├Professors Review┤Game Pros• Clean menu• Beautiful Graphics• Smooth Gameplay• VR Hardware Support• A lot of different controller supports• Decent selection of cars to choose from• Manual or Auto Transmission optional• Damage effects car performance (If enabled in race setup, you can make pit stops to fix damage)• Weather Effects car performance • Online Play (And private races for just you and friends)• In-depth car statistics while racing (Tire heat, Vibration, RPM..etc)• Text bubbles help you with complicated mechanics Game Cons• Non-friendly to players new to racing games• No full on multiclass races• The AI doesn't know when it's appropriate to let someone pass and ends up crashing into you• You get penalized due to fault of another player forcing you to go off track• AI ignores flagging system (Wont get all the same penalties you would)Relateable Games• Forza (Only in a few aspects) ConclusionProject Cars is a realistic racing game. While racing you must account for everything. This isn't another racing game where you can speed through corners to pass up other racers. One little mistake can cost you the race. So if you are looking for a racing experience that allows you to make many tests of trials and error to create your own personal setup. Then this is the game for you.(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) ",198,19,5,16,21,1,14

												I’ve played a lot of Project Cars, but I’ve had enough and I doubt I’ll go back to it.  It’s a nice looking game, at 4K resolution and with the video settings maxed out runs very smoothly on my system.  There is a wide selection of cars (if you buy the DLC) and plenty of tracks, but that all counts for nothing when so many other areas of this game are sorely lacking. The opponent AI in Project Cars is absolutely dreadful; It appears to be almost pathologically incapable of not colliding with you.  It has this apex or nothing mentality, which means if you actually try to race with it through a corner there is almost bound to be a collision. By way of comparison I’ve been playing Assetto Corsa again recently and the AI - while not perfect -  is so much better, you can actually race closely with it through corners without the constant likelihood of being rammed off the track. At any track with a tight first corner (Oschersleben, Nurburgring Sprint and GP for example) there is almost always a huge pile-up there on the first lap, where the race will sometimes grind to halt altogether, I think this is caused by the aforementioned apex fixation.  I’ve also seen AI cars actually collide with the end of the pit-wall on the way out of the pit-lane and spin, although this appears to have been patched by simply making the AI cars able to ghost through anything (including your car) when they exit the pits. So much for realism. The AI also cheats constantly. It’s able to cut corners and chicanes and go outside of the track limits with impunity.  Being able to set qualifying laps and gain race positions by doing things that you would be penalised for. I've seen some pathetic excuses on the Project Cars forum that the AI is just ""making mistakes"", yeah right.  Also in practice and most qualifying sessions you have to warm up your tyres on your out-lap, but the AI is just able to go at full racing speed straight out of the pits. Similarly, the AI is also able to traverse gravel traps and grass without losing any speed, where your car would quickly grind to a halt.  After the first two or three seasons the career mode becomes really dull. Apart from the one or two race series you unlock by completing career objectives, you have the same championships you had before at the same tracks in the same order with the same weather.  There’s this cringe worthy “Fan Chat” feature in career mode which is basically a feed of repetitive comments with your driver’s name copied and pasted into them with a wince inducing hashtag at the end.  Whenever a racing game tries to incorporate a faux “social media” element (GRID 2 for example), it just looks a bit sad and desperate and this is no exception.   Flag rules are also poorly implemented, blue flags in particular are a joke.  On a qualifying lap at Barcelona I pass a car as it’s coming out of the pits on the main straight, then on the way into the first corner I’m shown a blue flag because that same car is behind me albeit some distance away.  Just laughable, which pretty much sums this game up, a game I've uninstalled and consigned to the backwaters of my steam library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you do not have a wheel, and only have an xbox controller, I advise you to replicate the settings that I have below, in the controller settings in project cars. If you do not do this, you will hate the game. This game may not be as good as Assetto Corsa in terms of steering, handling, and over all life-like simulations; but it is better in terms of online matchmaking (with friends) and graphics. Overall, the game has decent simulation physics. I recommend this for anyone who simply wants to just ride along a track with a group of friends.

												Firstly I'd like to say that most of the negative reviews of this game are completely unjustified. I see reviews of people complaining that this is a bad game because it is too hard, or the car spins when you accelerate or something like that. This is an authentic simulator, not a casual race game. It has been intricately designed to feel like genuine driving, and the people who complain about this don't seem to realise that. Then you have people who complain about controls, and I'll say the same thing. This is a simulator. Its supposed to be realistic, and I don't know about you, but I've never driven a real car using a keyboard and mouse. It works best with a wheel, and as they are expensive, a controller is the next best option. You will find it hard with a keyboard. That isn't a problem with the game, thats a problem because you bought a game you couldn't play.This game is incredible. It is beautiful, diverse and customisable. Every aspect of a race, from weather to driving assists, can be changed. There is a huge range of vehicles and tracks, I have owned the game on Xbox for several months and I still haven't tried all the cars. You can practice on your own, or against AI, or you can move online, or go to campaign mode and start from the bottom as a karting driver or from the top as a formula one professional. The game is limitless in its possibilities. Many people don't realise, but the CARS in the name actaully stands for Community Assisted Racing Simulator. This means that simulator enthusiasts have helped build the game, contributing ideas, or testing it out. The game wasn't made by another standard company just trying to churn out a new game. It was intricately designed and it really shows.So please, please, please do not listen to the negative reviews. From what I can tell, 99% of negative reviews are people complaining about:A) the game is too hardB) the game doesn't run very wellC) they had a technical issueUltimately, these aren't problems with the game. A technical issue can be fixed with a siple Google search, or by talking to the devs. Performance issues are an issue with your PC, not the game. These people are not reviewing the game, they are reviewing there negative experiences - and it makes the game look bad. It is not.So if you are into racing games and prepared for a challenge, get Project Cars. If you're a casual gamer with a low spec pc, go get Need for Speed or something.			",40,1,1,4,2,0,9

 TL;DR  Game is great, but there are  better options to choose from considering the ammount you pay for Project Cars with its DLC's.  My Thoughts on Project Cars: First of all, there was a lot of hype for Project Cars the weeks before its release. Initially, the game seemed fun to me, especially with its one-of-a-kind Career Mode - only to be brought with the disappointment that you could start wherever you want in your career, therefore losing the motive in grinding your way from Go-Karts to Formula A. Although there are a lot of downvotes to the game there are a lot of good sides to the game. Pros:  The In-Game Menu is one of the best I've seen in quite a while.  Graphics are absolutely facinating.  Gameplay is fairly smooth, rarely come across visual / physical bugs.  Controller support is one of the best, also comes with VR Hardware support too.  A lot of Online Lobbies to choose from, if not, create a private lobby for you and your friends.  In-game car tuning has a lot of depth, a lot of things to tune, giving you an upper-hand above those who don't.Mehs:   Car statistics, usual car stats a game would bring you.  Mechanic is a meh, when it comes to long races, sometimes the mechanic would get on my nerve.  Physics are alright, usually a bugs here and there but it doesn't affect the gameplay too badly.Cons:  The In-game AI is generally a let-down.   AI doesn't really let you pass on blue flags, sometimes won't even aknowledge your existence on the race track, ramming you left and right.  Penalty system is also disappointing  Sometimes you will get penalized for things you didn't even do, such as corner cutting.  Penalty system also doesn't affect the AI, giving them the upperhand in races  Car selection doesn't include one of the biggest brands and icons (as of Jan 4, 2016) Ferrari, Nissan  SAFETY CAR WHERE YOU AT?? YELLOW FLAG WHERE YOU AT?? Games I Would Suggest or Relate to   Assetto Corsa Conclusion  Project Cars is a fairly fun and realistic racing game, and has a small mix of Arcade and Simulation (may not be the best idea). If you're looking for a more realistic game, look for iRacing. If you're looking for an arcade-y style game, I would personally suggest Need for Speed. Overall Project Cars was an initial disappointment to me but the deeper you look into what the game has to offer to you, the funner it gets. (If you found the review helpful, giving it a thumbs up would be nice!)  If you're looking for more Steam Friends? Look no more - feel free to add me!  ",69,3,14,7,11,1,6

												I had a very popular positive review up for this game until now. Over the past year my opinion has changed.I play with a racing wheel and play a lot of racing games and sims (all Codemasters games, iRacing, rFactor 2, RaceRoom,...).I'll keep it short:The good- It looks great and runs pretty well on Nvidia graphics cards- With DLC there is a good amount of content available and a nice selection of tracks & cars.- Some cars sound fantastic, others rather mediocre- A lot of settings are available- Full day/night cycle and weather (imo the best thing about this game)- No tuning and almost no street cars, this game is about racing race cars on a race track.- Solid career mode with a good amount of diversity.- You can do 24h multi class racing and even switch drivers like in real life so you don't have to drive the 24h completely on your own.The bad- The AI is garbage and inconsistent. Sometimes they are slow, sometimes they are overly aggressive BUT they ALWAYS CHEAT. Seriously, the AI is cheating and that just kills off any enjoyment I had with this game. They drive like maniacs in the rain and somehow have more grip than I ever had on soft tyres on a sunny day. Furthermore they can brake much later and never lock up. On some parts of the track they have problems with overtaking, so either they ram you off the track or crash into another AI car. Terrible.- The physics are mediocre but that's no surprise and not really a bad thing in my eyes. What's terrible is the force feedback. This has to be some Need For Speed level of force feedback because you can't feel anything on the default settings. You don't know what the car is doing half of the time. If you want to play this game with a wheel then I recommend to take a day off of work to find some force feedback settings that work for you.- Multiplayer is either dead or a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. Everyone crashes and drives like an idiot. Don't buy this game for online racing if you are looking for some clean and exciting fights. Either join a league or take a look at iRacing.- No triple monitor support. Game looks terrible on three screens.- Career had a ""coming soon"" section for almost a year until they finally removed it with the last patch.- A lot of features were cut and will make it into Project Cars 2.- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage model- No safety car, no formation lap, no yellow flags- The track stays the same during the whole race. In real life the track builds up more grip on the racing line, which makes it harder to overtake off the racing line. That's very interesting in endurance races (2h-24h races) but in Project Cars the track stays the same, no matter how many laps you do.- You can't select specific opponents in a race. You can either select ""Identical"" (same car as you), ""Same class"" (for example GT3 class if you use a GT3 car) or ""Multi class"" (a random selection of all cars in the game). Not sure who thought this was a good idea but you can't make your own WEC race for example, because the game will mix in some random garbage vehicles that don't even fit in the 24h of le mans. - The game had hundreds of bugs and missing features on launch and it took them 10+ patches to make the game somewhat decent.Verdict:Graphics powerhouse with a nice selection of tracks and cars. But when it comes to racing it is one of the worst racing games you can get, made by a company that over promises and under delivers.			",149,29,23,21,44,2,17

												It's hard to quantify what's wrong with this game in exact, concise words. Yes, on paper, everything this game includes, especially in GOTY form, sounds like an absolutely excellent package, but it's a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" situation, and even then, it's only decent at those trades at best.Positives first. It is very visually striking, and that absurd insistence that so many racing games have nowadays of making the cars impossibly, constantly shiny is absent in actual gameplay. The track list is impressive, and the original / un-licensed courses are excitingly original or amusingly just ever-so-slightly off. The Azure Coast and California Highway point-to-point races are extremely gorgeous, with the latter's bridge giving me vibes of Daytona USA. Azure Circuit and Sakitto fill in for Monaco and Suzuka, and I'm still loving that the Japanese circuit is literally just named Circuit but with a Japanese accent. All the courses included just feel right (except for Laguna Seca somehow), and it's a pretty excellent globetrotting collection.The car list, at least with DLC, is a bit scattered, but you'll generally find something exciting to enjoy even if you don't recognize the name right away. I found the Superkarts to be a welcome surprise that I heavily underestimated at first, the LMP vehicles impressively powerful and forcing me to change my racing line as I considered the automatic KERS usage, and the Caper Monterrey fit my need for classic American stock cars quite well (at least partially).The career mode is a simple calendar-and-event format akin to Dirt to Daytona, and it works pretty well aside from the blatantly bugged/repetitive emails and fan praise you receive. My number one praise for it is something that racing games in general need to learn how to do: DLC courses and cars actually are included, with their own events unlocked on the calendar as you progress if you have them. They aren't just awkwardly shunted to a free play portion of the game. They're part of the core experience. That's a massive plus.However, after a while, the career mode just isn't enjoyable. That's not so much a fault of repetitive events, or my unnecessary compulsion to play every single event in order when I could just come back to them later. The problem is the AI.The AI is a massive failure.So, racing in go-karts, yeah, I can see a little bit of bumping and slamming. It's go-karts! I'm being aggressive, too. Stock cars, yeah, they'll charge a bit hard in the turn, so of course the drivers would be thrown off. GT endurance racers smashing each other off the track? Well, that's a little silly!Starting an F1 (renamed Formula A in-game) race and immediately getting plowed into by the driver behind me, who digs into my wheelwell and chucks me into a ditch before the entire rest of the field dogpiles them and brings the race to an immediate screeching halt with the screams of tires and smashing of car bodies, showering the track in debris and caking the road in crushed cars? Bad. Very bad. It ended up very, very consistently like this regardless of difficulty adjustment. It cannot (noticably) tell the difference between different vehicles in terms of racing lines and aggression.Now, you might just be thinking, ""well, maybe you just suck at this"". Fair enough. I don't play sims often. I got stuck in rFactor immediately because I didn't think to shift the car into neutral to leave the pit lane. But I'm getting better at that. This? This is not a sim. It's not a simcade racer, either, not entirely. It's trying to be both, and again, it's aggressively mediocre in many regards because of that. It very much enjoys spinning the player and AI alike out, and recovery is nigh-impossible. A massive array of tuning options and an insistence on actual reasonable racing lines bodes well for it being a fine sim, but the actual physics and AI behavior just don't line up with that, reverting to cartoony slides and demolition derbies in short order.And full disclosure? I'm particularly furious that this game was supposed to have an oval racing mode, hence the stock cars even being included, but they gave up on it, allegedly after issues with the AI being incapable of navigating the ovals in a satisfactory manner. The AI is incapable of navigating anything, though. As such, the US Car Pack stands out as a purposeless shell, including IndyCar and NASCAR vehicles for tracks that never came to fruition, and that's after they already licensed, mapped, and rendered Indianapolis Motor Speedway! They just threw it out and said they'd try again in the sequel.In any case, yes, there are brief moments of fun here, and simply ogling the cars is probably money's worth in itself. I don't entirely regret my purchase. But it's such a weak roster for each discipline it represents that this is simply a stopgap appetizer before you go and buy whatever game includes the disciplines you like most. It tries to be everything and, as such, stretches itself extremely thin, extremely quickly. It's a wide array of shallow kiddy pools rather than one immersive but limited dunk tank.But hey, it's pretty, right?			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												Beautiful, polished, great driving physics and a dynamic envrionment make this racing game very appealing at first glance. However after spending some time with this game I have been dissapointed with the immersion this game offers as there are many features missing that a racing simulator should have. 1. There is no flag system or safety car. This gripe may seem nit picky but it does take away from the simulator feel of a race day when there are no flags to warn drivers that there may be a hazard ahead. Flags and safety cars are a huge feature in modern racing, often changing the outcome of a race and entire strategies devoted to pitting around safety car deployment. This leads into the second gripe, there are no AI caused accidents for there to be a safety car or flag system in the first place. 2. AI too flawless. The AI has no character in this game, they drive around almost on rails only to deviate in the most extreme cases occasionally onto the grass but then make a full recovery and lose 1 second on their lap time due to a small mistake. They are aware of the player, but too often they will completely give way to the player as if repelled by magnets. The biggest problem with the dull AI is that there are no retirements no matter how long the race is. 100 Lap races will 100% of the time have a full field finish, no mechanical faults, no accidents, no spins, even with full damage turned on. The AI does not make a mistake that leads to any game changing events. This makes for a very dull, boring race experience.  3. The career mode only offers a single full season of driving (17 races in a season) in one mode, the F1 equivalent Formula A mode. If you want to drive touring cars or karts or any other league the season is made up of only 5 or so races. It is kind of like the progress of simcade racing games like GT and Forza, just without the upgrades and car modifying and street circuits. 4. Every car is as solid as a tank. The damage modelling in this game reminds me of an old Need for Speed where you were able to drive at 300kmh and crash into any solid object and just bounce off. Damage is a huge component of racing, often slight damage will lead to changing a racing strategy and adds a huge element of risk/reward to a race. Damage is what keeps a race on the edge, gives a race character. Drivers will avoid taking huge risks because damage is a deterrent, and damage affects performance. Not in this game though, damage for the most part does nothing. You can use other cars as a brake with little consequence. Crash into a wall head on at 200kmh, and you will suffer slight suspension problems and get a couple of cosmetic scratches and a bent hood. That kind of a crash in reality would end with a DNF and debris everywhere. Since there is no deterrent to crashing in this game, the only solid tactic for racing is an aggressive push all the other cars off the road style. The surface of the game is really spectacular, it will easily draw you in and look amazing, but don't be fooled. This is not what I would expect from a racing simulation, it sits halfway between a Forza/Gran Tourismo and a racing sim, but does neither very well. It is not an arcade game where you can customise your cars and earn a sense of progression with unlocking newer nicer vehicles and new modifications. It is not a simulator where you can immerse yourself into the reality of a race day. Project Cars lacks any character or vision for what it is, and in attempting to appeal to a very broad audience it has alienated the fans of both arcade and simulator fans alike by providing neither. If you just want a game where you have the opportunity to drive around very pretty circuits with traffic and time trials then this game might be sufficient. It feels great looks great and sounds great. But it really lacks in the gameplay department so if you want a game that simulates racing, then I recommend you look elsewhere.  ",45,8,10,10,28,0,20

												I've put a lot of time into Project CARS, and frankly, I'm fed up.  So I'm going to give a long and thorough review of it.TL/DR Version:  Broken promises, missing game features, and crippling bugs should keep you away.  Ultimately, this entire things feels like a giant paid BETA for Project Cars 2.  I.E. You are paying full retail for the privilege of beta testing for the sequal.Pro's:PCars is relatively cheap.  $50 retail + $50 DLC sounds like a lot, but compared to other sim racing games, it isn't.  Fully investing in ""iRacing"" could easily cost you $500+ ($10-$15 per car / track, EACH), not to mention the $15 per month subscription.Amazing GT3 selection.Best graphics of any racing sim, by far.  Best weather system of any racing sim, by far.No cars are gated at all.  First race, want to try an F1 Car?  Go for it!  Even people without DLC can join a DLC room (but they can't host it, or play it in SP).Clever and fun Single Player campaign.  You can jump in anywhere from GoKarts and advance all the way to LMP1, and anything in between, all the while progressing through it from where you started.  I.E. Start at Formula Gulf (not go-karts) and still advance through to LMP1.Physics system is leagues better than from release, but still not perfect or finished yet.  Tire physics are trash.Relatively good VR / headtracker support.  (They just broke Headtracker support, though.)Con's (in no particular order):No Oval Racing, despite being promised and advertised.Replay system is utterly broken.  Some cars don't show up at all.  Some don't ever start off the line.  Some have switched models and skins.  And the control system was designed by a 2 year old.  Don't even bother to save a replay.Spectator system is trash.  What good is a racing game if you can't give people a good way to watch the action?Dedicated Server is missing half the features it needs to be viable, including race steward powers..Multiplayer sessions are missing half the features IT needs (separately from ded. servers) to be viable in the long run.Options available in Single Player Campaign are not available for custom and multiplayer races.No full course cautions option.There is a skill / safety rating system built into every driver's profile, but we can't see other people's rating.  Absolutely moronic.There is a collision measuring and fault system built into Project Cars, but it isn't used for anything.  For example, after 3 dive bombs it could kick out the bad driver, but doesn't.Some of the maps are broken and unplayable in Multiplayer.  Including maps that have been in the game since day 1.There is an entire Map Pack DLC that is basically unusable in Multiplayer because they don't have pit lanes.Pit stop system is unintuitive, hard to use, and broken / bugged.  Sometimes the system doesn't give you tires when you ask.  And Visa Versa.  You are also limited to a TOTAL number of pit stop strategies over all of the cars available.  Furthermore, pits give you gas, then tires, with no option to select otherwise (like simultaneous) or select class based setup.Almost a year after release, there is only the 1 option for Race Modes:  The standard race.  There are no other modes, even as gimicks.  You can guess that people are getting tired of it.There are still some ""tuning"" tricks (bugs) that make cars go faster than they should.There is no way to save a tuning file, import one, or export it.  Everything has to be transcribed manually from in game to out, and back.No viable option for a custom skins.All multiplayer games go through steam.  Steam goes down, your race room dies, even in the middle of a race.  I.E. Steam isn't just a match making service, it is a server hub for the race and all of PCars.Qualifying results are wiped if someone is DCed.  They are not attached to the Steam ID like they should be.No ""Tow back to pits"" option if you get damaged.  So basically you have to try to drive back, and endanger everyone else on the way.No ability to reconnect to a server if you get DCed mid race.There is a ""Time-out"" function to prevent people from connecting late in a session (practice, qual...).  I can't tell you the number of times I've seen someone bust their♥♥♥♥♥to practice for hours and get entirely locked out of a race because the game won't let them connect when there is 2:20 left, rather than 2:40.  Absolutely moronic.There is the option to host a race that is 24 hours long, but you are not able to switch drivers.  Why freaking bother?Some of the weather options are broken and don't work.The in game spotter system is absolutely crap.  He doesn't spot for you, nor does he actually say anything useful or worthwhile.  (Though someone has made a 3rd party spotter APP that is amazing.)Hard enforced ""Cut Track Penalties"" which force you to slow down immediately (often in front of other cars who can't avoid it fast enough).No real mod support, specifically Steam Workshop use.  This game could have lived for years, if it had.Multiplayer Rooms are dying, apparently 10 months of crippling bugs and missing vital functions is too much for some people.  Most of the time 50% of a room leaves when it's clear that they won't win (see built in skill / safety system bulletin).VAC doesn't seem to ban cheaters (not implying that there are any at all), all it does is ban people who rejoin too many times, or gives off a false positive.  (There is no way for a regular server to turn it off, too.)The lobby chat system is broken.  You can't type anything in or see anything others in the lobby chat have typed.  You must be driving to type and see.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: There are invisible walls in the middle of the track.  Imagine driving down the middle of the road, and your car smashes into something invisible.  Guess what happens to a car at 180 MPH when it comes to a sudden stop.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG: Cut tracks are now broken.  They are applied inconsistently, and sometimes get stuck.  Since you are hard forced into slowing down, the cut-track penalty getting stuck kills you.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Cars spawn in to the starting grid sidewise, upside down, backwards...  I.E. The game doesn't work sometimes when the race starts!OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Sometimes when the race is over, the final results splash screen doesn't show up.  I.E. The entire room breaks, and you can't see what happened in the race.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Rolling starts don't work.  AT ALL.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED:  Sometimes the game locks up on loading.NEW GAMEBREAKING BUG:  Tire system is broken.  Soft tires last as long as mediums or hards.  There is little to no real tire degradation.  There is very little tire strategy due to them being broken.OLD GAMEBREAKING BUG NOT YET LISTED: Severe controller (wheel) issues.  Sometimes the steering ratio is borked when you start up, and requires a game restart.  Some people get FFB bugs.  Some people need to recalibrate every single time they start up the game.  Horrible controller support for a full retail game.So to sum up, Project Cars 1 is missing a LOT of basic, necessary functions a racing game needs to be just a normal racing game.  Maybe Project Cars 2 will fix it, but after fully investing in PCars1 and getting stiffed, I'll not be buying PCars2.Edit:  After seeing the utter incompetence of WMD in not fixing their game, I've decided to list the remaining gamebreaking bugs I hadn't yet listed.

												update 2016: This is a glimpse of the game you are about to buy (i hope not)


YouTube™ Video:

You can find many more on youtube.And this image below is the remarkable post by Ian Bell, head studio of Slighty Mad Studios (that he erased it  because he was getting too much love for it): http://i.imgur.com/J7wCj0X.pngupdate as of december 2015: here is a more in-depth review of this ""updated"" game, because mine is like Pcars in a nutshell http://steamcommunity.com/id/kacperflak/recommended/234630/Also... patch v6.0? They need to learn to count. More like v1.0.0.6 with a lot of paid DLC released while they (don't) fix the game. My old review stands still below.1-It's not finished to the point where is playable due to the many bugs. It's a beta and they released either way when it should be delayed a bit more2-Ian Bell is a d1ckhead when it comes to deal with criticism about his work and customers that don't agree with him3-They are not commited to fix the issues like they were while in closed beta where we had almost a new build with fixes and improvements per day4-They are already announcing Project Cars 2 without even fixing the first iteration of the franchise without any hesitation5-They expect crowd funding the second game like the first one, so they can raise another truckload of money, do a lot of PR bull♥♥♥♥ marketing again to sell it, and then run off the scene without even trying to finish the product, like they are doing with this one. REALLY? I mean... WTF! Good luck getting support with that. Maybe your closed community of proud crowdfounder fools will do. It's a shame, nonetheless.			",425,130,42,45,40,5,45

Ladies and Gentlemen start your engines and prepare yourself for an experience which will redefine your perceptions on what a racing game is and provide hundreds of hours of entertainment.TLDR: If you enjoy racing games you should definitely buy this game and if you do not normally play racing games you should still seriously consider buying it.Project CARS has always been about developing the best racing game possible, within the budget and timeframe that Slightly Mad Studios (SMS) set for themselves. As is the norm within the gaming industry and a lot of big projects there have been a few delays, but the developers have followed through with their vision of the game and did not rush it out for a quick buck. The game was funded through their own World of Mass Development (WMD) crowd funding system, where the each member of the community could purchase a tool pack to gain access to the game and the rewards scaled with each tool pack level, up until the required funding was reached (similar to Kickstarter, but a portion of the profits will be paid back to the tool pack holders). This game is not a one off, SMS want this to become a new racing franchise which pushes the envelope on what is possible in the racing genre and video games in general [Note: There will not be annual releases of the same game and they will not immediately drop support of the latest game, each game will improve on the previous one and be supported after release].The ""CARS"" part of the name stands for ""Community Assisted Racing Simulator"" and the original backers of the game (about 80,000 in total) have spent the past three and a half years providing feedback, suggestions and bug reports which have led us to this point. SMS also received the assistance of several professional race drivers (e.g. Ben ""The Stig"" Collins, Oliver ""Oli"" Web and Nicholas Hamilton, brother of Lewis Hamilton) to further make the game as authentic and close to real life as possible. There were also other drivers which got involved in the project in an unofficial capacity and used it to help prepare themselves for races (e.g. René Rast).Project CARS is focused on racing and whilst some people will complain about the lack of cars, when compared to other racing games, it does have one the largest number of tracks in recent history and that is much more important in my opinion. The other complaint is that certain cars and manufacturers are missing, but the reality is that some licenses are exclusive to certain companies (e.g. Porche, but Ruf is included) and others are just too expensive for the budget, cannot be justified or do not fit in the game (e.g. Ferrari and Lamborghini) . There are also no road cars, with a few exceptions which have the racing trim and setup, because this is a racing game and those kinds of cars are not seen in professional motorsport events or series. The focus of the game is spend time driving each car and learning the intricacies on how to eke out that extra couple of hundredths of a second from a lap or sector. This is not a game where you go around grinding for cash or points to unlock new cars which you will quickly move on from when you unlock the next one. Every car is unlocked from the get go, each one has been selected to fit into the featured racing series, modelled to match the real life counterpart and the performance that you see in game is as close to the real thing as possible.The campaign allows you to work your way up from the bottom (karts) and reach the pinnacle of motorsport racing (F1 or LMP), but there is also nothing stopping you jumping in at any of the levels because you get full control over your racing career and each play through can be different. There is also the Driver Network and multiplayer portions of the game, which allow you to compete against others and get involved in the community events.It would be a lie if I said that everything is perfect, there are a few bugs (not game breaking) and features which did not make it into the game for launch, but those should be added later on and the bugs will be squashed. The most important thing is that SMS have set the bar very high and this is a great thing for every fan of racing games, because the competition are going to have to work hard to match this.There are ultra settings and the game is 12K capable, supports three monitors and supports VR headsets, so do not be unreasonable and expect to be able to max everything out on current hardware and not notice a significant drop in the frame rate. Even on lower settings the game looks great and you should take the time to find your optimal setup for the best performance.I am very thankful for SMS to allow myself and the rest of the WMD community to join them on this journey and I plan on participating in further projects in the future, but for now I will see you on the race track and possibly in future WMD projects.Head over to the official website for more information on the game, including the tracks and cars.[www.projectcarsgame.com]DISCLAIMER: As one of the WMD community funders of the game it should be no surprise that I have recommended this game and I will receive a very small portion of the profit from sales, so do not just take my word for it, you should have a look at all of the other positive reviews that the game is receiving. I cannot claim that I am not biased towards loving Project CARS, but I would also not be praising it if I truly did not believe in it. ",620,181,9,69,59,8,81

												Right now I can't recommend this game.GeneralLacks optimization and polishing (There's too many bugs for a full release game, including sound issues, illusory walls, crashes, etc..) Feels rushed. Like this bug I experienced a few hours ago, I was on first place but suddenly game says that ""I have to let the guy on second place pass me because blue flag"", first thing that crossed my mind was ""must be a bug"" but I turned on the HUD and oh my, somehow the game said that I didn't complete a single lap when I did nothing wrong from the very beginning.Dark souls easter egg? I doubt it:

PhysicsPhysics are a joke, I know is some kind of hybrid between arcade and sim, but it is an awful mix imo. Sometimes at the same turn you are on rails, others you are on ice for no reason whatsoever. And they tried to sell this game saying that literally ""Has the most advanced tires physics ever seen on a game""? I guess they have never played AC or iRacing before such overstatement.AIAI is made of psychos who have no issues crashing their cars with yours, but guess what, NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM while your car is a wreck and all you can do is retire or restart the race. Another one of its tricks is cut through grass to overtake you or never have the need of warm up their tires. I don't like passive AI in racing games at all but this, is too much. Here's a couple examples:

PC AI in a nutshell. 
A Screenshot of Project CARS
By: Space_Owl™




And this is what happens when AI gets crazy:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442804380 CareerCareer mode can get boring pretty fast, since there's no feeling of progression. You start with everything unlocked, you can even drive LMP1, the top class in this game, from the very first minute so it is up to the player to choose what to do, but imo it gets boring once you have to deal with the same issues mentioned before (Specially AI) over and over.GraphicsGraphics are great, because thats what this game is all about. Graphics, graphics and graphics although the game is poorly optimized so don't expect to run everything on ultra unless you have a beast. Although the game doesn't look as good as screenshots pre-release made us believe, not just that, but the cars are the only thing that looks great. Backgrounds look like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and visual damage is utterly poor. Btw, AMD users stay away from this game, check the forums for more info. SoundGood, but again there's some issues like loosing engine sound or hear your engine working after you blow it up.MPServers are a danger zone, again full of crazy people with only one task, troll as hard as they can. Plus there's some severe lag issues.Conclusion Many praise this game, but I won't, not until they fix it and release a game worth full price. So others can praise its graphics all they want, but graphics aren't everything in a game. And so far imo this game is Shift 2.5. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mix between arcade and ""simulation"". Seriously, stop this bs. Make an arcadish game (Like GT or Forza) or a sim (Like iRacing, AC, Rfactor, etc...) but not an awful mix like this one.Edit: AGAIN, If you own an AMD Vcard, forget about this game. Just pay a visit to the forums and you will find out what I mean.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like the core game and enjoy it however, while the main selling point of this game is the graphics they are so poorly optomized for AMD rigs that I do not feel I can recommend this game to anyone running AMD hardware. I feel the after paying $50 for the game discovering it is so poorly made is a disapointment. If this game is 75% off or they fix the poor optomization then I would recomend buying it.Update:After having tried the game on windows 10 it works much better so if you have windows 10 then ignore the stuff about poor optimization.

												Have to say I'm pretty disappointed in this game, as it currently stands. I do not feel that it lives up to the hype.First off, the graphics are hardly as great as all the review sites claim. In some ways, they are impressive. The lighting is the standout, once you get past the cliche stuff like post-processed lens flare. The car models are impressive too. Textures and landscape are passable. But, what kills the look of this game for me are two things: First, the terrible, terrible shadows. These look like what you'd expect from the 16-bit era. They are rendered in what looks like horribly low resolution and flicker like crazy. almost pixelating the track wherever they are cast. Even on 'ultra' setting. Just terrible. And SMAA antiliasing seems to make the shadows worse. Speaking of which -- then there's the aliasing. Sure, the game offers a whole bunch of anti-aliasing options. But none of them work very well. Even with MSAA 4x and SMAA at 'ultra', there are brutal jaggies everywhere. The only way I could reign this in was by cranking Nvidia DSR with smoothness filter at 50% and FXAA at 'high'. That would normally result in a blurry mess in most games, but this game is so over sharpened and aliased out of the box that you need to do this to get anything like a decent look. Overall, I don't get the big fuss over this game in the graphical department. It looks decent but nothing special in my opinion. I've run it maxed out in 1440p and on triple 1080p screens, downsampled from 4k, you name it... nothing has impressed me very much. (By contrast: another recent racing game, Dirt Rally, currently in early access, looks to my eye WAY, WAY, better. That game has excellent anti-aliasing, excellent shadows and ambient occlusion, and at least as nice textures and models. No comparison, in my view.)Speaking of triple screens, the game currently has no independent rendering, so you have to set a high FOV and keep your monitors in a straight line. That alone should be a strong signal this is not a very serious racing game, despite whatever the marketing fluf would claim.Then there's the racing. The dealbreaker for me here is that the AI in this game is infuriating. If you play at the easier difficulty levels, it's a cakewalk to leave them in the dust. But as soon as you crank up the difficulty, not only do they get faster (which is good) but they get excessively aggressive -- so the game becomes a demolition derby.  Earlier today I tried TWENTY TIMES to get through the first corner in an open wheeled race. I ended up rage quitting. The AI cars ram into you and each other like suicidal morons, so you can't get started without getting rammed and spun out, very likely suffering 'suspension damage' that renders your car undrivable. I tried a bunch of different race setups and the result is nearly always the same. Set the difficulty at 80% or higher, and most of the AI cars will be missing bodywork 10 seconds into the race, and the only way to avoid their mayhem is to hang back behind them all. This is so stupidly unrealistic and game-breaking, it'd be hilarious if I hadn't dropped a good chunk of cash on this.So, overall, we have decent but way overhyped graphics and racing crippled by terrible AI. My recommendation is to pass over this game, at least for now. I bought into the hype train on this one, don't make the same mistake.EDIT AS OF PATCH 2.0: This latest patch seems to have achieved some improvement to AI aggression. I no longer experience as consistently infuriating a melee off the line and into the first corner with high difficulty levels. However, that isn't to say the AI cars won't still ram you from behind, sideswipe you while cornering, etc. They still seem to drive like they're blind, drunk and senile pretty frequently. And it's frustrating when this happens halfway through the race, when some AI driver comes out of the pits and decides to ram you. This may actually be even more annoying than the demolition derby off the starting line. Also, the main AI avoidance mechanism now seems to be driving off into the grass and the gravel traps. Which is a bit comical because they seem to magically drive at full speed over these surfaces and rejoin the asphalt at race pace. I often look in my rearview and see AI cars driving at full clip all over the grass as they struggle to avoid each other. By contrast, you will slow to a crawl and struggle to control your car if you hit the gravel. I've also noticed the AI drivers cutting corners, while you will get a 'warning from the race director' if you do so. These warnings, by the way, seem overly sensitive with this new patch. This adds to the frustration when an AI car sideswipes you, forcing you to put a wheel on the grass, and the game announces you've 'cut the corner' and will be penalized.I've also experienced some frustrating new bugs and crashes. A standout was when I had run a great qualifying lap and wanted to skip to the beginning of the race. I was treated instead to an infinite loading screen. I had to end task, lose my time, and start again. Checking the forums I saw numerous others are having the same problem.I still have mixed feelings about the graphics. I guess if you have a high tolerance for aliasing and other temporal artifacts (I've noticed lately that the game also seems to have texture fighting issues, with distant objects flashing), and enjoy post-processed lighting effects, this will impress. But that is not my preference, and it is still my opinion that this game's graphics are overhyped. Overall, there is some improvement evident with Patch 2.0, but not enough to edge this out of the thumbs-down zone for me. The frustration is still overwhelming the fun. The game still feels far from a polished product. Maybe someday this will be a great game, but it isn't yet.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update:The game is now playable with gamepad. Quite a few people were interested in this aspect so will put this update up top.The rest of the game has improved but is still a mixed bag. To be blunt the early access DiRT Rally is a more consistent and polished product than the current version of pCARS.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Well here we are finally project cars is erm finished? Complete? Er let’s just say its ‘released’!Considering where the build was years ago I had hoped, dreamed, and even reasonably expected more. Somehow I think by trying to do absolutely everything pCARS has it all but none of it is really 100% sadly.Don’t get me wrong pCARS is great. If I could, this review wouldn’t be a thumbs up or down but a wavering in-between. There just really needs to be a critique of pCARS other than the overflowing WMD love fest currently on steam. Take with a grain of salt the reviews of those personally involved with the development of this game. We all stand to possibly gain financially from its success to boot. Although the details are very very murky. Perhaps my negative review will mean my financial reward is lost? We’ll see :) Would you trust the cast of a movie to honestly review a movie on release? Of course not… what about the crew? Well if they all have royalty options and are hardcore fans dedicated and have been working for free the past few years? Up to you. I see pCARS as the first racing sim to have a hardcore fan base with plenty of ‘fanboys’ preloaded before release!If you have 20 minutes spare this video captures my point exactly:

			I'm going to link an article here below. But first, let me just say this - I don't particularly care for the person behind the site, I don't care for the way he does things, the way it occasionally...		

PROS:-VarietyHeaps of cars for all tastes! Open wheelers, road cars and everything else!Lots of tracks and configurations.What a variety of conditions. Want to run a 24 hour race around Bathurst with everything from thunderstorms to clear sky’s go for it!-VisualsAmazing screen shots. You’ve seen them!The car models are stunning.Great cockpits with all moving parts (via g-forces too) bells and whistles.-Large grids. Depending on the track run 40 cars. (this has been unstable for me in the past)-Built by the community.Despite my problems with the rabid variety of fan boy any developer that listens and reacts is doing good in my book.CONS:-VarietyBy giving you everything and the kitchen sink (thank god rallying was dropped!!) SMS have bitten off more than they could chew in my opinion. Few cars or tracks feel 100% polished at this stage.Pushing the limits of number of AI and conditions still results in occasional crashes for me.-VisualsThey don’t live up to the screen shots!At the beginning of development my PC was woefully under spec. I could tour around in some builds hot lapping by myself waiting for the day I got a beast and it would look like the screen shots.I got my i7 with SSD and 16gig of ram gtx 970 and I can get over 100FPS with a full field in the rain but it doesn’t look at all like the screen shots out there. Some talented community members have worked magic with the photo mode and post processing on videos.-Starts in background.The game has never ever, on 2 different PC’s I’ve owned, started as the foreground window. It starts goes into the task bar and there I can click or alt-tab all I want, it stays until I kill the process… The only way I can play is from the quick launch right clicking steam. If it’s been a while since playing I have to start it then kill it and quick launch. This was raised and talked about forever on WMD, how on earth is it still not fixed? Don’t have any trouble with any other game at all!-Terrible gamepad support.Yes I can hear them now why use a gamepad it’s a SIM etc. Short answer I have too. My back is stuffed. I have all the gear I want it’s no good if I can’t use it. Anyway I have learnt to get around in other SIMS with my Xbox one PC controller. It’s not easy but I get around in iRacing, rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, Race Room Racing Experience and many other sims with the gamepad. Race Room Racing Experience in my experience setting the bar for how a sim should support gamepad. I really can’t understand it I used to enjoy NFS shift as an in-between serious racing game for some fun. It had terrible wheel support with massive dead zones and was only really playable with the gamepad. So now the same developers have gone and created a game that is completely unplayable with the gamepad but now works great with the wheel? Why why why?-AIThe AI has improved a lot in the final build. But then it had too! In this final build the AI displays less of its psychotic death wish driving style, actually respecting the track boundaries and your car for the most. However it is not possible to run a race without finding corner tyres and witches hats strewn everywhere after the first few laps. Being on a qualifying lap then slamming into a corner tire thrown onto the racing line and losing your lap time because of contact brings the kind of joy known only previously by the gran turismo special mission races. Don’t touch anything or you fail. AI rams you… oh joy! Why do all modern sims have such poor over aggressive AI? rFactor 2 is the only modern sim that will give you anything like the sort of behaviour you would see at a professional race weekend as opposed to the open multiplayer full of kids experience todays AI seems to replicate!-PhysicsWMD members get excited by the SETA tire model. It dynamically simulates aspects of the tire model that other sims use static graphs and data to simulate. In theory tires should heat up, cool down, wear out, flex and a whole lot of subtle things more realistically. In practice I don’t think it’s finished yet. A tire model is a hell of a thing to develop. Clever people have been at it for decades building upon previous work done. Is this dynamic model a step toward the future. Yes. Does it right now give you the best, most consistently matching real life data model out there today. Nope. In a word the physics feel 'floaty'...And this pretty much sums up pCARS right now. The potential is huge. Bigger than anything before. But there simply wasn’t enough time to finish every part of the game to the level it deserves. I would have gladly had less cars, less track, less dynamic models to have GT cars with the weather all at a 100% finished level polished like all hell, than a bit of everything that doesn’t quite feel right a lot of the time. I would say if your using a gamepad wait, if you’re not really into your racing sims wait. If you have a wheel and enjoy a wide variety of different racing sims that all have different pros and cons then no doubt this purchase is a no brainer! Just don’t expect the holy grail of sims that some claim it to be and you won’t be disappointed. I’m hoping they finish this off it really could be brilliant. But having heard pCARS 2 already mentioned I’m not sure this sim will ever get the polish it needs.			",119,11,24,5,19,0,4

best AI ever 
A Screenshot of Project CARS
By: jason moyer




Pros:- quantity of content- physics for most of the race cars- decent track modelling for being non-laserscannedCons:- physics for most of the street cars- strange design decisions in regards to the AI aggressiveness and career skill- odd bugs- the WMD communityI've put enough hours into this to feel I've justified my purchase, but I leave the game feeling like I've accomplished little of what I had hoped to get out of it.  Going into PCars, I was hoping for a light sim with drivable if not phenomenal physics and track modelling, tons of qualilty content, a solid career mode, and top-notch artificial intelligence.The physics for most of the race cars actually managed to exceed my expectations.  The Prototypes, GT Cars, and modern Open Wheelers in particular are generally fun to drive and behave more or less in the manner you would expect.  Most of the street cars, on the other hand, would be unsellable if they handled as poorly as they do in this sim.    There are also the odd gMotor-like physics issues with regards to how the cars interact with the track surface, as occasionally what should be minor undulations will actually cause tires to lose contact with the track entirely, as if the suspension isn't doing its job properly.  Additionally, some cars have very little grip when the tires are outside of their optimal temperature range, where in reality you would expect slightly less grip but for the tires to otherwise maintain their usual slip characteristics.The tracks are also surprisingly well modelled considering that, AFAIK, laser-scanning was not used to create them.  Having driven many of these tracks in iRacing and Assetto Corsa, I was impressed with how close they are represented here.  With that said, elevation and camber changes seem to have gotten the worst of it, but overall the tracks are functional and don't take me out of the experience.The career mode is almost insultingly barebones.  I am absolutely in love with the idea of basing it on a real motorsports career, where you can choose a starting level and work your way up and down the disciplines appropriately.  What I'm not in love with is the hightly repetitive nature of the social media aspects, where the same handful of headlines, emails and fake twitter posts are repeated based on your performance in the most recent race.What I'm also not in love with, in regards to the career, is how the AI difficulty is automatically scaled downwards based on which tier you are racing in.  I understand that they're trying to simulate the level of talent increasing as you progress higher through your career, but the differences should be based on the density of talent rather than a change to the overall difficulty slider.  This is something that I think Dirt Rally does well - the top times are always in the same ballpark, but the overall skill of the field tightens up as you move through your DR career.  Whether you're racing in karts or the LMP series (which is, laughably, placed higher than F1 in the career tree), the top drivers should be similarly skilled.  The difference should be that the LMP series would have more of those top drivers than the lower tiers.Speaking of AI, the AI is super aggressive.  I like that they attempt to defend and gain positions, but the ""red mist"" that has apparently been implemented has got to go.  It is routine to see cars, after being passed, immediately cut the next corner or run wide on the exit, even if doing so means driving directly into another car or a physical barrier.  Addtionally, the lines they take at times are shockingly bad.  Braking too late into corners and then getting on the throttle far too late, causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  Cutting corners or exiting wide, again causing them to crawl down the ensuing straight.  The AI in this game basically drives like first-time online racers, with no situational awareness and no understanding of the importance of early throttle application on corner exit.I feel like, despite not recommending this title, there are quite a few positives to be had.  However the poor career mode and AI really make the overall experience pointless, as there are far better sims out there for online play or hotlapping.  As of this time I cannot recommend the title, but I do plan on revisiting it in the future when it has been patched further and more content has been released.			",568,113,37,59,37,6,84

												If you own an AMD graphics card DO NOT buy this game. It is built for Nvidia cards and the devs have no intention of supporting AMD users. If you have an Nvidia card then go for it, it'll probably run well. I have a R9 280X and this game dips as low as 10 fps at times. People with R9 290 cards also can't run it well. Do not waste your hard earned money on this game or this developer.			",310,53,11,39,51,2,62

												I wanted to like this. I really REALLY REALLY wanted to like this.But the game has problems that just make this game feel more like a chore than an enjoyable experience to me.For non-ingame issues: any visual setting change requires a restart. Any. Even switching to windowed mode. This is frustrating along with the fact that you can't skip the intro logos (in game or by manipulating files) which feel like they go on longer than they should. This makes adjusting video settings or just doing basic things like windowed/fullscreen a chore and take much longer than necessary. You also cannot change any settings while in a race, which is also annoying. Not even adjust controller options like deadzone or sensitivity. That means that when you're trying to correct the frustrating handling (more on that in a bit) you need to continuously load in and out of races. Over. And over.Also there is no borderless fullscreen mode.But those are mainly minor annoyances in the grand scheme of things. The big issue that I've found is the handling. I play with the stability and traction control on and all. All penalties, damage models, tyre wear, gas, etc are all off (This also means that I do not have tyre temperature simulation on). I cannot keep a car on the track even if my life depended on it. Oversteer and understeer are extremely common. You can slow down to 20 - 30mph to take a 90 degree corner in clear bright weather conditions and you will either drive straight into the gravel or have your car start spinning as if it was caught in a tornado. You can also completely lose your traction on straightaways and head face first into the barriers due to bumps in the road, the AI drivers, or the game deciding that you're not miserable enough. Correcting spin-outs feels practically impossible because as soon as you start to spin out, your car will feel like it is on solid ice. This felt the same from karts to street cars to touring cars. Nothing felt stable. Even after adjusting controller settings to the ones found on a very popular guide from the Steam community, it felt a little better but still completely uncontrollable. I've heard that this game feels much better with a wheel. With a 360 controller however, it felt like a nightmare.I'd also like to comment on the community for this game that I've seen while trying to troubleshoot many problems. The community is very very defensive about this game and is very quick to point fingers at anyone and everyone rather than admit that the game has problems that need to be fixed. For example, I noticed that if you so much as scrape a wall with your front bumper, your entire side of the car will snap to the wall and be impossible to steer away from, as if the wall had a magnet that sucked you in. After googling the problem, I found many people in the community eager to dismiss it as realism and that the player was just playing badly. Cars do not stick to walls. This is also true for people that have issues with the handling. They are at fault because they play badly, not because the game has an inconsistent and hard to grasp handling model.I was very very excited to finally play this now that it is in the Humble Bundle after reading much about it and watching many videos etc etc. I ignored all the problems people said it had and now I wish that I had listened.I'd love to recommend this in the future if its problems get sorted, but for now I'd suggest that you pass if you're on the fence.If you're gonna get it anyway, that's great! I hope that you can get to grips with the handling better than I could and have a fun time.Edit: I feel like it would only be fair to briefly touch on the AI too. It is not good. You know how when you play something like Gran Turismo, you use the other cars as buffers around corners and shunt them around because there is no penalty not to? That is what the AI does to you. Around corners, the AI will frequently shunt you off the track even though you've given adequate space for themselves and for you. I have also experienced the AI swerving into me countless times while I'm overtaking them on a long straightaway. Because of the penalties system, if the AI shunts you into a wall, your lap time is invalidated. If the AI shunts you across a corner, you cut the track and your lap time is invalidated. It is an extremely frustrating experience dealing with the AI.Edit 2: Also sometimes when you tab out the window turns completely white. It still is running properly and hasn't crashed but is completely white and uninteractable, requiring a restart.			",149,25,3,24,21,0,41

												Let me see, lets address whether I will be censored with an opinion on this review? erm no, goodLets get to it, the amount of poor support regarding this game is a joke, having major issues for people all over seems to be missed due to the amount of censoring done by DevsKnown fact amongst STEAM users and also else whereIf this is how SMS wants to treat its customers, then by all means don't think the same user base will be buying pC2Now to the game, lets just say I have played better on consoles fwiwJoypad support is non existant for user input here, sur eyou have a plethora of adjustments at hand, but why? none seem to give any smooth input making the game frustrating to say the leastWell all can't just buy wheels, which it seems this game is designed forI have 4 myself, but no where to use this as I have a 55 inch TV I use for the PC, so no deskHaving asked the forum reasons to why controller input has been over looked, a response of, ""we don't support 3rd party apps"" If this is the kind of support one is expected as a soruce of ""professionalism"", well I am sure this transparency to the real intentions of the Devs is seenQuite simply, they don't care about our needsI have pretty much played every car game out there, not all, but pretty much most of them, and this game by far even though it's eye candy plus, is lacking some serious support from SMS1.5 million games sold? most on consoles, they use a Joypad as a predominant device, yet PC seems to be over looked, why?The game has potential, which is met by the arrogance of the Devs and support staff, thinking thsi game is a Sim. It's far from, most things that go to make it a Sim is broke, too many issuesAI is seriously BIASED so it does as it pleases and is not confined to the rules of what you drive toOpponents go off track, over take you, you do the same, you get penalties and slow down, greatAll I can say is, a good looking game does not necessarily make a good playing gameEdit, proof of how customers get treatedhttp://oi60.tinypic.com/20b1pv6.jpgThis post has since been removedUpdate, looks like that pic has been removed so here it is againhttp://postimg.org/image/stmxy7iih/Edit 31/01/16I am adding that my review has been hidden, for what ever reason, I don't know, but it just goes to show how the devs censor anything but a positive reviewEDIT, I have to add this, this is a moderators msg to me to why I was banned, and since I have already spoken to a Global, it wasn't a STEAM mod, but SMS Leviathon who did thishttp://s13.postimg.org/bydqbih87/p_CMr_Wii_JPG.jpgNow since this is specifically a friend of mine I was speaking to, hence the sledging, I don't see how any of the reasons apply to why I was banned, particularly since I had already deleted the comment myselfThis ISN'T about me being banned, this is about how SMS employees treat their customers, ergo my reviewUnfortunate as it is, but I doubt many people 2nd time round will invest in pC2, given that we were promised a DX12 upgrade, looks like that's not coming either...

												If you like racing games this HAS to be in your collection.  One of the best racing sims on PC.  The handling of the cars has a great feel with each one having there own characteristics.  Your able to feel tyre wear as it slowly drops away and if you leave the pits on cold tyres and expect to go flat out, you'll quickly find yourself in the barrier.  The weather not only looks great but adds alot to the racing as the track evolves from dry to wet.The career mode is great for those who enjoy single player racing as you progress up the ranks into the higher formulas while also getting the chance to gain invites to special race series throughout the race calender.For the graphics, the videos and pictures say it all. Sounds are great also.There were still a few small bugs in the last build before release but watching how quickly things have developed over the last 3 years it won't be long, if there are any still, to be squished.If things start to feel a bit too easy, try out the Lotus 98T on full boost round the ring in a thunderstorm! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfinished, even at patch 1.4. The amount of game breaking bugs, unfinished features, poor ai, crap multi player and even worse AI make this game nothing more than a graphical showcase.  The developers have time to release paid DLC and work on features like advanced RAIN - fecking RAIN, rather than fix the broken game. STEER CLEAR if you want to enjoy racing - there are plenty to choose from on the PC.			",243,37,30,17,23,3,25

I will be comparing this game to its main competitor, which is Assetto Corsa. (cant account for rfactor 2 because i dont own that game).Having played both games, I think they both upsides and downsides.Project Cars feels, to me, like a more complete game than Assetto Corsa.You have a proper progressive career mode where you start out as a racer and choose which league you want to start out in, you have proper multiplayer in which you can easily host your own lobbies without any port-forwarding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You have day/night time progression as well as various weather settings. You have complete control over each individual option in a race you create, whether it be assists, cars, AI/player count, practice session time, qualifying and the final race.Project Cars feels amazing with my G27 wheel.The graphics are the best of any sim racing game on the market today.Beautiful tracks, especially Azure Coast & California Highway.Okay, moving to the downsides of this game.-The physics are not the best in the genre by any means, a lot of oversteer and easily correctable which makes racing relatively *easy*, compared to Assetto Corsa where it is very biased on understeer which rewards you for proper driving.-The sounds are not realistic at all if you compare some cars to real life. It's as if every car's sounds are simulated with the car having 0 noise muffling even if it's a street car(Ford Mustang).-There are barely, if any, mods for this game so you're pretty much stuck with what you get + DLCs.-Speaking of DLCs, this game has many and are expensive for *barely* what you get.-The AI is incredibly horse♥♥♥♥♥♥and will always find a way to ram you, no matter how well(or bad) you drive. Move a bit to the right if an AI is overtaking you, and he will(for some reason) run into your♥♥♥♥♥and spin you out any way.ConclusionBoth games are good in their own way. It's all down to personal preference.Do you want a hotlapping simulator with the best physics in it's genre and modability?Or do you want a complete game with an amazing career mode, proper multiplayer and incredible visuals?

												I have held competition licenses for many years now, and I can tell you that this is so far off from a sim that it is laughable. Most reviews of this game come from people playing a controller. In it's own right I understand that not everyone will have a high end racing wheel to use. However, any real sim should be tested and reviewed at minimum with a controller and a wheel.First things first, I am not some crazy over the top fanboy. This game looks great. The interface is smooth, and has a very nice layout. The graphics put it in a league of its own. There are lots of little things that this game gets right that a lot of other racing games and sims alike seem to really muck up. This is one of the first games that I have played that did not immediately lock up the rear wheels when pulling the hand brake. On the subject of Brakes, this has a loose idea of something called Brake fade. The hotter the rotors get, the more distance the car will need to stop or slow down. The engine temp will rise and fall depending on ambient temperature, Driving style, clean air V.S. Drafting. It has a lot of small things done very well. It is one of the few where you can toggle the lights and see the effect on the environment. The different camera angles are spot on. There are true elements the devs wanted this game to be a sim.I want to like Project CARS. I really do, but I can't. This is not a sim. It is a game. Had it been marketed more as a game I would have loved it. In fact in early development it was. It changed rather abruptly near launch however. It became the ""Ultimate Driver Journey"" and ""For Racers by Racers."" None of the actual racers I know whether it is SCCA cone chasers or Rally America drivers had many things that we said put into this game. The end product actually turned out to be something some of us downright hated. The physics are buggy, sometimes you fall through the track, sometimes the car has more grip than it would on rails, other times it is like driving on ice. Collisions are far from sim level. You might be asking, "" Isn't the point of a sim not to crash?"" Absolutely, however mistakes happen on the track. It is a reality of the sport that drivers have to accept every time tires touch the track. This game has nearly no consequences for mistakes large or small. Hit a rumble strip too hard, nothing will happen. Bump a player or AI. Mild scratches. Really hit them, body damage and mild alignment failure. It seems really upsetting that games or sims in this genre really seem to ignore player punishment. The odd thing of it all is that is what players want. We want the aggravated feeling of throwing away the whole race over a miscalculation leading us to rip an oil pan off and blow an engine; Or the feeling of unspeakable pride when we finally master a track. I know that there are going to be bugs in a game like this. I am sure things like that lack of Force Feedback, or awkward dead-zones will eventually be fixed. There isn't a game out there that is trying to achieve this level of detail that wont have a few things to work out. I understand that, but there was so much potential that was just thrown away. It was like a sim that didn't know it wanted to be a sim. Driving feels disconnected and not very authentic. Project CARS is a good game, but just that. If you are a hard core racing sim seeker I would go into this game with the idea that it is not a sim. It is a fun and somewhat challenging racing game, but it will not meet all of your needs as a hardcore driving sim fan. In total I will give Project CARS a 77/100. The beautiful graphics and amazing attention to detail make this game stand out, but I can not forgive the vague sense of driving or the important bits that Slightly Mad Studios Gave up on. With that I can not recommend this Sim as a sim. It gets an ""Eh maybe"" as a game.			",215,35,19,23,28,1,25

												Have an AMD card? Then you are ♥♥♥♥ed! The devs are in bed with nvidia, and have screwed over player with non-nvidia cards. SMS has downgraded AMD performance.(Also, force feedback seems to be also sub-par, or do my memories trick me in that regard?)Exhibit a: all tracks are awash with nvidia ads. Either SMS have an idiotic sense of finances and were duped into including nvidia ads in their game for free, or they are lying through their teeth. As their successful financing of the game hints at good sense of money, I'm sorry to say the latter one is the more sensible of the two options. (Or they are rabid nvidia fanboys who plaster everything with nvidia logos. Which would be even worse.)Exhibit b: while a couple hundred builds back, AMD cards were working fine, now surprisingly they are simply not utilized. GPU usage is far from 100%, with the same driver as before.This is from October of 2014, build 829: http://i.imgur.com/867VGbX.pngAnd this is from now, build 1000+: http://i.imgur.com/Fcm4FSO.pngThe difference is that the first lets you go mostly ultra on a 290X, while with the second, you can't even use high settings for the same framerates.

												1) the ""mixed"" reviews are coming from people who are expecting this game to behave like need for speed. This is a simulation. Your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ xbox controller will not give you the control required to play this game on it's maximum difficulty. 2) The AI ""smashing into you"" And players ""smashing into you"" is YOUR fault. Learn what an apex is, and follow it. Learn your racing line and don't act like you own the road. Would you drive like this in a real car with your life and the life of others in your hands? No! Don't do it! They're hitting you because you're bad at racing. This game's physics isn't for casuals. Practice, practice, practice. Everyone says they want ""the most realistic driving simulation possible"". Slightly Mad gives it to you and the crybabies realize that they actually didn't want that. They want to feel like a racecar driver without realizing it takes actual skill. Go play need for speed. This is the single most incredible racing experence you can have in VR, if you have a proper racing wheel, and you want something that is a little forgiving and looks fantastic.It translates to real track time improvements, I feel, as long as you set the game to the hardest, full manual difficulty. The simulation is not 100% ... but it's damn close. It can be somewhat forgiving when it comes to damage or vehicle on vehicle impacts and so on - but the driving and road physics are top notch. If you don't drive like a lunatic and keep it on the track, the behavior is incredibly close to a real car.As someone who has raced in road course time attack in a real racecar, this is the closest you're going to ever get without splashing 20k on a racecar and making it your life: or getting a full motion sim rig and going all in on iracing.

												I'm only 5+ hours into the game, and I really like it. I own Forza for XBox One and GT6 for PS3 so the first thing that stands out are the graphics on the PC... Wow! The loves.. I love that when you are racing in any city, that you feel like you are there.. the buildings in the distance are as detialed as the race track, the smog, the amazing weather affects.. as it starts to rain, it is on your windshield but not on the track, as it continues, you can see the rain puddle as the track stops absorbing it! And the sunset hitting the clouds as the rain stops.. Wow again.The likes.. I like that there are 7 views possible for racing: bumper, hood, left/mid/right driver view, windshield, and above behind. I like that the controller is very responsive.. I haven't tried my G27 with it yet. And I like that it feels as though it has a lot of potential..The dislikes.. Where are the cars? There are 74ish cars. And I'm sure that there are lots more coming.. but that's just it.. it doesn't seem finished. From the menus, to the woman explaining each part, it doesn't feel as polished as the actual racing. I couldn't figure out how to quit the game! Why would I want to? The cars come fully modified. Meaning there is nothing to buy. But you can fine tune every detail from +/- .1% toe in angle, to shock height etc. But don't take too long cause the practice, or qualifier timer is still running.. and you want to qualify for one of the top 4 spots or forget it. When I have started in 16th I have usually ended up in 16th.So to sum up. If you want a racing game that is exceptionally detailed visually, has great car control (for the cars it has), and has a lot of potential. This is it.			",38,3,2,6,0,0,8

												UPDATE 5/6/2016I find it amazing that people somehow focus on only 1 of the 25 points I made in the review and assume I hate this game merely because it's not on Wii U. Moved original review UP for people who can't read.Having over 100 hours in this game now. In many parts it feels good, but there are many things that are constantly annoying, and after I think 7 patches so far the problems are still there.Pros I can think of:Look better than most other sims, day/night transition and weather look goodA career mode which keeps you busyA decent number of players onlineMany cars are good to drive and makes more sense than most arcade titlesProblems I can think of:Twtichy graphics. Flickering textures here and there no matter what settings I use. Reflections and special effects often look fake.Despite most people's praise, the game looks bad in many aspects, such as night. It looks way worse than say the new NFS. Also you can try driving behind a Mustang at night with you head light turns on. The Mustang's rear will look really bad. Same with many other cars. In addition, Azure coast and California highway don't look quite good as those screenshots.You need to turn track detail settings to high in order to see graffiti on Nordschleife, which means they don't regard graffiti as reference points but as decoration.In-car camera way too dark. Feels very unrealistic. It looks like you have window tint on your windscreen.Online lobby is usually a big mess. Much bigger than sims that more heavily depends on dedicated server. Everybody makes a lobby with car/track they like, and many don't make much sense such as 5 lap race with mandatory pitstop, Formula A cars having track day with slow road cars, etc. There are lots of wreckers too.Many cars feel stiff, and their behavior sometimes doesn't make sense.AI is bad, they either can't drive themselves, or like to ram players, or are too pacifist and don't give chanllenge, depending on car classes they use. AI is particularly bad in Karts.They aren't affected by weather as much as players do, which is unfair and frustrating.Rolling start is broken. It often guarantees the 2nd place player gets to 1st when green, and there are a lot more bugs related to rolling start, which havn't been resolved since launch.Race start sequence is fixed. The timing from the last red to green is always the same.Track-cut detection is broken. People can still gain lots of advantage cutting the track without getting any penalty.Engine start is the most pathetic in all games that have this feature. Instant engine start with no sound at all.FFB feels too much spring, and the community relies on JackSpade guy's hard work to make FFB work, which should be the devs' job in the first place.Community events/Time trial leaderboards have problems. Record on Hockenheim GP is an SLS GT3 in less than 25 seconds. I bet it's faster than a jet fighter.Calendar in the career mode is poorly thought out. 24h Le Mans seems always in mid December which doesn't make sense. You can have multiple events on the same day at opposite side of the planet and feels very unrealistic.UI is made worse and worse. After the new update the option button and shutdown button on the top right corner are almost invisible. What were they thinking?No proper triple monitor support (graphics are stretched to side screens and UI is not designed to work best with 3 monitors), and the telemetry HUD is unusable on triple monitor, while other features kind of work on triple screen. This means when they first design the game, they never even think about triple screen setup, which is ridiculous since it's aiming at the sim racing community.There is no way to change any option at all when racing. You can't even adjust game's sound volume. To get a nice FOV or to find the best video settings, you have to go into and out of races back and forth constantly, and there is no automatic visual settings. There is also no way to check you button binding when you are in race.Many problems with physics. Rain is unrealistic. Contact between cars is broken (cars that make contact with stick to each other).As a Wii U owner, the developers' attitude towards the promised and then abandoned Wii U version and Nintendo supporters is ridiculous.DLCs, especially the Japanese car DLC, feel like lazy work and cash grab.It's a nice game but loaded with problems. I think a ""Postive"" rating should best describe how it is.You don't have to read the updates below at all.==============================================================UPDATE 3/27/2016Repsonse to that daddy do it right guy with a reply regarding the Wii U stuff. I assume this guy is a PCars fan, and I dislike his attitude towards my negative take on PCars Wii U release cancellation.1. Far back in 2012 SMS has confirmed a Wii U release. The Wii U logo appeared on their website, along with Steam OS version announced and confirmed. They did get a lot of funding from Wii U owners and supporters from their crowd funding campaign.2. Since the annoucement of PCars, SMS had been constantly asked about the Wii U's capability of handling such a racing sim as PCars, and SMS had been constantly saying PCars will come to Wii U. You can still access the presentation slides here: http://www.wmdportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/WMD_Overview_160212.pdfThey talk about utilizing Wii U's unique controls quite a bit.3. For people who don't own or like Wii U and believe I (along with many other Wii U owners) am ""gullible"", check that slide and see on page 22 how many promised features and aspects are left out from the game or are made into paid DLCs to milk gamers. You can even find videos of Indianapolis track from early builds of the game, but the official release left this out for no good reason.4. I'll list some quotes from SMS regarding the Wii U version of PCars, check what they said:Jan 7, 2014. http://gamingbolt.com/project-cars-will-showcase-the-hidden-power-of-the-wii-u-slightly-mad-studiosSep 5, 2014. http://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-cars-wii-u-delay-theres-no-conspiracy-dev-/1100-6422143/5. Even without a Wii U release, the PC version and console versions are full of bugs and issues. I personally will no longer support this developer. Me being gullible? No. It's this developer's attitude and expertise being far below my guess, and many others'.UPDATE 2/6/2016Reply to the ""if you don't want it just refund it"" comment:To begin with I pre-ordered this game because I wanted to support them bring the first ever racing sim to WiiU (but then they dropped it which is disappointing), and back then there was no such thing as Steam refund.Besides, current refund policy requires game time less than 2 hours, which in most cases will not do a fair review for racing sims. Most racing sims even need more than 2 hours to set up your controller and FOV correct. I have over 100 hours into PCars now, and I'm confident that my negative review on PCars much more fair and unbiased than other people's negative review, who only spend less than 2 hours in the game. Yes PCars for me should be more than 5/10, but due to the polarity of how Steam review works, if I'm asked ""Do you recommend PCars to people who wants a racing sim"" my answer would probably be no, hence my negative review.Also I just lost my about 80 hours career save when I change my hard drive. It seems that the save file is local and not cloud backed-up. Be careful when you reinstall the game.			",85,14,25,4,4,0,6

												As a simracer I've been waiting for this game for a long time. When I plugged in my T500RS and did my first laps I was like: Wow, Need for Speed Underground is back? The force feedback gives you zero feel for the cars. It feels like playing Ship ""Simulator"". Don't get me wrong, this game will make a good 3rd person console gamepad title but srsly... not a sim. I'm Nürburgring Touristenfahrer and drive the ring about 4 laps a month. There are sims which simulate driving the ring pretty good on an accurate layout but not this one. Everything just feels totally wrong. Sadly I can't review the graphics because I'm only using an AMD R9 card and we all now that this game runs good only on nvidia cards. I had high hopes on this game because of all those Fanboys (that will dislike this review of course as you can see on every negative review here) around hyping it so much.Long story short.. You want a 3rd person console gamepad racer? Buy it. You want a Simulator? Don't buy it. ",47,0,10,0,5,0,1

												Im disappointed.Bought it during sale because it looked good and thought it would act like a really good  car game but sadly there are too many down sides to warrant it being such a high price and released game.Tires blow up after pit stopping which is mandatory but can be fixed by changing settigns which is a pest.AI cheats and takes pit stop on last lap meaning they get 22 seconds ahead of you and steal an unfair win.AI dont respect your car and they will not move from race line and this causes them to hit you and push you off.Penalties dont apply to AI but they do to you so if your pushed off by them they get away free but you penalised.Overall its a good game but really needs bug fixing instead of bring out more fancy cars.

												If you have an AMD card, stay away.This game does not work well with AMD cards.For now it's not recommended.Edit:This is my spec.Windows 8.1Intel i7 3770k quad core CPU (8 logical with HT), clocked at 4.2GHz.16GB RAMAMD R9 295X2 (2x8GB) GPUSSD 256 GB Storage.I've heard AMD are working on it together with the developer of the game, so hopefully it will be fixed soon. Also, not everyone with AMD cards seem to be having problems, looks like it could be the higher-end-cards, like 290 290x, 295x.I'm using the 15.4 AMD driver. I also disabled one of the 290x's in my setup, still not working well. So, it's not only an SLI problem. Check the forums, and benchmarks, at least some AMD cards are not doing well with this game so far.I tried disabling Hyper-threading and that actually helps, but it does not solve the performance issue.

												Ever dreamt of becoming a professional race driver? Racing insanely fast, exotic cars through extremely demanding speedways, facing fierce competition from other drivers and manufacturers, negotiating lucrative work and sponsorship agreements, while avoiding the paparazzi and guarding your private affairs like your life depended on it? If you do, then maybe we have something or other in common. The passion for racing and the curiosity about paddock and backstage affairs like contract negotiations, unveiling of new models, new driver and team entries and the occasional industrial espionage get people like me extremely excited for no apparent reason to the uninitiated or the frankly uninterested. And, while watching races from the TV can be really satisfying, having the opportunity to get in touch with the world of professional racing and experience the joys and pains of auto racing (even if through a computer simulation) brings such satisfaction to a whole new level.Project CARS (acronym for ""Community-Assisted Racing Simulator) brings the paddock to your home. Its deep, comprehensive Career Mode allows for progression not only through different racing disciplines (from go-karts to prototypes), but there also is an element of personal development in the game. The player has to manage one's inbox, where contract offers, event invitations and notices are sent, and keep track of scheduled races for a given period. There is also a Twitter-like ""social network"" system that allows the player to see the reaction from the fans and the media, something that adds a nice bit of off-track experience and helps to make things even more interesting. Many wins in a row may lead to invitational events, tests and even contract offers from other teams and promotions to other motorsport categories; the standard starting point of the career mode is go-kart racing, but there is the option of skipping some steps or even racing at the top level, Le Mans Prototypes. It sure does work differently than other simulation or ""simcade"" titles like Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport, whose ""simulation/world tour"" modes possess a more open structure, not being career and discipline progression-oriented like Project CARS; it really gives the sensation of being a real racer starting from the bottom, aiming at the top ranks of motor racing.Mind you, Project CARS is not a game for the uninitiated or the uninterested. It is, actually, a quite demanding racing simulator, having an intricate simulation model which tries (and generally succeeds) to replicate real-life vehicle behaviour. Much like Assetto Corsa and rFactor, PCARS requires accurate driving; cars behave and respond to inputs as they should, and that means that any driving mistake could send you to the pitwall in a matter of milliseconds, especially when driving faster cars like the Audio R8 V10 Plus or the Sauber-Mercedes C9. Effects like g-forces, weight transfer and body roll are reproduced, and the game gives out the sensation that the player is in control of a real automobile, especially when using a steering wheel like the Logitech G series wheels. Shaving off those precious tenths of a second from your lap times requires mastery of the use of the clutch pedal and the shifter, precise braking and absolute control of the gas pedal, in addition to learning how to set your car properly for each circuit. PCARS lets the player adjust every bit  of the vehicle - shock absorbers, ride height, transmission, aerodynamics and so on -, although the car settings are not as deep as what was offered by GTR2 or rFactor. Finding out the best setup for each car and track is extremely rewarding, and at the same time is a tough challenge. Real drivers Ben Collins (a.k.a. Top Gear's The (former) Stig), Nicholas Hamilton and Oliver Webb assisted during the development of the game.The learning curve is steep (as with any other simulation out there), and players are encouraged to take their time to learn each track and learn how to handle each vehicle, as each one of them responds very differently to inputs - as any real car would. A good idea is to start by driving the less powerful cars, like the Renault Clio and the Formula Junior cars, around easier tracks like Monza, and then progressing to harder tracks and more powerful cars, like the GT and Formula A vehicles. Fortunately though, there are plenty of driving aids like automatic clutch and gear shift, braking help and best line indicator, which could be very helpful for those interested in learning the ropes but not experienced with racing simulators.The car list, though not impressive like its rival titles, is enough to keep the player interested, and has got some real gems, like the Sauber C9 and the Lotus-Renault 97T once driven by Ayrton Senna and Elio de Angelis (although there are some important cars, in my opinion, that are missing, like the Nissan Skyline and the Honda NSX). But the track department is where this game shines: the game includes around one hundred different courses (some of these being separate sections of full courses), like the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and the Circuit de la Sarthe (host of the 24 Heures du Mans), a knock-off of the Suzuka Circuit (aptly named Sakitto, ""circuit"" in Japanese language), as well as fictional locations.The graphics are marvelous. Every car is faithfully recreated from the headlamps to the steering wheel, and the environments are lush, rich with trees, roadside buildings and objects. Lighting and shadow effects are top-notch; the sunlight passing through the trees by sunset is definitely exquisite, and puddles of water scattered through the track after heavy rain (one of the most cosmetically appealing rain simulations I've ever seen, as a matter of fact) actually reflect their surroundings. Grass and particles are believable, and their level and quality can be adjusted by the player. When played at the maximum settings, although very CPU and GPU-consuming, Project CARS becomes a serious showcase; however, PCARS remains incredibly good-looking even at lower settings. The sensation of speed is so good it's really hard to describe - but it really makes the competition eat dust.Sound is also excellent. Apparently, engine sound was captured directly from the real thing, and hearing the engine roaring while cruising in a long straightaway like Monza's is exhilarating. Other sounds, like gearbox whirring, tires and brake discs screeching, suspension movement and crashes are very realistic and help in immersing the player in the experience of driving pure-bred racing cars on virtual circuits. Radio chatter is also available - the pit crew advises the player on any accidents during the race, or when to come into the pits, or any issues with the car.There is one flaw, though - AI. No, its not bad. Really. The computer-controlled racers shows believable responses to every racing situation and act sportsmanlike for most of the time... except when playing with AI levels above 85 - then, the carnage begins. Racers become almost suicidal, crashing  in spectacular fashion, messing up race starts in a way that even a total novice wouldn't (pile-ups and missing wheels are a rather frequent sighting) and wreaking havoc at every curve. Imagine yourself having an almost-perfect race, attacking every corner with surgical precision, leading the pack, heading to the checkered flag... only to be hurled off the track by a raging maniac. Frustrating enough? Well, at least you were not knocked out at the very beginning at the event.Multiplayer is excellent. All cars and tracks are available for selection, and the game sessions are, for most of the time, stable (depending on your connection speed and quality, that is). Like the single player mode, the host player can adjust the duration of the race (in laps or minutes), time of the day (continued in the comments section - character limit reached)			",119,7,30,6,7,0,8

												After playing this game/sim in beta stages on a g25 and quite enjoying it, I thought it was an easy decision to buy the retail game.Initially I was impressed by the visuals and dynamic weather and time. My wheel had died in the interim and I was playing on a 360 controller.I got bored with the game after a few weeks and the controller was really ruining the experience for me. I left it for a month or so while I decided on a wheel purchase.Fast forward a month or two, I had ordered a Fanatec CSW V2 as I didn't have the money for the Accuforce and wasn't aware of the OSW (which I would have definitely gone with had I known).Fired up pcars in excitement. Turned a few laps. Felt rubbish. Worse than beta with g25. Tried changing settings. Still lacklustre. Tried the Jack Spade FFB tweaks, much better. Started an AI race offline. AI sideswipe me on first lap while passing on the straight. Try again. Same result. AI either has no spatial awareness or a death wish.It may just be that the novelty of all the pretty shiny effects has worn off, but I feel as though this game has maybe gotten worse since release. Version 3.0 FFS and the AI is borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the control system and FFB seems to be continually skewing towards control pad users (why when it supposed to be a ""Sim"" I'll never know).Dissappointed in this game. It had so much potential. As much as people bag out AC for♥♥♥♥♥♥physics, at least I can run a race in that without the AI ramming me like a prepubescent teen raging in gran turismo when they get passed.			",85,5,9,3,5,0,6

												The disappointment of the last decade for me!project Cars was meant to be the ultimate simulation. The physics of rFactor2, the laserscanned Tracks of iRacing plus their great online community and partly realistic graphics. First apart from the graphics they reached none of their goals. They said real racing drivers helped them to develop the physics but i, as a guy who has driven a formula renault 2.0 car, can say that it is sh*t, so are the tracks the lack of details such as missing curbs or bumps that are actually implemented  in iRacing is huge. Another point is the AI well if they actually survive the first turn and you have a nice little battle with them they will divebomb and ramm you of the track at the first possibility. Do not judge me wrong i love it if the AI races hard but they have to be fair like in f1 2015. so i decided to do time trial but then again i realised that the physics are sh*t, the cars have way too much grip and are way too forgiving. For example you can brake almost 50 mtr. later than in real life but you just lock up and understeer of the racing line if you turn in but you do not spin and still get a decent line to overtake. So i think this game is even worse than the good old shift 2 in my opinion because we are 7 years on now and the Handling has not improved in the slightest only the graphics are good			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If they fix the ai... this game would be a lot of fun, but it is just too frustrating to race them. They have, for me, qualified 30 seconds faster than what should be possible with the car/track combination. Half the field (even ai) qualify with 1:30, while 10 or so cars are qualifying 1:02-1:01 at Outlon with the formula C car... Then when you try to race them it is just awful. They don't react to the terrain (such as gravel, which is like glue to you, the player, but the ai seem unaffected), they follow their terrible racing line whether you're trying to pass or not, they smash into you constantly, and they sometimes fly off the road at full speed into a chicane or hairpin (even on 100%). I'm not the fastest and 100% ai is pretty easy to beat on most car/track combinations. If the driving was amazing I might even look past it (I do for AC's ai woes) but the driving is pretty meh. Honestly, wait for a few patches and see where it's at. Stock Car Extreme is a far superior product, or even AC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unfortunatly I can't recomend this title to anyone even at a low price. At the moment the game has way to many bugs, patches have created more. Updates will eventually fix this game but how long this will take is anyones guess. Only fit to be called early access.Multiplayer is almost unplayable with bugs like invisilbe cars to crash into. Penalties for jump starts when no jump start commited. No systems in place to reward or penalise drivers. Most of the time you are taken out by either a really bad driver or someone who just wants to crash and bash.Project Cars forums is also very little help as developers and backers don't like critasism and seem to shout down  bug reports and complaints (Disapointing)Hopefully in the future this game will work as advertised.

												This is my OWN EXPERIENCE with the game, good for you if the game is perfect to your standards.One word to describe this game: FrustratingFrustrating when you find out this game has a terrible progression system, specially because the same devs did Shift 2 that actually had a great progression system with credits and car tuning and customization.Frustrating when you are in the last lap and something goes wrong because of the game and its bugs.Frustrating that every bad thing that happens to you never feels that it was your fault, other ""simulators"" transmit this feeling way better and makes you improve, PCARS just makes your Rage meter go up.Frustrating when you need to research how to make the Force Feedback Wheel feel good tweaking the very complicated and confusing settings in EVERY car because the default FFB is terrible and you can't feel what the car is doing.Frustrating when they broke promises of features and starts ANOTHER crowdfunding caimpaing for PCARS 2 just a few weeks after the PCARS 1 release riddle with bugs.Frustrating to feel that the physics don't improve with new updates.Frustrating when you feel that there is something wrong with how aerodynamics works in this game.And frustrating because there is a ""Game of the Year Edition"" now, indication that they probably will drop further improvements to the game.I put hours and hours into the game hoping for this game to get a proper polish but enough.Bought into the hype, the hype let me down hard, you gotta give them credits, they know how to do marketing for this mediocre example of self-proclamed ""racing simulator"" game which is not.The only thing that could make this game good is the addition of a progress/customization system like in Shift 2 because besides the graphics, everything else it is just mediocre at best.

												Where to start with this game.Lets start with the maps. They are great! great detail and accurate to the minor details.The cars. Pretty damn good! They need to add some more packs soon so that there will be a more diverse car selection for you to choose from.The online. Pretty bad, need to sort out the de-sync issues ASAP and it's typicaly full of foreign kids screaming at you for cutting them up. Joining servers is a pain in the *** and sometimes leaving the pit lane in qualifying is a double pain in the ***.Now then, the physics... ABSOLUTE ****. If you love pushing through the pack of cars to get to second place and then just exposing a tiny tiny tiny amount of you wheel onto the grass and getting flung around and around, then this will be £30 well spent. The countless amount of times that i've battled to get 2nd and even 1st and then be thrown to last place because of shoddy physics which bug out when you tap grass is unbelievable... You  get stuck to cars when they come into contact with you, you can randomly spin out on a straight and if you dont have a rig thats above good then you will experience some lovely low frames and mysterious slow motion effects when you frames drop. All in all, unless you have a decent rig and a great tolerance to bugs and shoddy physics then i would wait untill they patch this game up with more than duct tape and a glue stick.

												The game sure is pretty - but for everything that you see in the menus, it's really just a fancy overlay on really basic races. No car customization, nothing to do in career mode except click to the next race, deep track list, but most (all?) not laser scanned which contributes to the lack of feel while driving.I thought I would buy Assetto Corsa as a holdover to this game, but it wasn't worth the wait. Assetto Corsa doesn't pretend to be all of the things that PCars says it is... but at least it delivers on the racing simulation.			",153,38,6,17,37,1,25

												VR experience is AMAZING!!! I honestly can\'t believe it. I have had the game for a while but never really spent any time with it. Got an Oculus and thought I\'d give the VR version a whirl and I\'m sooooo glad I did. Project Cars in VR is the best simulated racing experience I have ever seen. The cockpit view finally feels spacious. I can look ahead as much as I want, glance to the side to make sure I am clear of the other vehicles. Other cars on the track feel real. They have size and mass, but at the same time, I feel like I have room on the course. VR changes everything.			",145,26,15,13,25,1,28

												I learned about Project Cars some years ago and have waited for this game since then. I wanted to back it up but i was afraid to throw my money away because Slightly Mad Studios were behind NFS shift series, which i disliked. This time there's no EA behind the game, instead Namco Bandai published the game, it's not the best publisher out there, but they're definitely better than EA.This game is nothing like NFS shift (i so want just erase that „f“). Shift 2 was unplayable for me. I have tried it on PS3 and PC, on both platforms i had a huge 0,5 second input lag which made the game unplayable for me. I tried some fixes on PC, but it didn‘t help. Besides that there was almost no force feedback and the performance was not so great. Many people thought that Project cars will be Shift 3. But fortunately it‘s nothing like Shift, it‘s much MUCH better. It is one of the best racing simulators to this day. But of course it has flaws. It was released in a very bad state, almost unplayable if you play career mode. Patches coming very slow, SMS do not want to acknowledge bugs. Consoles are holding the patches too.I can‘t not compare pCars to Assetto corsa, i own both but i like pCars slightly more. The physics in pCars are no very good and ffb is worse. Nothing changed to this day. And what is even worse that AI is not affected by physics. Raining or not, physics laws doesn't apply for them.The graphics. This is probably the best looking racing game on the market. The graphics are stunning. Of course at some weather conditions it can look bland, but the same happens in real life. Unlike Assetto corsa pCars has weather conditions and full day/night cycle. Racing at night while raining is awesome. Rain effects are great, the game looks even better in the rain.Performance is not very good. It‘s playable, but i expected better performance with GTX970. It drops to 30-40fps which is not acceptable. But if you lower the graphics options it can run really good. There's slightly to no chance that the game will be optimized.pCars has great career mode unlike AC. And career is really long. You'll race every kind of vehicle, every kind of race etc. You get rewarded for winning and collecting all the rewards will take some time. Difficulty is easily adjustable so is race length.The car selection is varied but there are not many cars in the game. Yes quality over quantity, but we need more cars, let it be DLC cars (please give us real DLC, not ones which are already in the game and are created much earlier). I‘d love to see some more slower road cars, more muscle cars, Japanese brands. With such good sale they can afford much more licenses now, so if SMS will not waste the money we could see some nice cars. Sadly there's a problem with custom liveries. If you download one, it replaces the old one. What a nonsense. And the workshop was promised, it even has a section on steam discussion, but there's no workshop.Track selection is great. It lacks some tracks, but there is more than enough tracks. And it includes the famous Nordschleife, unlike AC were you need to pay 15€ for it. I guess more tracks will be added via DLC. I also hope for more point to point tracks. Yes AC has laser scanned tracks, pCars not, but not everyone is a maniac who notices this.I probably haven‘t seen a really good AI in a racing game. pCars is no exception. AI is pretty bad. But from the funny side it is very realistic because you often feel like racing against real people because AI rams you, cut corners and do other stupid things, same as real players. But if being serious, AI is bad. AI is not affected by rain so it‘s very hard to win in the rain, especially when it starts raining in the middle of the race AI keeps the same pace. This was one of the most reported bugs, but SMS did not fix this.The multiplayer is similar to other games. There are crashers all around who don‘t know what brakes are. There also are community events where you compete with others in the leaderboards. Similar to Gran turismo system where new events are added each week/month.The game is good, but it needs more work, more polish, to fix the bugs, add more features and make current features fully working. All in all i can recommend this game if you love racing games and have a steering wheel, love to drive/race, love to adapt to new cars, love to grasp the handling of each car which is completely different. It has it's flaws, especially the official forums, where you can't criticize the game, point out bugs, complain etc. Ian Bell the head of SMS can't communicate properly and even banning people who liked someones negative post. Besides many addressed issues were not fixed in patch 1.4. But how it can be fixed when reporting bugs on official forum can be a bannable offense. So the game is good, but it's not finished and buggy and it will probably stay that way forever. There's no support from SMS. After two months major bugs are not fixed. So i suggest wait at east half a year or even a year and get it for 75% off (it is not worth the full price), maybe the patch will be released which will fix the bugs...in a year or two.Pros:Great graphicsGreat soundNice career modeGood amount of tracksCons:Poor physics and tire modelPoor FFBLack of car varietyLack of updates and fixesIan Bell			",702,392,38,104,109,5,116

												[Reviewed using a Logitech g27 set]A solid single-player racing game. The physics are really forgiving when compared to iRacing, but overall they are solid. The Career mode is good, and provides you with a lot of opportunities to drive all different kinds of cars while still giving you a ""season""-style experience. The emails and feedback you get from your racing directors are repetitive though... not sure why they are even there considering they say the exact same thing over and over again, to the letter.Major con against the game would be the trash AI. Open-wheel racing is near impossible due to the AI's desire to wreck you. In closed-wheel cars its less of an issue, but its a major frustration elsewhere. Also, the multiplayer is unpopulated and disappointing. If you want a good single player racing game, get Project Cars. If you want a competitive multiplayer racing game, get iRacing.

												I want to like this game.  I do like it, mostly.  The proble is that the controls don't feel realistic at all.  Not even close.  Even after pouring a good chunk of time into changing every concievable aspect most cars come off feeling like you are driving either a heavy truck or like you're driving on ice.  This game is totally unfinished and feels like a beta release.  the graphics are 7/10.  The driving physics are hit and miss but not even close for something claiming to be a sim, so 5/10. The AI is garbage and on rails.  I'm not great, by any means, but I know smart AI drivers when I see them and this ain't it.  I bought this thinking there might be some support for it but it turns out they are already looking to PCars 2.  Ah well.  I'd say it's worth $15, not the $30 I spent.  Even on sale, this game feels like it's asking too much.  I appreciate the attempt, but the excecution falls WAY short of what is now industry standard.  I'm not new to driving sims or arcades titles and this is neither one.Edit:  Something else to mention is the disappointing lack of customization and small car roster.  VERY small overall roster of vehicle brands given the deep field of vehicle brands in the racing community.			",23,2,4,4,9,0,4

												It's probably the best mix of simulation & tracks & cars that is currently out there, in my opinion. The force feedback and the handling are lacking compared to Assetto Corsa, but the vehicle range and track range I would say compensates for that. Then again, Project Cars 1 development and DLCs might be finished, the way I see it, while Assetto Corsa continues to bring new content.Sometimes it can be glitchy, and usually a patch fixes one bug and introduces another. That's quite annoying. Nevertheless, a nice experience, and a pleasure for me to drive, especially in online multiplayer. I remember trying career at some point, but I found it incredibly boring and never touched it since.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT 08/21/15:  Now over 200+ hours in, 12000+km driven on the nord.... pCars is still the best.  When your first racing game was pole position on the atari, playing pCars is such a treat.  EDIT:  Over 100+ hours in, and 5000+ km driven on the nord... pCars is the best.  Have a look at these videos.Clio Cup AI Race 70%, starting last

			I played a bit with the AI on some other tracks, and since I don't know them as well as I know the nordschleife, I was having a bit of difficulty keeping up with the AI at 80+.

Since 2012, I've been a huge fan of rFactor 2, probably spent more than 2000-3000 hrs on it since then.  I also have more than 600 hrs with Assetto Corsa, and I came back to rFactor 2, because AC is so shallow.  The visuals sure are better than rF2, but everything feels gimmicky.  Lots of canned effects, and after a while, the initial wow factor wear off very quickly.  If you like to race single player, than AC is pretty much only hotlapping, if you have any driving skills, the AI is very weak.So I like rFactor 2 AI a lot..  it feels very natural in most cases.  I have not been part of the alpha phase of pCars, since I learned about it, and the registration were closed.Knowing this was SMS, those who made Shift series, I expected something like it, but maybe more oriented toward sim.  I also expected the game to run far from the visuals I have seen in screenshots and video, since my rig is pretty modest:Phenom II X4 9658gb generic ramgtx 580 1.5gbAnd yet, the game runs silky smooth at native resolution of 1920x1080, with AA, track details ultra, grass ultra, most other settings high, reflection mid, and the game looks pretty good, miles better than I would have hoped.I started the game with more conservative settings, and bumped them up a few times, and this is what I'm running now.  I'm playing the game with a stock g27, and the feedback is nothing short of stellar.  It blows AC out of the water.  There are so many settings to tailor the game how you want it,  I've played with FFB settings, and managed to get feedback almost identical to AC, and with some different settings, feedback like rF2.   I'm now playing with something in between.  Feels very good.The UI is excellent, looks good, clean, but could use more usability refinement.  Going to options to adjust settings is too many clicks away.  The same when you run hotlaps.  We could have the leaderboard showing there, instead of having to go back to the menu, in leaderboard (and it doesnt remember the car you have selected, so you need to select the car you are running) and then you see where you stand.  But having the leaderboard integrated like this and the possibility to load up any ghosts from there is a huge feature, if you are like me, and like to improve your lap times by running time trials.  I play mostly single player.  Haven't tried multi-player yet, but I wouldn't expect much from public lobbies.So far, I'm nearing 2000km driven on the nordschleife exclusively, as I haven't tried any other tracks, and this one is brilliant.  After seeing this version, one might question if Kunos really laser scanned their nordschleife, since the elevation changes don't look proper after nordkhere, thru hatzenbach, and hocheichen.  This version seems to nail it on spot.One thing Kunos have done better tho, is the attention to details regarding the bushes, the fully modelled terrain (this seems to use a few layer of cardboard mountains) and curbs.  In this version, most higher curbs seems to have been lowered, and they don't quite have the shape they should.  They are made so you can run over most of them.  A little bummer, but it is indeed more interesting as you have more racing surface to use.   Also Kunos have dirtied the x bricks seen in the inside of the karussell and other locations, SMS did not.  Kunos also added 3d grass on the outside of those brick.. it looks nicer this way.  SMS x bricks looks brand new.Physics are what you would expect from a sim.  I haven't played with aids or anything, so I dunno how far from sim it can become if you don't play as I do, but in my book, it's a sim.  Pure sim.  It doesn't lack much options either.You can fine tune FOV for EVERY view, independantly, and there are more options for anything than you probably want.  If you are a console gamer, you will definately feel lost.  But play with a setting, and go back in game and see what it does.  If you use the helmet camera, there is quite a few options to set exactly how you want your view.  The car setups are as detailed as any sims would be.  The numbers used for setting might not be values in real life, such as downforce for wings, it's not in degree, but a fictive number.  But does it really matter for the targeted audience?  F1 drivers wont be traning professionally with this...  neither they are training with rF2, but instead rFactor pro..    but the game could probably be turned into a pro version to train pro drivers. So, if you are like me and have every sim there is, like rFactor 2, AC, BeamNG, WRS, GSCE, etc, then you have to give this one a try, specially if you are more into single player like I do.  The integrated leaderboard will keep you honing your skills as you defend your position in it.I haven't tried to race the AI much, but have done one race, and it seemed very good.  Might not be at rFactor 2 level, but it's probably the next best.  Well, with rF2, I'm also counting all gmotor engine based game... so that includes GSCE and more...  at least the recent ones... I'm not sure for rFactor 1 itself, would have to play it again.I'm delighted with pCars and I will be playing this for a long time to come I think. Good job SMS!			",125,28,37,19,8,1,0

												Game looks great, graphics are top notch - however, the gameplay, AI is terrible. Worst of all, cars feel like they are driving on ice and you have to change the steering settings far too often. Its much harder to drive a car around a corner than it is in real life..and the excuse of ""its a fast race car"" actually cannot justify the slippery steering and inconsistent tyre movements of the car handling in the game. Career mode is really boring, and online play is lacking, it takes too long to find a good room. No option of automatic race/join.			",4,0,1,0,1,0,1

												My hours played speak for themselves.I've been playing racing games for close on 30 years and I've never felt the immersion that I get from Project CARS. This game really makes you feel like you're in a car, in a race, with real weather and time of day.If you're really into racing games and have a wheel, then this game will not disappoint.However, if you try to drive like NFS or GT, then you're going to be punished.

												Edit: One year later, online is still woefully underdeveloped and the AI is no better. Poor effort, SMS.I've had a roller-coaster of a journey with this game, and it can be brilliant when it works. Right now, the terrible AI and MP issues are destroying the experience for me. Wait a few weeks for SMS to iron issues out. It's not worth £40 in its current state.			",126,8,27,10,9,1,13

												If I ever make a let-down list, this game will be close to the top of it. I followed it's progress in the few months leading up to release and thought ""Wow, this game looks amazing. AND it's a racing sim. Perfect!""What I got (in my humble opinion) was neither amazing, nor a racing sim. Or perfect, for that matter.I started my first career with the first tier of karts, which I quickly learned was a huge mistake. The physics and handling models applied to them were so atrocious that I wanted to vomit. Not from motion-sickness or anyting, but because they were so bad. Yes, 125cc karts are lightweight and hug the road, but the handling was just way too unresponsive and twitchy with an xbox360 controller.After forcing myself to finish a season of the karts career, I decided to try one of the events in which I get to drive a proper road car. During qualifying, it started to rain heavily after about 2 laps and I had posted the 2nd fastest time while the track was still dry. After pitting and getting 'wet' tires put on my car, I noticed that the AI were consistently crushing my posted lap time even with racing slicks in a torrential downpour, sending me back to 13th place. Now, I'm no expert on tire physics, but I've seen enough F1 races to know you can't drive soft-compund racing slicks in the rain and expect to have the slightest bit of grip. I thought unfair AI advantages were something of old arcade racers like NFS and not new racing ""sims""? The handling was better with the cars but still not what i would call simulation-like.I cannot comment on the supposedly beautiful graphics because I'm running 2+ year-old laptop hardware,(Intel i7 @ 2.4ghz, 3.2ghz with turbo and NV GTX 765m graphics)but I would get sudden drops in FPS from 60 to about 45 that would last a few seconds while running medium-ish settings.The game does, however, have a large selection of tracks and a nice selection of cars from what i saw. A little more variety in some of the car classes would have been nice, though, like the open wheels.I was excited to pick this up on sale, but now I'm excited to hear back about a refund.UPDATE:Less than 2 days after requesting a refund, my request was approved even though I have well over 2 hours spent on the game.If you like your racing ""sims"" with a  side of twitchy, unresponsive, and inconsistent handling with terrible AI, then by all means, go for it.But if I were you, I'd wait this game out and see if they patch some of the issues that I've seen.

												Aaahh, Project C.A.R.S.I really do love this game, despite the 100% justified complaints and criticism it has garnered. Kart racing in this game has actually improved my IRL go-karting tremendously.I'm not exactly an experienced driver when it comes to racing wheels; I use a DF GT on my rig whenever time permits me to play PCars, but what I do play I enjoy thoroughly. The game could be considered sim-cade'ish, but its leaning towards sim' so yeah, but AC is probably a better choice for pure driving. Car selection in PCars however is the♥♥♥♥♥♥for racing oriented vehicles, street not so much (although DLCs are fixing that).My only criticism with AC (which I consider a better racer in terms of driving physics and such), and mostly the reason I prefer to play PCars over AC atm is the presentation and UI.AC's UI is IMHO garbage, it plain sucks. I use a 3K display monitor and the way the game is set up between the menus and the actual driving part is ""bleh"" to say the least because of windows scaling issues. It's not very user friendly is what I would say.PCars on the other hand is more welcoming, sort of.You can't really save multiple tuning setups for the same car so that's a gigantic PITA, and configuring my wheel took forever (I haven't played in a few months, some of my complaints may have been resolved, who knows).And it has to be said, the announcement of PCars2 shortly after release was a bit infuriating, but at least it doesn't exactly seem like they have stopped support for THIS game so we'll see how it goes.Multiplayer in this game is eh I guess, not really much in way of variety. I LOVE the track day pub sessions (which is primarily the only sessions I ever come across), lots of cars with both good and bad drivers behind them swerving around tracks like Francorchamps or the Dubai Autodrome (my two favourite courses), and of course the lovely Nordschleife ;)I'd give it a 7-8/10, game has a lot of good in it, but the bads do outweigh it. Definitely try it out if you're into racing sims, and ABSOLUTELY use a wheel.[/b] ",138,6,16,10,7,1,2

												In this simcade racing game you spend less time battling the AI and track and more time battling bugs. Wanna play a realistic career? Damage is bugged. Wanna do an endurance race? Every single car will blow it's tires and be parked in the dirt by lap 8. Wanna listen to your crew chief? He'll tell you it's  raining heavy when it's clear as day. Wanna watch a replay with dynamic weather and time? Car lights and damage are bugged (and you can't watch the replay from the perspective of other cars). Like fancy particle effects? Bugged. Wanna race clean in a packed field? Sorry, you're a target and the other cars are missiles. Need to hear your tires to know exactly what's happening with your car? Tire volume is so low you can barely hear them.This game actually does a LOT right. The on track car count is out of this world, the graphics are great, it's well optimized on Nvidia cards (I've heard nightmares about AMD cards though), it has more options and tweakability than any racing game I've played.  But it gets so many things wrong I just can't recommend it right now.It's worth noting that similar to the Elder Scrolls games I'm having a TON of fun with the game when I'm able to look past the glaring issues. But too many of the issues really ruin the experience for me.[EDIT] I've been wanting to change this review to a thumbs up but since writing it two patches have come out and not only have none of my issues been fixed but I've discovered several repeatable bugs. One of which allows you to shift into first and drive off before the race has started leaving the pack in the dust. When such simple things like not being able to start driving before a race don't work the game is just not ready to be called ""released"".			",279,52,33,17,24,5,22

Posted: February 11, 2016
												Project Cars certainly is a very controversial game without a doubt, but something that confuses me is that people who dislike the game never really justify their reasons or provide proof to the technical issues within this game.I am going to say straight up, I have grown up around plenty of racing games through the years (Project Gotham Racing, Forza 3/4, Rally Cross, V8 Supercars 2 etc.) and its clear that this is one of those games that really quite is timeless. To be honest it seems like Project cars has taken little bits of each racing game I have played and combined it into one mass production. PROS: The Graphics- Simply stunning, this has to be one of the most realistic games I have purchased in quite a while and certainly does impress (provided you have the specs to push it)The Gameplay- When it comes to racing, nothing is more important than playing a game which is fast paced and competitive, there are plenty of settings that accomodate for difficulty, weather, time and day to customize to your every need. If you want, you can have a Sunday drive in a classic vehicle on some of the worlds most famous roads, or have a heartracing encounter at bathurst behind the wheel of a true racecar. The Cars- If you like your cars, this is the game for you. There is a mass selection of cars that are available (without purchasing DLC packs) and you can also expand your garage and buy unique cars and show them off to other players. CONS:AI- When racing in a Singleplayer game, you would expect the AI to be somewhat realistic to online racers, but its dissappointing to see when your going for a pass (particularly on tight tracks) that the other cars seem to sway for no apparent reason, some even running of the track when making turns. Now this may not be a major issue and could even be fixed via difficulty settings, but its not a major setback. Online- Probably the most annoying thing in this game is the online community, yes there are people that do actively engage in Project CARS, but there certainly could be a heap more people that play. Its never really common to find a game that has more than 20+ people in the one race, but there are always racing groups which you can join and then play with them (I do that, because not many Australians play this in my opinion)Car Customisation- Please dont be fooled by the title, but Project CARS does not let you customise/ modify any of the cars (all you can do is customise liveries), not a big issue if your just into racing. Overall, this game certainly puts pressure onto Forza and Gran Turismo, as it really makes you feel like you are playing a professional racing simulator. There are arcade elements to the game, but if you want fast cars and pure racing, this is the game for you. Aside from the negatives, this game is thoughrougly enjoyable and will give you a pleasent suprise when you start to get into it. I can guarantee, if you spend the time to effectively tune and work on your car, you will be hooked for hours. (Just a note, I use an Xbox 360 controller and am getting a Logitech racing set to play)Rating- A (84/100)			",37,1,3,1,5,1,1

												Out the box PCars isn't set up very well, the stock settings need tweaking to feel right, epecially if you're running a wheel. Then the individual preset car force feed back settings need work (install the Jack Spader Tweaker files, and the job is done for you). Finally, the race car settings are completely generic and need a bunch of adjustments; per vehicle and per track to get the best of a car.There's alot of hate for this title as it needs so much initial effort to enjoy, you can spend hour upon hour messing around with car settings. Then you need to test tweaks on a track and rinse and repeat until you nail a good car setup. It's far too much work, it really is, you shouldn't be tasked into into so much setting up where the dev has failed to spend the time. However there are shortcuts, online databases have decent settings to copy from.Once you've overcome all of the above, PCars is very good, it's got lots of content and look gorgeous. Sure the physics aren't quite up their with other top tier racing sims, but neither is it as bad as some people complain about either.I run a full racing sim rig, direct drive wheel, fancy pedals and all the trimmings, and this game feels great to me. My setup is expensive and big, it's not typical and it elevates racing games beyond being just a game. But I fully understand why casual racers can't get on with this title due to the steep learning curve required to navigate the confusing and massive amount of settings. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project CARS is truly a next generation sim experience.  This game is really something special and an evolution in racing and gaming in general backed by the power of WMD.  Raising the bar to new levels from the [literally] jaw dropping visuals to the high levels tuning and technicalities of the tire simulation.  There's so much to talk about from the dynamic weather that can mimic real world conditions, a deep career with realistic and challenging AI, a complex damage and wear system, to the solid arsenal of cars and tracks made to the highest of standards you really need to see to believe. Developed by racers, for racers, where our opinions and ideas actually made a difference with the outcome of the game.  With that said, is it perfect?  No.  It's not without a few bugs here and there but I can tell you SMS will be supporting it and patching things in well into the future.  The level of detail and high standards shows you just how much they care about it.  If you're a gearhead and/or like racing games I highly recommend getting your hands on this.  A word to the competition: The bar has been raised.  So step your game up!Disclaimer:I was a Team Member (2nd lowest toolpack). I have virtually nothing to gain from the success of this game. I logged nearly 500 hours during the development period simply because I couldn't stop playing it. I advise you to wait for more reviews to start rolling in if you feel my opinion is biased.

												6.8/10Pros:-Race cars that arent home made or modded intot he game!-Tracks that let you go vroom vroom-Its pretty as all can beCons:-The game has a mind of its own on whether it is going to work properly or not (in game)-Pits sometimes work in some ways. This has been 90% fixed with the lastest patches-Cut content and broken promises. The devs of this game made GTR2 and then split to form two seperate dev teams. One team when on to make Race07 and its dlc and kept it very very true to the format of GTR (it doesnt hold your hand, you have to do everything, drive out the garage, hit your speed limiter, drive a safe pace lap yourself, cautions both full and partial, and open for modding) My honest review of the game is that it is a half baked remake of race07/gtr2. Half baked int he sense that they ditched the SIMULATION aspects for the... pretty graphics? You cant even cut down a tire in this game. My honest suggestion is that if you want a hardcore racing sim get the race07 game and all its dlc, it goes on sale often for super cheap. You will get liscenced race cars from all over teh world and tracks as well. And when you want more content just get some mods and be on your merry way in anything you could imagine (ALMS, BlanPain, Le Mans, Rally, ETC)This review doesnt even begin to go into detail on the things that i have bared witness to on their forums... That is a fiasco showing that Mr. Ian Bell is by no means a man i want to give money to based on his mouth and way of cunducting business. I however, have already paid 30$ for this and so i aim to get my moneys worth out of it and struggle through it hoping it gets better with age and time. I ONLY reccomend getting this game if it is on sale for 25$(USD) or less. It is a ""40$ brand new"" title that you see many mid grade developers doing these days. i sincerely hope this game grows on me a bit more though. It has potential in about 5 years when the game's files get torn apart and modded because boy howdy being this pretty.... well the mods that will come in time will be marvelous. Shame that the team didnt allow that from the get go, but they have DLC to sell and well, the way they ""voted"" on whether it was to be allowed or not was reminisent of the old ""3/5th compromise"" as not all votes are equal over there.

												I can thoroughly recommend this game to those with an open mind. Physics wise it's a very complex sim,  not without it's faults, but other sims that people rate have had major physics rewrites, especially  tyre physics. The game is not without faults that much is obvious, the importance of the faults will  vary from one person to the next. I couldn't give a rats hairy crack about multiplayer or league  racing, but that's just me. Others do and for them PCARS falls short and I understand that. But for  me the overall experience is excellent. Graphically it is excellent, the details on the cars and the tracks are at times stunning when  combined with the day/night and weather transitions. On PC only Assetto Corsa comes remotely close and  it falls short compared to PCARS IMO, Kunos have done a stellar job updating the tracks but they are  still sterile compared to PCARS. The car models are excellent in both titles. But it's mainly the  PCARS Day/night and weather transitions that make me slack jawed in wonderment, it's a stunning  looking game. Probably the main reason some luddites call the game Simcade, as they refuse to believe  anything looking this good could be proper Sim as well.Sounds wise it falls short of Raceroom Racing Experience (hereafter referred to as R3E) which is the  best by quite a margin in this genre. But the sounds in PCARS are in the main well done, a few weird  engine notes but overall above average (no Gran Turismo esque ""hoovers"" here!). Ambient noise is well  done IMO, including sheep and cows at Bannochbrae (DLC).FFB is good for me, others don't rate it and that's fair enough it's a complex beast to setup right  and if your not invested in a game then it's daunting to wade through it. Luckily with My CSR  everything felt reasonably good out of the box, yeah I'd like a bit more road sensations but I can  tweak that in when I can be bothered. It's not a million miles away from the other Sims I have  (GSCE/AMS, RF2, R3E and AC) I can feel the front go light when locking up, front goes light in wet  weather when on slicks, I can feel weight transfer. Overall it's decent when it works and nowhere near  as bad as people make out.Physics is fine for me too, I spin when I push too hard and I can feel what the car is up to, I can  sort out handling issues by adjusting the relevant setting and can tame cars that have default setups  not to my liking. Cars are easy to drive under the limit which for some in the community means  ""simcade"", literally EVERY racing driver has stated that cars are in reality easier to drive under the  limit than some games would have us believe. Push the cars up to and over the limit and the cars  behave in a logical and realistic way, there no Ridge Racer or Need For Speed unreal levels of grip  here at all! ADD in the fact that apart from RF2 none of the others even have wet weather simulated at  all!!Career mode is interesting and varied, none of the short pathetic 2 lap races that console racers  start with (I'm looking at you Forza and GT!), but the length can be adjusted if the player wishes.  Most have Practise and qualifying (unlike Asseto Corsa which has a VERY console game like career  mode). Could do with a few more types of cars oustide of GT3, but overall decent enough. Weather  effects and time of day keeps you on your toes, think you know a track well, try it in the early hours  of the morning in low light and in a THUNDERSTORM!! Nerve jangling stuff especially when you see the  lightning! Scripted weather in main career races is puzzling though, strange decision.Yes the game has bugs, changes and omissions, these are all incredibly disapointing for everyone. Some  have logical reasons for why and a few do not. for me these do not detract from the overall. It's a  real shame and I hope that these issues can be solved with PCARS2. No official mod support is a bummer but I have Asseto Corsa, RF2, GSCE/AMS for that, PCARS was never going to support modding  properly, it was always going to be a franchise that gives us sequels rather than the traditional  method of devs and modders supporting a title for many many years. Some really dislike that and fair  enough that's their perogative and they can play the games that follow the traditional methods. SMS  have chosen this path and I believe it fits quite well, even at 45 euros I have more than got my  money's worth out of the game from release. And I'm not counting the multiple hours of enjoyment I got  when testing before release. Despite all that there are unofficial mods coming out so it IS possible, just not as easy as other Sims.I highly recommend this game as a single player value for money at full price. I FULLY recommend it in  a sale. If you're after something articially difficult with low grip then PCARS is not really for you,  if you want a game for modding it's not for you, if all you want is MP league racing it's probably not  for you. Other than that, love cars? Love racing? GET THIS GAME!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Things you should know about Project CARS:- It's a simulator, not NFS Style arcade racing game. Try to play NFS style and you'll get frustrated easily- Don't start the career mode with carts and a Xbox 360 controller. It handles rubbish.- A wheel isn't mandatory neither is a controller, but you'll find it's better to play it with either than a keyboard- Multiplayer is fun, especially with friends. Even more so if they aren't used to sims. Watching them slide all over is hilarious- Looks incredibly pretty and runs pretty well too. - While it doesn't have mods like Assetto Corsa, the 'polish' and the overall quality is much better than AC.Overall, good game.

												The A.I. is honestly some of the worst A.I. I've ever seen.  All A.I. cheats in these racing games, they have to or you would crush them.  The way this game is though, it is 1990's bad.  Here is a list of the things the A.I. can and does do.1.  Ram you because they brake later.2.  Brake later because physics are not applied evenly.3.  When they do ram you, they are a brick and you are a bouncy ball (see evenly applied physics).4.  Go off the track and accelerate past you  because the grass doesn't effect them at all.5.  Drive in the rain on slicks.6.  Drive faster than is allowed by the rolling start rules.  You will literally start slower than they do, so they immediately pass you.7.  Take turns faster than you possibly can, they have the grip of the gods, see evenly applied physics.Honestly this game's A.I. is so horrendously bad I think GT2's was better in the 90's. It's like they cut and pasted this right out of a need for speed game.  Save your money, I wish I could get mine back.  I would much rather be playing Gran Turismo even though its sound quality is awful.  I wish so much that I could get my money back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: It is a racing game, And it runs relatively well on a razer blade while using an Xbox controller in a different state from your main computer.Cons:It was sold as a genre redefining racing simulation using the community to help with creating all of our wildest dreams. Instead we get a half-baked buggy representation of racing (after 6 patches the Career karting will STILL occasionally not count the first lap you take), on top of poorly done physics, and in general just... It's gross.Do yourself a favor and at least get rFactor 1. If not, rFactor 2, assetto corsa, even R3E would be better. I'm partial to IRacing myself, but would still rather people buy any of those other games. (Also they have pretty cool devs.)			",142,12,13,15,8,1,5

												Not finshed game yet.Multiplayer with bad peer to peer games.Which leads to a lot of synchronizing issues.Not able to drive issue in a lot of cases.Wrong player list.Lap counter gets updated late in some cases etc.Beside of all the multiplayer issues there are great graphics and a fine music.Cockpits look very great. Handling is ok, not very much a sim, its some kind of half sim, but could be fun at least if they fix the multiplayer and deliver the dedicated servers.Only one setup is saveable per car and track which is ridiculous if you want to go online racing leagues in future.You cant save a qualy setup and a race setup for different lap races.But i think they will fix this in the future.Tyre temp graphic is wrong in some cars.Server browser is very bad.You cant order by anything.Filter is only for car class, not for exact cars.You cant see where the host is from.you cannot see the server settings in the server browser. How many laps for example, only short and long.No ping times etc.Very very bad.So verdict: I would not recommend this game at the moment if you look for a great racing experience in multiplayer.For me it is a dissapointment right now, but there is some hope it gets better with the upcoming patches. If refund would be possible, i would do it and maybe look again in some month.If you are more the singleplayer gamer, it is quite fun right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can see up there that I have put 8.4 hours into Project Cars. What that doesn't tell you is that all this time (not to mention my 19 posts in the game forum) was spent tweaking parameters and tryng to make the game minimally functional. So far I have been unsuccessful. I have never - never! - joined a single race or even spent a few minutes of practice on the track.Yes, it's a nice game, with beautiful graphics, and it has lots of potential. But, despite the hype, it is far from finished, the interface is quite clumsy and the force feedback issues make it unplayable. If you doubt me, visit the official forum. You will find literally hundreds of pages (one single thread about FFB issues has 141 pages and counting) with people trying to make sense of its obscure FFB parameters and discussing how to make the game work for them. The developers seem to be as bewildered as the users and are of little help, when not outright rude. Project Cars has been launched some two months ago and is already patched to version 1.4, but most problems remain unsolved. Since I am one of those old-fashioned people who believe software products should be sold only when they are fairly functional, instead of being sent out on the world to have their problems sorted out by their buyers (granted, some people actually seem to enjoy that), I give Project Cars a 3/10 at best. I may review my opinion later on when these problems are fixed, but right now, if you want a racing sim that actually works, go for Assetto Corsa.UPDATE: Now I have 13.7 hours into the game. This accounts for a whole afternoon spent trying to make FFB work. I still haven't driven a single lap.UPDATE 2: Patch 2.0 is out, supposedly to fix FFB problems among other things. Now I have 14.4 hours in the game. The difference was the time I spent lauching PCars, finding my pilot floating 5 meters above the ground, verifying it was still unplayable with my wheel (in fact, it got worse) and closing it in frustration. I also have 34 posts in the forum without a single helpful or informative reply from the devs (contrarily to other users, who are trying very earnestly to help each other play the game). I asked Steam for a refund and I am waiting for their reply.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pCars isn't the best sim but it's far from the worst. Even with all the hate it gets, the game is still a ton of fun and brimmed with content that will cater to anyone who loves to race. It feels a lot similar to GTR2 which is a classic so if you ever played that game, then you'll feel right at home with pCars. Pros: +Graphics. Even at low, it looks better than most racing sims out there. I personally love the weather effects.+Plenty of tracks to drive on.+Decent career mode that'll keep you busy for a while. Challenging AI. Cons: -Slightly mad  physics at times. Some cars never feel right even after a lot of tweaking.-Few laser scanned tracks (honestly it isn't that big of a deal to me, only the hardcore sim-mers care about this)-Car selection could've have been better.-Game needs to be restarted everytime a visual setting is changed which is kind of annoying.  Overall rating:  One of the best racers i've played, period.			",121,12,14,9,3,1,3

												Did I really just pay full price for this buggy alpha game?Bloody hell it's s promising and the racing is so good, but the oculus support is a joke, wheel support is a joke. I'm talking silly things like: You spent 5 minutes selecting and calibrating your wheel. Save all of your settings, bu then when you leave and start the game over again, all settings are lost.. COME ON!Oculus is supported, but in extended mode only, no oculus compatible menus, which means just a REALLLY awkward experience startig the race on my PC monitor and then dragging it over to the oculus display, then having to constantly recenter my oculus view (which woops, the key is now unbound becaus eit didnt save your settings!).Also, once in a race, there is no way to access any graphics options, so when a certain option slows down your rig, or is buggy in the oculus, its a pain staking process of exiting the race, toggling 1 setting, starting a race, then exiting again, etc, etc.. COME ON!for years in development, it's very disapointing that obvious stuff like this was missed or just not cared about.			",43,5,2,5,2,0,1

												Initially it looks great. I can get a really good looking FOV in this game. The deeper you go, the more rough edges you run into. The menus and the way they work are a pain, often making things difficult to find, especially deeper options. I always load up this game for a few runs, but in the end something always turns me off and I head back to my other sim racers (Raceroom and Assetto Corsa), which are more focused and refined in their bases, and just offer what feels like a more realistic driving experience. Impressive at first and a good effort, but just too many rough edges to keep me around. Perhaps tries to do or be too much instead of focusing on one area.			",21,3,13,4,9,0,1

Posted: May 27, 2016
												After 140h of playing Project CARS I would like to share my thoughts about this game. First of all let me state that I play with a Geforce GTX980 and a T500 RS + Th8A using the natural transmission type of the individual cars (i.e. clutch + H-shifter / sequential with paddles / sequential with shifter). In addition I mostly stick to the single player career mode with the following settings:- opponent strength of 80%- a session length of 30%- helmet camera- full damageand the following assists enabled:- traction control,- anti-lock brake,- stability control- partially visible racing lineAt the beginning I started to play with all assists off except racing line but found it way too time consuming to get used to the different cars' handling in order to achieve decent results. Even with the above-mentioned assists enabled, most cars are far from having a handling like being on rails. With many cars you always have to take care of not going full throttle in bumpy corners, on curbs or revving too high in low gears. So in essence this is for me by no means a casual game, but a game where you have to be fully awake and be willing to take the full grind of training, qualifying and race. For each event I am in absolute need of the training to get a feeling for the car and the track. With some car beasts or tracks one training session isn't even enough for me.Let's get to the pros and cons:+ excellent graphics, especially the lighting and rain effects+ dynamic weather and time-of-day changes+ many different cars and car classes+ many different tracks with different layouts+ many of the cars and tracks are great fun to drive+ immense feeling of immersion in helmet camera view, especially in the open wheelers+ nice sound+ good FFB (I use Jack Spade's tweaker files)+/- very demanding and time consuming to master the different cars and tracks+/- opponent AI- the available car models in some car classes are very unbalanced in terms of performance- the racing line braking points are quite often misplaced and thus useless- Due to the very strict short cut detection system it can sometimes be quite time consuming to get a valid lap time at all. In addition it is really annoying that you can get a short cut penalty even when the AI pushes you from the track.- The AI is way too quickly back on track once it gets off, while for yourself it can sometimes take ages to get back.- Unbalanced opponent strength: At 80% opponent strength, I often am 1 or 2 seconds faster than the AI while sometimes I am 3 seconds behind. E.g. with the 90's DTM Mercedes on the Nürburgring I don't stand a chance at all, while races with the Lancer in Monza are like a walk in the park.- For my flavour it rains too often in carrer mode. Even when it's currently sunny, if you forget to check the weather forecast for a three lap race, you can get in BIG trouble.- Save game is only stored locally and not in the Steam cloud. Not knowing that in the beginning once cost me about 40h of career progress.- Majority of Community Events requires owning DLCs.- Sporadically I have the suspicion that the driving assist and/or rain tyre selection detection is bugged as the handling can be like on soap.- Annoying menu for graphics and controller settings. You always have to leave the race for changing anything. In addition I can only partially navigate with my wheel buttons through the menu.- No possibility to save the progress within a race. For multi-hour races you can only put the race on pause, but you have to drive from beginning to end.Overall I give Project CARS a 7/10.			",10,5,6,0,4,1,1

												This game has so many things going for it that it pains me to say don't touch it if you intend to invest amy more than a few hours of your gaming life. Every driving game with intentions of hooking you and keeping you coming back for more will allow you to create and save multiple car setups for each car at each track. For any serious driver, continous tuning of  setups for various weather conditions and tyre strategies for example, are  basic requirements. Every racing game form Crammonds F1GP1  back in the early 90's to present day allows you this joy. But not Project Cars! You have some of the best real time weather effects ever seen. You have more setup parameters than any racing game I have seen. BUT, you cannot create and save multiple setups for each car at each track. Its crazy I know but the developers did not include this basic feature that every other developer considers a must. Despite requests to fix this game killing omission none of the many patches to date have addressed this issue. In fact the developers have simply ignored it and refuse to even discuss it on their own forum? Don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												great game in itself but too many issues like FFB settings not saving so have to manually set FFB settings every single time i start the game considering you have to do this for every single car and track anyway only to get into race to be slammed off the track on first corner by idiots who can't figure out what the middle pedal is for.also still no way to kick trolls lurking on the track waiting to take you out.also with latest patch more issues have arrived like random  black screen, getting stuck in pits when race is about to start, also megas issue with steering wheel going dead on entering races.possibility to be a truly great game but nagging issues kill the game for me,  .... but never mind plenty more DLC to buy and more to come which i will pass on.now they announce Project cars 2 ... so looks like they use the business model of making a core game with many bugs and promised content / features missing, the idiots will buy it, make millions in profits and not bother fixing what they released in the first place.RIP Project cars ... i'm going back to iracing.

Nice attempt, but needs workThis game is extremely beautiful. It honestly is probably the best looking game I've ever played. If graphics alone made a game worth playing, this game would be brilliant.Unfortunately, this is about all the game is good for in it's current state. Vehicles respond ""poorly"" if I were to be kind. The game was unplayable when I first launched it because of a glitch in the FFB. I currently can not use FFB at all or the game is unplayable. Online has absolutely zero penalty for smashing into other cars nor is there a way to counteract it. If you were to purchase this game for photo mode or to watch the opening cutscene over and over, this would be a worthwhile purchase, but in it's current state it is BETA at best.UPDATE 5.0 Version: I've been playing since the 1.x version of the game and the controls are STILL incredibly terrible. They've seemingly made no attempts to make it translate more accurately. The FFB issues are STILL present, and you have to use 3rd party mods to make work correctly. Avoid this game like the plague.			",509,95,19,59,35,9,54

												Initially, when the game came out, game was unplayable on day one for me and many others, my situation was computer locking out (freezing) each time i started a race and drove my car for 30 seconds. After a few attempts at trying to solve the situation, i decided to give up and put this game on the wait-list and try again months later.Today (18th August), i decided to try this game again. To my surprise many of the issues i had before are now gone thankfully. Yet, game is still unplayable with random issues occuring from time to time. Did a free lap session as usual to try out the game, figured i would test the game once more for potential issues. First time worked fine, i drove a racecar for a while but i didn't costumize my controls (can't do this ingame), so i quit the free lap session, which ended up in a forced game crash out of nowhere.Now, after messing with the options and controls for a few minutes. I decide to give it a go again, to my surprise (once more), my game glitches out everytime i get in race now. Screen turns dark, i can see the pre-race menu, can't do anything from there. Sound still works, game seems frozen so i'm forced to shut down the application manually.I would give it another try later but i really lost interest in this glitched up mess of a game, i had hopes that the game would run fine now, after a few months of its release, but nope.In other words, don't buy this game yet, it's not worth it. You will likely run into alot of glitches and bugs, if you want to play it that badly, be prepared for anything. I see alot of people complaining in the forums about random issues, you could just end up being one of those people if you so happen to buy this game and give it a try.Now it's time to unistall this game and add it to the pile of games that will never see the light of day again. It's a sad thing really.PS: At the rate they are fixing the game, buy it in a decade or so, perhaps then it will be running smooth with little to no issues.			",760,182,46,98,74,4,141

												The game takes a while to get used to as it is realistic and most of the cars are hard to control. Online is pretty toxic and most people just intentionally hit you and spin you. The career is rewarding and solo is good for testing new cars. This game also requires a controller or steering wheel.Overall I would recommend this game to people that are willing to learn and do not give up when they don't win a race, this is because it takes a while to learn how to handle the cars.

												PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING. As mentioned by another reviewer, there is an enforced deadzone which cannot be removed, even though deadzone settings are set to '0'. I'm not sure whether this affects all wheels, however, it has made this game virtually unplayable in the admittedly very brief 30 minutes I have spent on it. Sadly, even when I overlook this huge issue which makes delicate steering corrections impossible, the cars feel strangely disconnected from my steering inputs, making them behave unpredictably and sadly much like RC cars, rather than than high performance cars they are advertised to simulate. This could be a personal problem, however, having spent far too much time throughout my life on racing games I can honestly say, this is a problem unique to this game. I also own Assetto Corsa, which seems to be Project Cars' main competitor and the cars in that game feel weighted and react accordingly, whereas this game offers absolutely no 'feel' for the cars whatsoever. Extremely disappointed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't recommend this game right now. Maybe after a few patches but not right now. This game is FULL of game breaking bugs. This game could have used another delay and that would have been the smart thing for Slightly Mad Studios to do instead of rushing out this incredibly buggy game. So let me point out just a few bugs that I have been experiencing lately in Project CARS. Can't play single player because my laps don't register so I can be racing until the end of time. When I finish a race in first place, the game will sometimes register it as last place. While racing and being in first place, the game will switch my position from 1st to last or any other position making me lose the race. Playing online is the reason why I bought this game. Big mistake. This game is almost impossible to play online without experiencing bugs. I don't even know where to start. Lobbies are endless pits and sometimes can't start the race. Sometimes I'll be adjusting settings in the lobby and it will start the race while I'm still adjusting settings for the race. Hud display vanishes while racing, can't tell which position I'm in unless I use the cockpit view. Cars hop around the track constantly. Lets say the race is 4 players, the game will make me start at the end of the starting grid even though we are only 4 racers...I can go on forever with these bugs but I have better things to do like play Assetto Corsa.

												I will not recommend this game yet. It is obviously an open beta version. The goal was: Make the best racing game ever!That was a complete failure! Why? They started with a simulation and ended up with an arcade game. It not far away from games like forza. Real SimRacers who are used to RaceRoomExperience, Assetto Corsa, iRacing or rFactor can just smile about the physics. The tyre physics are completely surreal. If you are going over the slip angle and the car starts drifting you can just catch it in a split second. No overheating at all. Just a small mistake! DfuqThe menu is crap. It doesnt work. - Some options you take at the very beginnin cant be found again.- HUD changes are not saved. - Replays are found behind the profile.- You cant see what session is running if you are not on the server and even then its pretty hard to figure out- you cant undo some changes like the car classes without closing and reopening the serverThe sound is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Sry but even if you are not comparing it to r3e which is the game with the best racing sounds on the market atm. Its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. To quite, to noisy, the formula cars are broken.Replay function is broken. If someone left the race before it was finished the one is not at the replay. The complete replay hud is not working. Why should it? No Telemetrydata at the replay, you can only see yourself, its not even possible to have a free cam. The presetups for the cars which should be an all functional standard setup. Are crap. They are made for the console guys with their controller. I can accept that. But the setups are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They broke a lot of rules you never ever do. So some cars are literally undriveable untill you made some better settings.BUT to be fair. The graphics are overhelming. ",150,20,24,27,33,2,16

												Search for issues and bugs before buying. It may not launch until you start it without Steam. It may stop working and throw errors, requiring a new 22 GB download to install again. There's not much support offered, if any.It can feel nice as a racing sim though, and if you have nothing else and miss GT or Forza, it can be an unforgiving - but approachable replacement as long as you're not attached to car customization or selection. What it lacks in outright car selection in the road and touring classes, it makes up for in range of car classes, more like the Pro Race Driver series.If you like big tracks like the Nordschleife... you better have lots of time because you can't start practice/hot lap with warm tires. So that's a good 15-20 minutes just to do a fair run, assuming your car's in mint condition on lap 2.I can't recommend it for its serious rough spots and issues, but it can be a fun and gorgeous game if it actually runs for you.

												One of the greatest racing sims I've played ever!I saw this game back in early devepment and instantly wanted to put my money in. I knew this game had potential because it had the team responsible for the NFS SHift games that I love so thought this could go know wrong and boy was I not. This game has that perfect blend of sim that you want from a game that looks this pretty. With the detail of the vehicles and the tracks you are not expecting an arcady racer, you expecting something more and this game really delivers on that. The feel of the cars are completely believeable and the all the tuning options that they give you effect you vehicle also in a realistic matter, a way that you would expect it to happen.That is what make this game great. You choose one out of the fully detailed vehicle, so then choose from one of the masterfully done tracks and then you go and start driving, tuning and then you take then you join others with the car and the game immersses you to the point where you feel like, the car is your car. That's the great experiance you get out of this game.This game could definitely be more but for it's first iteration, this is definitely a racing game that'll be coming up over the years. Can't wait to see what is done with the next game and hope they are taking in the players good input.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like the game itself, but it is unbelievably frustrating that it looses your save game randomly. I've played it yesterday, turned off my PC, today started it again, loaded up the game, and it welcomed me as a new player. Save game file gone. I am not interested as much in the multiplayer part of the game, so career mode is what in it for me. But I can not enjoy it, because (for the second time) the game decided that my profile has to go. I mean come on. I wouldn't recommend it if you like playing single player, because it isn't worth it in this state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Utterly woeful game. The game has its own force feedback, which is all wrong- which means that cars can be uncontrollable at times and you cannot save a car from spinning- if you get in a spin you will hit something. The AI are rubbish and inconsistent- either slow or really fast but both times they smash you off the track, karts don't drive at all like karts do in the real world, the damage model is too sensitive and there are still too many bugs and glitches to call this game a simulator. The recent update has only made this worse, and the control settings are still idiotic. Overall even GRID Autosport drives better than this game, best off saving your money for something else. This game is a huge disappointment- it has potential, but it seems to have been made quite badly.			",1,0,8,0,1,0,0

												I'm reviewing this as a game for the HTC Vive. I bought the game after the last patch which added SteamVR support, and I've not played it as a normal racing game on a monitor.Initial set-up was painful for me. My advise is to totally unplug the Vive and go through the initial setup of your wheels and pedals on the desktop and make sure they're working. It's also far easier to create a career profile if you can see your keyboard while you're doing it. Also there continues to be an annoying bug in Steam Big Picture/SteamVR Overlay where wheels and pedals are interfering with the controls making it impossible to interact with Steam. To get this game to work I first start SteamVR, then plug in my wheel, then plug in my pedals then, from the desktop, start Project Cars In VR. Then... everything is peachy.As for the game itself: To me it's absolutely marvellous. Seriously. Being able to sit in these cars and karts, to have depth perception of the incoming road, to really feel like I'm there... well I'm finding it a LOT easier to drive than I normally do in these sorts of games. The graphics are pretty much as you'd expect from a Vive game: Resolution isn't great, you can't turn everything up to ULTRA FULL AMAZING without killing your system... but that doesn't matter at all. The cars and karts are detailed and the enviroments are breathtaking, especially with all the different weather and lighting conditions. The immersion is there, ultra quality can come later with better GPUs.There seems to be a great range of tracks, including quite a few I know, some I've never seen before but they've all been great and well modelled so far. Project CARS likes you to do a practice round, then a qualifying round, then the actual race. You can skip these, if you like, but I find that going through all these steps methodically is the best way of learning the tracks and learning the cars. It tells me I should go into the pits and set a 'pit strategy' but I don't care about any of that. Maybe that stuff is good but it's too nerdy for me. I just want the car to be set up right out of the box and so far I don't really have any complaints about the defaults. There seems to be a good selection of cars. Nothing on the scale of Gran Turismo and the 'normal road car' selection is sadly lacking but then the game is really about fast cars and racing so it's understandable. So basically: So far I'm really into this. If you're a Vive owner with a wheel this is absolutely an essential purchase. If you're a Vive owner without a wheel I probably wouldn't recommend it... this game needs a wheel. It really does. Should Vive owners buy a wheel and the game? Well, that's a trickier one. If you've ever owned a wheel in the past and really enjoyed something like Forza or GT on the consoles then this is probably exactly the PC racer you're looking for. My feeling is that if you own a Vive then getting a flight stick and a wheel and enjoying racing sims and elite dangerous is all part of making the most of your stupidly expensive headset so... yeah. Why not? tl;dr: The best racing sim available for the HTC Vive.			",78,23,3,6,14,3,3

												I bought my FIRST EVER racing wheel for this game. And I do not regret the choice ONE BIT. This game gets me sweating, cursing and screaming bloody murder as I cross the finish line. A wonderful game. Got my very first DLC, and now ""Project: CARS 2"" has been announced. This game was brilliant, but I will not support the developers greed, or poor decision making with publisher choice.EDITED AFTER PATCH 6.0:It is currently my favorate racing game, they have fixed many issues (took quite some time, and MANY MANY things are still buggy or broken. Chat boxes pit options and in general PITS) and it is very exciting to play when you can find or host a good group of fellow racers. The developer gets the thumbs down here. I am sure many more PAID DLC packs are coming on the path to Project Cars 2, which will feature many Pcars 1 assets and promises. Just like This game uses many from the ""Need For Speed Shift"" series. Take it or leave it. I wish I had left it, but it can be brillant when its not asking for money, now or later.$85 full price with all DLC, and they are THIS close to releasing the new game. Which of course will require all new DLC as well.Leave it I say.EDITED AFTER FORUMS VISIT:I am astounded by the snarky, and out right disrespectful comments the devolpment team has for critics. I would like the lead developer to leave his ""This is us, not supporting Pcars1 people"" patch comments on Steam. I'm sure the team won't. Here on STEAM they cannot ban or berate at will (Not currently, or ever was a member of the forums)EDIT AFTER PATCH 7.0: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! More bugs, no pit crews, we are seven months later here and they are trying to release another game while this is still very broken. Development team now telling users it is THEIR fault (Told not to run extended races, certain tires, wait for pit to work correctly, not to run timed races, avoid interior views during racing at sunrise or sunset...Wait WHAT?!) More disappointments.			",59,4,7,12,4,0,14

												It's like if Goat Simulator was a racing sim. I cannot advise any stronger that people stay away from it, and don't even consider touching it with a barge pole.- Cars can be launched into the sky for no clear reason- Half the car can begin to levitate, and driving becomes impossible until this ghostly influence stops- AI is a mess, exceeding track limits and causing wreckless collissions every single lap of every single race. Makes career mode pointless.- Setup menu is buggy. Some settings only take effect if you save the setup then quit and reload the session.- The pit menu only opens when you're in your pit box. You sit still with your pit crew doing nothing until you've finished selecting what you want in the menu- Reporting bugs, and asking for help on the official forums will get you banned... Yes. Seriously.PCars is only good as a hotlap sim with these issues. The bugs will ruin your races if you enter anything longer than a short sprint, or if you join a league.The developers have their heads buried in the sand about real problems. The head of SMS (Ian Bell) has had numerous public outbursts, outright insulting people who are genuinely experiencing game breaking bugs. It's a miracle even a handful of bugfixes came out of these people post release.0/10 would not back again. It doesn't matter what kind of racing you're interested in or what your skill level is, this is NOT the right game for you.			",408,43,47,21,45,3,40

												After +100h into career mode, all Gold accolades except for two, only 7 invitational events to unlock, the 4 longest endurance made and lots and lots of seasons the game suddenly crashes and deletes my profile.The game doesn't have Steam Cloud Sync (this game was released in 2015, absurd that it doesn't have cloud security) so I lost everything because the game wanted so.♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ SMS, this is the second time I buy a game from them and I receive utterly garbage (Shift 2 was the first but I thought EA had part of the fault).Don't expect from SMS anything related to post-launch support, they will release the game and move into begging money for another one while saying that features promised for this game will be in the sequel.BTW AI is too agressive, don't get affected by weather, tire wear, penaltys, etc.Shortcuts work bad, they said that it got improved, but feels exactly the same as in Shift 2.Guest in multiplayer are desynced so they can lose a race even if they win for 1s of advantage.Car categories are too limited, most of them with only one car, the game doesn't even have a log of which color pattern you like in your car and you need to select it each time you choose it. It's actually kinda funny since if you are in a multiplayer lobby and want to get your car you have to go to the full car list because the filter put by the host only works for a random pick.Community challenges are way too DLC-attached. There's an achievement (I know is optional but it works as an example) that needs you to play 20 community events, guess what? Without DLC you can't even access 10 per year.TL;DR Don't buy this if you want gameplay, it's only good for the graphics.			",80,9,4,14,5,0,15

												Got AMD card? Then Don't purchase, choppy backgrounds make this uplayable... I have a fairly decent card (HD7990), and need to have pretty much all on LOW settings to achieve a consistent 60fps, but still with stuttery background... Was under the impressiom this was being ""fixed"" which is why I waited... WASTE OF MONEY!!			",22,3,2,2,3,0,0

												Ive not had the best past with project cars and im not sure why. Firstly is that i have a problem getting it to run, im not sure when but it decided it no longer wished to run on either my laptop or my desktop pc's, both are very high spec which is a shame, it will get to first splash screen and then give up on trying and crash to desktop. Afterthat is the actual game and I am basing this on back when i had the ability to play it  in the early summer period. First is the interface, its not great but its serviceable, it works but it could do with a bit of polish.Next is the car selection, i think i like the selection, its not massively extensive but there is nice variation and each class is fleshed out rather nicely. I dont like the fantasy skins though and id prefer it if there was some sort of option to allow the skins to be 4k, maybe a texture pack that one could download but that doesnt seem possible which is a shame. The dlc car content is also nice but i think that the packs are too small and i would have prefered if there were more dlcs that were the size of the japanese pack and judging by the community it seems like they would prefer it to happen as well.Track selection is outstanding, there is a massive number of tracks its truely fantastic but most of them are not laser scanned and i can feel it at times, like something is just missing, maybe ive gotten a little too used to laserscanning, maybe its a placebo im not sure.  Next is the driving, people can go on and on about the physics as to whether they are realistic or not, are they challenging, does assetto corsa have better physics, its a battleground a lot of the time with that debate. Anyways in my opinion the road cars feel way off, they are horrid, i cant even touch them because they just put me off a ton. But race cars are what matter most anyways, they do feel a lot better than the road cars but i still get a faint feeling that the grip just isnt right, maybe that is to do with the feedback that i get or the times where the cars show behaviour which doesnt seem right, its a bit like the uncanny effect that we have to faces where the closer we get the more we notice slight problems, same with this, even without getting extremely technical i find that it just doesnt feel right at times. Graphics: Personally speaking i have an unpopular opinion and that is that pcars doesnt look nice at all in its vanilla presets but thats because i try to search for the immersion factor of reality and the chromey effect that vanilla pcars has is very bad at this thankfully there are mods that can fix this and with those applied the game looks outstanding, the tracks have a great level of detail, the cars for the most part look great bar a few things. Sounds: No, they are just bad, as i said earlier i search for immersion factor. Project cars fails massively here because it does it wrong, they focus on trying to make a car sound good instead of sounding like how it should of which they have failed with a very large majority of cars here. There are common sounds that are copied, they took the sounds and set a preamp of something crazy like +5db and its a crazy distorted mess. I understand that some people like this sort of sound but I personally cannot stand it. I think this is the poorest part of the game. Racing features: They do rather well here, there are a few oddities with the pits where you cant control it and being inside an ai instead of waiting but for the most part the racing ruleset and features are close to class leading and why people say that it had a lot of polish. Online: I didnt race too much online so i cant comment much here. Career/AI: I liked the concept, some people questioned the reasoning behind it  but racers will know,  the euphoria from earning it is what matters, you dont need some carrot dangled in front of you to race sadly this immersion is lost a bit because the AI simply isnt face, i can best them with the default setup easily and im a rather average paced sim racer In the end though ive encountered too many issues with the game such as getting my wheel to register, dialing in ffb being harder then it needed to be granted guides helped a ton with this, AI being problematic in open wheelers and modding something as simple as a skin should be a bit easier to do. Also the minor problem of it not running on either of my rather powerful systems is a shame and I will not recommend something that doesnt work.			",287,101,36,76,28,0,27

												If ever there was a day and night difference between the overhyped scores of 'professional' reviewers on Metacritic, IGN etc and actual user experience then this is the embodiment of this all too common phenomenon. This game should never have been released. I will only scratch the surface of this rotting, vulture-devoured carcass by mentioning the following bugs:- In multiplayer cars can't even exit the garage half the time, forcing you to exit and re-enter lobby. - starting grids often start with a tornado like effect of random cars being dropped sideways on the starting grid almost as if delivered by a sky-dwelling demon. This often results in a penalty being given to the unexpecting exorcist act victim.- open wheelers drive like the chassis is made of limp carrot and the tyres are suspended on sea sponges. Formula A handling is most disastrous.- AI are to put it very kindly inconsistent. To put it bluntly they behave like a rebellious teenager experimenting with recreational drugs. The results are always unexpected.- Finishing positions are sometimes displayed in incorrect order. You might clearly finish 2nd but the results table puts you in top spot. I mean WTF?- I've lost count of the number of times the game has frozen or just shut down entirely.I could continue til the cows come home.The most conceited and enraging thing about all this - Slightly Mad Studios has the nerve to start crowdfunding for development of Project Cars 2. Send a strong message to SMS that their greed and incompetence is unacceptable. You can do that by not buying this game or better still buy it, try it and get your steam refund asap. In most other arenas of commerce this kind of behavior would be bordering on criminal. A defective product sold on the back of glamorous pre release hype is a clever, get-rich-quick scheme plotted by soul-less thieves. Now only absolute morons should contribute to round two of self-inflicted flogging.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm playing this game on my HTC Vive, and I have to say it's one of the best racing game I've ever played.The VR support of all the menus and in-car is the perfect example of how UI/UX should be done in VR. The immersion is just incredible inside the car.Sure it's not a simulation like Assetto Corsa and it has its faults: the tracks are very flat (no bumps) and large, grip is tremendous for every car, braking points can be missed without consequences but the fun is definitely there. The AI is sometimes very stupid and will ram you for no reason, overall it's not a difficult game, but it's aimed to enjoy racing with different cars, reducing frustration of having to learn the tracks by heart and mastering a car.The graphics are gorgeous. Cars are perfectly modeled and the weather is actually the most impressive thing to witness both on cars and on tracks. TLDR:For non-VR:I really recommend this game if you'd like a great and enjoyable racing experience. It's a perfect balance in between Assetto Corsa which is a pure racing simulation, and Need for Speed Shift, or Need for Speed (the latest) which are arcade racing games. Graphics are really above its competitors.For VR: Best racing game at the time of review. Everyting can be done with the Vive on and the immersion is incredible. Definitely a must-buy.

												The user interface is horrifically bad. Loading times are atrocious or infinite. It’s like trying to drive with bungee cords on the controls. First driving game where I have experienced elastic banding of my car in single player. WTF? Bizarre!To adjust a graphics , control or sound setting you have to leave the race and reload the main menu thus returning to the second point above.Unplayable.Very disappointed. Do not buy. Whomever is behind this pile of festering faeces is just a pirate.More than Three million in funding and this is the result.I wonder what cars the devs are driving in the real world ?

												I grew up with Gran Turismo 1 and on, Forza etc, done some real racing in real life (Corvette C5 Z06 at Laguna Seca) and for me the main issue with this game is that, attempting to counter-steer out of an oversteer condition results in you over-correcting, no matter what, and then fighting it left and right and left and right until you spin out. Even completely getting out of the throttle wont prevent this. I've gone in and reduced Steering and Throttle Sensitivity all the way to zero and it still does it. For me this is completely unacceptable. The handling in this game is down-right broken. I am using an XBox 360 controller on the PC. I wish I learned this within the Steam refund policy time-frame. This issue aside, the car roster is completely abysmal. The only car I drove for the few hours or so of owning this game was a McClaren P1. The game also looks nowhere as good as it does in the trailers. This with everything maxed out. It looks very bland. I can't recommend this game at all.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's amazing how much a game can change post release.  I was very excited for the retail release of Project CARS.  With many hundred hours sunk into Gran Turismo, Forza, and more recently Assetto Corsa, I had high expectations, especially after the months of hype lead up.  Additionally, being an experienced real life driver with many fender to fender road races and some rallying under my belt, I feel that I can see these simulations with a grain of salt.  That said, the day one version of this title was not good, mostly due to the control setup / feedback with a steering wheel.  Everything just felt so wrong.  Even though I could sense that there might be a sound physics model under the hood and the pretty face, the inputs felt so nonlinear and highly exaggerated at the extremes.  It made car control incredibly tricky and completely unrealistic.  I immediately went to the forums to look for help and found I was not alone, many other reported similar issues and suggested control tweaks.  I tried many of them with varying levels of success, none of which bringing the game to the level I thought it should be.  I stopped playing after about a week of fiddling.  What a disappointment.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I see the version 4.0 update information, I decided to give it another go.  Am I glad I did, THIS is what the game should have been like on day one.  How it made it out with the controls in the state that it did is completely unbelievable to me, especially with the whole community assisted beta aspect.			",48,12,7,10,3,0,9

												The more I play it, the less I like it. The dynamics are way overdone beyond simulation. Without a wheel, don't bother.Without perfected throttle and steering control, theres absolutely no skid pad or room for mistakes or fun beyond simulated driving in this game. Looks great, sounds great, all the options are amazing, lot's of neat positives in this game and all the cool race trakcs as well. Decent game all around, just dosen''t have the fun handling.

												I  have put a lot of time in to this game as you can see, and yet I still keep coming back to it.I have pretty much all the other racing sims/games in my library and across other formats, but this out of all hits the sweet spot, it has a bit of everything, totally addictive, graphics are good, even on my machine at low-med, sound is ace, and physics of the cars, and feel of tyres and grip, just can't be beaten so far for me, so much so I even purchased on PS4, where surprisingly the pad controls translate better than I thought possible for something as technical as a sim.I can't praise the experience enough, once you have given it a few hours to master, you'll find there is no better representation of vehicular competitionMotorsports simulation at it's best(reminds me, in atmosphere or a new era Toca race series game), and one that is going to evolve, with additions and new features for years to come.I would score this highest out of any of my racing games, a true petrol heads dream, if you are on the fence, dont be, go for it, you won't regret it if you are a true car/motorsports fan, thumbs up			",43,3,25,2,13,0,2

												Theres a good game here, if you can see it through all the bugs. I got the game a month or two after release. I bought it to play multiplayer in private matches with my brothers. So that is the only area I have really given any time to.Unfortuantly even at the time of writing this review, half a year later, the multiplayer is still riddled with game breaking bugs. Silly ones like it always ignoring your qualifying position and falling through the floor. There were plenty more.Its a shame, as I know I would really like the game if it wasn't for the bugs, but the frequency of the bugs are too great. In the last gaming session I had prior to writing this, not one race went by with out some oddity or other happening. Some were quite bad, others were amusing. but all in all it ruined our experience.They have been releasing patches at an OK rate, but still its massively bugged. Single player maybe fine, I don't play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review will be strange to some.  And dont be fooled by my ""hours"" on record.  It's more.  This is just what I accumulated with this install.Project Cars is in mnay ways the driving / racing sim everyone wanted.  Easy to pick up and hard to master.  But...SMS is not delivering what they promised.There were too many day 1 bugs...as if no-one quality checked it.  Then there are the many bugs that persists to this day...with most updates seemingly happily focused on ramming more DLC down our throats.One of the most annoying is how cars can just magically disappear from replay saves.  And dont get me started on the actual replay system.  It is truly horrendous.  And for a long time all of these things could be overlooked simply because the actual racing is so damn awesome.  But no more...not with it becoming clearer by the day that the developer is more concerned with pumping out DLC and planning a big UPDATE in the form of PC2 than they are with fixing a product people paid large amounts of money for.  It has this unethical flavor that just makes everything in my mouth bitter as hell.			",23,3,5,0,7,0,3

												BUT WAIT.... this is the main motto of this game. I am a big motor head when it come to cars and racers. and when i saw this i said yes its finnaly here. But wait. Looks nice, the cars look very pollished and neat. in car looks to be real, idk dont own many of these cars. but it looks good enough for me, but wait the aspec in the car is lacking of any redefinment so your stuck with that postion. the drive is great all the phyics, but wait most cars feel like boxes with no real suspension in them at all, over steer and under steer has never been so big. cant tune it out and that if you know what to tune, no real guide for anything, carrear mode is cool all those division and all open but wait not all the divisions are open and the seasons seem formless race here race their then do it again. by the way you cant select the car you want you get the sponsor's car and the sponsors mean NOTHING not bonus or even diffrent voices in car. I love this Game but wait. it dissapoints but offer so much hope.			",52,3,3,9,11,1,11

												TLDR: Project Bugs - ""The Devs know about the problems, but it will surely be solved in PCars2""My review is based on over 540 hours of multiplayer gameplay. The more you play this game the more bugs you will encounter. First off the cars sounds different online compared to offline, the ""whine"" sound from the gearbox or whatever is not present in multiplayer until the 2nd game in the same lobby and it's a well known bug. This makes some cars sound quite different and in some cases quite dull and boring online. Then comes the steering ratio bug, when I first load into a session and go out of the pits, the steering ratio will always be 900 degrees no matter what car, and requires and Alt-Tab to overcome this(may be my ancient wheel is to blame). Not forgetting to mention changing your steering ratio in setup requires a session rejoin to take effect. Ok then I'm ready to go on with qualifying, or at least try to. You see everyime someone joins the session you get a split second delay (I get about 0.5 sec of screen freeze, some people get up to 3 sec). Imagine driving in Monaco and you get that freeze? into the wall you go, freeze while you're under heavy braking? you WILL overshoot the corner, freeze while turn in? wide you go, freeze while on the straight? you're fine. It's a lottery while trying to do qualifying. Gone are the outlap-hotlap-inlap style, you HAVE to put like 5 laps fuel and go round until you HOPEFULLY get a clean lap.On to the race. Theres a bug where cars spawn on each other, if a car happen to spawn on top of you and lands on you, you WILL get a drive through penalty because your car moved. If anyone decides to jump the start and hit you = drive through penalty for you. If you manage to survive the race start then great. Since my location gives me about 250 ping I'm always delayed at the start and lose places but I don't think this is the game fault, I can't upgrade distance to server. Also I can jump start like 0.5 sec to 1 sec without penalty, or maybe it's because of my ping, or another bug.On to the racing. Cars will STICK to one another on side contact. Once 2 cars touch, they lose all steering capability and will just slide straight off the track or until they come apart. Penalty system is literally useless. There is NO PENALTY FOR RAMMING. Imagine T1 at Monza, someone hits you and you're forced through the chicane at T2, the rammer just continues on because he's still on track, you on the other hand are considered to have ""CUT THE CORNER"" and get a 10 SECOND penalty where you can't accelerate. There is another abuse where you can cut chicanes without penalty and gain massive time in a race. Track limits is also another problem, on some corners 1 wheel on the grass is considered cutting the track but on some other corners you can go all 4 wheels off and hit the wall and yet it is not considered cutting the track, with this technique you can actually gain time on some tracks by 'wallriding' or you can run wide on some corners and gain time(eg. Degner 1 & 2 at Suzuka).Onto car setup. Some settings are just not realistic. On some class like GT3, running 0 camber  is still the best. And then there is the abuse of running 0 radiators & brake ducts. The telemetry for tyre temps is inaccurate for the inside, center and outside of the tyre. Using full negative camber can result in higher outside tyre temps. Also the left front bump stop seem to be the only one that can hit 'red' and not the other 3 bump stop corners. ""Live"" telemetry is not that useful because you have to drive and see telemetry at the same time which is hard. You can download apps for telemetry recording but the problem is suspension is not part of the numbers which you can see, and suspension setup is critical for a race car. You can only have 1 setup per car/track combo, so if you want to have multiple setups you have to manually record and enter it. There is a 'summary screen' in setup where you can screenshot but it doesn't include all the settings you can do on the car so it's kind of pointless.Chat was broken a few patches back and never fixed. You cannot chat in the online lobby, you have to drive out of the pits, park somewhere and chat. Vote kick function doesn't work, only the host can kick. There is a bug where it auto kicks people randomly in the session.Replays are completely broken and never fixed since game launch. Cars parked on the grid, missing cars etc. Saved a replay where you just had an exciting race? or a collision? Go to check it out and see yourself racing against nothing, crash with nothing. Completely useless feature.If you like hot lapping and top the leaderboards you have to abuse the 0 radiators & brake ducts to get the 'perfect' lap. Also since there's not gearbox protection you can downshift like a mad man 6th gear to 2nd gear in a second to maximise engine braking without penalty, and you can off tyre wear so your tyres don't degrade throughout the lap.Having spend some time in the official forum you read about all the problems people have with the game, promised features which will never be in the game, and also all the bugs which will never be fixed. Forum threads questioning the developers on these topics often end in arguments and the thread closed. Some 'top people' will defend the game with their life even though there are so many problem with the game itself. It's like they're blinded by something and don't want to see the issues. I even saw an insta-ban on someone for insulting the game. It seems the common answer to every problem with the game is ""It's a well known bug"", ""The Devs are aware of this"", and the most popular is ""It will be solved in Project Cars 2""Resources spend for fixing the game is less than resources for new DLCs. Makes sense because it is a business after all but if your product is of such low quality then you will lose more people compared to people buying the DLCs.Other stuff you will encounter include:Hitting invisible wall/car while leadingDriver floating without carDriver floating in mid air(Imola chicane)Hitting a landmine(literally car flies & flip) - too bad for youFFB bug where it feels like you have a flat but you don't - requires game restartTotal lost of steering wheel functions - requires game restartScreen freeze but sound still works - requires game restartOpponent car stuck at 45 degree angle, creating smokescreen for everyone behindQualifying 1st only to discover someone beat you with a time of 00:00:0000Cars spawn on other cars/upside down on the grid, or in pitlane during race start""But hey maybe all this will be solved in PCars 2 eh?""Overall I give this game a 5/10 and that's being generous. Only because of the fun racing I have with the friends I met racing online. If you plan to buy this game for serious racing then don't, this is a ""Sim-Cade"". Only buy if there's a massive discount. There are better sims on steam which are cheaper, have better physics, and less bugs.edit* typo			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is all about the professional racing experience. Assetto Corsa and Race07 were my go-to racing sims before Project Cars came out.  I've been in the racing sim genre as long as anyone else and I can say, without a doubt, that I completely enjoy the setup of this game.Don't want to grind out the cash to finally race your dream car? No problem, you don't have to. Every car is available from the start.Tired of being trialed through licenses to race your favorite kind of race? No problem, you can do it all from the start.This game is purely about testing/tuning/practicing.  The racing is just the icing on the top.  The AI are extremely aggressive, but smart.  If you are off the pace, you won't be able to bump your way to the front...because the AI are already planning on getting you out of their way.  It's a culture shock to those who are used to very passive AI systems.The phyiscs, while different than Assetto Corsa and Race07 (and Forza/GT), are not arcady and closer to the previously mentioned games.  Each sim has a different feel and I'm glad to say that this game nails tire physics.  Unlike Codemaster's games, where you can feel the 'rail' that they want you to race (*cough* F1 series), this game allows you total freedom to miss an apex or not. It's however you want (or can) take the turn. Career mode is definitely deep.  And by deep, I mean if you want to succeed on more difficult settings, you have to practice, tune, re-practice, and re-tune.  You start by choosing a class to race in, which is tiered (cart/open wheel, GT, and Prototype - form three linear paths)...all ending with the LMP1 class.  You choose a team to race for and it's only a couple who are interested in hiring you, so expect to learn a car that you didn't expect to learn before.  From there, it's all progression.  You can set just about everything, from race-length, time of day, practice/qualifying sessions, to AI difficulty...all while you've already started your career.On top of that, the DLC package was extremely cheap and came with cars that I find interesting and useful.  Free updates are on the way, but cheap (and quality) DLC like this is rare.Plain and simple, this game was meant for people who dream of living the life of a racecar driver.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still one of the worst racegames to play with a controller. I've played Grand Prix Legends, rFactor and Assetto Corsa with a controller and all of those game handle it a thousand time better than Project Cars. (which released on consoles!) There is something wrong with the response curve of the joysticks in this game, which make every tiny movement in the center of the joystick too aggresive, but big movements to the outside of the joystick too slow. This is the only racegame I've ever played that has this problem and there is just no way to fix this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot of the community whines about the drama with Project Cars, but they have made me happy with CV1 support at launch. They and Live for Speed have been able to keep up with the VR trend and I applaud it.There is a lot to like in Project Cars-CV1 support-Lots of great race cars-Lots of great race tracks-Beautiful graphics-Each car has a unique personalityThe not so good.-Suicidal AI. Prepare to be dive bombed, sideswiped, rear ended, and put into walls. Scarier than actual wheel to wheel road racing.-Pits, pit stops are a bit of a pain to manage, but I'm comparing it to iRacing.-Flags, the flags aren't really happening in a race. You can cheat your way to the top if you wish.-No ghost car during practice. One of my favorite things in Gran Turismo and iRacing is missing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a good sim, try Assetto Corsa or even RaceRoom Racing. Heck, even rFactor2. Project CARS is really good looking, and may work for arcade players who want a console-y feel for their game, but the force feedback is horrible, the cars feel floaty and the AI is so aggressive I can rarely finish a race without they ramming into me.tl;dr: not a bad game, but a bad sim.

												Hello all, In terms of content Project CARS is really nothing to complain about , plenty of tracks, plenty of cars.The weather system is something I would want to see in Assetto Corsa but I know that won't happen I guess.In terms of the sense of speed , that is lacking, it is a bit of a bummer.The feeling of cars or tracks is a bit of the downside of this game. For example I drove the P1 around Spa, the bumps, the curbs were not there in the meaning of I couldn't feel them through the wheel (G27). A little bit inward the curbs you got these little bumps which I could feel. Then we get to the car, the P1 there was no connection to the road, I should've felt something but the only thing I felt was the rear stepping out on various occassions , 1st to 3rd gear in a straight but also in 5th gear through a high speed corner, I mean come on guys you delayed the game soo many times already and yet this happens? 3rd or 2nd gear exiting a corner I can imagine the back stepping out but , 5th gear on quarter to half throttle going more than 160km/h (100mph) is a bit absurd. Yet on some occassions the cars felt good and some occassions the cars felt like boats. My fears before release became clear : Oh dear, Here we go with a yet another simcade game trying to be a simulator, but failing at trying to be one. I heard many players having the same opinion as me, yet I heard players who like it. And these kinds of people I like to categorise in : sim-racers and arcade-racers. I expected Project CARS to have similair car-physics as Assetto Corsa but what I felt was less than that. For arcade-racers to find a new challenge this is a game for you, for sim-racers like me it's a dissappointment.Graphics wise, the cars are sublime , nothing wrong with that, weather-effects the same thing. Tracks could've had some more love in the end.Despite this I nor hate or love the game. Every game has it's flaws , but this games has the flaws where I didn't want it to have them.   5/10 - It was promising but a let down after all the hype around it.---------------------------------New Section : Third day of playingThis is what I noticed over the third day of playing Project CARS.First of all lets start with the animations, I use with my G27 the H-pattern on the cars that have it, Nothing wrong with that? Well the animations of shifting seems first fine from neutral to first all is well, from first to etc. you see the animation going for neutral then being cut off and restarted for the animation to the selected gear which is annoying after a while and for me noticeable at the third day of looking through what is wrong. What is more wrong, is the rain effects on the front and side windows of the car, because if you want to implement rain you need also take notice of the windspeed and the speed of the car, because the flowing air makes the rain drops move in certain directions, as for the rain drops in pCARS they are static pretty much at whatever given speed.Next part about the rain drops involve the windscreen wipers, after the windscreen wipers cleaned an area and they go back in an up right position you see for half a second in light rain or a thunderstorm / heavy rain, that a certain is dry. Rather more than that is the water particles from the wheels as they go through the car model ( only seen in third person camera behind the car ). Further more some cars like the, BMW 1M or RUF RGT-8 do have incorrect engine sounds. So are more cars like that. There a few cars which I find driveable are the Renault Clio Cup car, the Aston Martin Vantage V12 GT3, the Ford Focus RS, the RUF RGT-8 despite the lack of a good engine sound. Trackwise, I drove a few laps around Sakito GP not sure if I said it right (Suzuka, a real track located in Japan) missed some corners, I don't know if this is done on purpose or not, there can be a reason which I or we don't know. Despite this I can find some fun in the game.Now for the online gameplay, it's well done with the lobby's and interfaces.But, the following was a HUGE let down for me, probably for others as well, after a while my steering wheel was no longer recognized and i had to force quit the game and restart the game, one of my friends had to restart his computer to get his wheel working again. After that we could play a nice round on Watkins Glen Short. The score of my rating stays the same, I won't lower it because it is already given.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't mind the reviews, if you have a wheel and can read head over to projectcarsgame.com, check out the forum for tips on setting up the wheel to get the feel you desire. I prefer only feedback on what the steering rack provides, a GOOD pair of head phones comes in extremely handy. The sound in the game brings in the immersion, paying attention to the sounds is key to balancing the car.This is the only sim out there that i keep coming back to, not to mention the only one you can hop in and join an online race at anytime compared to the other games. I own AC, RRRE, The whol SimBin bunch, the immersion from this game just keeps me coming back. There is something about the feel and physics of the game that lends itself to be natural to me. The input and output feels like a car at least the road cars for the most part feel like my car. The EVO behaves like it does for me at AutoX and general track days. I can toss it like i would in real life, granted not as extreme, you know the whol its a game thing :) Can't just restart and have a shiny new car in less than a second...Regardless, you will read a lot of bickering about minor stuff, while i agree about some (safety car, proper flags, custom championships) even without it i get way to much joy out of driving this game. So many cars, so many tracks, so many combinations.At the end of the day, its about what feels best for you. Find a Sim that you agree with most and master it. I can't do AC or RRRE3 because of the wonky tires (instant grip loss on slip and its just like ice after that) and they feel like they are way to canned with the steering, like its guiding me rather than me driving. Meh, to each their own, take this review as you wish, but to me this is an amazing game i just hate the fact i missed the chance to be part of the dev process on Project CARS 2.			",82,8,23,7,5,0,1

												Project Cars is, when all is said and done, a very middle of the road racing game.The physics are okay, the graphics are okay, the sound is on the poor side and the single player experience, despite first impressions, amounts to a very bare bones structure.Physics - Touted as stunningly realistic with ""best in class tyre model"", feel very muted. Even with all assists off it still feels as though all cars have some amount of traction and stability control enabled, the behavior of cars at low speed is weird and in most cars it's impossible to do a burnout as you can in any other simulator.Visually comma it's mostly just an okay looking game, in certain weather conditions and times of day it can look very impressive but it is not the photo realistic tour de force that it has been made out to be in promotional shots and various shill articles from around the internet. Sound, which in the lead up to release was touted as being one of the game's killer features is actually on the poor side. Engines sound clipped and distorted, which can be a cool effect, but in Project Cars sounds tinny and lacking oomph. Cockpit rattles, backfires and tyre squeal are serviceable but nothing exceptional.The AI in single-player is slow, even on the hardest difficulty, any competent racer will find that they don't put up much of a fight. They also have difficulty keeping off each other and it's not uncommon to find them all dog piled on top of each other on corners they find a bit tricky.The games true killer feature is the dynamic weather. Setting the weather to random is great fun and really adds something to the game that the other sims don't have. It's also during rain that the game engine really looks its best with terrific looking pools of water forming on the track and atmospheric lighting, it really makes for an immersive experience.Most troubling is the games current state in terms of stability and features. The game is supposed to have fully animated pit crews, but as of patch 2.0 this is still not in the game and who knows if it's actually going to be added. You also don't need to look very hard to find the plethora of bugs still present in the game, with cars absorbing into each other, flying into the air and falling through the track. The collision physics are also very odd. Touching another car seems to mute your steering, often causing both cars to just carry on off the track, sort of glued to each other. These issues combined with the announcement of Project Cars 2 along with it's funding campaign leaves a bad taste in my mouth.Project Cars is not a bad game, but it feels unfinished and even with the polish it needs, I am not confident it could match the single player experience offered by games like Stock Car Extreme and RaceRoom. If you are someone who enjoys weather effects and cares more about immersion rather than the racing, Project Cars will have something to offer. Otherwise, don't bother.			",768,128,63,67,65,2,134

												[Quick points]=Pro's=- Good graphics, well optimized (AMD Phenom x2 810 2.6ghz, GTX 960 2gb, 4gb Ram)- Excellent netcode- Good selection of cars at launch- Quick and easily joinable multiplayer races- Can add AI to multiplayer races=Con's=- Not a true simulator, more of a Grid-esque semi realistc hybrid.- Car sounds are not very good at all (A V8 in a flat six Porsche 911?)- Very uningaging FFB- Bad sense of speed (when going 160mph, it still looks like your travelling at 50mph)- CPU hungry singleplayer racing with AI- Terrible AI (overly aggressive and no regard for players positioning)While Project Cars is not an actual simulator at all (dissapointing i know), it's still a pretty fun and rather pretty looking game.The FFB is a bit wonky, the cars do feel rather 'floaty' but after my first race, i was rather suprised to see how smoothand well made the netcode was. I've not played a racing game online so lacking in netcode issues since LFS.30 cars on track in a multiplayer race. Not a single lagging car.While this is to be expected, there's been so many new games out in recent times with issue's all over the place. Racing games in general need to have extended work done when it comes to the netcode, and its a breath of fresh air to just be able to jump in and play.I particularly like that you can add AI cars in multiplayer races.It's a feature that should be on all racing games, especially since a lot of sims out there, do actually have good AI, unforunately though, this doesn't.Being a Sim racing nut, I do tend to critique a racing games sound a lot.I've been all over the country visiting various racetracks, watching countless different types of race meetings from Group C cars to BTCC and  the World endurance Championship.In other words, i know how the majority of the cars provided in the games should sounds, and while theres a good 2 or 3 which do a reasonable job, most of them are a bit 1995 in quality and some cars have completely the wrong type of engine sound.TL:DRA solid game worth picking up for a quick race.Theres not a lot of depth, no unlocks to aim for, no customization, but its a great pick up 'n' play racer.Don't expect the next best Racing Sim either, It's not remotely a simulator, but its great for a quick bit of fun and it's simple to play.

												Woot!   I bought Project Cars the day it came out with Vive Support.   It doesn't dissapoint, I'm an old time gamer from the 80's, many many racing games from Atari 8 bit computer, Atari ST, to IBM PCs for the last 20 years.  I even had the Act Labs Steering wheel and gate shifter back in the day.  I kind of lost interest in racing games with a single monitor, but Project Cars with Vive support has changed that.   I feel like a kid again, and racing in VR is glorious, no need for tripple monitors!  Love it! Oh and I'm using a Force GT steering wheel/pedals on a Wheel Stand Pro.  I can set it up in my Living room (VR place) in minutes, race for a hour or so, then pack it up.  Good for wife factor.			",320,62,12,27,34,0,51

												[50 hours in game] Ugh ""Project Cars"" will be known as the biggest racing game flop in history.  EVEN with the limited edition pack you barely get any cars without buying DLC and their mostly European!  I mean sure there are plenty of Fords but how can you flat out ignore the other great manufactures out there?  I'm really surprised project cars has not learned from GT6 that players actually like driving cars from their favorite manufacturer?  Also a real killer is the fact that there is ZERO customization for the cars, you cant even change the paint color which seems essential.  When they say ""we listened to what the players wanted"" they really do not mean that, I cant see a single player actually wanting only 30 (I know i may be off a bit) cars to chose from.  The only pro I have with Project cars is the graphics, which can STILL be horrible it does not matter what monitor or GPU you have, textures will still be tearing everywhere and if your CPU is not top of the line it will still be imposible to play agianst any AI.  Just get GT6 guys or GT7 if their making it (I do realize its a console game but seriously, its better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥and this is coming from a strongly PC oriented player).			",25,3,2,3,7,0,2

												Some games will give you thousands of hours game play satisfaction, action and fun for a fraction of the price of this.  At £39.99  for the initial Game + £40.09 for DLCs  bringing the grand total to £80.08 for a f**king average game I think its safe to say that this game for me is way over priced and certainly not worth the money I paid. I've done more hours on old rfactor and SIMBIN titles for a fraction of the price, with more fun and community content than this game can ever give me and thats whilst already owning this game.  Its a good game, but its definately not worth the £80.08 (Euro 102.84 / $115.88) that you will have to pay for the full game including DLCs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So here we are ..playing the DayZ of racing games.. so much potentioal ..such bed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (over promise and under deliver)All things said ..if you like getting in a car and gong for a rip , maybe with some friends, this game nails it. My friends and I have had a lot of fun just messing around in this game....BUT the fun literaly stops there. At a $60.00 entery point I have to give this game a thumbs down.As far a visuals go this game looks awesome. I run an AMD card and have no trouble at all with this game. Racing in the rain/fog is a lot of fun and looks stunning, the helmet cam is awesome( cheating yourself if you dont use it). The attention to detail for this part of the game is really top notch , project cars in that regards rival's the big boy's ( Gran Tourismo, Asseto Corsa....and so on )Then there's the rest..or rather the lack there of,  hence the odd feeling of being stoked to play a game and at the same time thinking ... I wish I had spent money on F1 2012 or 2013..or Asseto Corsa....or givin it to that homeless guy with the twitchy eye who hangs out behind the Wendy's on Main St. ",38,1,3,5,6,0,3

												This game is more of a dissapointment, than a bad game. The lack of content really bugs me. I will say the game is solid graphics are good. The sound however is terrible, and always glitchty, and that really robs the immerision. The fake social media like menu is another thing that shouldnt be there at all.To keep this short if you enjoy playing from time to time doing hot laps everyonce in a while than this game is for you. But if you are looking for a hardcore sim racing experince i would look elese where like Asseotto Corsa. Even though that game has issues, its in game content and moding comunity is huge and immersive compared to project carsI dont hate this game and i wish there was a mixed button, but i wouldnt recomened it to everyone.

												All style, no substance. It looks nice. It’s clear this was the focus of the developers as every 2nd race takes place at dusk for no other reason than to show off the graphics at the expense of the gameplay.The AI is HORRIBLE. The worst AI I have ever seen. They spend more time off the track than on, and have no clue what to do when your car is near them, they either drive straight into you, or clean off the track to avoid you.The handling is mixed, between “okay” and “terrible”. I’m a sim racer using a wheel. My first race was in a hot hatch that kept losing the back end somehow every time I lifted off the throttle. I spent ages recalibrating, trying driving aids, but couldn’t solve it. That level of simulation would embarrass Sega Rally. Occasionally you find a car that handles okay and you see what this game could have been.The racing is flawed. You can massively cut corners and chicanes, overtaking dozens of cars. The annoying team radio guy tells you the stewards will “pull you off” if it happens again. I haven’t been disqualified, penalised, or pulled off by any stewards while playing this game.

												Very polemic title. Thumbs down inbound.>> Break of recomendation levels on the bottom of the review if you don't want to read it. <<Early in the release of PC I have to say that I didn't looked at it with good eyes. All the polemic involved plus the promisses of a ultimate sim not delivered, and the shaddy community behavior towards helpfull and ocasionaly heavyhanded reviews in the fervorous and niche community as it is racing SIMULATORS.OK, leaving that stuff behind. Let's pretend that shaddy♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't happen.Cool game!Graphics are excelent, but in some areas you can see some glitches and insconsistencies with the advertised screenshots, but overall, amazing!Gameplay:I'm not going to talk about handling or physics on project cars, it's a can of worms.I have no Steering wheel at the moment (for years now :c), so i'm playing with a 360 controller and for adrenaline sake, no assists.Gameplay wise is good if you're into real world kind of racing and not Need For Speed or other generic ones I shall not name. AI is quite insane some times but not as crazy as some users claim to be: HAVE AWARENESS! They are fierce to get positions and the great majority of my crashes with them were my fault (seen the replay)You can do championships as far as I know in career mode and some ppl have a lot of fun there I guess, but I'm the lose races kind of guy atm. Some 15 to 30 minutes races do for me.CARS:The game have a ton of cars and all kinds, not Gran Turismo library size, but the thing here is racing and not looking at 3000+ cars that can handle the same sometimes.No assists play, as I am doing, every car so far feel unique BUT some does not feel realistic with tyre behavior and have some hardcoded stability assists. Some other just don't feel good to drive, those are very few in my experience.Some cars are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing to drive and make up for every other that doesn't feel right.Sounds: The engine sounds are pretty crappy. Extreme digital feel on them and not enough bass on recordings/mixing. Take RaceRoom game for a reference of mindblowing engine sounds.Multiplayer: I've seen a lot of lobbies full of people and making a custom race seems effortless (yet to do soon). Stability on MP info, you should google that or see in other reviews. I have no experience in MP as of now.OVERALL: Very nice racing game on the simulation side. Great track library, missing just some famous tracks here and there (famous: Interlagos, and ovals)I'd recomend this full price if you have nothing else to wait to release or play as race SIMI'd recomend this ON SALE to...anybody, really. Even if you're a Simulation only machine head, this game can give some relaxing arcadey little races here and there and for people who wants some simulation arcadeish yet challenging experience with cool graphics.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS TO: players who are dedicated only to racing simulation and looking for something else other than iRacing in the same level of fidelity. This is not on the same level of fidelity. You will get frustrated.Personal recomendation observation: Get it on sale. The folks who made this game are already making the sequel and all this sequel♥♥♥♥♥♥moneygrab industry is crap. They could just update the game and make current players happy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've been waiting for a racing game for your Vive look no further than Project Cars. Vive support has now officially been added! I wouldn't say this is a 100% sim racer and it's definitely not a arcade racer. It fits comfortably in the middle of those two. The biggest disappointment when it comes to playing this in the Vive is the resolution. It is the first game I've played in VR that it stuck out like a sore thumb. Hopefully the next few generations of Vive improve on this. Happy racing!			",65,26,2,1,10,1,0

												With how the developers of this game seemingly moved on to Project CARS 2 so shortly after this was released (they were crowdsourcing for PCars 2 barely a week after PCars 1 first launched), I feel like that I paid full price to do their beta testing the whole time I played this game. The game remained fairly buggy after numerous patches, and during my time with the game, any criticism on the PCars forums was commonly met with hostility from the game's supporters and occassionally a banhammer.While I like the variety of cars and tracks that Project CARS 1 has to offer, the toxicity of the community and its developers don't give me much hope for PCars 2 whenever that comes to fruition.

												asking for a refund on this gamewhy?- horrible sound, i dont know if it is a bug or something but i tried in various tracks with different cars and the sound of everything else besides the engine is a joke (i never had similar problems in other games).-Yes the game is beautiful, but it has serious problems with frame rates, especially in keeping them, i run the game at high-med settings with frame rates between 30-60fps, it doesn't sound bad, right? well when the game works well yes it is awesome, but i suffer of frame drops and skipped frames all the time, this shows how bad performance is with AMD cards-restarting the game to apply visual settings, this one kills me, we are in 2015! this is not acceptable...With all this performance problems i didnt get much time to drive, but for what i felt this game is not bad at that aspect.Like many people say the game does not look finished, i found 2 bugs in the little time i played and there is not many tracks to choose from and neither are cars (yes you can buy dlcs but at this price the base game is kinda empty)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the moment, Project CARS isn't an absolute failure, but I feel my money could have been more well spent. Short review, TLDR form:EDIT: Changed some words and opinions after re-playing with sufficient sleep. <3Pros:-Amazing car graphics-Finally, a nice-ish damage model-Variable weather-Oh the list of cars is fantastic. Cons:-Physics are varied - overall they need improvement, but some cars more so than others (looking at you, Lykan).-Tracks are not as detailed as some of the game's peers (esp. Nordschelife).-Very little sensitivity and feedback - I don't feel like I'm in control. -Sounds are bad. Definitely needs improvement. At times it's muffled, at times it hurts, and some cars sound off (a C9 should not sound like it revs to 9000...).I suggest SMS and WMD put a hold on the weekly car release thing that they have planned and focus more on fixing the physics and the sounds first. It would make this game more fun than a wrestling match with my Zonda Cinque whose rear wheels have read too much Orwell and want to break free of my control.			",34,7,3,6,2,0,3

												I want to recommend this game because some of the cars feel amazing, the tracks are beautiful, and occasionally you get an amazing online race. The content, however, is lacking.  Career mode(single player) is entirely inconsequential with no unlocks, money, or achievement.  This makes it go stale quickly(for a gran turismo fan like myself).  Where it goes worse is the online races(which are arguably the main reason to get this game).  In Pacific Standard Time there are about 15 - 50 players online at a time spread across multiple lobbies.  Finding a good race takes a lot of time investment, only for a bunch of turn one wrecks by dive bombers and rammers.  It's rare that a race actually goes cleanly and well(though so satisfying when it does).  It's the low player count that hinders it the most.*This being said... I do enjoy how most of the cars feel(especially the Mclaren mp4-12c GT3 car) and have had some EPIC races, but the experience is very inconsistent			",6,6,3,4,3,0,3

												Project Cars is not for everyone. Capable of stunning graphics with the right GPU, it is (and was) very tempting. But the game is loaded with problems. Accuracy of vehicle dynamics and Force Feedback settings has been a major issue, and constantly written about. There are mods for this problem, but I found them of little real use. Personal research and experimentation garnered the best results. Literally, hours of work were put into it. Once the FFB hurdle is cleared, the problem with track accuracy becomes glaring. On several tracks the racing line is off from one track's layout to another (e.g. Snetterton 200 vs. Snetterton 300, especially Turn 4). This makes consistency an even bigger challenge than it already is. One problem with the A.I. that has popped up in a few forums is that A.I. opponents will turn out impossible lap-times over 75% difficulty. Personally, I ran the game all the way to 98% and did not struggle too much. Maybe this is just another manifestation of the Track and Vehicle inaccuracies. Additionally, fine-tuning your preferred graphics performance takes forever, because changing even one setting (e.g. grass detail) demands the game be re-booted before they take effect...and there are 20 settings!ADVICE BEFORE YOU BUY:1. Define what realism means to you. Graphics or accurate dynamics?2. Make sure you LOVE to tinker with Force Feedback and/or mods.3. Perform a self-diagnosis of your patience level.4. Invest in a beefy GPU, a punching bag and a stress ball :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm sure it's going to get better but it still gets my downvote. I advise buying only when on sale (i bought it 66% off) and arming yourself with patience for the first few plays.

												I bought this game when I read the recommendations of this game. Graphic is simply the best I ever saw in racing games, but... Handling of cars is really, really terrible. Overstearing in almost every corner, validating times is some almost impossible think, if you run through the corner and due to really overstearing thing in this game, you just a little miss the outside way of the corner and time is not validated, omg why???? (not talking about inside of the corner, thats understandable when you shorten the corner that the time is not validated). This game is really not worth the money, it is pain to focus all the time and even when you focus, cars behave like nothing real. I have really bad car in my real life, but I can run through any corner in real life at higher speed than in this game and comparing the stearing at low speed has nothing to do with real simulation. I like realism, but not unreal realism, this game could be more fun with arcade stearing exept of trying to make something real.			",12,4,2,0,6,0,6

												This game is just fantastic!I have to say that it's a challenging and very simulative game, very funny to play even with friends. Multiplayer is the best part of the game.It's a very immersive experience on every track it has.Pros:  Very challenging in Multiplayer (if you get the right lobby, no first-corner crashing kids and serious racers)  Nice looking game  Cars are really well-designed  Gameplay is really immersive  Technical aspects are really well-madeCons:  Some strange bugs on the starting grid in multiplayer (rare, but really annoying)  Cars' engine sound is not that good  Singleplayer AI is too easy to beat  Corner cutting can sometimes be wrong  Lack of Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Volkswagen, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ferrari, Subaru and Lancia licenses (personal opinion).I would totally say that this game is a great buy for your Steam library.9/10			",21,3,8,3,3,0,0

												Sadly Project CARS does not live up to its own hype and expectations created when the game was first relaesed.There are still many unfixed issues which the devs and community said would get fixed but didn't. It all looks like a bit of a cash grab from the developers now, they claimed that starting work on pCARS 2 would not affect the continued support of pCARS 1 but that is simply not the case, many 'features' (I would call them requirements) like triple screen support were supposed to be implimented and are all of a sudden going to be in pCARS 2 instead (except this info was only 'shared' on a post within the forum, same as a lot of the ommissions and back tracking the devs have done since release), all while they still churn out monthly paid DLC. The patches are getting smaller and smaller with less fixes which proves they are no longer working on the core of the game, which is still a mess in places.I'm glad I never put money into pCARS 2 as I can see the devs playing the same cash grab scam as the first, promised the world, released it broken, patched it to a beta state, don't mention all the stuff that they are not going to impliment, let time go on so that people who invested good money into it don't feel so sore about it then slowly leak the fact that your not going to deliver what was advertised, nice strategy.This game has some good points about it, there is a big if bland career mode, and the driving model is nice but the lack of ability to save more than 1 set up for a car (seriously this was achievable back in days of the Amiga, it's 2016 FFS), dodgy collision physics, odd wet weather tyre behavour (especially the AI, this has been 'fixed' apparently yet still exists in certain circumstances), no real multi-class racing (hey look we have prototype 1 and 2 and GT3, but were not going to let you race them together because clearly our game engine can't cope with it) which ruins the career progression for me in this regard, very inconsistent AI meaning you never run at the front with the same guys race to race (this is again shocking, Amiga racers had this, c'mon), no custom championships (yes another staple of most early 90's racing games seems impossible in 2016 for SMS) along with a plethora of small niggly little bugs and issues that culminate to make the experience one of frustration rather than fun.My advise, wait to see what pCARS 2 produces, do not buy it on release, read the forums (don't for heaven sake post there, especially with anything less than wishing to suck the balls of the developer or you will probably get banned) and see if they are capable of producing a sim that lives up to even half the hype they surround it in.

												I reviewed this title when it first launched with pretend VR support. Lets fast forward all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that happened inbetween with the constant glitches, bugs and horrible dev responses. Lets look at Official Oculus Rift launch day. This was ment to be an Oculus rift launch title. Well, it is. However, they've completely forgotten about their original backers and earlier adpoters by forcing them to buy the entire game again ($91aud) or buying all of the DLC ($65aud) to get a key to the Oculus version of pCars. The only other options are to stay on 0.8sdk. What kind of options are these? This type of greed is not acceptable to backers or early adopters or anyone for that matter. What about VIVE launch you say? Well that launches early April. With SMS not even making an attempt to respond to this very question countless times, I think it's safe to say VIVE support will be screwed or non existent come launch day. From what I've read, I could only imagine Oculus trying to run 1.3 through STEAM VR to be a horrible experience and resource hungry.Now add these issues ontop of the 12 months worth of issues (some of which are still not fixed) + Ian Bell abusing people with any sort of criticism then banning them.. Or abusing them for reporting bugs, Google it and be amazed at how someone responds to his own backers....and you then ask yourself, will you support SMS with pCars 2? Or any other title? No chance will they ever get a cent off of me. Never. ♥♥♥♥ing. Again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This games engine is just bad, plain and simple. If you plan on using a controller, do not buy this. If you have a wheel setup, bare in mind that this game has overly complicated settings to the point of being annoying as you have to adjust steering ratio for every car. Correcting oversteer is near impossible, and wheel spin will randomly shoot you sideways with no feedback prior.			",89,14,7,3,9,1,6

I play this game casually just to enjoy the sounds of the engines and dem graphics, but if you're looking for a proper sim racing game get Assetto Corsa or rFactor/2 if you want to go a step further with your sim racing experience get iRacing.

												Came from Assetto Corsa, played for a while and got a refund. The career mode seems fine enough, but the actual driving just feels dishonest and too artificial. The physics don't feel reliable, despite being much more accurate than something like Forza. I think what really let me down is that Project Cars just feels like a game whereas Assetto Corsa feels like a simulator. I think it comes down to presentation and driving feel, because the physics in Project Cars seem alright.Tl;dr  -   If you are coming from Assetto Corsa, Project Cars' Career mode is not enough to make it worth while and the physics are not up to par.

												Before you read the rest of this i am going to make a bold statement! BETTER THAN FORZA AND GRAN TURISMO!!! Yes that is an OPINION please don't hunt me down.---------------------------------------- The Review -----------------------------------------If i wrote this review about 8 or 9 months ago, my recommendation to you would be leave this game alone at all costs and save your money! Now however i can say the opposite; throw all your cash at this game (there are no micro-transactions, don't worry.)I bought this game on first release, i had been looking forward to the game hoping that it would be a PC rival to Forza Motorsport. Sadly on release i was disappointed by endless bug, optimisation issues and gruesome GUI screens. You start the game driving Go Karts which is great to teach you the basic mechanics of the game, you then progress upwards onto harder difficulty vehicles with the game occasionally throwing you a cheeky challenge race with some Million Horse-Power monster. The original issue was that after you stopped driving Go Karts and went onto full sized vehicles, the game became dramatically unstable and would leave you with a game just coping at 20FPS (on low settings!!!)I might point out my computer isn't weak it has a GTX 780 which still packs one hell of a punch.Now for the bit you were waiting to read, because you are sat there wondering why this game has a thumbs up and so far all i've done is moan about it.The game is now, on writing this, in version 7. All of the optimsation issues have gone (on Nvidea Cards) and the game handles and soothes every driving style possible.There are a great selection of tracks! From the favourites to the ones you've never heard. Cars i would argue are a bit lacking, this could be due to my current progression level in the game, however on selecting quick race i still don't see many cars.Don't let that put you off though! Although there are limited cars, they do leave you feeling satisfied after a race and don't make you wish you chose another car because it has big flames on the bonnet.The career system seems to have improved also with a far clearier understanding of what you are actually progressing towards.My biggest issue with the game is, the still horrible, GUI. The menu system is like working your way through a maze of horror; left does not mean left all the time and the same for right, before you know it the selection has gone upwards and you are sat there feeling frustrated because it's taken so damn long to click one box. Whoever designed that UI i do hope your on a good training course now cause by god who let you get that through Quality Control.To sum up, the game is now fantastic with its small niggle of GUI horror. The gameplay is smooth, fun and leaves you feeling satisfied that the driving you did was your driving and not a military GPS system guiding you every step of the way (although those options are available, except for the military GPS thing.)

												I love this game, I have logged many, many, many hours in it with my Logitech G27, G930 and Oculus Rift DK2 and I'm so very pleased to see it's available for everyone now.I have seen many comparisons between it and Assetto Corsa and rightly so as they are both Racing Sims and very good ones at that but it irks me a little when I read about how Assetto Corsa is much better as IMHO it's not.Neither game is perfect, no game is but I prefer the car handling in Project Cars, I prefer the Force Feedback in Project Cars, I prefer the Sound in Project Cars, I prefer the DK2 implementation in Project Cars, I prefer the Graphics in Project Cars, I prefer the Joypad control in Assetto Corsa but the launch build of Project cars seems to have evened that out.Overall Project Cars is an amazing game that needs more polish, specifically VR Menu's have to happen for a start. However I only play it in the DK2 so it's definately not a deal breaker.I really like Assetto Corsa, I've had great fun in multiplayer (Which is an absolute disgrace to set up a server and HOST a multiplayer event, Project Cars really does it MUCH better, no messing around with external servers, Router settings, IP forwarding, or whatever other torture Assetto Corsa inflicts.Both of these games are officially released but IMHO Project Cars is the game that feels like it, Assetto Corsa feels really rough around the edges and should have been delayed until it was finished. I did buy the Dream Pack and am happy with it but not so happy that it fragments the multiplayer even more than it already was, you can't join a session if there is even a single car that you don't have in it, rather than just letting you join and not be able to pick that vehicle, how dumb is that?

												I like it. The graphics are sharp looking. The AI seems dumb and a little cheap. This is not GT or Forza. The car selection is smaller and their is no opening up of new cars or adding engine parts to cars. There is a career mode. The Go karts are fun to drive. The game has a ton of camera options. The game does have a lot of tracks. Fun game overall.			",299,147,32,35,36,9,44

												I honestly can't recommend this for ATI owners... The problems that existed at launch still linger, with the game suffering severe framerate issues even with rather conservative settings applied. If I ignore all that, there's something that could be fun hidden beneath - though it requires players to be patient and invested in authenticity over the more immediate action of competitors like Forza. In the end I've come away feeling like this whole 'needing to practice and qualify before a race' thing just isn't for me, and it seems a shame that the game doesn't offer a slightly more streamlined approach to the career mode for players who just want to experience the main events. You can manually skip to the main races, but it hamstrings you, putting you at the back of the grid each time. In the end I just got bored.Perhaps my view has been skewed by the frustration I've felt spending hours fiddling with graphics settings and drivers, and maybe the smoother experience on offer for nvidia players will genuinely lead to more fun, engaging play sessions. Alas, the experience I've had has not been worth the investment (in money  or  time). I only hope Slightly Mad stop blaming AMD for their QA problems and do a better job next time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wish I could recommend this game. There are some moments where it's the best racing game on the market....then you run into one of the lengthy list of bugs/UI quirks/questionable design decisions that plague this game.Their forums are a toxic environment as well. You list the bugs/issues and you either get your posts deleted, comments from backers saying that these issues aren't bugs/dont effect anyone else, or you just get flat out banned without reason.Oh and don't expect the issues to be patched out as they've announced they're already working on the sequel which even though they sold over a million copies of pCars 1, is going to be crowdfunded yet again.

												ENGLISH;I hyped this game like I never did othersI waited this game so long that sometimes I forgot that it will come out one day.I expected a realistic drive.I got a simcade one.I expected a developer who won't spam DLCs from day 1.We already have 8 DLCs after 6 months. They are already surpassed the price of main game combined.I'd recommend this game but I won't.Why?I HATE DLC SPAMS.TÜRKÇE;Oyunu yıllarca bekledik bekledik durduk. Hatta kimi zaman oyunun çıkacağını / yapım aşamasında olduğunu bile unuttuk.Bu oyunu çok destekledim gerek forumlarda gerek arkadaş çevremde. PC platformu için böyle bir oyunun , FORZA ve GT ile yarışması için gerekli olduğunu düşünüyordum. Oyun genel olarak NFS : Shift 3 diyebiliriz. Az daha dayanabilir bir fizik motoru ve oynanış sunuyor.Normal şartlarda oyunu tavsiye ederdim. Çünkü şu anda Assetto Corsa'dan başka rakibi yok. Ancak tavsiye etmememin sebebi kesinlikle indirilebilir içeriklerin çok hızlı ve fazlaca çıkması. 6 ay gibi bir süreç geçmesine rağmen 8 tane paket geldi. Bu paketler tabiki güzel ancak bu kadar yıldır geliştirilmiş bir oyunun içinde bazı ekollerin ve ikon arabaların olmaması bence çok komik bir durum. İşte tam bu noktada bence oyun yapımcısının daha sonra indirilebilir içerik olarak satmayı göze alması yatıyor. Zaten 2015 Mayıs ayında çıkan bir oyunu 2015 Haziran ayında %40-50 indirime çekiyorsun ondan sonra insanları tahrik etmek için ayda birden fazla indirilebilir içerik çıkartıyorsun. Şu anda 8 paketin toplam fiyatı çok rahat bir şekilde oyun fiyatına yetişiyor. Yani bir oyun parasıda ekstradan sahip olmak istediğiniz 3-5 arabaya veriyorsunuz.Oyunu tavsiye etmeme sebebim budur. Yoksa oyunla ilgili ne grafiksel bir sıkıntı , ne optimizasyonsal bir problem veyahut ne de motorsal bir sıkıntı yaşamadım.İndirimdeyse alın ancak onun dışında sakına tam fiyattan satın almayın. Benim gibi araçlardan hoşlanan biriyseniz alamadığınız her paket , her araç size kötü hissiyatlar yaşatacaktır.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												very good racing sim. has best graphics ive seen in a racing game.Good points:1. how realistic the racing i/2. how the rain drops on the windscreen and how over the period the track can get completly wet and changes the whole impact of the race/3. dynamic weather, first it could be nice and sunny, then it can get foggy and rain, then the sun comes out and the track stays wet till it drys out.4. how the cars handle. this is most impressive5. this racer makes you feel like winning the race isnt just important. that finishing out the podium places is an acheivement like it is in real racing.6. the amount of tracks are amazing.7. the career is really worth playing as it offers someting never seen in any over racing game.8. the old stig as your driving instructer.9. saw paul walker in one of my races think thats a nice touch/ 10. how it makes you feel as your really there.Bad points:1. controller feels out of place and i dont recomend this without a steering wheel. but is still fun with a controller if you balence the settings to your liking but still feels slugish.2. the car list isnt too inpressive, but with free cars over time this should improve. hope to see more licences soon. 3. no nissan gtr ;( not even a gt3 gtr or prototype. not one japennesse car maker. and hardley any american. i hope this changes.4. go karting is fun but can become un intresting as the handling not too great.but overall this game is very good. i would score this an 89/100 must buy for a car and racer lover.

+ Very emersive realistic experience+ Visually the game looks amazing with a great amount of detail inside and out of the Cars, dynamic weather, great use of lighting and reflection, etc.  + Many camera views, UI options, and even has VR-Support (which is probably amazing if you have a VR headset)+ The sounds are incredibly life-like. It's especially neat that the way you hear things changes when you go in and out of helmet cam.+ A great variety of cars+ Go Kart Racing which I found extremely fun, especially for casual players+ 8 Tiers / Types of events with different cars to race. + Arrows on the track which help indicate where to go, and when to slow down.~ The game overall tries to be very realistic / simulator-like making the game have a high learning curve especially with the faster cars. - No real sense of reward or sense of progression for winning races. Unlike other racing games you do NOT earn money to save up for new cars or parts. Instead everyone seems to be on an even playing field each and every race with the same type of car, and after you win a few races you get a trophy. - Lacks customization options (paint, logo, etc.)- Going slightly off track, hitting a wall, going backwards, or hitting another player can get you instantly disqualified or your lap time nullified. This can be very annoying during the more challenging events as it can be sometimes hard to stay on track while racing full speed with a jet engine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Disclaimer: this is sort of a Project Cars vs. Assetto Corsa review, for no other reason than I bought both games within a week of eachother and have a clear 'winner' in my mind which I think needs sharing. I had no knowledge of either games before I bought them as I wasn't into racing games all that much prior to the purchase of my racing wheel.)I got my first racing wheel a week or two ago and so I bought Project Cars to test it out. It's not a bad game, but it's not the best game out there. After some debate I decided to give Assetto Corsa a try, to which I was immediately hooked. Why, you might ask?The driving feels much more natural in AC, when you skid off the track you know it was your fault and you know how to avoid making that same mistake. Whereas in PC, sometimes it just feels wrong. You think or know you've probably made an error somewhere during the race, but you just can't put your finger on it. Was it a steering, braking or shifting error? It seems impossible for me to describe this feeling as a beginning sim racer, but the difference is palpable once you race with a force-feedback steering wheel. When you drive a car in AC you are ín the car. In PC, less so. This makes a lot of driving errors you tend to make in PC feel unjust and out of the blue. Supposedly there's a number of reasons why the driving experience in AC is better than the one in PC. I won't get into it now, you can probably google that for yourself. I am no expert on these matters whatsoever. All I can say for now is that AC feels better and therefore is much more immersive, enjoyable and addicting than PC.I must say that PC is more user friendly in the sense that the menu's and career mode are easier to navigate/get into. However, the perpetual event invites you get in the PC career mode annoy the hell out of me. I just want to progress with karts. Now I know you can start whereever you want in the career mode and figure things out from there. But where's the fun in a career mode where you can skip 90% of the levels? Granted, maybe I just don't 'get it'.Supposedly the AI in PC is smarter than the AI in AC. I find this to be true. However, this doesn't mean the AI in AC is completely daft. They just feel a bit more like an AI: a bit more rocky and predictable at times. It's not something that puts me off all that much. This is mostly due to the fact that you are so immersed in your driving that you aren't bothered by details like that. Whereas in PC I would get annoyed with the slightest AI error because I was already having unnecesarry trouble getting used to the car I was driving.The only real major positive PC has (over AC) are the graphics and especially the sounds. They are absolutely excellent. All of this leads to the conclusion that PC is shiny. It's an O.K. game. A game you could buy when it's on sale, to see whether it floats your boat without it costing you too much in the financial department. More fun with a steering wheel? Definitely, but at times it's infuriating because of its flaws. AC is a game that you MUST buy if you have a racing wheel, because right now it is the best racing simulation game on steam.If you have the money, buy AC first. If that doesn't win you over, possibly due to the fact that it is less user friendly (marginally so in my opinion, but still), give PC a try. Maybe the slick design and amazing sound and graphics of PC will win you over if AC doesn't. I must admit that AC is priced rather steeply compared to PC due to the DLC packs. On sale AC+dlc was about 41EUR, compared to about 18EUR for PC+dlc which I purchased through a third party.			",68,4,9,10,7,0,8

												This is maybe my new FAVORITE RACING SIM. (Aside from Gran Turismo being my favorite Sim series) I use Project cars for Time Trials, Curcuits, Sprints, and Endurance Races. Project Cars has the biggest track selection i've ever seen in a racing game/sim. When setting up a race, you are able to edit and adjust numerous setting and features for that race. Time and Weather can both be set at a fixed position or can be set to have multiple different weather and time changes that occure during the race. EX: You can have the race start during the day and end when its night time, as well as having a rain storm swoop over the track for a specific amount of time. The combinations are endless.Each car can be tuned individually, as well as your STEERING WHEEL SETTINGS! Thats right, you can apply different force-feedback settings for each vehicle.Ai is another story, for the most part the Ai is fantastic and always races with a mix of lenience and aggression. Some Ai will drive as if they struggle with the track, struggle with the car, or just flat out suck♥♥♥♥♥at driving in general, and other Ai can be as agressive as kid on Forza trying to ruin your tandem drift. Thus meaning they are very well at keeping their racing line and following it, they not afraid to slip by if you give them too much room, and near the end of a race they might try to make some last resort moves in order to take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. *Im gonna give a detailed example of one gripe I have about the Ai:- When overtaking someone on either the outside or inside, you would know to respect eachothers racing line and try to keep it as clean as possible. Well I had an incedent where I was doing a 30 Lap race at Bathurst and I was in 3rd, about to take 2nd. We both we coming up into a left hand corner and I happened to take the inside line, but he was at my same pace yet on the outside line. I went to turn into the corner, keeping my side of the lane, and then out of nowhere instead of the Ai keeping his outside line to make the corner clean, he just turns into the inside like a freight train and takes us both out. In the real world this wouldn't have happened, but what can you do its a game/sim anyways. Thats really my only gripe about it, yet it only happens every so often. And not to only me, Ai will do this to other Ai and create collisions and pile ups.On the other hand, Project Cars is still a must buy!!			",54,2,21,1,12,0,0

												I was so excited for this game but I am disappointed by Steam and Project Cars. Experienced the game crashing after completing events and a multitude of bugs and issues. The career mode is buggy. I signed to a kart racing team but I end up racing Porches and forced only to race certain events? Even starting a career involved me leaving the game and tracking down a message board to find the steps to even begin the career mode. Multiplayer is full of children to just want to drag race each other or crash me out. The servers are almost all empty except for the children messing around. I was promised a real racing game and ended up with a buggy game I dont want to play. I tried for a refund but since I was passed the 2 hour limit (way too short to find bugs and issues with multiplayer, come the f@#ck on). I understand it was my job to know the limits of the refund policy. So.. Im stuck with a game I dont want to play and a lesson learned from Steam (vote with your dollars and choose a better platform). It will be a very long time before I come back to buy another game from this publisher and steam.			",23,0,1,1,4,0,0

												Bought this game while it was on sale for $30 to try it out and ended up refunding it.This game has the potential to be a great game but there are so many areas that need improvement. For starters, everything you hear about the AI being terrible is true. They drive as if you car is not there. Overtake someone going into a corner? Be prepared to get launched into space at corner exit by an AI. In addition, the crash physics are ridiculous. One little tap and off you go flying into the barrier. Lastly, there are graphical glitches that make the cockpit cam of some cars almost unusable. The car selection is also lacking considering the wide variety offered by other racing games on the market. At the end of the day, Project Cars has a lot of potential but unless the game becomes polished and the AI fixed, it simply isn't worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Short Review At bottom !Project CARS Is a intriguing Racer! Having Had it from Launch I Have encountered many Problems, At first the audio was horrible on all cars and the menu music didn't fit (Opera).The handiling of the cars was next and this was a crucial test because a bad handling system for a racing game isn't really a racing game. Lots of the cars are very twitchy and uncontrollable but others handle lovely and make a nice racing game (GT3,Formula A) just some of my favourites. When I first had it there wasn't much going for it that made me like the game besides stunning graphics. After a few patches and trying the game with a G25 wheel,I've Grown more than fond to it but I now love the game! There are still some game braking bugs but most of those are online.The Cars handiling Grows on you as you get used to it.TheTrack list is decent with many variations and variety from Racetracks to A-B Roads.The Audio has had some fixes and some of the cars sound a bit better but are still a little bit ""tinny"" And the Menu music is still opera.The Graphics are stunning with Rain decreasing FPS but the map looking lovely!  Bugs and a few game designs bring it down sadly,Sticking every style racing game in one doesn't work like it should.The game has many hours of fun to be played with a long career and many hours of fun online! there's much to do and many cars and tracks giving the game a good variation.With PCARS 2 on the way I hope it fixes and solves the issues PCARS has.A Great All round racer I recommend To Anyone who likes racing, hardcore or the casual! 90/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Guided, tested, and approved by a passionate community of WMD members and real-life drivers who are paid to say good things, Project CARS represents the next-generation of racing simulation as the ultimate combination of WMD fan boys and developer arrogance/rudeness.Discover an unrivaled immersion fuelled by above average graphics and simcade handling that allows you to truly not feel the road. Create a driver which is your name pulled off steam, pick from a huge variety of motorsports in a simplistic career mode and write your own tale in empty or crash-fest online multiplayer.Featuring the largest track roster of any recent racing game giving quantity over quality with a scripted time of day & weather system, buggy tuning & pit stop functionality with terrible UI, and no support for 3 screens or current version of Oculus Rift, Project CARS trails the competition in their dust.

												I can't recommend this anymore, it just became far too frustrating to enjoy thoroughly. You'll basically spend most of your time resetting events because the AI drivers are more skilled at demolition derbys.I really wanted this game to get better. More variations in classes and performance tuning would be key. Knowing that's not likely to happen just scraps all reason to continue playing as the progression is pointless. Why bother when you get the same thrills from a non-career race such as practice or quick race?The game does have its high points in sound and visual presentation, the enjoyment is just a little dry.

												Cars do not react the way you expect them with controller or keyboard (don’t know about wheel, I haven’t got one) once you start turning it won’t stop unless you turn the other way, and then it sometimes does not do it so you never know how to handle the car during a corner. Also if you hit some dirt with can drag your car all the way into it with extreme force, even if you use full steering locking in the other dircetion. And finally if you hit a bump at high speed you seem to go flying even though aerodynamics (especially with the high end cars) should hold you to the ground. Other than that I think they have got something going here just needs these things sort especially the dirt problem then I would recommend this to others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even after Patch 5.0 it is unfinished. Carreer mode is dull. The AI is extremely bad - even after 5 patches they just ram people off. And once you are in front they cant keep a good speed even at maximum difficulty. Game looks good. But that is not a reason to give it a positive review. The tires still heat unnormally because they are not simulated. They do an overhaul now, but when you promise realistic tires then you better not only come up with that in patch 6.0.

												Unless you belong to a group of elitist pc racers good luck finding a race. Most races are password protected and the ones that are not have like three poeple in them. Not to mention there is NO PROGRESSION in this game at all. It was really really boring for me to see all cars unlocked from the start. Everyone literally races the same car every single time. Look the game w as released a few months ago and is already 40% off. Whats that tell ya lmfao.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like i said nice graphics but in no way is this a simulation, even stock car extreme is better then this and thats a small brazilian company.

												This game is broken, deeply broken and I do not think it will be fixed. There are issues from menu bugs all the way to physics bugs that make this almost unplayable. Issues like rain tires being faster on a dry track than dry tires, or issues where the setup menu offers a certain compound of tire and then the pitstop menu simply has, ""Hard, Medium and Soft."" There are also some very odd psychic behaviors especially with the cars over bumps. Some of the cars are undriveable, look up the McLaren F1. Unfortunately it took me several hours of gameplay, frustration and then googling to realize that it wasn’t me, it wasn’t the learning curve, simply the game is bad. The studio has said it’s reached, “the end of development” with this title, but they clearly never begun. It’s embarrassing, it’s worse than a Beta version and it’s pathetic it’s being allowed for sales.Bottom Line:I was very excited about this game, totally sold on the hype and I feel ripped off. Thankfully I bought it on sale, but don't make the same mistake I did, stay away! Unfortunately, by the time I realized just how horrible this game was, I was well past the number of play hours allowed by Steam and was refused a refund. I still want my money back!

												THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER... As a player of forza 2 3 and 4 and also Gran Turismo 1 2 3 and 4 I can tell you that this is the WORST out of any racing game I have ever played. Bought this off of♥♥♥♥♥for $30 and even at that price i feel scammed. PROS- Well... um... There's lots of tracks and cars i guess.CONS- Physics are terrible, clip the curb of an apex and the next thing you know your kissing a wall. The grass spins you out way to much. Driving a stock Renault Clio turns into driving a Formula drift car over ice covered in butter.- Graphics are WAY to beefy. People are saying this game sucks because its optimized for NVIDIA graphics cards, I have a NVIDIA graphics card, and a decent computer, but running this game on all of the lowest settings is a challenge.- The GUI and menus DO NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT CONTROLLERS. I'm using an Xbox controller but in most menus you have to use the keyboard or mouse to use, which is a hastle for me because i like to sit far away when playing racing games.- All of the cars are too clutchy, a little flick of the joystick sends you into a 180, and there's no way to fix the sensitivity.- Tapping the brakes DOESN'T WORK, you either give it the beans our come to a complete stop. If you tap the brakes you get an EASY spinout which will cost you the race.- Penalties. Get bumped off the track in qualifying because of one or all of the control issues in this game? Good news! Your next 2 lap times dont count! took me 15 minutes to quallify 4th to last. - Go Karts. Are they really necessary? The brakes are so sensitive that even a little bit of braking stops t he kart immediately. Plus they unreallistically rev really slowly after stopping, so every time you use the brakes, you're looking at a good half second off your time.I haven't even gotten to use the multiplayer because this game is si bad in single player. Too bad you can't get your money back. ",20,3,3,3,3,0,2

												Hmm.  What a mixed bag this is.  As far as physics go: this is not the best simulation.  It's ok, sort of a Forza style representation.  Slip angles are extremely forgiving. Slides are quite eaily recoverable.  Understeer is more prominent than oversteer, though both are fairly minimal.Force feedback with a wheel: lacking.  Even if you spend hours and hours tuning and tweaking the force feedback (which you WILL), you won't get as immersive an experience as rFactor 2, iRacing or Assetto Corsa.  It feels numb, lacking in representative feel relating to what you see on screen, and sterilized.  There's also an extremely heavy centering spring that you'll have to spend lots of time tweaking to get where you want, but it still won't be great. This is my biggest dissapointment with the game.Graphics: These are pleasing, but they aren't as amazing as they're made out to be.  On par or slightly ahead of Assetto Corsa is my best description.  There's tons out there on the graphics in this game.  Tone you hype back a notch or two and that'll get you a relatively good expectation level for the reality of them.Audio: Nothing particularly stands out.  It's sufficient.Gameplay: The career mode is underwhelming. I enjoy that its all about the racing, but I find it lacking depth via no differences between the teams you sign for and an obfuscated progression between series.  IE: There's no real clear goals to achieve in order to attract a team from a particular series you want to progress to.  There's some big and obvious flaws there I'm extremely surprised the developers didn't seem to notice.  The one thing they get right is track and car selection.  It's very diverse and populated.  Easily PCars' best attribute.Other: The UI is annoying.  It's pretty but when it comes to using it, there are many places of frustration.  For example, only being able to change FFB settings in the main menu options.  So you have this thing that takes a ton of initial setup work (yes, even after the updates), and the only way to change the (many many, too many really) settings is through the main menu. Yet, the only way you can test those changes is in game.  So the end result is the user spends hours and hours tweaking in the main menu, booting up a session, quitting the session to get to the main menu, changing things in main menu, booting up a session, etc, etc.  It's one of the dumbest things in the game without a doubt.  Choosing a car skin is similarly annoying as well.Overall, the game is a struggle.  That's the best way to describe it.  It has a, on the surface, career type I want.  However it doesn't excecute it well.  The physics are *ok* but not very good and definitely not up to par wih its competition.  The force feedback is a quagmire of disappointment.  The visuals are nice but not nearly as pretty as advertised or hyped up to be.  And there are a myriad of annoyances throughout the experience from UI design to choosing a car skin.  The one and major saving grace for this game is its extensive car and track list. I won't go over the PCars 2 drama and what that may or may not entail.  Nor will I go over the development drama of this game. However, as an owner of this game, I really hope Slightly Mad Studios keeps working on this title.  It still has potential, but at this point is more of a Beta release than anything.			",83,15,24,8,6,1,10

												It's not a bad game, it runs superbly well on my machine. 4th gen i7 @4.2ghz, 16gb RAM and a GTX970. The AI is irriating, stupid and unrealistic. Online works well if you have some friends that drive properly, most lobbys have at least 2 fools who think it's fun to play dodgems. Graphically the game is lovely, love the fact you can have 40+ multiclass cars on the track. The sounds of the cars is not bad at all, engine notes are captured very well but tyre noises aren't that realistic at least from experience of being in the drivers seat. The single player career mode is a nice idea but annoying you can't skip the races you aren't interested in unless you start higher up the ladder but then you miss out of some of he earlier fun ones.I love driving/racing games but somehow I just can't get into this one, and I can't really explain why.

												I have played Grand Tursimo, Project Gotham, Grid Series and various NFS games (With a racing wheel). And my first expirence past the Go Karts. I turn off all driving assisstances in the game including ABS and traction control systems.I spun out alot in some car no faster than my actual car. You cant just drift around corners you'll spin out, it is a very unforgiving game you have to work to learn the corners (which gear, how much throttle, braking, steering angle, driving line). Too much throttle after a corner, spin out. Brake too hard especially in a rear wheel drive, spin out. Raining and you try to floor it off the line, spin out.  Even a poor gear change can cost you 2 positions easily. I literally sweat trying to hold poll position. I love having to work on it. Critizing myself on how i performed each corner.There is a no BS game, you dont have to earn money to unlock a car. All tracks and cars are avialable from the start. You dont spend an hour putting decals on your car, you'll spend 1 hour tuning your car to fit your driving style on a specific track. The gratification in this game comes from mastering a track, not from earn 1mil to unlock a car. Getting hyped you knocked off 1 second from your lap time. It really is a racing game for racing enthuesists. The game is literally about racing nothing else. I get people like and are used to unlocking cars, tracks, decaling their cars and a feeling of progressing through a story. If so this is not the game for you. Its about mastering your favourite cars on the track. P.S - Have not expirenced any bugs/crashes  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Assetto, iRacing, Raceroom, Forza, Gran Turismo, Dirt, I play them all and others, yep, they are all good games but this is something else, and it will only improve as subsequent patches roll out. Maybe I was blessed with a special platinum edition of the game or something but I fail to see where all the negative crap I keep hearing comes from.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first got the game I was quite excited.  You see, I bought into the hype.  Mistake number one.  Mistake number two was spending money on this.One minute it is Ok, the next it is horrendous.  One car sticks to the road like it's glued on, and the next, a pure race car is like driving on some kind of super slick polymer.  Almost all cars feel utterly disconected from the track.  Random sounds thrown in to simulate what, I don't really know.  Gave it a go and tried playing career, but when you have rain tires on in the rain and the slightest input of any kind and your car is off the track or into the wall or going backwards.  All the while the AI is driving around as if it were on slicks in dry conditions.Had one point where in the dry I actually had the fastest lap time until the last three seconds of practice when BOOM, an AI driver beat me by a mere twenty six seconds putting me at number two.What a joke these guys played on the consumer.  Next go around they will not get my money.  I will give it to Polyphony Digital.  Grand Turismo may be a little numb on occasion, and they may still have AI issues next time around, but at least it is not one big, unfinished, riddled with bugs, lie to the consumer.  The saddest part about games like this is that the people that make them are utterly shameless about putting out trash.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great simulator. My first run was with the Mustang Boss 302R at Brands Hatch. It didn't feel right, kind of floaty... then I dug into the MANY MANY options, and found just the right tuning setup for me and the way I drive.  Granted, I still feel like I need some practice, but that's just awesome.  The graphics are good, in some ways better than anything else out there, in other ways the additional realism makes it feel a little flat.  (Sometimes in game development, a little oversaturation in colors makes the game more engaging, making it feel more real somehow compared to photographic perfection.  It's all a perceptual thing.)  On the whole, so far, I'm very, very impressed.  The number of choices and options is just staggering.  The only real flaw is some of the options have nice descriptions in the center pane when you select them, but then there's other areas (like controller settings) that offer no advice or documentation whatsoever.  I hope they'll polish that up a bit.  But again, really great sim.  Another thing I will miss from Grid Autosport is earning cash to buy new cars, and getting sponsors to get more cash... I found that personally very engaging, and that's missing from Project CARS.  However, it's absolutely not a deal breaker, just a personal preference that I'll miss.			",65,1,8,5,7,0,1

												well i have to say this game has quite good graphics but the problem is that the car choices is too few,have you ever seen a racing game with no lambo and ferrari?and also the damage system is so unrealistic the glasses can be scratched but it cant be broken .There is alot of bugs , i crashed ,the following car crashed into my car , it said i hit opponent and disqualified me.....

												Meh. I got it on sale and despite being pretty, the driving dynamics are just passable. I've seen more realistic tuning and driving in both Forza and Gran Turismo...further proving that good racing games are hard to come by on PC. Bots aren't as dim-witted as most reviews say they are. They're pretty dumb granted, but they don't try and wreck you outright. Just hard to avoid.Lacks content compared to its competitors...it's the compromise nobody asked for, or needs.

												Heres how this goes...Been playing racing games since F1 96 on the psx, completed all the greats, toca 1 + 2, Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4...Moved to PC gaming, got into SIMBIN's Race07 heavily in 2012, did well in an online WTCC league, Race07 was always noted for the touring cars being 90%+ accurate to real life.Discovered Raceroom Racing Experience, have got into that in a big way in last couple of months and spent a fair bit of money and time on it, shame its not that well optimized cause the sound is beautiful.For over a year ive been waiting for the moment I had some spare cash laying around to buy Assetto Corsa, and this week I did......... I got my wheel working and tried so desperately to like it, but being used to stripped out ready to race race cars i guess the ROAD CAR physics wernt my scene, I managed to get a refund from STEAM and thought bugger it.... Ile try out Project Cars......Cautiosly however, i downloaded a cracked version first, OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im literally addicted!As soon as my refund went back in my back i was more than happy to lay out £40 for what could possibly be, the greatest piece of software released in a long time.As ive said ive played all the big racers (even had a go on Forza6 the other day, sorry but anyone claiming that to be a sim is clearly deluded... it just isnt)Project Cars however, is a great sim! The sound cant touch R3E (nothing can frankly) and at times i find loosing the back end a little be too forgiving, and like R3E drifting isnt really built into the physics like it is on Assetto...... but i guess thats the real point.Some Sims Simulator road cars, others simulate Race Cars.... no sim does both very well.If you want to race, Project Cars is the real deal (seriously its nearly perfect)If you want to hot lap like the Stig or Jeremy Clarkson in Ferraris then Assetto Corsa may be your thing. Theres a vid on youtube proving how bad assetto is at simming race cars, an old lotus f1 car doing nord in 5:20, then same car in project cars doing it in 6:14 .... nuff said.I love this game, and sense my laptop's GPU will die before i get bored of it.Thats another point....... the eye candy!!!! I have it looking like NGEN GFX on an ASUS N56... and its very smooth, very well optimized!!!<3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is no other sim at the moment that gives me the same sense of speed and excitement that Project CARS currently delivers.It may take most people a little time to get their controller configured the way they like, but after that the racing is a pure joy.It has a different feel to it than iRacing, and AC, but that is not meant as a negative.I have all the major racing games, and recommend Project CARS to any gamer who likes a fast paced experience. Online action is great too.			",22,0,23,4,0,0,1

												Not for everyone. Explaining project cars is not too easy. Lets put it this way. If Need for Speed is a fastfood hamburger, then Forza is Pasta dish at an eatery and Project Cars is Savory seafood dish at a well known restaurant. Like food, you have to have a distinguished taste to like this game. It may seem subtle at first, but this game is insanely DEEP. It's worthy of a simulation. Many people say ""Physics this, and physics that"".. but I wouldn't pay too much attention to that talk. Seriously? How many of you have actually driven a GT3 down Silverstone going 80mph around a tight corner? You don't know that kind of physics unless you do that for a living. The physics have been designed in this game in a way where it takes some learning, but the good thing about this is it's VERY rewarding learning how to properly drive fast. I honestly wouldn't buy this game without a wheel. Gamepad is horribly difficult. The wheel, despite force feeedback issues, feels very natural and easy to learn. In conclusion, it's a fantastic game if you give it some patience. Highly recommended for car buffs			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project Cars is an arcade racing game. It is not a simulation as some would want to make you believe. The AI is unaffected by rain, too many races suddenly change from sun to rain to the point where it is not realistic. It is good as an introduction into racing, but I have discovered there are actually better alternatives (rF, rF2, GSCE, AMS, R3). The game is still full of bugs, the main one for me being the fact that the order at the end of race is incorrect. It calculates lapped cars wrong, resulting in the last unlapped car being put at the end of the finish grid, while actually it should be in front of all lapped cars. It's astonishing that this never got fixed!!! The ai have better lap times in practice than in qualification, wtf? Some cars feel like skating on ice. Ok, I have never driven a real race car before, but it seems highly unlike to be so slippery in real life (especially after heating up the tires). One of the few ways to try to counter this was to deflate the tires enough, to try to improve the grip to a more reasonable setting (which does have the side effect of heating up your tires too quick). It's better to invest your money in Automobilista or their upcoming successor (at this moment referred to as Reiza 2017). You will have a better racing experience and far better ai, plus the added bonus that they listen to the community and try hard to kick out bugs & improve their sims.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What's to say about Project Cars? I honestly can't put my finger on it. It claims to be a sim but it sure doesn't feel like that to me. Driving physics feel ""wrong"" after playing Assetto Corsa for well over 200 hours with a G25 and TH8R shifter. The cars I've driven so far feel clunky, even when the settings are set to realism. There is no sense of speed when you go over the track at 250 km/h and still feel as if you're going 100 km/h.   The list of cars is also a bit disappointing. There is, however, a huge list of tracks, featuring some of my favorite like Spa, Nordschleife and BRNO. Project Cars isn't a bad game but the physics and the way the cars handle still make it feel rather arcade than a sim. Do I recommend this game? I'd say no, not if you want a full bred race simulator.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok where to start with Project CARS...Graphics 10 out 10. Game is effin pretty; beyond any other racer currently out. The Weather and lighting is some of the best I've seen in any game to date.I'm using two very old 550ti 1 gig cards and Project CARS seems to perform fairly well on those. I'm able to run at 1080p with all settings maxed except for MSAA, AA and or FXAA. I run FXAA at low and sometimes I opt to run at 1600x900 with FXAA cranked all the way up. The thing is even at 1600x900 Project CARS is still a very pretty game. For those with higher performance rigs take it up a notch and add SweetFX to the mix.Simulation vs Simcade vs Arcade: Project CARS on the surface can hit that area of simcade a lot of players look for, but, dig a little deeper and Project CARS is a full on simulation that can be brutally difficult with no room for errors. There is nothing Arcade about Project CARS.Views: There is a wide range of views to choose, from cockpit, helmet to third person. You can adjust the depth of fields on the fly to fine tune to your liking. Track Selection: All the best tracks in the world, been years since I've played a game with this good of a selection on day 1.Controls: If you're using a controller, you won't have much of an issue with just getting straight into the game. However, there is a lot to be desired still. I find the default setups to be very twitchy on an xbox 360 gamepad. I've had to put numerous hours into adjusting my controls which leads me to the next part.UI/GUI: Project CARS has the worst GUI I have ever came across in my life long gaming career. It is confusing, lackluster, ugly and hard to use. So for example in the controller setup there are no tooltips that explain a single thing....This is kind of ""what the ♥♥♥♥"". So you're forced to look for guides on steam or other websites that explain how the controller setups work and what everything means...Then you can't adjust controller setting from in game. So you are forced into this cumbersome process of bouncing back and forth between this terrible GUI. The entire UI sucks and sucks hard. There is nothing good to say about this UI. It's horrible. Car selection is even a chore, the tunning menus are somehow worse than the controller settings menus. This UI is pathetic, what a waste. This UI looks like something a 10th grader worked on at night after he/she got done with their homework for about 2 weeks. Then brought it to school for show and tell. COME ON GUYS. GET WITH IT. This UI brings Project CARS down in so many ways. SMS has made a great game here, held back by a ♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE UI.There is no section of Project CARS that has a good UI. It's all bad. In career mode, the ui sucks, online the ui sucks, tunning the ui sucks, controller setup the ui sucks, car selection, track selection the ui sucks and just to type it out one more time....THE UI ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS.So Project CARS is pretty, fun, and, held back by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ god awful, train wreck, amatuer UIProject CARS still has numerous bugs as well. You can't even enable advanced options in controller setup, because if you do, you have to remember to go in turn on the settings you want each time. For the life of me I can't figure out how to save a controller profile so I can load different setups. It seems it's simply not an option. Again ♥♥♥♥ THIS UI. FIX IT SMS!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good luck surviving the green light chaos. Oh and also good luck overtaking the AI on tight spot. :)[TL:DR]Update After Patch 2.5:I've changed the review to not recommended. I do really know this game has an astounding graphics, vast choice of cars. But what makes me change my mind is the support from the developer, the community, and the bugs that's still not fixed up till now. The pCars Head Developer is not even trying his best to help the people that has issue with the game (see the top review for the proof about his attitude towards his customer). Well, no comment about his attitude anyway, as long as he's still working on it.The issues I'm dealing right now is that when I start the game, the SMS's logo pops up and it stays the same for a long time. When I try to click, the game crashes, and Steam says that I'm still in the game. So I have to restart my PC again. I have reported the issue but that Ian Bell doesn't want to help me. Instead he makes fun of me, tho' I have delivered it with the most polite way I have done. Take a look at thishttp://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?32776-Project-CARS-All-Platforms-Patch-2-0-Release-notes-OUT-NOW-on-PC-PS4-and-XB1&p=1025173#post1025173Conclusion: Not even worth a penny if you want the best service from a developer.

												As far as racing sims on PC, I'd say this is one of, if not, the best one out there. It has stunning graphics (yet heavily demanding on hardware), realistic races and simulation/damage, and career mode has me hooked trying to level up. Not to mention the vast number of cars and tuning.In regards to tuning, a true petrolhead would feel right at home. You can change everything about the car such as technical details about the tire pressure for each wheel. Personally, I don't have a clue what I am doing with these settings so leave them at stock, but someone with a knowledge of that stuff would definitely benefit from tuning their car to the track conditions.I am yet to try out the multiplayer as it seems like there isnt really progress to be made there, yet I hear it can be fun in terms of messing around with friends.Pros:-Stunning graphics-Realistic feel and steering-Highly accurate track replicas-Intelligent AI-Progressive career modeCons:-Higher graphics settings can be extremely taxing on hardware-Controlling the car is very difficult until you get the hang of it-Fairly expensive when not in the sale ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a newcomer to the simracing world, I've seen a lot of negativity around project cars; both with lack of cars, and general wheel behavior (force feedback, steering, etc). I am using a Logitech Driving Force GT (DFGT) wheel, and after scouring forums, I found a few setups and configurations that most people thought were good. Well, these were older forums. Like 2015 forums. Anyways, I tried out their settings, and honestly, they weren't good. I reset everything to default, my wheel profiler, and the game controls, and wheel settings. Controls are great now. This game is an absolute blast, and the career is excellent. While it may lack a bit in substance (no story line, etc), there are emails that you receive, and contracts, etc. I've heard Assetto Corsa is better, but I'm in no rush to compare the two. This game suits my needs, I like it a lot. Check it out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review does not reflect actual playtime or system. I started with the steam version, and quickly realized my laptop was not powerful enough to handle the awesomeness that is Project Cars. Even with settings low, for some reason i had difficulty getting it to run. Steam was very cool and gave me a refund for this version.Last month i got a PS4 with Project Cars, and it now runs as it should. The game is amazing, you really have to compensate in the corners and each car feels very unique. I really enjoy the addition of the highway tracks and both of them are very scenic. Project Cars is for the driving enthuseiest and i would not recommend this for a beginner, although you can play with assists i don't recommend it. I consider myself a moderate driver but i still need a ton of work when it comes to sim racers, it has a nice variable difficulty which you can play around with to suit your tastes. Many cars are quite challenging to drive and get the hang of. Karts are lots of fun. I have played everything from Gran Turismo to a little iRacing.. keyword a little. Project Cars is pretty unique and its worth a try if you love racing.			",101,87,17,28,3,0,6

												When it's been out of early access this long and it still doesn't show the lap times correctly...CLOUD SAVING DOES NOT WORK, DO NOT RELY ON IT.This is like a reskinned Shift2 Unleashed, maybe with a few different cars or routes, but the driving feel to me is the same.  Forget the marketing on physics in PCars, you'll still hit invisible walls and obstacles on the track that will stop your car dead.You can race your friends in this, yes the matchmaking is easy with steamworks integration, but forget about being competitive.  Why? Because the lap times don't show up properly at the end of each race.  But don't worry, the devs made a GOTY version so you can have all the DLC and forget about game breaking bugs like proper lap time recording in a crowdfunded racing game./s			",204,18,14,10,16,1,16

All of the positive reviews had me going.So lets get just dive into the point real quickly,  I will look passed the fact that the game its self is very bland, Most Simulation games can be, And the fact that the AI is pretty well dumb?But if you are buying this for VR be prepared to get some pretty intense lag from time to time. My Specs are.EVGA GTX 980 Classified Edition6700k i7 processor 4.0ghz32gb Corsair Dominator Platinum Ram512gb SSDLiquid CoolingEVGA SuperNOVA 1600 PSUYou get the idea, I have a pretty heafty pc that should be more than capable of running this game let alone VR, Yet i still get Vive frame rate loss on a lot of the maps unless i go into 3rd person mode which sorta defeats the purpose of the vive. I am not the only person having this issue i have talked to a few people claiming they had the same problem.Until they get the frame lag issue sorted out for VR i would not buy this unless you are just playing it on a regular monitor.

												Overall very good game.Pros-Good Physics.Nice car models and paint schemes.Great setup control.Cons- Career has no real purpose, just pick a start point and then work from there. Also progressing in career doesnt gain you no advantage.*specific to me I would like to see some BTCC cars and extra british tracks added. ",12,1,3,1,7,0,1

												Pros:GraphicsEasy to driveCons:Car settings are pretty messed up. I had to tune every car one by one to drive properly. Car sounds are very horrible. I guess it's due to putting many cars into one game. The most car settings are the same. The worst thing is that steering ratio is not simulated properly.As a race simulator, I don't recommend this game, but if you like an arcade race game, it would be a good choice.I don't like this game personally			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say I'm not overly impressed. The FFB out of the box is really sub-par. I don't want to say its rubbish but users should not have to run and jump through hoops to fine tune FFB. rFactor 1 and 2 do a great job of it without making users change hundreds of FFB settings.The graphics......they are nice but some times they look abit second rate. I have a good PC with all settings maxed out, so my PC is not an issue.I understand its a sim but I feel that the devs have been lazy with the FFB implementation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First   Would you recommend?    In a frickin heartbeat.   I am an AMD USER and Yes I recommend. AMD A-6 6300 Black edtion, and AMD R9 270X. 16Gb ram. running a solid 35-52 fps in most conditions. Yes I am running High and Med settings. It looks apsolutly amazing.     Now this is a issue with the Amd patch. Somebody blew it! OK lets not throw the baby out with the dirty bath water. This game is nothing short of amazing. This game is not better or worst than AC. It's in a league of it's own. IMOP this is way more fun. It's way more emersive, with more driving then one human can do in a life time. And the racing is fun and fair. every car looks, feels, drives, and sounds differnt. And you must learn the car, track, the wather. But you learn on the games time not your own. They'll fix it and somehow it will even be better. Can you play now? oh He** yes. that's where I'm going now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I mean... This game has everything. Yet I don't like it. I bought this, Corsa, and Dirt Rally at the same time. I've tried my best to get into Project Cars and on paper I should love it but I hate the way the game feels. It has A LOT, but masters nothing. Lots of cars, lots of graphic effects, lots of settings, lots of tracks but none of it feels right. Maybe it's good with VR?I love Corsa, Dirt Rally, Forza 3, even F1 2016 (so far). They are all very specific games, but this game tries to do it all and it never feels rememberable or intense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's fine for multiplayer, in fact it's very good for racing against friends, but if you want a good racing game with an in-depth and accurate career mode, challenging AI and accurate race weekend simulation, look elsewhere.

The game is hard, not because its difficult, but because the car handling is completely wrong, Assetto, Iracing, hell even Grand Theft Auto's racing is better than this. (lol) Why would they add the Radbull if there's no car control? Snap oversteer is real. Oh well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After quite a few hours in game I have to recommend not to buy this game.There are numerous glaring errors in game that even after two weeks after release have not been patched.Straight up bugs: 2 out of 3 times Setups are not saved (e.g. changing the gear ratios before the race will sometimes not be reflected in game) Many of the default setups are plain broken (e.g. in career mode the BMW M1 Procar has the same gear ratios for 2nd and 3rd gear on some tracks) Game sometimes crashes/hangs during pit stops AI will crash during pit stops blocking everything making other drivers unable to use the pits On some tracks some of the curbs are not existent but only textures. Driving on them will not make a difference to normal road (e.g. Donnington, Spa and others) No collision detection during pit stops, leading to other cars driving through you when rejoining or entering the pitsSome of the HUD Elements bug out (e.g. the ""predictive"" timer)Missing things I consider important for a game marketed as ""the next-generation of racing simulation"":Handling is rather simplistic. Weight transfers are barely present, the car feels lifeless (although I have to say that there are quality differences between cars...still none of them feels good. All assists off btw.) ForceFeedback is not up to par with other sims like Game Stock Car Extreme etc. Even after spending almost two afternoons tweaking there is just no really good feeling. Not possible to share setups with friends Could not find a way to have multiple setups per track (only 1 for each training, qualifying, race) Things that are just not good: The AI is atrocious. Divebombing like crazy, ramming like the best of them...sometimes it feels like racing on a public multiplayer serverThe AI only seems to be aware of the player after being about half way alongside while overtaking. Driving alongside an AI car overlapping only about a third car length is a sure way to be rammed of the track.On some tracks the AI seems not to be subject to the same physics calculations as the player. Clearly visible when following behind closely and watching turning behavior of the AI. Also when driving in rain or watching AI racing through sand/gravel without being affected. Also AI seems unaffected by cold tires... Some of the tracks are just not very well modeled. Some of the corners of Spa are just wrong...the Nordschleife (a track I know from RL) is of laughable quality (Hatzenbach, Miss-Hit-Miss, Mutkurve just to name a few corners are really not well modeled)...in Barcelona the corner radii are off... Pit stops are plain broken....tried to finish a 2 hour race multiple times to only be unable to pit because multiple AIs are stuck perpendicular to the pit straight accelerating into the divider.The replay system is so limited it borders broken. Watching a second replay while driving will bug the replay controls out.This game could be really good. I could overlook the very limited tire model and physics or the lackluster FFB, but all the bugs added to that make this a huge disappointment. And I have given it more than enough time to show its qualities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game for many hours and I really want to say that it's a game that i would recommend to my friends, but, with the way they treat people in the forums and how no real improvements or promises have been fulfilled, I cannot with a clear conscience. I have lower end equipment, true, but it is above minimum specs required for the game and I have less than 60 FPS with all settings to low. And if it rains....forget it. Some tracks are better than others and if the frameraate was consistent even being less than 60 i would be happy. It simply is not very optimized for most if not any computer. So with all the beautiful graphics and they really are, if you cant play it at a consistent FPS it is not worth the money. And as I have said before the way the studio head belittles his customers and the banning of any one who dare point out a legitimate bug is banned and ostracized i would not recommend supporting this studio in this game or any other that has the SMS and WMD logo.EDIT: I have recently majorly upgraded my equipment, 16GB DDR4 2133MhZ RAM: Zotac GTX970 Graphics Card; icore 5 6500 3.2Ghz 3.6 Turbo Processor; Its a beast now, and I still wouldnt recommend this title becuse of the poor treatment of customers and players who are still upset from the empty promises that have not been fulfilled and the poor A.I. and many other problems that still plague this title. I will admit, it is beautiful and really could be a must have tiutle, but , its not at this juncture and dont think it will ever be. I think they have pretty much given up on any more ""fixing"" of the game and the fanboys will say they still have a large team dedicated to this title. But the truth is they have a team dedicated to cranking out DLC not fixing the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So I've not played that much (14h as you can see).I've focused on the ""career"" mode. It's not a real career mode, more like ""drive those races and you can change the mode after you finished the season"" and by mode I mean you can change between GT4 and Formula C and stuff.You kind of work your way up but you can also start in Formula A (the highest one) if you want.So I like it for the fact that you get different race weekends with the whole practice and qualifying stuff which is based on the real regularitions (i guess).But there are plenty of races you are ""forced"" to drive wether you want to or not. So I'm in GT4 atm. and am forced to drive a Lotus cup. If you drive those compared to the GT4 it's like you put on a Speedhack and turned off the traction. If you accelerate to much you will turn around. You cannot even start straight if you've got full acceleration.Thats kind of annoying.All those Karts and Formula cars I've tested seem so freaking unrealistic. I've been karting in real life and in this game it's just like a speedhack version of that. You cannot control anything. Well I can't.Eitherway in career mode I've started with the Renault Clio (since Karts were not an option for me).Those feel like your steering a battleship. You're so slow and heavy.After that I've been driving some GT5 car i forgot. That was better but felt pretty heavy, too.The Aston Martin Vantage (GT4) is really fun to drive though. Atleast I like it. But it doesn't seem to be realistic in any way. You're like driving on rails compared to the Formula Cars. And that's what makes me wonder. Isn't it the other way round?All in all I might not be the best informed racer on earth and I've not tested all the cars in this game but I can say it is partly fun but there are better games focusing on one part of what this game tries to combine.

												Not worth waiting 3-4 years for. The biggest let down in this game is actually audio. Granted, very few racing sims get this right, with the notable exception of Simbin - the sound experience in this game is downright unpleasant. Its supposed to make you want to turn UP the volume, not down - as is currently the case. I suppose the game will look nice on an NVIDIA card - but I will never know. My HD7970 struggled to keep this at 60fps - but only after spending an hour tuning settings; At which point it looked no nicer than a stanard Xbox 360 game. Dont believe the hype.

												Alt-F4 is disabled. On a game like this, the ability to quickly close it when the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI drives you to want to smash the monitor is essential, and in this case nonexistant. I don't get why games disable alt-F4. I know that if I alt-F4 the game won't have a chance to save, but I don't care / I don't want it to, hence I'm trying to alt-F4 out.On to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI then. Weather doesn't apply to them. Cold tyres don't apply to them. Blue flags don't apply to them. Cut track penalties don't apply to them. Your position on the god damn track doesn't apply to them and they attempt to drive straight through you EVERY TIME. Sure, you can get around this by setting the difficulty to 0 and lapping the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, but I want a challenge! I don't want to just tap them lightly and watch them drive off the track to give way - that's not a battle for 1st place! Neither do I want to have them completely ignore me and wind up taking us both out as I go for a pass and they decide to suicide themselves into me. No driver would do that!Unlike others, I haven't encountered any blatant bugs yet. In fact gameplay wise the I think driving is very good. They have the game down, they just need to stop releasing quick cash grabbing car DLC packs and fix the damn AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I genuinely like everything about this awesome racing game.  Initially I didn't like the menu system/GUI, but it really doesn't take long to get used to it.  Sounds, graphics and physics are amazing and I've played every racing game from the hyper-realistic SimBin games to the more accessible NFS and TDU series.  This game is closer to the realistic end, but still very customizable to suit any playing level.  I believe they could do a bit more with the Career mode as it's not quite at the same level as say the Dirt series, but overall it's very well done and should keep you interested in progressing through the game.  I love the replay capability (as most racers have), as the game is so pretty I always look forward to finishing a race just so I can go back and watch the replay and maybe grab a screenshot.  Definitely worth the price of entry for any racing fan!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The value of the game and the price tag are like Sun and Moon. The engine sounds all sound the same for respective engine sizes, and cars are *nearly* uncustomizable save for preset appearances. The menus and structure of the game are very shoddy, every time I load the game I have to re-set my control presets, as it is nearly impossible to play without some form of controller. It seems to me that they put way too much effort into making it look graphically realistic, and they accomplished that, but other areas of the game are simply not up to par at all. I still play it just to rip around California highway 1, and there is a decent selection of cars, but alot of them are underwhelming, and beg the question ""Why is this car even in the game?"". I would not recommend this game to anyone as there are other games that do the same job better at lower prices, but it is a little bit fun at least.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By and large, I find this to be an enjoyable game.  By no means perfect, but still quite enjoyable.Pros:-Great graphics and sound-Nice handling models (although I find the Superkarts to be too twitchy with a gamepad)-Nice customization options (the game, not so much the cars within the game)-Pretty good AI-Great weather effects that really change the way the cars handle.Cons:-Not much variety in cars.-I wish there were more variety in tracks -- I really enjoy the 'street' tracks (California and Azure Coast) and would like more of those.-Not much of an online community from what I can tell.  On multiple occasions I waited for a random game but there never were enough people in the lobby to get the race started.-Campaign more isn't very deep.  Very little sense of progression.

												Very delightful driving experience with a pad. Requires a lot of concentration even going down long straights as the car will automatically shift in directions if you're not controlling the steering. After playing a lot of games driving with traction control, abs and stability control this game will make you want to turn all them features off and try to drive like a proper racer and experience the true control of a car.Graphics are fantastically stunning and runs max on my GTX 980 but when you race with 20+ car in the rain you will suffer a huge fps drop so dropping the AA down to one of its lower setting (still looks fabulous and no noticeable difference) and you can race with healthy frame rates.

												Project Cars is great. I did have to upgrade from my old GTX 760 to a GTX 970 in order to play this on mostly high and ultra settings, but for the visuals this game provides it was well worth it. Feedback while driving is good, the amount of detail put into each and every car, track, and the environment is fantastic. Also owning Asseto Corsa, I would recommend this game over AC any day of the week. In Project Cars, the menu system is much better laid out, it loads faster, and is far more polished. My only complaint is that I wish it had more cars - but I'm sure they will add some in the future. I'm getting a Logitech G27 this weekend and will likely report back with an update on how well it works with that as I've just been using a controller thus far. So far, I am much more pleased with this over Asseto Corsa (which is okay in its own right, as well).To those of you comparing this to iRacing, I think you're trying to compare apples to oranges. I've always known and been told that iRacing is more of a legit racing simulator, and know several semi-pro drivers that actually used that game to learn some skills on. I honestly wouldn't put Project Cars or Asseto Corsa into that same category at all - they are likie Forza; a racing 'simulator' for those who really enjoy driving games. Games. I just believe this is one of the most well done racing sim games for the PC available to date.So far, I haven't noticed any of the bugs that other users have mentioned, but I haven't tried playing online yet. Gameplay has been smooth and predictable without major issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I slammed Grid Autosport for being a poorly executed racing game, with bad menus, no cockpit view etc. Project cars takes all that... and does it right.I have been freaking loving this game. The graphics are fantastic, the racing is realistic and generally it's REALLY fun.I've spent the bulk of my time in online mode. Since I'm actually going to Spa soon, I've been racing round it online. Sometimes people rubberband at the start of the race and it does wreck people, but apart from that, the game is good, it was compatible with my racing wheel out of the box, and the online racing was thoroughly enthralling. With practise I'm doing consistently perfect laps, and posting rediculously good times. Other things: The cars take realistic damage which is good, and it is possible to blow an engine or gearbox by jumping to first at 150MPH.It's a damn good fun game, a little addicting actually, and I really recommend playing online!

 Positives + Oh so pretty.+ Excellent out-of-the-box wheel Force FeedBack.+ Decent selection of content (cars/tracks). Negatives - Online server browser is horrible - can't sort columns, limited filters (e.g. can't filter for a specific track).- Lacks car/track mods, but does allow shared memory for 3rd party plugins for profiling. Touch points It somehow annoy's me that I have more fun playing Project CARS than I do with Assetto Corsa. :) Both games/sims certainly have their own draw-cards. I prefer the openness of Assetto Corsa (and can't wait for official Steam Workshop integration), but am really drawn to the different content selection (especially tracks) available in Project CARS. As a whole, pCARS feels far more refined, whereas Assetto Corsa feels ""unfinished"".From a technicality standpoint, my wheel (Logitech Driving Force GT) setup and experience is FAR better on Project CARS (out of the box) compared to Assetto Corsa. With a bit of tweaking, the experience in Assetto Corsa can become good, but doesn't seem to feel as responsive as Project CARS.Content perspective, arguably I can download mods for Assetto Corsa - but without workshop integration, the fragmentation makes it too much of a mission for me to care, there are quality issues with most of the mods, and the modding process also seems to make Assetto Corsa really unstable. pCARS doesn't seem to offer modding capabilities, aside from shared memory to allow profiling apps. I'm really loving http://www.tomshane.cz/profiler/ ! Hopefully any upcoming DLC from Project CARS is fairly priced.Final verdict, I give big thumbs up to both Assetto Corsa and pCARS, and would continue to see them as worth getting / having for a more rounded racing experience (plus RaceRoom and DiRT Rally!).

												this game is the poster child for pirating games before you buy them or why steam should offer refunds for games. This game is junk. mainly because It's not really a game. It is more of a simulator. I was looking for something to replace asphalt 8 and this looked like a good game, but after I actually got to play it was hyper realistic crap. the cars seem to have a 2 mile turn radius. I go to turn and it barely turns then slams into the wall. Such a waste of money			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was very excited to get my hands on this and when a sale hit, i got it. I didn't really know what to expect...and i was let down.The game feels unfinished. The sound is far from perfect and buggy, the physics are odd, especially for collisions. Visuals are pretty nice, that's a plus.Setting up a controller is a chore, if it works at all. No profiles for that, if you happen to touch something have fun doing everything again. Settings are buggy in general.There is a nice list of cars and tracks availabe, that's also pretty cool, but the sheer mass of content does not increase its quality.I'm sorry, but i would not recommend this game. If you're looking for a proper racing sim get Assetto Corsa or iRacing or rFactor2 or whatever, but not this.If you like to play around in a more arcade style game, go ahead, at a discounted price it sure can be worth it. I'm not going to talk about my feelings when i look at the list of DLC...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are some good things on that game.It's very beautiful, the simulation is great, the driving view are nice too.Cars are very realistics, even in the driver's first person view.The solo player mod is welcome, with a little scenario it's even better.You can modify a lot of things on your car. Same for the in game options.However, i'm a lil'bit sad about some missing content.I'm talking about a real collision motor. I prefer Grid for that.Some mythic cars too are not in the game (Veyron, GTR, Agera..) - or maybe it's a DLC but if it's true that sucks -.And I would like to see more street racing..Whatever, if you like simulation racing, take it.

												If you are going to buy this game please understand that this is not Need for Speed Underground and that in order to play it properly you need to invest some time in understanding cars and tracks.  Don't be suprised when your tyres or engine blows up after a long race if you haven't invested any time trying to setup the car for a particular race/track.Do ignore people who are complaining that the developers announced Project Cars 2.  The only difference between these guys and other game companies is that these guys are honest and they let their clients know whats coming so that can get involved again.  It most certainly doesn't mean that they forgot about this game.  There is another DLC coming out tomorrow.It greatly annoys me to see these ignorant, moronic reviews which only indicate intellect of people buying the game not the actual game.Ignore the children complaining about a hard game.

												After playing the game for a few hours, single and multiplayer offline/online I have come to the conclusion that this game is awesome!.The big pluses for me are the following:   1. The sound 5.1 is amazing.   2. The menu. At first I wasn't sure but now I love it. Very easy to navigate.   3. The options in the Gameplay, graphics, HUD, career I could go on an on. They make you game experience a breeze.10/10 for me. Great game.ADDIT:Have now played it for 20 hours+ and I am still loving it. The only thing that bugs me is occasionally it crashes and also sometimes in single player I have to restart the race as I have now control over the cars.Apart fro that I still give this game a big thumbs up. keep up the good work.Also the online racing community is really nice. Players seem to play sensibly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												hellofirst of all before i say this, id like to say ive played this since its release, and almost every day ive played it on a number of tracks, both online and offline, so please dont lecture me, but this in why anyone thinking of buying this game, should turn around and run away...i can understand that on release a game is not going to be perfect, lord knows rome 2 wasnt, and i can same the same for most games, however there is a line that has to be drawn, and the issues with Pcars..is that it should not have been released in the first place. Let me explain - the cars and tracks are fine, thats not the issue, they feel fine, the speeds are realistic, even the weather and detail..is amazing, but...the one thing its needs to do most...its fails at miserably - driver input ....how many times do i have to enter a race, and have the car accelerate without my input, how many times do i have to be mid corner...and have the wheel go full lock to the right? how many times do i line up on the grid, and get a drive through penalty?? why do i enter the pits to change to wets, and come back out still with dry tyres on??!!! ... why was this game released...with those bugs in existence, those are game breaking bugs. the enthusiasts that trust the developers and look forward to ""real"" feedback, have been betrayed and stamped on, and still after updates, the issue, the most important thing that makes racing fun, has not been fixed....ive just raced at le man for 2 hours...only for the car to snap randomly..due to the steering going.now i know what your going to stay - ""your steering is wrong, its your fault not the games"" but...i am not the only one ive spoken to that has this issues. and my wheel is perfectly fine in iRacing..GTR2..and others, so that..is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.And just to give you the full truth...PCars 2 has been announced...and most the features, like driver swaps, safety cars, dynamic systems, have all been taken out of Pcars and put into Pcars 2!! so not only have i bought a game, where i dont get what i invested in, but the biggest part that annoys me...is that the developers..dont, give a dam ive never read news, or seen anything that has had a positive impact on the way PCars feels, and the way it drives...and for a person that is a creator of a racing league, someone who love motorsport and racing ...i feel let down and dissapointed that people could turn their backs on the very people that made their company flourish....I wont be playing until they fix this game, but its not like they will care, as they already have my money to invest in their next broken mess to be released in 10 years or so. Ill stick with iRacing, a company that actually offers you a service, and delivers whats on the tin...OverTheLine			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game: personal 9/10, game actualy deserves 10/10. This is what everyone who spent hours on end in forza or gran turismo racing to get that .001 of a second wanted. I gave it a 9, because known of this game for about 5-8 years hype builds up so much in those years. It is better than I could expect. The twinkies (horizontal bumps) at lemans that launch you into the air don't. People have been saying that there is no force feedback while using a wheel... not true, I have a G27 wheel and racing a F1 around nur you feel more than you could imagine from looking at the track. This is a sim, casual weekend racers beware! This game is really everything we wanted from forza and GT, Rain, Night racing, lights, physics, absolute carnage! True Aerodynamics, Tyre wear and fuel on or off are seperate! Endurance racing, parts will fail and break like they actually do IRL! This game is really out standing! It looks amazing I don't have it turned up to ultra yet because I only have a GTX 650Ti :(. All in all this game is what we asked and begged for for years and years never to get it.

												Being a previous console racer (Gran Turismo and Forza) fan, this game really has filled that gap for me.  The physics are awesome, the graphics are awesome. The game still requires mouse/keyboard in some spots for the menu however it has decent controller support in the menus (compared to assetto corsa). Many of the negative reviews are not against the game, but the politics behind it (crowd sourcing for PCars 2) and game bugs while developing a new game.  Many of those people complaining don't understand software lifecycle development, and I am happy to hear they are continuing development. At the end of the day I had a only a few crashes on release 1.4, so hopefully the latest and greatest 2.0 release resolves those issues, but I wouldn't call the game unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like it!If you are looking for forza horizon / need for speed type of games this is not for you.. this game will bite you in the behind in every race.there is no cool story, no gazillion cars (and types of a car) and no pimping your ride in this game.(Do not get me wrong, I absolutely love these types of games too :)This game will give you its kicks from you trying over and over again finding out how to handle a car on that track.plus the sound is pure pwnage.. :DI play on a 770 gtx with amd 8350 with 8gb 1600 ram and get between 80 - 100 fps on 60hz and a xbox one controller.The controller is okay with this game and I bet a wheel would be much much better.. but  they are too expensive and too bulky for storage.

												Game looks good and drives well when it recognises controllers BUT!As for controllers this game is a total load of rubbish, it is inconsistant as to when it recognises or works with controllers.I use Fanates Elite pedals and a Fanatec Porsche wheel which work with rFactor 2, iRacing, Dirt Rally (& all previoius steam Dirt games), Asseta Corsa and others with no problem.I have had problems with wheel & pedals since day one and tried to get a refund but was told I had played the game for more than 2 hours - YES while trying to get the controllers to work, I dont think I have ever completed a lap..

												Was winning a Formula A (F1) race with 19 other AI. But the AI in this game is really stupid and never gets penalized. I was about to win, when one AI cut me off at a corner by slamming into my side. I swerved out of control and hit another car, causing a 5-car pileup.I went from first to last in 2 seconds because the AI is so ♥♥♥♥ing dumb.Still a fun game though. 10/10 would Niki Lauda again.

Fun, but it's no ForzaAs one of those who owns a PC and multiple consoles, I have traditionally favoured the console (particularly the Xbox) for racing games. Forza is one of my all-time favourites next to Mario Kart. The car selection is second to none (even Gran Turismo is behind) while the simulation physics are well done, with realistic damage (though not as extreme as in Project Cars with wheels flying off). Oh, did I already mention Forza has a ton of great cars without stupid sponsorship livery ruining the exterior?I don't want to pay for Xbox Live, and have been wanting to play a racing game online for a change, so I picked up Project Cars after seeing a friend enjoy it. At $23.99 CAD, I don't regret it, but I do wish I could've paid less, because the game, while good, just isn't as good as Forza. Is there ever going to be a PC racing game that has both simulation elements and a good car selection?Project Cars' car selection is abysmal. Seriously. There's only a handful of stock cars without promotional livery (Audi R8, BMW 1-series, Mercedes A45 plus a few others), and many of those are locked in paid DLC. I decided to suck it up and try a few of the cars with ugly livery like the Scion FRS so I could have some variety, and have gotten used to it, but I still don't like it.One of the game rules is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well. ""Cut track penalty""? Seriously? Sometimes I screw up a drift and end up in a situation where I've ""cut the track"" but have actually caused a setback for myself, and this disadvantage is made worse by my speed being limited for 5-10 seconds, which is NOT FAIR. I tried to find a way to disable this in my own lobby but to no avail.But putting those glaring flaws aside, I am genuinely having fun with the game. The simulation mechanics are more hardcore than in Forza, with tire wear, fuel consumption, and mechanical damage (including blown engines and complete losses of wheels) to worry about. Sometimes you can ram another player and send him flying into a wall at 200 km/h and cause his front wheel to snap off, and then his engine blows as he tries to get back on track. It's deliciously satisfying when that happens. The graphics are to die for. Forza doesn't come close. There's even an Xbone version of Project Cars available and that also puts Forza to shame.The setup flexibility in races is amazing. You can have up to 23 AI opponents. You can set the race to occur at NIGHT (which means you need your headlights and you need to avoid frontal collisions that could destroy them). You can turn on light or heavy RAIN which can add an extra challenge in handling. Overall, Project Cars does many things right in spite of its flaws and so I recommend it. But it could be so much better, if it added the Forza car selection and took out the cut track penalty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a decent racing game simulator, which is targeting people who at least have racing wheel controller. I try it with xbox controller and it's still hard to setting it for full potential. If you using keyboard or/and mouse to playing this game, I recommend you to not buy it. This is a racing sim afterall, without a proper tool, you cannot enjoy it.Pros:1. Customizable. You can set your car as you wish to adapt your playing styles2. Great graphic quality. Especially when you play it in ultra.3. Great simulation. Your car can be damaged and your engine can blow up if you’re not careful enough.4. Career gameplay is great, you play from the bottom to pro5. Great experience if you using VR or racing wheel.6. For now, multiplayer status is healthy. There’s even an event that you can play periodically.Cons:1. Very hard to play for full potential with keyboard and or mouse2. Playable but still not quite right to handle with controller3. Boring graphic design. The building seems just like a cube, and the trees very much bad copy paste.4. Button assignment is not responsive. Some button cannot be assigned and some clash with another input I already changed. 5. Just my opinion, but the car sound is kinda crap.6. AI looks like machine rather than human. They behavior is very stiff and predicable.7. Using assistance is very annoying and make you don't enjoy the game at all. It's almost take the control of the game. Very not recomended if you want some experience to play the game. But without it RIP mouse keyboard user.My Score is about 50/100			",136,42,5,28,14,0,18

												This  racing game  was going to be like no other racing game. I know was in on it at the start. Beta test this game for 3 years. They SMS had great ideas not sure what happen. But some where down the line it didn't happen. After 5 years of working on this racing game its still not done. Menu's still lock down , Kart tracks are open for racing only no pratice can not put a set on have to run the one it came with. When you cut track they turn you  power off for 5 sec right in front of other cars . Why not a drive threw . SMS wanted to make it so we could swap drivers (not working). Set up menu is a mess can only save one set up per car per track. Can not send set ups to friends . There are all kinds of bugs in the game there is a bad force feed back issue with g-27 if you exit on the track and then go back out the wheel will pull to the right. If you want to run more then one class of cars there is no way to pick what class of cars run . When you open it up to all cars on the start of race you have all type of claasses of cars all over the grid. Maybe a filter sytem to allow us to pick what class runs. Beside not finishing the game. Why not sure but I wish it would get done because it could be best racing game out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Released in 2015 but it's still not finished?This is the most beautiful racing simulator I have played, but so long after release it still has flaws that can't be ignored. Every time I run Project Cars, it resets my desktop wallpaper to the Windows default. How did this become a thing, and why is it still a thing, especially when the bug was first mentioned in a thread from May 2015?I started playing the career. On the second race of the first event, my kart crashes into a wall during the rolling start, before the player is allowed to control it. It then sits there wedged into the wall until the other cars cross the start line, putting you about twenty seconds behind. For my first experience of the game, this is pretty abysmal, again made worse by the fact it has been out for two years.Based on its current state I can't recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Career is entertaining and there is as much or as little challenge depending on what you want.  I got this on one of the Steam sales but am having so much fun got some of the DLC to increase the experience.  Imagine it's amazing with a wheel but I'm having a ton of fun with just a humble controller.  If it comes on sale again DO NOT HESITATE!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Down a 40 of whatever you want and play this game. Soon the one inch of wheel you let go onto the grass and the subsequent  'YOU CUT THE TRACK HURRRR DURRRRRRRRRRRRRR"" just meeeelts away into the background as you settle into the sweet embrace of alcohol poisoning.After the hangover (and funeral), you realize the achievements are absolutely ridiculous. Driving 50 km/h for half an hour or doing a 24 hour race in real time? Sounds like a great ti-oh wait.Also, Go Karts are the equivalent of running around with the care package glitch and a tac knife in Modern Warfare 2. Or the pistol in Halo 1. Just a liiiiiiiiitle cheesy. Unless everyone's doing it, in which case you're all cheese. Like the AI at 100 difficulty in the rain. But this is why I love this game. It's just a bit ridiculous. It makes you just a bit crazy. You begin to WANT to drive your LMP around the track over and over to get that .1 of a second. This game with a wheel? great. This game with a wheel AND a VR headset? perfect.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HOW TO FIX THROTTLE HESITATION - Just got project cars about 3 weeks ago after years of playing and really liking all the EA Need For Speed games. I'm running Project Cars on a PC with the Intel Core I7-3770/3.40 GHz/12 GB RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce GT640 and a new  Logitech G920 wheel. So far the game is very impressive especially with the degree of ""fine tuning"" of settings built unto it! This game also has the best intergration I've seen with the new G920 wheel and works great. One bug I had to work out was some intermittent but significant throttle hesitation on all cars which made it almost impossible to race. After a lot of trial and error I found that if I turned OFF ""Braking Assistance"" under ""Gameplay"" settings the throttle hesitation went away completely. Thought this might be helpful to others.

												Sadly, all in all I regret buying this game. Replaying it now after over a year didn't bring the patches I was hoping for. It still feels not completed.I was hyped while I was following other channels beta tests but in the end Project CARS feels really empty and shallow to me. The selection of cars is, at least for me, not that great and mostly also not that interesting. The game looks okay, as long as you stay on the track. The damage model isn't really that present. Sure, it's there but doesn't react properly to whatever crash you're involved with. Hitting a wall with 150 miles doesn't do much - plus the sounds aside from the engines are terrible and/or not present enough. What annoyed me a lot even though it's really just a minor detail are the sparks - they just look so damn bad that almost every PS1 game would do a better job. I'm puzzled how the creaters saw that and still thought it was okay for being in the final release. Also, sometimes I had that feeling I'm playing Ridge Racer, seeing how my car just bumped from the walls like a bouncy ball. Playing with my Driving Force GT was pretty okay. In the other hand, trying to play it with the XBOX One controller was absolutely frustrating next to impossible.It's pretty close to that strange Gran Turismo feeling. You play it and you're trying really hard to have fun with the game since you're driving a nice car and all while trying to nail some nice laps. In the end, maybe you had fun, but you aren't that sure about it. Having no real tasks in this game is a kinda frustrating thing, too.Now I find myself playing the 10-year old Race Driver:GRID again. Sure, it's not a simulator, but it's at least fun and did pretty much everything better than Project CARS.			",96,10,3,14,14,2,15

												This is the first racing game I have ever played in a long time, and eventhough I do not like the genre a lot I enjoyed the game. The game offers multiple options for gameplay, from Formula 1 style motorsport to go-karting, and offers aassistance for beginners such as me (which can be turned off). The physics and graphics are reasonably realistic, however the AI is not on par. The game is much better when played in VR. A controller or a wheel setup is highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm new to racing games , Played forza and other titles on xbox , But got a g27 for pc , This game is the best ive played on pc so far , and when on sale the price is great. Career is fun , Online seems pretty stable , and you cant beat going in some go karts on california Highway with friends. If you need a good starter game , This is the one.UPDATEProject Cars with HTC Vive , truly is the future of games , with a wheel and vr , its amazing how diffrent the scale is, Yes the vive isnt the best resolution , but you still feel like you are there, I've had no issues with vr in this game , you can use your head to pick stuff in menus , or just use mouse and controller , Thank you Pcar devs for putting time in to add vr support.

												My experience so farStarted careerplayed one season of 125cc (its pretty booring at this point)moved on to superkarts - won every race (more fun)new contract - wee -somehow i ended up in the 125cc again...... (stopped playing)The game has nice graphics, and is very well optimized. However the career mode just isnt that funny. Its really just grinding races, to move on to something more fun.I think its a decent game, but i probably wouldn't recommend it. However ill give it a thumbs up anyway, because its well made, and if you really like this type of game, you might enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 23, 2016
												Having played this game for close to 30hrs, I feel I have enough of a grasp of it's content to write a review. For reference, I come from a Gran Turismo background so a lot of my feedback will be based on that as a 'simulator' with the use of a wheel/pedal setup (My current setup is a Thrustmaster T500RS, TH8a Shifter & T3PA PRO Pedals).GRAPHICS - 8/10This is easily the strong point for PCARS. I am fortunate to have a very good PC so play with mostly Ultra setting with some at high getting roughly 70-100fps. The detail within the cars is excellent with the environment and tracks being even better, a really good looking game. However I must note that even at the point of this review, there are still graphical glitches seen in open cockpit cars when it is/isn't raining.INTERFACE/UI - 7/10In one word I would say....simple. Everything is easy to find and straightforward. That being said, the ""career"" segment is so basic and shallow it seems like an afterthought. WTF is that calendar system all about? Could the Devs not think of something more interesting/complex than a calendar?Also pointless emails/""tweets"" are pointless. WHY? I won 15ish races on the bounce and I still got emails from people saying ""...this could be part of a streak""....??? Really? You think? Why do I care what Betty whatshername wrote about me on twitter clone-hashtag thingy? I don't!PHYSICS - 6/10This is where I start to see a downturn in PCARS. The physics attached to the cars are very good and definately worth the title of simulation, however the score I have given reflects the lack of positive impact changing the settings of any vehicle has on it's handling. I have tweaked the settings to try and improve charachteristics of the vehicle (Escort Mk1) but to no notable avail. It seems as though every car is set-up to be pretty darn competitive out-of-the-box to the point where there is no real reason to change anything, even though any positive changes seem unoticeable. Why have such an indepth choice of tweaks and settings to your car when it isn't really needed?? Also to note, crash physics between cars is below average at best (It feels more like you are playing bumper cars!).AI - 5/10Boring. Just plain boring. They are okay for casual racers that just need someone to race against in offline mode, but for people looking for a challenge just go and face real humans (....or try another game?). Apart from staying pretty rigid to the raceline, they do not seem to offer much of a challenge when trying to compete for podium places. I feel this is a problem area that almost the entire race genre has, probably owing to the challenge of coding such an AI. So in that regard PCARS is no different than most racer sims, which in of itself is dissapointing considering PCARS is meant to be the challenger to the race-sim crown.FEATURES/DEPTH - 5/10...and quite frankly I feel I am being generous. You never *OWN* any of the cars within the game, you are purely a contract driver. As a concept this is fine, but it will naturally lead to a lack of depth in gameplay owing to the fact that you are simply a faceless dude that turns up around the world in a blink, races then jets back home (This is the main problem with PCARS). This is unlike in Gran Turismo/Forza Motorsport ect where you earn the money and put blood, sweat and tears into owning a piece of machinery. Then, carefully taking your underpowered Golf Gti and turning it into a FWD beast, you face the challenges with something that is YOURS. You earned it, raced it, improved it then won in it. The concept is rewarding and makes for improved length of gameplay and a vast array of features.PCARS has none of that. You're a faceless grunt, deal with it.CONCLUSION - 6/10When I first learnt of PCARS I was HYPED. The idea was brilliant with a community focussed race-sim that delivered a Daddy of all racers that I could spend vast amounts of hours being a nerd while drooling over cars I will probably never own. However, I feel disappointment. It's very pretty yes, but it's so...so shallow. The ""Career"" is pathetically boring at best alongside the AI that seem to be drafted from the deaf-dumb-polite society.Disappointed.			",49,8,2,2,8,0,4

												Being a sim-racer, I've heard discordant voices about this Project CARS. Many depicted it like the definite sim, many others as a simcade junk. I got it on the Steam Sale and chose it over Assetto Corsa only because it was 5€ cheaper.The game is actually very good! The visuals are astounding and really scream for a VR headset, the handling of the cars feels solidly realistic, there's a good selection of cars and the career mode, although still not addictive as a Gran Turismo or a Forza Motorsport, still compels to play the game more. The AI is aggressive (sometimes even too much... they don't know when to back down thus they are always fighting) but it feels quite natural and overtaking one always gives a great chill of satisfaction down the spine.The car setup has an overwhelming amount of choices, and not being an engineer myself I always have to rely on the setups over at projectcarssetups.eu. this is quite frustrating and a bit boring tbh.Online is good, lots of options, dedicated servers, competitive tools, and it feels like there's a good community out there on the public servers (but I really need to explore it more). Sometimes there are some lag spikes, really annoying and potentially race-breaking, but they're maybe a problem on my side, even if CSGO and the rest play smoothly.PRO- it can be a tough sim, it can be a simcade- astounding visuals- helmet view with loss of focus is immersive- lots of good and funny cars to drive- lots of great tracks (but not enough from the F1 season unfortunately even tho the big names are there)- four different modern F1 cars, plus some blast from the past like the 70's and 80's Lotus- I'm looking forward to race in an onine F1 championship- Career is fun, but confusing - which is championship, which is invitational?- It's easier to drive than iRacing - which leads me to think that iRacing is actually at fault here.CON- the interface of the setup seriously needs an overhaul- there are some weird issues with the deadzones- you can't run it on ultra. EVER.- Career could be better- there are some leftovers from some unimplemented features, like the engineer suggestions for the setupDefinitely reccomended for all the sim-racers out there. Vote: 9/10STEAM CONTROLLER: it takes a bit to get the feeling right, because the game is not straightforward on its settings and even by setting the deadzone to 0 you'll still need to use a bit of anti-deadzone to make it feel right. Otherwise it works perfectly, you can also use an actionset for driving, an actionset for the menu and set them in the configurator to switch automatically based on the cursor shown.It's definitely the closest to a wheel you can get - without a wheel. Turn on the vibration for feedback and use a touch menu for additional options!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game was very good for if you want to just race on race tracks and not have an open world to drive in, but it needs more cars that you can use on the road.And there is no open world so you can run from the cops or anything. So the price is way too high since you race on certain maps and such without being able to have a open world.The only great thing about this game is if you want to drive on race tracks realisticly(rain, dark, or shiny) then this is the game, but its only realistic if you have these special steering wheels and special brake and/or gas pedals.

Pros Sleek menus and interface. Stunning visuals. Extremely in depth customisation and tuning of cars, graphics and difficulty. Huge range of car classes and diverse representation of real life motoring franchises including Renault Clio Cup, GT4, GT3, LMP1, LMP2, LMP3, F1, Karts etc. (As of patch 6.0) Good optimisation: 60fps+ on near-ultra with an R9 390, 60fps on high with an R9 280x Controller and Wheel SupportNeutral Points Realistic variables such as tyre temperature, fuel, tyre wear, damage and lighting that affect the difficulty of the game - some may not like this simulation style. Buggy (although I have never encountered a single bug in the whole time I've played.) Career progression system - not able to access all branches of motorsport from one class (for example, you can't go from GT3 to F1.)NegativesOption menu not available during the race, not even the audio options. Very difficult to find a multiplayer game that isn't mid-race and isn't a super long one. Aggressive AI that, can make mistakes but will then decide to drive straight into you upon returning to the track, making you spin off.In my opinion this is the best simulator (or sim-cade if that's how you want to describe it) you can get. While Assetto Corsa and iRacing have the better handling and input feedback, neither have the graphics, career depth and interface to match PCars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the closest thing to racing a car one can do without actually racing a car.It will give you the most lifelike experience of being inside exotica, hypercars, kit cars & high performance track optimised F1 open wheelers & grand tourers available.Get yourself a wheel, start with the training tools on, hone your times then take off the training wheels get some snacks and race against the best in the world.Record your times then compare them with realworld lap-videos and see how close or ahead you are of the real world records.Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Music 0/10Sound effects 10/10Replay value 8/10The attention to track detail in this game is just breathtaking - I've driven a real car around Bathurst (Being an Aussie) and although I wasn't going too fast or in an AMG merc every dip in the road, house on the side of the track, crest where the sun blinds you, cambre of the tarmac is absolutely perfect.Enjoy.

												If you like racing games this HAS to be in your collection. One of the best racing sims on PC. The handling of the cars has a great feel with each one having there own characteristics. Your able to feel tyre wear as it slowly drops away and if you leave the pits on cold tyres and expect to go flat out, you'll quickly find yourself in the barrier. The weather not only looks great but adds alot to the racing as the track evolves from dry to wet.The career mode is great for those who enjoy single player racing as you progress up the ranks into the higher formulas while also getting the chance to gain invites to special race series throughout the race calender.For the graphics, the videos and pictures say it all. Sounds are great also.This game is a must have!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Finally caved and bought it.Graphics are good, while leaving a lot to be desired sadly. Engine sounds, tire screech and other ambiance are nearly perfect. Lots of details went into that aspect. The physics are comical at times. The cars are overly twitchy when driven with a controller. Definitely designed around a steering wheel and pedals setup. Vehicle setup is incredibly detailed. Can be overwhelming at first seeing all the sliders and numbers. AI is either too easy or sets near-impossible lap times. Location selection is plentiful and a decent amount of cars to run with.Overall, I found this just ""ok"". It's not refined. You're punished for going too fast. Either when you or the AI snag the road and come to a complete stop from 160. Ha. This really sealed it for me. Never had I come across this bug. And so many times in one game.			",5,0,4,0,1,0,0

												Pros:- Good graphics.- Feels very good with a decent set of wheels.- A lot of different classes.- Good weather effects.- Many great tracks.Cons:- Lots of bugs. - Flags are useless and often wrong. I got blue flag when i was on hotlap during qualifying when i drive pass a car on out lap. - AI is not so good. They are fast enough, but they often ignore you and bump into you- Few players online.- Lap times will not go into leaderboard during practice. So laptimes set when you are tuning and trying out tunes will only be stored in your memory. - Few cars.- Cannot save and share setups. - No support for modding. - Developers have all ready started to make project cars 2, witch means the improvments of this game in the future will be minimal. They will instead put the impovements into a new game..Do i recommend this game?Yes i do. This game is far from perfect, but its still good enough to give you hours of entertainment if you like racing games. But keep in mind the number of cars are very low..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unless you set the game up for an arcade-like experience, you probably won't find instant gratification in Project CARS. It takes patience and practice to stay on the track and be competitive. Once you do get the hang of it, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had.My favorite aspect of Project CARS is being able to set up custom races. You have complete freedom to choose the track, cars, weather, time of day, number of opponents, difficulty, starting position, race rules, warm-up/practice/qualifying rounds, and much more. This alone offers unlimited replayability.I notice a lot of the ""helpful"" negative reviews are out of date. There have been numerous patches since the game was released which have addreesed issues people found.  As it stands, Project CARS is my most played game of 2015 so it gets a big thumb up from me. :)			",85,29,8,11,20,1,9

												A half arsed attempt at a racing sim,while project cars does something's right and offers a more robust front end and track and car line up than other pc racers it however fails in the most important departments when trying to be a driving game simulator or even an enjoyable arcade or casual driving game.I hate the sound in this game,there are not enough options to balance the sound effects in the game,the slider doesn't work as intended and with most sounds down to 50% and car engine sound at 100% I can stil hear far too much road sound and other car sounds,on top of that there is an annoying tire sound heard when cornering the car at any degree that i also can't stand,it's as if the tires on your car are wrapped in sand paper and there is no variation in this sound what so ever from car to car or gegree of turning point,very generic sounding and it wont go away.The engine sounds themself i also dislike and this contradicts general thoughts that the sound quality of the cars is very good,i trialed 6 cars from the kart and fomula series to stock and road and they all sounded very furmilar,each had very similar gear ratio sets ups and all were very quick in gear changes,i couldn't get to hear a turbo kicking in as you throttle up second or third gear to the over rev point with any meaningful sense of speed,all the cars did were go up quick and over rev with no real improvement in speed,there were no backfires or engine haults,the engines all sounded a bit winy to me with no depth.Controls while using a 360 controller were dreadful,very twitchy controls that sometimes seemed to lose control and traction on the road for no apparent reason,i found this strange and to be the case on only certain parts of a track too and feels more like a bug,i wonder if the wheel is also like this ?I could never recommend this game,i am a little let down by it in all regards,graphics are nothing that new,sound quality is lacking mostly in deph,controls feel like a rehash of a game called need for speed shift unleashed with a similar feeling of twitchy floatyness and middle wobble,no sense of speed vs sound design.A shame and i am glad i waited before buying and refunding. I come from racing games like forza on console and race 07 on pc,race 07 is a far far superior game in almost every way to this pile of garbage,i highly recommend it ! and if you want the newer and possibly the best sim racer on pc i would recommend racingroom experience here on steam,the base game is free for all to play.

												Whenever I run the game it afterwards sets my Windows Sound scheme from No Sounds to Default. It is totally unacceptable to me that a game changes my system settings. Also you can not set the race distance freely when using timed races. There are only fixed times forced upon you. So you can not run a lot of real life race distances. How hard can it be to make the time a freely selecatble minute setting?When you use the AI co-driver and the weather changes he comes in to change tyres. So someone had half a brain. However you then have to be there and select the tyres the AI wants. Of course it does not tell you which tyres it wants. So if you give it tyres it does not like it comes straight in on the next lap again. Also it would do this on the final lap. So I take that back. Whoever programmed that has to be brainless because otherwise he would let the AI take the tyres it wants and then send it off again. Also the track limit system is complete rubbish. The AI itself frequently violates it. AI cars pass you going completely off track and get no penalty. And also your AI co-driver misses the track limits frequently and then gets you disqualified. Another problem is that the game just crashes after long races. I did two 12 hour races with it. Each time the game did not come back after the results screen and therefore the data was not added to my driver profile. As much as I like a lot of the other things the game does I can absolutely not recommend it unless these most basic, glaring and unexcusable major bugs are fixed. It seems like nothing is tested or thought through at all with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tried it few months ago and performance in VR was terrible. Gave me motion sickness as well. I don't know if the devs have fixed it or not but I'm not willing to try again as Assetto Corsa is a way better alternative in terms of physics, performance, graphics and VR.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this for HTC Vive support, absolutely amazing.  This is highly playable and completely awesome (don't even think about turning up the graphics though, I can't get 90fps with anything but default settings)I'm not a huge race game guy, but this will surely give me hours of play time.

												Best SIM driver at this moment, but they need to expand their functionality in online racing if they want E-sports involved in this. Driving with a controller is possible, but Google for some settings otherwise you can get dissapointed. Sound is real, graphics a really fantastic, weather conditions etc. If you love racing a SIM, then this is your game for at least 2015 and maybe many more years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												can not be recommended for VR! The performance in VR is so poor, its beyond playable. I have decent hw(I7-6600, GF 1070) and the fact that on the same hw assetto corsa with compareable settings runs smooth, altough it has no official htv vive support (which pcars has) is a shame.

												This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.I was excited about this game. I love forza, dirt, and grid. I thought it was going to a combination of the best of all 3. It was, but it also wasn't. The graphics are good. The amount of detail on the cars rival, if not surpass, forza. However the track and the environment suffer. The AI in the game is okay. They follow their race line and thats that. The will not move. They will not try to take the outside to pass you they will try to go through you in order to pass.The game play is great. Each car handles in its own way. You feel the difference between the BMW M1, the Zonda, and the go karts you start out with. It is wonderful and I give full credit to the developers who made it. It is a job well done.My biggest problem is the shear lack of cars. No ferraris. No lambos. No Bugatti. No koenigsegg. No Volkswagon Golf. No Chevy Corvettes. Litterrally 3/4 of the cars you find in Forza alone are not in this game. They have very few normal cars for you and your friends to drunkely race. Few super/hyper cars that you can only dream of owning and want to top out. It is by far the biggest dissappointment. The cars that are availabe are race cars with few road cars availbe.This game is supposed to make you feel like you are a young race car driver. It does and it does it well. I now realize this after I played the game for a bit. I also realize what I liked about forza and grid and dirt are not good for a game that wants to be as real world as possible when it come to making you feel like a acutal race car driver. Grid, Forza, and Dirt are racing games. They look good, they feel good, they are focused on making the driving experience entertaining and fun. This game focuses on accurarcy above all else. Again for the people who only read the first and last senteces  of a review:This game is a race car driving simulater. NOT a racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the Greatest games I have EVER played.Why this game is AWESOME :)I really love Project CARS' visuals because they are quite breathtaking with Beautiful Vistas.The Car tweaking in this game is INSANE, you can remap everything on ANY keyboard, ANY controller and ANY racing wheel. Then you can tweak traction and other things. (I haven't touched anything so I don't make it wonky :P )THE TRACKS, There are SO many tracks in Project CARS.Photo mode, SO many filters ;)The Driving, The cars are fun to drive but some can take a while to get used to. but the Best part about driving is..... YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BREAK :OThe weather system is awesome, in thunderstorms and rain there is less grip to the road, In haze/ fog you can see less, In clear weather you get lens flares :P(I have not played multiplayer yet:P )The Not so Awesome thingsI might sound like I am taking back some things that are good about Project CARS but these are minor things :PThe trees, the Trees are just front facing sprites. The Amount of cars is so little that once you find a car you love there is no reason to use any other :( (I maybe the only person wanting DLC cars and traks for this game :P )The Car cutomisation. You can't exactly swap in a different engine or breaks or anything. If you want to do that go to The Crew (if you don't mind Uplay ;P )There is no Horn :P I want to beep the people i overtake :P and don't  all cars have horns :O(If there is one tell me please ;) )BUT those things are so minor that the game still gets....9.9/10 An Excellent Racing Game			",381,74,17,32,44,2,41

												The game is really overrated.Particle system is the ugliest i've ever seen in a new video game. Also i found the handling of the cars very odd. On top of all that the game is very boring: same old tracks from games like grid or need for speed. I'm just tired of the same locations like nurburgring and so on. Game lacks originality. I've payed 50% off but i am still feeling ripped off.			",234,42,22,25,29,4,17

												Welp, i gotta say... multiplayer is pretty broken for me since this last patch. Not too many problems in single player, but the multiplayer bugs i've come across so far are:-Game will sometimes crash to desktop in the middle of a race-Will visually and audibly stutter-Has tons of server side lag (in a race between more than 3 people you're almost guarnteed somebody is driving sideways around the track at some point)-Will lock you into a camera view even though others can switch -Not being able to drive when you've joined the game so you need to quit and rejoin-Cars will sometimes spawn on top of each other at the start of a race These are most of the bugs i've seen so far, i'm sure i could add more if i thought hard enough. Now, some of these bugs can be funny at times, but combined you're sure to experience very few completed races, or at least races where an external bug factor doesn't somehow screw the race up. I get the whole ""Games will have bugs"" dealio, that's a given. But as it is, i paid a premium for a game that has delivered half of what it should have been... so far. I'm hopeful that they will fix these problems in the near future, considering they've sold over 10 million copies worldwide (I'd say thats a bit of capital influx). Also, I'm pretty irked about the fact that they've come out with DLC already for a game that desperately needs fixing. All I can say is that with all release delays (which i'm fine with in order to catch bugs and polish the game), it seems like one of 2 things happened:1) Multiplayer was SO broken that it actually did take that time in order to get the game to its current state OR2) They pretty much ignored blatant game bugs, which i have a hard time believing.If Slightly Mad Studios can't take the criticism, they shouldn't be making games... or they should just sell out to EA which shares that philosophy. There will always be trolls, but these are legitimate complaints. Good luck SMS.I'm recommending this game simply because the single player hasn't given me very many problems and it really is a good racing sim.  It just desperately needs some mulitplayer side fixing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall I rate this game 'Very Good' I think the visuals are excellent, especially the changing weather and time of day, all fully customisable you can set your own weather patterns such as fog, to haze to sunshine starting at dawn :)The Game does have some issues, hopefully they will correct them in 1.4 patch.  AI are a bit frustrating, they will always turn in when you try to pass them in the braking area, always!  And if they can't make the corner they will not yield, they will cut the corner to retain position without any recourse.Force Feedback is a bit vague, you can't feel the slip in the rear of the car so you can get easily caught out by random spins.Otherwise I do really like this game, I'm enjoying the career mode and the freedom of setup for single race events.  Online is very easy to ge into, the lobby system works very well and I like how you can force all to use the same car.  Of course you get the usual rammers online, but this happens in all games so as always best played in private lobbies with friends.I hope this helps some people :) ",82,9,21,3,3,0,2

												Well im dissapointed , it feels unfinished , short of content and im reluctant to stump up for extra content , handling is rubbish as soon as your car looses traction you cannot ride it out you will crash stuck in to the barrier and have to reverse out , crash detection is woefull , slightest clip and your in a lurid spin , some tracks have blind dips and as soon as you hit that your car goes light and you most likely again crash .AI is weak the lead car just sits behind you and the rest fade away , yep or you crashed and worked your way to second there is a big gap to first  . the slow cars are decent to drive with more mechanical feel but supercars on fall apart at the first corner with the crash detection and the knife edge handling .i am using a 360 xbox controller , its working better in win 10 but pre update in win 7 i had no hope at all , no support for 360 controler unless it has been patched now i dont know .out of 10 i rate this unfinished game 4 .but if it were finished it has promise .

												9/10+  Very technical, the game enforces good racing habbits by severly punishing bad ones.  I'm actually learning things just to be competitive on easy mode, this makes it really addictive.+  Graphics and sound, especially the weather system.+  Flexible game modes allowing you to play pretty much any way you want.+  Runs very well on my i7 4770k, 8gb RAM and GTX 560ti.-  Selecting a cars and tracks is a little odd.-  The AI has a tendancy to ram you out of its way.*  If you get the ""Lap time is invalid"" message because you went off the track, you can still finish the race, it just doesn't compare your lap to time any records.  Cutting the track or intentionally ramming other cars will get you in trouble however.*  If you play with a controller, you'll need a keyboard to do things like exit the game.  The game itself plays beautifully however, be prepaired to use some finesse!*  If you're looking for an arcade experience, move on.*  The game focuses on modern, high end vehicles, so it might not interest you if you want to experience driving a Shelby Cobra or racing your Toyota Camry for example.

												Oh man, I paid $30 and I glad I did! This game's the bee's knees!-After some tweaking, the X360 controller is pretty easy to use. (Turn turning sensitivity down to 20 as a start).-On my GTX 780 based rig, the game can run 90fps (144hz monitor) with DX2M (double resolution and MSAA) + FXAA high and high(reflections, shadows, env mapping)/ultra settings. Grass and motion blur are low since I don't really need them.-Cockpits are pretty. After tweaking the helmet cam, TrackIR support is super awesome.-Did I mention this game has go-karts? Like really pretty ones?-All of the tracks and cars are unlocked from the get-go.-A bazillion tweakable options for racing nerds. Maybe if/when I get a racing stick I'll think about it.One minor nuisance, the menu music is a bit too epic for me. Di.FM fixes that. :)I wish this game had splitscreen, but Trackmania and Grid Autosport take care of that I suppose.			",146,9,11,13,7,0,7

												I don't get it, I've driven quite some fast cars very fast and they never felt so prone to loose control like in this game. I always start feeling disconnected with a game, when I e.g. choose a BMW M3 and the game has it performing like some average street car, except it isn't able to do 20° corners at 50 mph without troubles. So if i can't trust the sim with cars I've driven myself how should I trust it with the others... Maybe getting a 300€ steering wheel would be better than using a controller, but at this point I'm just to afraid my experience wouldn't be different if I would buy one.. Also great is the ""going into a corner at 20, hitting the grass with one tire, better spin completly"" experience			",95,5,7,9,26,2,25

												Good game.  Don't view this as a Forza or GT PC alternative. It's something different.  Which, IMO is a good thing.  Yes, it has a few bugs at the moment, but nothing too bad.  I felt the FFB was a little light at first (I use a thrustmaster TX, on a dedicated rig and triple screens) but I became accustomed to it and now feel it's spot on, even using default wheel settings.  I recommend taking the zero to hero career route to get the most out of the game. Once you get the hang of the karts they are excellent, plus you get to lean the basics of racing and there are some great tracks. The AI I find to very good, gives some great close racing.  Not played online yet so I can't comment on that. All in all, a very good game.			",70,5,29,6,10,0,9

												tl;dr I really like this game!I have been a gamer for a very long time and have played many driving games, but mostly at the arcade end of the spectrum, Burnout Paradise (arcade driving perfected) and NFS etc.Occasionally I would dabble in closer to sim games like Forza, F1, Grid, Gran Tourismo and enjoy them, but they have their limitations of sitting in the uneasy space between arcade and sims, not quite fun enough to be arcade, no accurate to get a satisfying drive.I have tried a few proper sims, but I always find them too hardcore and hard to get into, basically I don't find them fun enough to persevere with. I made the mistake of buying Assetto Corsa which while it simulates car driving well, has no discernable game around it, the AI is terrible.So, I have been following Project Cars for a while and unfortunately missed out on supporting it in early access, I bought it on day of release.After playing it for a few hours I can say this is the more serious driving game I have been waiting for for years. It isn't a full on sim, with all the baggage that carries, but I would put it at the casual end of the racing sim genre.I play with a steering wheel (old logitech Momo) which after setting up in game works well, although the Force Feedback leave a lot to be desired, it is very weedy and inconsistent. The general driving experience is great, whether doing time attacks around a course chasing ghost cars of faster real players laps, or when driving in races against the AI. The AI is the one of the highlights of the game as they genneraly act like real drivers on the track, and not crash into you like other games do. You can adjust the AI strength from 1-100 which allows you to fine tune the experience so you get a good race. I haven't tried MP yet.My only major disappointment is the Kart Racing which unfortunately you have to do a load of races in to progress through the career mode. The Karts hand terribly with a wheel, I found I had to use my 360 controller instead, which fortunately makes the Karts playable, though still very tricky to drive. The AI in Karts doesn't work too well either. Personally I don't think they should have included Karts in the game, it detracts from the masterpiece that driving the cars in game is.There is a wide array of tracks in the game and a decent selection of cars, although 95% of the cars are in the very fast to warp speed classes, and only a handful are at the slower end where I like doing a lot of my racing.I know the hardcore sim snobs look down their noses at Project Cars, but IMO they should be more supportive of it even if they don't play it themselves. It acts as a great introduction to the more serious side of racing and will probably lead to more people moving to sims down the line, which is good news for their niche ecosystem.Overall I can really recommend this game to someone who want a more serious driving game that isn't intimidating.ProsGreat gameplayTop of class AIGreat graphics, makes you feel like you are really racing in a car.ConsKart Racing with a steering wheelForce FeedbackNot enough slower cars for my tastes			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												258 hoursHere's the thing, Ian Bell's team at SMS WILL continue to work hard to make it perfect.  5 patches since May launch. 2 DLCs since launch.Like someone posted earlier, it's a ""NO BS"" simulator.  Pick your car, set it up right, race.  Since patch2.0 the AI has gotten more tame without becoming boring, a good challenge now.  Online Multiplayer is working good for me, I participate in 2 ""sprint leagues"" (waiting for additional pitting bug fixes before the Endurance Leagues get going).   The support forum is frequented by the programmers and even Ian Bell himself...they care. They listen.  You will not be ""abondoned"" like with some other companies.  Make a forum account for free and check it for yourself.  An online race I had in May:

												Great game but some things are Important to know imho:- Using Jack Spade's FFB Tweaker files the drivability is great (using a wheel)- Graphics are mostly great, but the videos and screenshots available online are better than real life experience on more down to earth hardware... definitely need a very expensive computer to achieve excellent graphics- I find the shadows flicker and disturb my concentration, especially in Monza- Multiplayer (PC) is way worse than I was hoping: Few options like filters, 60 min practice + 60 min qualifying + 60 min warm up.... wtf- Singleplayer great fun though, really like the ability to precisely adjust opponent strengthAll in All: If bugs were fixed and multiplayer experience improved, then I wouldn't stop playing...

												Excellent racing/motorsport simulator buried within a not-quite-finished game.  It is fantastic when it is good, but there are many small issues that need either work-arounds, or outright avoidance.Pros: - Great track selection - Great selection of track day & race cars - Outstanding graphics - Tons of options - Rift support!Cons: - UI is cumbersome and frustrating - Ongoing bugs - Flags/pitstops not well implementedOverall, I recommend the game based on its technical achievement and excellence when all of the features come together.  Just be prepared for an experience that may be rough around the edges. ",117,22,8,8,8,1,3

												This is by far the best racing sim I have played. The only sim that comes close is Asseto Corsa, which is very good as well. Project Cars is a blend of realistic physics, great AI, and choices on what to race. This game offers something for everyone and is must for any racing fan. It is the racing sim that I will judge all others on.			",4,0,9,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing racing sims since I started in 1993 with IndyCar Racing, and I've played most of the ones that have been released since then. Some off the top of my head would include IndyCar Racing I & II, F1GP2, Grand Prix Legends, Sports Car GT, Richard Burns Rally, GTR/GTR 2, GT Legends, Race/GT-R Evolution/Race On/etc., RaceRoom Racing Experience, SimRaceWay, Game Stockcar (including Extreme and Reiza's truck game), Live For Speed, netKar Pro, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, rFactor 1 & 2 and NASCAR Racing 2003.I can wholeheartedly say that among all of the sims I've ever played none have felt as alive, as deep in handling nuances and as engaging to drive as Project CARS, and it is by far my favorite sim of all time (it also inspired me to really look into the physics of racing and to develop my own spring and damper calculation tool, which I'll release at some point). I'll tend to agree with Ben Collins and Kristian Roos in that past sims were often way too difficult on and over the edge, too punishing. Like Rene Rast has commented, racing cars are designed to go and be driven fast and inspire confidence in the driver, they're specifically designed to be good at going fast, which means that until you start to get to the limits, they're not that necessarily that hard to drive. So the cars feel like they actually do have some semblance of grip as they should, but start pushing to the limits and shaving those last hundredths of a second and you'll find all the challenge you could hope for.I love this game.

												Lets keep this simple shall we....     3 reason why not to buy this game!!If you like crashing into people and driving like a moron then this game isnt for you!If your an Arcade racer and want instant track gratification then this most definatley aint for you!If your a Need for speed fan boy then more than likley this game aint for you either!This isnt an arcade game so please stop moaning about cars, content and controllers not working correctly etc etc etc Success comes with trial, patience and practice.Lots of reason why to buy this game!!If you like racing with a like minded community and have a little time to put into your configuration settings then this game is almost certanly for you. Instant track gratification is almost impossible but then again it probably is in real life, you need to try different setting for your controllers in order to get the most out of this game. Then you will see the real gains and success on track.If you like games like Live for speed, rfactor, Asseto Corsa and even F1 2010-15 then this game is for you. Id even go as far to say if your a Dirt fan the you will probably like this game too. This isnt an arcade game therfore instant success is not possible, practice practice and practice some more and you will become a top racer and then be able to enjoy the thrill of close to real life racing without spending fortunes.

												I really tried to like this game and put many hours into it but I just can't stand playing it anymore.There are so many problems with this game. AI divebombing you when they pit. AI driving on grass as if it was fully rubbered in asphalt, AI constantly smashing into the back of you when you brake. Screwed up tire model where I can drive with wet tires for a whole race on a dry track without them melting (tire wear was enabled in options). AI not yielding when you go to lap them, resulting in more crashes.This game should have been in development much longer. PBugs is an appropriate title.			",48,22,28,36,13,2,11

												I've been toying with car sims for quite a few years now, and honestly, this one is the most realistic and precise car sim I've ever used. I've raced on GTR, GTR2, GTR Evolution, GT Legends, all of which are *excellent* sims, but this one has just a little thing more regarding the feeling when you get behind the wheel. And graphically, of course, when watching replays, I find myself thinking this is footage from Eurosport channel, and then realising, oh no, this is PCars! :-) :-)I've read some negative comments about this sim, but honestly, it does not feel any worse than all the others I've tried, and I've raked up a fair amount of time on them, on the contrary, I think the force feedback is very precise and you can really feel and anticipate loss of adherence and feel the vibrators on the tracks, the difference of track textures and the bumps. This is of course quite subjective, as everyone is different, but if you love driving and cars, and have a decent wheel like a Logitech G27 or better, like fanatec, this won't disappoint you, I guarantee you that.Have a nice time on the track!

												The game isnt easy to begin with, its kinda like dark souls of racing games: Hard, takes alot of time, will probrably make you mad sometimes.Everything matters in the game, tire temp, brake temp, ride height, suspension setup, tire pressure, stuff like that.I wont recommend it for someone who just wants to cassualy drive around, wont happen, too much gas or steering input and you will understeer in a wall right away.But for people who want that, this game is a gold mine, its challenging, the engines sounds great, the game looks great, the game in general is great!

												Not fun at all.1/10Playing the game on triple screen and Logitech G25.Force feedback just sucks, game has no fun or realistic feeling. Feels more like GTA than a racing sim.Graphics are odd. Game is not built with triple screen in mind, unlike Asseto Corsa.Vehicle and track selection is the only good thing I can say about the game.Probably can somehow be fixed with setting change but the menus are horrific, Takes too much time to understand what each setting mean. Spent more time in the settings section than in racing and still no good outcome.Can't believe I've waited for this and spent more than 5$ on this.Good bye and welcome back, Asseto Corsa.

												This is the first PC racing game I've played that's been able to fill the gap left by Forza Motorsport, now that it's an XBone exclusive (because there's no way I'm buying one of those).Controls are tight, to the point where I'm considering picking up a racing wheel for this game alone because a controller is not doing it justice. More configuration than you can poke a stick at, I honestly don't know what half of it does.Graphics are incredible but you'll need a high end rig to do a packed race without framerate drops on ultra settings. If you have less than a dozen cars it's usually fine. I get a solid 60fps driving in heavy rain with 12 cars on the track on the highest possible settings with a GTX 980.Plenty of beautiful tracks to race on, including Bathurst for any Aussies out there.Personally I'm a little bit let down by the variety of cars, but there's definitely plenty to choose from. You'll be going without brands like Ferrari and Lamborghini... and even more of a let down for me was the lack of V8 Supercars (something that is offered in many other Steam racing titles such as Grid Autosport). You can't have Mount Panorama with no Holden or Ford V8 to drive! EDIT: DLC adds some extra variety, such as the Old Vs New car pack adding some Fords. Very cheap too, the base price without discount is only $4. You'd be paying on average around $1 per extra car WITHOUT a discount.Definitely worth picking up for $50 or less. I bought it on day one and have enjoyed it since (usually play in offline mode connected to a TV so my hours don't reflect how much time I've spent ingame)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												PROS+ Quite pretty for the most part, apart from a couple of issues mentioned later.+ Fairly good selection of first-person cameras.+ Menus are crisp and well laid-out.+ The logo is quite nice (seriously, I'm struggling quite badly for positives here).CONS- AI incapable of racing, but will barge you off the track at any and every opportunity, and never seems to actually lose control even when it should.- Laughs in the face of actual realistic physics.- AI seems to be completely unaffected by rain, not needing to change tyres, remaining fully in control and continuing to post the same lap times as it would in the dry.- Car will veer off the track or spin out for no apparent reason.- Constant (scripted?) engine blowouts - I've even had a few occur on the first corner of the first lap!- Basically zero customisation options: you can't even choose your helmet, and the game will blatantly ignore your choice of number.- Noticeable screen-tearing, even with V-sync on and a 4GB GTX770.- Bland and lifeless crowds at race venues.- Career mode is marketed as sandbox but is in fact linear and lifeless, and doesn't even really let you know what's going on.- Limited selection of vehicles.- Limited and very poor selection of venues.- Go-Karts are awful. Just awful.- No real sense of immersion or of progression.- Extremely poor and limited selection of 3rd person cameras.Basically, DON'T BUY THIS UTTER CRAP! Spend your money on something else. Anything else. This is the worst racing game I've played in a long time...			",45,13,3,17,30,2,18

												The best racing game I have ever played, with the irritating caveat for new users that its default G27 ffb effects are terrible and the ffb system takes a lot of headache inducing tweaking to rectify.[comparisons influenced by comparing to Grid Autosport]+ UI is nicely designed and very well integrated with online elements which allows a much more social experience for example competing with community ghost cars and quick access to online play, colours are bright and graphical elements are well thought out and modern in the form of a tablet icon layout.+ With some Ultra settings on Tracks and Cars (i7 4770 nv 760 ) graphical detail is excellent much better than GA, nice clean well modelled cars, track surfaces and general layout are excellent, almost photo realistic even on a small monitor- Despite high anisotropy I find there is some ""jaggys"" at distance that can make judging distance to oncoming corners sometimes difficult+ Car interiors are excellent really add to immersion, find myself playing in these all the time despite other views such as bumper view being arguably clearer, much better immersion factor compared to GA- Lack of split screen mode hurts long term playability if you have 2 wheels and friends, a great shame for a game with so many other features+ Pit stops requesting fuel and repairs in online races, plus presence of practice and qualifying rounds online before races really adds to immersion makes for a fantastic race experience+ Level of detail in customising cars, such as camber and toe settings, downforce, tire temperatures for inner,med,outer and so on and on are almost endless, the defaults for each car are pretty good though I found the default gear ratios sometimes off for some cars and tracks, the potential depth of gameplay to be had by endless tuning is excellent, though daunting the defaults are okay! Menus presented in a decent fashion as well.+ Online community is good, good online integration+ Physics model compared to GA is much better, physical modelling of tires and contact forces, cars handle very well really adds depth, tire scrubbing if turning in too fast, loss of traction, cars suspension bottoming out, tire temperatures and effects, fuel weight effects, many nuances are shown for each car, cars look great in replays and adds a level of detail in car handling not present in many games, really cool!+ Audio [edited after 2.0] Car engine sounds are great and diverse, environmental sounds are too loud, typically hearing crowd sounds over tire sounds is very problematic. After 2.0 tire sounds are much better to hear but still difficult to pick out over the din of the crowd, still wishing tire sounds and states were better transmitted through audio as it helps to get a feel for the car. Loss of traction sounds, brake lockup sounds and other sounds are more noticeable now post 2.0 which is a lot better than before.+ Offline is extensive regards career mode, nice offline practice and quick race functionality+ Car selection is amazing, DLC are cheap, all have great interiors and outstanding 3d models and textures, repaints available for each car are amazing and look amazing.+ On a 4770 + nv 760, with some Ultra settings but no [ott] particle effects I am getting 100fps + offline, dipping to well above 60 in online with many cars, I would say it is well optimized even more of a shame they never fit in split screen as it seems reasonable spec computers can get good framerates.+ Good menus for fiddling with controls, defaults for many peripherals***************************EDITED After 2.0 (removed rant and recondensed with more positive outlook after recent changes);Prior to 2.0 and as a new user coming from GA to Project Cars with the G-27 I had a lot of trouble getting the force feedback to a reasonable state which made left me very sour.As a more experienced player now finally getting a better ffb experience through my own tweaking and understanding the numerous parameters I have removed the rant with my new outlook, however as a new player even into 2.0 there are many frustrations with ffb and feel of the game through this popular wheel which I will add a condensed rant;- Default FFB settings as of 2.0 produced endless amounts of ""clipping"" on G-27 resulting in terrible feel through wheel feel and can really offput you getting into the game further.- Default Car setup page FFB effects are in my opinion terrible for new users, many of the default tire forces, for example lateral tire forces, obliterate subtle helpful force variations for example tire torque, and have to be radically tweaked to get better feel, I recommend only Mz and Sop Lateral forces on each car at 100, zero out all the other parameters or your wheel will get saturated.- FFB options are many falling into two primary filtering techniques, relative mode and soft clipping mode, by default the relative mode is used though I found this unsuitable with jumping between cars with wildly different tire forces (ex. FA to Road Car) resulting in clipping. Basically the over 20 sliders dealing with FFB are a headache for new users and require a lot of tinkering and exploring to make them feel better.[I think FFB feel is a subjective thing, if its of any help I used the soft clipping settings of; SCH2,SCF0,RelSettings All 0, Deadzone 0 Deadzone Falloff 0.05, TF 100, Knee settings of position 70 and strength 30. Though these are ok for me as of patch 2.0 subsequent patches may alter tire forces and render these useless!] [These are also in conjuction with default car ffb strength and only 100 Mz and 100 Sop Scale + 100 Sop Lateral, too many other car ffb forces here I find washes out much detail] [I even ended up charting my own G27 force linearity, or so called linearity, it has a very linear response at ~70% force upwards at a logitech profiler strength of 106 (I found this the most linear response strength) Below this its all over the place with higher force output than input, I used a knee reduction of strength of 30% at the 70% mark to match aprox my own wheel and it feels ok, different profiler strengths produce much different outputs, the default 100 produces some odd dips and rises as well. Not to mention the force deadzone, though this can be treated with increasing the force strength, more strength less deadzone, 106 is not as much deadzone reduction as higher but has best linearity]- Learning about ffb effects and interactions as a new user is as you can believe a bit of a bore lol! Once you are past the hump the game is good and the ffb is good too, though the game at default makes too high a demand of a new user with a G27 (and other wheels?) to get good force feedback across different cars without asking for a ******* degree in tweaking :(Rant over but better than before!**********************************************TLDR Version;+Game is the best racing game I have ever played, It is the best racing game in existence.- Users with a G27 will need to be patient to get the game ffb working, keep at it, hoping much better default ffb setups will come in future along with much better car default ffb effects as well.*********************			",26,1,4,5,6,0,8

												PLEASE NOTE: I own a Nvidea GPU so I have no comments on the AMD performance issues.PCARS is a semi-sim racer, being more realistic that GT and Forza but less realistic than Assetto Corsa/iRacing etc.  If you are looking for a modern sim racing game I recommend buying Assetto Corsa as its FFB and physics are in a league of its own.At first sight you will notice that PCARS isn't as 'pretty' as advertised, that being said it is easily still the best looking racer out there!  You will also notice that the Force Feedback is a bit dull and doesn't give you that true feel that you might expect from your wheel, in my case being the G27.  However after doing some research I found a helpful link in the Steam community forums that completely changed the feel of the game: http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22938-Jack-Spade-FFB-Tweaker-Files&p=891198#post891198 The physics in project cars is decent not following the mainstream arcade route.  I might be wrong but I think this is the first ""sim"" racer that targeted the mainstream market, thus also attracting gamers without wheels.  This caused some confusion since sim racers are nearly impossible to drive on keyboards.  I recommend that you save up some moola and invest in a wheel.  After some practise you will learn to love the more realistic feel and never look at any arcade racer ever again.A summary:If you are new to sim racing(like me) and do own a wheel I will recommend this game for you.  This game is easier than true sim racers but also requires some  practise to get use to and it's very rewarding once you do get the hang of it. Thanks for reading :)			",173,46,10,25,20,3,19

												Let's be honest, the devs have given up on this game and they've left it in quite a state. The online is so full of bugs, 1 time of 4 you won't be able to start a race because you'll be stuck in ""limbo"", either planted on a random part of the track or in some kind of glitchy heaven type world, all you can do is kill PCars from the task manager.Another fun glitch online sometimes is a patch of around 50x50ft under the car that is like a stripey shadow that follows you around... However hit the right curb at just the right angle then it might disappear for a lap or two.On the other hand the GT3 cars are a blast, so that's nice.In other words, don't buy it full price, wait for PCars 2.

												It's absolutely the most amazing racing game ever! Why? Well it's very realistic because of the damage models, the fact that you can blow your engine if you damage it too much or if you don't know how to shift gears, the game shows pretty much all the states of your car, way too many for me to understand, the driving physics are pretty realistic as well, atleast compared to other games. There's many cars and tracks you can choose. Plus they'll be adding new cars every month! The graphics as well are pretty amazing, just kinda make you want play the game just to look at it. This is a pretty good buy, but if you do decide to buy this game you should invest into a racing wheel or a game pad if that's more of your liking.			",702,159,36,63,79,2,84

												Note: This review has been changed since my purchase of a decent racing wheel for my PC.This game is for hardcore racing sim fans only. Why do I say that? You need a steering wheel for this. Sure, you CAN use an X-box controller, but be prepared to spend a long time setting it up, and it still won't be great.I have a Logitech G920 with clutch and pedals. It cost me a pretty penny but I feel it was worth it as it really improves the game (and every driving game I have). BUT it doesn't improve this game enough, unfortunately.You see, Project Cars is a bit of a cluster-♥♥♥♥. If you want career mode, you will be at the mercy of a calendar, which will often force you into a very narrow band of choice with regards to racing types at any given time. This means that you will have to slog through a lot of racing types that might not be for you in order to get to the races you do want, and even then you might have to slog through even more crap to get to those. It's tedious, especially when the AI will plough into you, causing disqualifications while perfectly hugging the race line without drifting or anything.During a racing session, whether it's a solo race, free practice or career mode, you will be unable to select a colour for your car... sorry, that's not true: you can select a colour, but you won't get it in the race (a problem that has been present since release) These things really detract from the game for me as I don't get a sense of progression, achievement or ownership. I want a nice, unique paint job on my cars. I want to unlock cars and be able to use whichever one I want (confined to the racing type of course) rather than just be told to eat what's put infront of me.This is a sim, through and through. The driving itself does feel nice, but only with a wheel. It's a real shame that more effort wasn't put into this game to give it some staying power or making it a bit more user friendly, as the gameplay is a real let down. If you are happy doing races in whatever cars are thrown at you or failing that, playing single races with no sense of progression, then you might enjoy this game; but you had better buy a wheel first.

Biggest regret was not buying it sooner.   i play between a mix of medium to high settings for better fps, but currently playing on ultra settings for world, car detail, reflections, every other option was set at medium.   The core racing of this game is fantastic!!  Each car feels different from one another, career mode is fun.  For a game that is different than forza and GT, the core racing is far better.  Try racing in helmet view than you will realize how fun this game really is.  If your going to cry about how this game didn't support AMD cards well then honestly your lost. 9/10 -			",38,0,4,1,2,0,1

												I really didn't care for Project CARS when it first went public, but they added Vive virtual reality support and I fired it back up again to see how it was. Magnificent! I love it now. The menus are well done and easy to navigate and it is just simply beautiful in VR - with one glaring exception...Slightly Mad - Please, PLEASE allow us the option to render our whole car in the cockpit view. In VR it is just so disturbing to look back and see the rear of your own car not fully rendered especially in the open wheelers.But the rendering issue doesn't keep me from recommending it especially for anyone driving in VR. It's just so nice to go blasting around tracks or along Highway 1 like you are really there. So damn cool!Highly recommended! And folks, VR is how this sim should be experienced!			",7,10,4,0,18,0,0

												I have 170 hours logged in the game, but about 50 of them are using the internet trying to figure out how to get the thing running stable, and 100 trying to work out how the force feedback works. It is the worst implementation of force feedback I have ever seen in any game ever. There are so many settings, and no matter what I do, I feel like I'm driving a boat that somehow suffers from snap oversteer.Of the 20 hours I have actually played, the AI drive like pastor maldonado on a sugar high, and the career mode is about as rewarding as watching paint dry, only to decide you dont like the colour.However credit to the art and sound team, the game looks and sounds really good2/10 Quite possibly the worst but prettiest racing sim I've ever played.

												this is one of the best racing sims ive ever played. i own assetto corsa and forza but this game takes the crown in all categories in my opinion. both games lacked some umph and this game delivers. the graphics are stunning. using my wheel the game drives amazing and feels more real than anything ive felt before. the amount of tracks is rediculous and while theres maybe only 50 cars they are very good ones to have in a sim and they all feel unique. the experience is rather exspansive, from actual pit stops to qualifying rounds to tuning you cars setup to the astonishing AI, this game has it all and will leave you with a smile on your face. i will say there are some negatives. first everyones heard of the amd gpu issues which luckily i dont have to worry about, but its ****** for anyone that runs a amd card. next is there isnt many players online very often, enough to play games with but not enough to have a real choice of what you play due to lonely servers. the game also has a boot issue where once it starts it minimizes to desktop and you have to reset nvidia backend software for it to maximize again which can be achieved with gamebooster( razer cortex). these are the ONLY issues with the game that i have and im very picky about the sim racers i play. so if you like sim racers dont you dare miss out on this one. its ******* awesome. just be patient for the few hickups its having at launch. im still a very satisfied customer of wmd and mad studios. my setup is i7 4770k 16gb ram gtx780 and a g27 steering wheel. i run the game at high settings 1080p at a CONSTANT 60fps.  message me if you have questions about the game boot issues.

												Let me first start off by stating the positive attributes of the game, and then I will elaborate as to why you the consumer should not waste your time/money on purchasing this travesty of a ""racing simulator"".  There is only a few qualities of this game that I can say are positive: 1. Graphics/IQ(don't trust the requirements posted on steam, you will need a high end system in order to achieve ultra IQ at 1080p+/60 fps), the graphics are phenomenal.  2. Track selection: the tracks in this game offer a wide variety of locations.   Now for the negative stuff 1. Lack of content, and progression system, the career mode is an absolute joke and lacks vision as well as direction.  This game is more inclined to simply be a venue for test driving F1/Super Cars because that's pretty much all you will get out of it.  2.  Little to no in game sound tracks, while engine noise is nice the ambient background chime of music seen in almost all racing games is a must.  3. Control's, this one takes the cake and should be the primary reason for not buying this game.  If you are using a typical Xbox 360 or similar controller you will be in for quite a shock, as almost every car is virtually uncontrollable  or handles like a boat no matter the difficulty settings.   It would appear the developers could give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the majority of players whom aren't using a wheel with this game.  After all is said and done, I have played many racing simulators, and others like them, but this game still cannot stand up to the likes of Gran Turismo, Project Gotham Racing, or Forza.  Dare I say it but DriveClub, actually does a better job than this game, finally if you are interested in the new Need for Speed Shift 3 buy it, otherwise avoid it.Note on System requirements:  I am running an extremely high end system when compared to the system requirements listed on steam, and still drop below 60 FPS when running at 1080p on ultra.

												Best racing game available. Cannot say more. Some bugs in the beginning got a hotfix. Now everything works fine (up to 96%). Day-night changes are impressive. Still, some lags make it uncomfortable to drive. Matchmaking is not that easy because you gotta search for a game that fits your preferences. Steering/handling is a bit different from what you know from other games (Grid, F1...) but after a short time you get used to it.To beat iRacing, it needs oval races, but overall for me this is THE BEST RACING GAME at this time.

												This game has a lot of hype, but it is extremely boring.  It's only worthwhile playing with other people.The amount of vehicles, currently available, is not that good.  Most groups/classes, only have 1-3 vehicles to choose from. (unless you like Formula/open wheel)  They also promise ""Each month, Project CARS players will also receive a free car. We started with a bang in May with the $3.4m hero car from the movie Furious 7 - the Lykan Hypersport - and players can expect delivery of the next very soon...""  Seeing as it's now July, we're still waiting on the 2nd & 3rd free car... (Edit 10-16-15: 4th free car has been added.  We're a few months after release now, & unless you're buying up all the DLC, there aren't many choices for cars.  If you own all of the DLC, the car choices are much better now.)The amount of tracks, currently available, is average.  One would expect a lot more tracks than what they have now.  Most tracks, currently available, are variations of each other.  They boast a whopping 110 courses, when in actual fact, there are only 30 actual tracks, which they call locations, with most having 4+ different layout variations.  http://www.projectcarsgame.com/locations.htmlThe graphics are above average (I have no issues with an AMD setup, FX6350, R9 280X, with 16GB RAM).  Nothing like what you see in the media releases though.The realism is, well, there is none.  This is an arcade racing game allowing tuning of many parts of the vehicle.  Yes, each change will alter what the vehicle does, but, the ""simulation"" side of things is an illusion.  There are too many unrealistic features for some of these cars that, no matter what you alter in settings, it will never feel like you're actually driving it.The career mode is a waste of time, literally a waste of time.  There's no reason to even do the career mode.  No story.  You don't unlock anything.  You don't get special licenses to do special races.  The AI is not that good.  If anything, the career mode is for people without an internet connection (I.E. PS4 players).  I think that's the only reason it's there.The online mode only searches games within your Steam Download Region, which can only be changed manually.  (This has now been fixed.  Well done WMD.)Controls are not controller friendly, no sensitivity options for throttle, brake or steering.  It's either 0% or 100%, nothing in between.  (Steering is now a bit more forgiving with a joystick/controller.  Throttle/brake, are still 0% or 100%.)This game is NOT worth the money they're asking.  Even half price is still too much!  60-70% off and you've got yourself a game that is worth buying & playing.  Perhaps once they start adding more vehicles, needs about 10x more, it MIGHT be worth buying at its current price.This is an Early Access game at best!Edit 7-19-15:I will say that with the past couple updates, they have managed to fix a few bugs & create a better experience when playing.  Although, it was at the expense of new bugs & new penalties that may alter your gaming experience.  Also, still waiting on these new cars that were promised.  And for those that didn't know, WMD have already started working on Project Cars 2.  Granted, release is still years away, BUT, please make this game better first!			",116,4,7,16,1,0,6

												Really wish I passed on this one.  Worst is every time I finish a race it kicks me back into Windows, and I have to reboot the computer before it will let me play again.  I got 30 other games on Steam and Origin and they all work FINE.  My computer is TIP TOP and my net connection is blazing.  Can I get a patch please?  As for the game the graphics are beautiful, even on my 750ti FTW.  The races are  is all over the place.   Why am I in a Porche racing F-1 cars?  Why does the Ford Focus handle better than the Porche?  Why are the side events so much more fun than the career mode?  Man this game should not have been released yet.  So much promise.

												The cars are very driveable but not easy but not easy to drive. I like it that if you lose grip, you can catch the car. The career is long and challenging but you can adjust the strength of the AI drivers. I have them set at 70% and that's just right for me. At that setting, I have to fight for position at the top. The graphics, physics, and sound are great. As for the fun factor, it is very fun. I enjoy Assetto Corsa, Raceroom Race Experience, and Game Stockcar Extreme as well. They all have their pros and cons. I think out of all the sims I enjoy, this one is the most accessible and scaleable to suit the driver's abilities.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is more of an arcade than it was marketed as or intended to be.  The physics are very unrealistic and I'm not entirely sure what lead this to happen.  The tire grip is extremely over-asserted, and the oversteer feels as though it has been exaggerated to compensate.  This is especially noticeable with the road cars, which are genuinely unplayable if you're looking for a sim.  Absolutely not worth the selling price.PROS:-Many supported wheels-Optimized 360 controller settings, which is more fitting for this game-Oculus supportCONS:-Extremely inaccurate physics, especially noticeable with road cars-Extremely small and disappointing car selection, especially road cars-Poor track selection.  Only 2 or 3 of the essentials, not nearly enough to justify the price-Menu UI is overwhelmingly cluttered and counter-intuitive.  I have never had this complaint before-No integrated mod support-Exaggerated arcade car sounds			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is beautiful, and as long as you just stand still and watch the pretty cars it is all good. But as soon as you begin your first race you will realize that there is something completly wrong with this game. i play with an xbox controller and sometimes the game ignores my inputs and refuses to make a turn so you have to put your stick back to the center and try to get repeat the input this is not a hardware problem i have tested this bug with 3 different controller one of them being a PS controller and they all encounter the same bug. Also sometimes the game will armwrestle the controls from you and force you to make a turn when you want to go steaight for some time. and then there is time... when i am playing the singel player time will begin to slow as i enter the begining of a turn and this effect has no duration bar or anything it is just like bam 50% time speed and bam back to normal, they could atleast give it a more fluid transition. I thought i would give racing another chance even though it have never really been my favorite genre of gaming. i sincerely hope they will fix some of these bug, so the game becomes playable at some point			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A WARNING to everyone switching between 2 different controller devices!  (between Wheel (for me Driving Force GT) and Controller)You can't save settings for 2 different controllers. To me this is an issue as I like playing the game with a controller just for fun, and sometimes more seriously with a wheel. When switching from wheel to gamepad, all wheel-settings are getting resetted by the game and you have to calibrate the wheel and all your Force Feedback settings again.As the whole setting up your wheel process takes quite some time (calibration, button-mapping & adjusting FFB), I'm very tired of doing it all over again.Although I like gameplay, that whole thing makes me think twice about starting the game.  And after a couple of times setting up the wheel I'm sick of wasting my time with controller settings.With PC2 coming by the end of the year there is no fix to be expected anymore.For me this is not tolerable as a finished product and I cannot recommend the game to anyone wanting to use wheel and gamepad alternately to play the game!

												This game is, without a doubt, the biggest dissappointment there has been in the driving simulator genre over the past decade. And that's saying a lot, considering Gran Turismo 5 was released in that timespan. The game lacks basic interface functionality; you can't change the horrible futuristic speedometer you get in racing cars, and you can't even have a rear view mirror in certain camera positions. The menus are irritating and unnecessarily fiddly (and barely functional if you're using a controller), the user interface is cluttered up with pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥♥such as artificially generated twitter posts, and you have to restart the whole bloody game if you want to alter the graphics options, and sit through approximately 9 hours worth of opening splash screens each time. Hell, you can't even adjust volume levels while in the pause menu, you have to exit back to the main menu; and how exactly are you expected to know where to set the volume levels when you're not driving?The driving mechanics and car selection certainly don't make up for this either. While Project Cars does seem to offer a dazzling selection of manufacturers and models at a glance, on closer inspection it is apparent that ~70% of the cars available are lazily designed, ugly, soulless race-cars which, quite honestly, all drive identically.The biggest let-down with Project Cars, however, is the appalling career mode. Instead of sticking to the classic formula of the old Gran Turismo and Forza titles, this game adopts the insipid ""racing contract"" system of the famously lifeless Codemasters racing games. Earning credits, finally getting your hands on that gorgeous Jaguar and at last having the power at your fingertips to win greater titles has always been part of the fun of racing simulators; this game throws it away completely. On starting a career, the game railroads you into a tediously narrow selection of cars, then forces you to keep using one for an entire season. What's more, you're stuck with the utterly bland LM racecars right from the start, so there's also no feeling of progress whatsoever in this supposed ""career"" mode. The calendar design is intrusive, and sometimes kicks you into round 4 of a race without choice, skipping the qualifying and practice rounds; I can only speak for myself here but being forced to race on a track I've never seen, in a car I don't like, starting in 20th place isn't exactly fun.Don't be fooled by this game; it may look appealing on first glance, but believe me, you're looking for something else.

												if racing experience is what you are after, then this game is for your. The racing in this game feels great and not like in any other game. AI can occasionally ram you or be too aggressive, but in that it's simulating what real players do in online races ( not talking about the usual first turn incidents, talking about proper MP raricng) game still has some bugs to be ironed out, so perhaps you might want to wait for some time before you buy it, but if you like racing games in general, this title shouldn't miss from your library racing is what they promise and oh boy they deliver it !I have been playing other sims such as rFactor2 (demo only), AC, iRacing, and while each of them have great things about them, they also have bad things about them ( as does pCARS btw) but if you can afford to have more racing games, and I think you should always have most if not all of them, they you will definitely enjoy racing around, track selection is unmatched car selection is solid, although some exotic cars are missing ( ferrari, lambo) visually it's stunning, great weather effectsfull day-night transition makes it perfect for endurance racingMP can't comment on much, since I'm not much of a Mp player myself, but neat feature is Driver rating, that based on how clean or bad you drive, you will be put into MP with same sort of players 9/10 for now and once it's all polished it will be 10/10 for me highly recommend it			",51,5,36,10,20,0,8

												This game is unlike any other racing game. Now I know you here that phrase used all the time and trust me I get tired of hearing it too but trust me, this is unlike any racing game out there. The immersion is so incredible and the graphics are so good that (no joke) it actually looks like real life. I looked up Project CARS on google just to see some amazing screenshots and one of them was actually real life but for the first 10 to 15 secs I thought it was the game...-UI: The UI is very clean and crisp. Everything is easy to find and manage. Only gripe is that changing your liveries for cars requires you to go to your garage and change it from there instead of the quick car list. (Not a big deal but still worth mentioning). 10/10-Singleplayer: I haven't even started a career yet but I assume it's amazing. As for just random racing, it's amazing. You can add up to 55 cars (most I've seen at least) on the track at once which was at Le Mans and can also have multi class so you can simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans or 24 Hours of Nurburgring. 9/10-AI: AI is a bit iffy. They are quite a challenge if you have it at 100 and do make mistakes on there own but seem to not even care your on the road. 7/10-Multiplayer: This is where I have spent the most time on, mainly cause it is actual people and I like that more. Everything runs smooth and the people for the most part are nice and aren't trolls/wreck everything. Getting together with your buddies is a breeze. This is by far my favorite part of the game. 10/10Bugs/Crashes: The only crash I have experienced was on Spa Francorchamps and my screen froze but the audio continued. I had to CTRL+ALT+DEL to close it which kinda sucked but over all that is nothing compared to all the fun I have had. Basic Specs of my Setup: NVIDIA GTX 970 (EVGA)                                          i5 4590                                          8gb RAM			",39,5,7,4,11,0,2

Disappointment. This game was terribly overhyped. In an attempt to do everything, the only thing they have gotten correct are the graphics (for nvidia). The rest of the game feels like it is a beta release. The fanboy steam community jerk off going on over this game must consist of console gamers. No one should be using the word ""sim"" to describe this.Oh yes it looks phenomenal if you have an nvidia card, but anyone who thinks these cars handle correctly and that the force feedback feels realistic obviously hasn't driven real cars before, or real sims for that matter. Cars don't spin just because you let off of the throttle before you even turn the wheel. The rubber band AI drive like teenagers who just got their license and can get away with antics like cutting corners bouncing their way through the grass. Damage is a joke other than cosmetic, you can plow head first into a wall and back up and continue like nothing happened. You can even shift without the clutch all through the RPM range without consequence on stick shift vehicles.The sounds are even a little off, and some (tire squeal for instance) are just straight up unrealistic. I mean judging by sound alone you can't tell if your brakes are squealing or your tires have locked up. If you love games like Gran Turismo and Forza, you are new to PC racing with a FF wheel (and blissfully ignorant), or you just want a racing game that looks great on your new monitor then this is for you. But if you want a simulation, know how driving a car should feel, have a triple screen setup, oculus rift, or an AMD card - STAY AWAY. Buy Assetto Corsa instead and save some cash. Or if graphics don't matter as much as physics/feel to you then iRacing is even better than this.			",56,49,22,9,14,2,18

												I'll share my somewhat unique experience with this game, although perhaps not exactly a game review.  Shortly before purchasing Project Cars I became a fan of the show Top Gear.  Before watching the show, I had no interest in cars whatsoever.  Over the course of a few months and 21 series of Top Gear I developed a taste for cars and was learning the basics of racing terminology and mechanics.  Top Gear introduced me to the idea of track days.  I researched them and found at there are events every weekend where I live in Southern California.  I signed up for one at random and starting researching the track.  Shortly, I realized I had signed up to go to Willow Springs, which of course is in Project Cars.  I did over 250 laps in Project Cars on Willow Springs in the classic Ford Escort before I went and did my track day there.  For those interested, I drove my land yacht Kia Amanti at the track haha.  Project Cars was an OUTSTANDING preparatory tool for me.  As a novice to track days I was required to attend some short classes before we started and after each session.   The instructors would ask us about the turns, the straights, how our different types of passing were going, and so forth.  I restrained my arrogance verbally but could not help thinking in my head that I was miles ahead of my peers.  The teacher would explain what an apex was and use turn 9 as an example.  And I would listen thinking ""I already know where the apex is on that turn, I also know that the track dips just before the apex, I have decent idea of the speed I can take the corner at thanks to the accuracy of PCars and the similarities of my car to the Ford Escort.  I knew every turn.  Their apexes and exits.  I knew the race line.  I knew where the pits where.  And I also knew my limitations.  I knew the dangers of turn 1 and how likely I was to go off.  I knew that I could stay flat out through turn 2 and that I had to find the apex out of the passenger side window.   My first track was one of the most fun days of my life despite being in a terrible car.  And I have no doubt that my experience was deeply enhanced by my preparation in Project Cars.  Only flaw with Project Cars - No Top Gear test track in the game.  Make it a DLC.  Someone make a mod.  Something.  I wanna drive that track soooooooooooooooooo bad.  tl:dr Project Cars unquestionably made me very well prepared for my first track day in real life and has helped to further my enthusiasm for cars.  And its fun.  9.9/10			",216,25,6,9,17,1,21

												Only buy this if you want to sim. That might seem obvious, but ultimately there is no 'game' here at all, other than the racing, sort of like Assetto Corsa.I prefer Gran Turismo for the car collecting and ton of preset races. That would make this into a game, in my opinion, if they had put any effort into the 'reasons' for opening the game, other than bombing round a track.Watch some videos thoughs, read some more reviews and you might decide if it's for you -- for me, however, the challenge:fun ratio is all wrong.

												OK SO I CHANGED MY MIND AND CAME ROUNDThe AI suckThe controller support sucksThe menu's suckThe navigation sucksThe loading sucksBut, it's pretty god damn fun when you’re out on track racing the AI. I've spent far far too much time just doing quick races starting from last and seeing how far I can get after an hour or so. It's brilliant. It has many problems, which should be mentioned beyond the list at the top. The controller support is TERRIBLE if your car has a moment and twitches (which it should a lot) you cannot really correct it in anyway, you just have to over-correct and hope for the best, or spin out and start all over, it sucks. The career mode is terrible and does a horrible job of showing or giving any indication of progress. That said I still had a lot of fun with it and it’s easily the best modern racing game on the market at the moment.			",104,6,7,2,5,0,12

												Newest version of Project CARS alongside with currently availabe DLC is very different from the 1.0 version, and I can say that the game is gradually improving: framerates are better, developers are working on the car physics (there is a realistic car weight distribution, intertia), tire grip has also changed. Moreover the developers actively support the game searching for interesting content like Audi 90 IMSA GTO or McLaren F1 GTR Longtail and include it to the game. Recommended.			",79,10,19,4,6,4,3

												This game suffered a lot with it's start... But, it's finally worth playing.The handling is somewhere between simulation and ""Grand Tourismo""It's far better than games like Forza, Grid, and the like but when it comes to being a simulatorAssetto has it beat. When it comes to being a fun and engaging driving game with physics that are pretty good, and consistent enough to hone real world skills with? This is where it wins.Full support for Occulus and Vive! That's right, full Vive support!You can play Assetto with the Vive but you have to run a hook program off of Oculuss home software to get it to work. This game supports it natively. The career mode in racing games is something I've always enjoyed. Something about working your way through the ranks and being tossed into cars I would never normally pic for myself is fun, presents challange and give a great experience. I play with a Logitech G27 and while my first review was REALLY negative because of the poor support for wheels, and the game forgetting your settings and a list of other issues, they seam to be worked out now and the game plays really well. If you want a sim style racer with a progress system but still the ability to just race any track with any car at any time, then this is for you. If you want a cade style racer look at Grid or the like, full on simulation, with no niceties Assetta (Seriously, non... A menu over haul and propper VR support would push that game up a bit but right now those things drag it down...but that's not this game so enough about that heh.) There is always iRacing but that's a pay to play game, and Simraceway is fantastic as well but I haven't checked in on it in a bit to see if it has VR support. A+ but they did need to go to summer school to get to that grade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this thing works its excellent .. but the number of times it crashes is ridiculous. I played for 11 hours most of that trying to figure out why it crashed. After trying everything I could find online to fix this issue and everything else I could think of I requested a refund to be told I couldn't have one as I had played it 11 hours. I've owned this for 3 days and spent almost all of my play time trying to get it to work. I also made another refund request explaining what I had done to get it to work .. no dice .. no refund .. broken game .. now I discover this is a long tim known issue .. bad taste in the mouth .. you bet .. great game but buy at own risk .. thanks for the support Steam .. well played not. This only ever happens with software. Fit for purpose just doesn't hold any water in software.			",10,1,8,1,10,0,4

												I am a big fan of Grid Series and played Some Gran Tourismo games before. I want to try a more simulation oriented racing game and bought Project Cars with all the DLCs on sale.Keeping car on the track is very frustrating especially for high powered cars. Cars spin very easily on the track even if stability and tracking assists are ON. Also it doesn't feel like a real car reaction to me. For road legal class C & D cars I managed to win races on average difficulty. However for higher powered car classes I could not manage completing a lap without spinning multiple times.I am playing this game with an X-Box controller. That might be the reason for car control issues but I am suspecting that same would have happened if I had a wheel.I am requesting a refund now and wanna try my luck with another race simulation like Assetto Corsa..

												I bought it to take a break from iRacing and Dirt Rally.The graphics are nice, but it's just a *really bad handling model*, no matter how you set it up (assists on or off). (I'm using a Logitech G27 + Triple Monitor)If you ever played nfs shift 2, project cars os slightly better than that, but only SLIGHTLY. The physics model definitely feels like a tweaked version/evolution from that game. At least the steering lag is gone and the cameras feel better on a triple display.But If you ever played dirt 3, this game is a little bit worse than that. And if you played dirt rally, this is so far behind it's sad, even for asphalt handling.And iRacing... well, iRacing is a simulator. This is not. Even if the graphics are better.

												If you've been looking for a racing simulator that isn't iRacing (like me), you'll probably want to keep looking.I had waited over a year for the price of this game to align with what I thought it was worth (based on gameplay videos and reviews), fortunately in one of the sales the GOTY edition was reduced to a decent price (on a side note, the price of the base game in NZ is still frozen at $65.95). What I can say is getting the complete DLC bundle was worth it content-wise: the cars are designed really well and there is a decent variety of classes/disciplines.Aesthetically, this game rates highly. Nice graphics, great looking cars and good looking tracks (if you're not too picky about the lack of licenced sponsors). UI isn't so good (having to restart whenever making graphics changes, no access to any game settings from pause menu).What bothers me about this game is the accuracy of the cars and the AI behaviour. One of my favourite things about racing is endurance races, and I've been looking for a simulator that caters to that. Gran Turismo 4's endurance aspect was excellent for its time; superb car and track accuracy, although limited to 6-car fields and no day/night cycle or dynamic weather. The driving physics of the cars in Project CARS feels quite underdeveloped; the fastest prototype cars top out at 300-310kph, and you'd have to make ridiculously unrealistic setup changes to get them to 340/350 like their real-life counterparts. In addition, the single-player experience feels very unrealistic; AI cars are overly aggressive on corners, and seem to not be subject to any penalties or tyre wear (no matter what the user setting is).I played around with the settings a lot to try and compensate for the downfalls in this game, which says quite a bit about its realism. I will probably continue to play around in race weekend or career mode just to explore the remaining content I've yet to try, and to get a bit more value out of my purchase. If you're a fan of realistic racing simulation with a focus on single-player experience, this game would probably let you down. You're better off waiting for Project CARS 2.TL;DR - Great looking racer, but falls short of Gran Turismo 4 for realism			",44,6,4,9,8,2,12

												This game needs some serious attention before I can recommend it.The most important part of the game - the driving - is fine. Cars seem to understeer a lot but I might just need some time to adjust. Everything else, however, feels unpolished, almost unfinished.The menu is unintuitive and very difficult to navigate with a controller. It doesn't seem possible to enter text with a controller, either, meaning the game isn't really couch-viable.The settings are poorly explained, and far worse, can't be changed during a race. Not even the camera settings. Not even the volume! Changing graphical settings requires a full game restart and there's no borderless fullscreen mode.In career mode, you'll get emails suggesting you reply to them, but you can't; you'll get invitations which you can't accept - you just have to wait until the events in question come up on the calendar; and you'll get the same ""new mail"" popup three times in a row if three messages arrive at the same time.The introduction to the very first level of the career mode, karting, talks about qualifying, but there aren't any qualifying sessions. There are no warm-up sessions, either, so there's no way to acclimatise to the track from within career mode; you're just thrown in and expected to know your way around.Race reports talk about constructors' championship points even though there isn't a constructors' championship in that category. The reports are also extremely generic, not even remarking on championship victories.In the ""accolades"" menu, the counter doesn't seem to match up with the number of visible accolades.The AI is... bad. I've seen worse in driving games, but I've also seen better.Rolling starts are abysmal. This is not a minor complaint; they are truly, absolutely awful, to the point where they shouldn't be in the game. Think you're starting first? Nope, probably second or third by the time the game actually hands you control of your car. That's if there hasn't been a massive crash already (plenty of evidence of these on Youtube if you're interested).Speaking of starts, I've also experienced a glitch where I start 30th on the grid in a four-car multiplayer race, with the other three drivers the full length of the pit straight ahead of me. I asked on Reddit but nobody was able to explain why this happens.The racing line / braking point suggestions are laughably bad. New players would be best off ignoring them.The HUD sometimes goes missing for no reason. I have never switched it off.The race engineer will often be completely silent for 90% of a race, only to radio you on the last lap to say that your teammate is in sixth. Thanks. For. That.I had high hopes for this game but so far I'm feeling pretty disappointed. Not recommended.			",29,16,4,11,11,0,12

												I spent $170 odd bucks buying this and all the DLC's coz I loved it on PS4. But they haven't optomised the gameplay and physics properly for PC so it just drives spastically. Slightest turn of the steering and you jack knife. And no its not me, as I said, I owned it on PS4 and it drove competely differently. I did really well.

												Good♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Nice graphics, dynamic weather, awesome lightning shaft & raining, reflection effects.- Pretty good sound, not vacuum cleaner recording *cough* GT5/6 *cough*. Damn, I played GT so much, the awful sound is the first thing came to mind when comparing every sims to them.- Great physics and force feed back. DOES require time and searching for optimal settings. Kudos to JackSpade's ffb tunings & Roccafellas G29 settings.- The best Racing Sim ever created Imo. GT5/6 is just a DRIVING sim, not even close to Racing, preriod. Forza? People call them Sim? Not even close, well I played FM3,4 on my X360 & Fanatec GT2 and I do know how it feels.- Good Career mode.Bad♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Stupid F uking AI. Yep, they do provide the thrill and challenge but way too aggressive and stupid driving. They always have one target: crash the F you out of the race. Annoying as F, but you know, still the best AI out there, it would be perfect if SMS fix their stupid behaviour.- Although the physic is good but the cars feel so light, one small touch and you'll get spinned out of the track. WTF? GT5/6 is better in this aspect.- Not many cars & tracks as competitors. Ok so should you buy it? F yeah, especially for single player since Career mode and aggressive AI will get you accompanied for quite a while.			",309,74,16,34,38,6,61

												A year with the game, only 85+ hours with it due to time constraints... It's much better than it was on initial release, excellent feel, good selection of cars and better selection of tracks. DLC material is decent, some surprises, and some stuff that's not that useful (mojave desert track is pointless). UI is better than what GT has offered but still annoying to use. Stability under Win10 is a bit rough sometimes and generally speaking there are issues with getting the game running in full screen (like now with the latest Oculus related update). The main point is that playing the actual game is really good. I just hope they sort out the menus and UI, and simplify the tweaking of cars which is overly complex (examples in video of changes and their consequences would have been nice), as nothing's ever really explained to anyone (that's not just this game btw).

												This game is so much fun. It is the first driving sim I've ever played, and I can tell this is something I will be doing for a long time. I bough a used Logitech Driving Force GT steering wheel, and it works great with the game. The car selection is awesome. Carts to F1, amazing road cars, GT cars, and classic cars. The tracks are fantastic. I have a lot of fun just doing time trials in various cars to see how I stand up against other people on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Career mode is a lot of fun, you can start in whatever driving discipline you want, then at the end of the season decide if you want to move up, or stay the same. The AI is really good. I like being able to change their skill level so easily. I can get pole position at AI 70 most of the time now. The tuning options for each vehicle are fantastic. It is definitely difficult to get the hang of tuning, and find good set ups, but there is plenty of help online. Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in driving sims.

												Gave this game an hour and while the graphics looked beautiful, the gameplay was just a little much for a controller to handle. Definitely requires a wheel to play. Would it be a great game? At the price? Sure, but you need that wheel or it's just unplayable.			",52,3,1,2,2,5,8

												This is an excellent racing simulation game and is very fun for both semi-casual and heavy enthusiasts alike. On the face it's just a hard to master racing game but the more you dig the more customization you find. Very enthralling and a great game with a lot of replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I hate serious reviews; all I do is write goofy reviews. But I just rage quit this game again, so serious I'll be: This game is horrible. More succinctly: it's horrible for people that dont take it super seriously.I grew up on racing games; the more realistic, the better. Drove manual, turned off all assists, and never had issues. I do amateur motorsports for fun in real life and in general play around with the physics of cars to learn. The more, the better.Then this game came along. I presumed there'd be a learning curve, but otherwise I know I'd at least enjoy it based on what I've seen and read. So I bought it, installed it, and have spent however many HOURS fighting with it. Tweaking controller settings and tweaking controller settings AND TWEAKING CONTROLLER SETTINGS. There are people that can play this game with no issues, but for whatever reason it is ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to make it where it's comfortable and FUN to play. I KNOW how cars behave; I understand the tiny nuances that can alter/affect vehicle handling. I ♥♥♥♥ing GET physics. But despite knowing that, this crazy♥♥♥♥♥simulation never feels right. The biggest issue is that cars are twitchy and lose grip out of nowhere with no indication or warning. For whatever reason, that kind of feedback is not put into the controller. So I can't count how many times I've completed turns as smoothly as possible and I STILL end up seeing the inside wall from sudden, magical oversteer when exiting a turn.There are plenty of other horrible things about this game like a magical AI that have perfect lines, jacked up power, and adhesive ultra-soft tires when you crank the difficulty. The sound is janky with all noises except your engine being loud as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have all sounds except my engine turned down to 60% and I STILL hear some AI car 100 feet behind me more than I hear my own engine. Overall vehicle choice is incredibly imbalanced and lacking in variety, DLC car packs are usually random crap with no real value. The cursor never goes away despite the fact that I'm using a controller, so I always have to reach out and move the cursor off the screen. Controller settings are CONSTANTLY being reset. Random lock ups and crashes abound. Plus whenever you're in the zone and concentrating on finding an opening to pass, that IDIOT pit chief starts yapping and it makes me lose it EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. No way to turn him off, either. I know how to strategize my own movements, I don't need pre-recorded garbage chirping in when I need distraction the least.Just so many tiny things that add up to the THE most disappointing game purchase I think I've ever made. I was ready to adore this game and all that ever happens is I try to play and I end up screaming so much my throat hurts and rage quit 10 minutes later. To me it's an ultra simulation that requires a wheel and insane amounts of tinkering to be able to enjoy. There's no fun ""out of the box"", and it's for that reason I can't recommend this game. Not to casual gamers like myself that would rather play a game than tinker with it to no avail.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project cars is a strange bag, I first played the game on my pc with a AMD video card and game ran like an Elephant seal smoking a rizzler. I now have a 1080 and an i7 6700k. In general the game now runs fine apart from these very annoying hitches which can be as long as 2 seconds sometimes. It can happen when crashing into a cone or just before a bend its all a little random and dropping settings does not sort this issue out.Also I have a g290 wheel which the game is suposed to support. It has the wheel in its menus with a lovely big picture of the wheel itself, so there is no doubt that the game supports it. Problem is the Force feedback is all over the place.It feels like the FFB is reveresed somehow as it actually turns itself violently and can judder even when the car is at a stand still. After a crash, when the damage is set on full and real, the ffb will make the wheel go off at an angle. This seems to then be saved like that somehow even after exiting that race and starting another even with a different car.I have every other racing game working with the wheel even games that don't directly support it, yet project cars that does support it, has me wrestling a pig every time I try and play.Their seems to be problems with some of the physics with various cars still simply just not acting correctly and maybe this also has a knock on effect for the FFB.Standing still at the start of the race the ffb will go full lock itself in either direction if you turn the wheel slightly. Something is just broken with the FFB.I have a feeling if there was a reverse FFB setting in the game like other games have I am sure it would sort out the issues. Another game I have which has a reverse FFB setting gives the same effect that project cars displays when changing this setting. Even if they could put it in a ini file for now i believe it would help greatly.The game itself has so many ffb settings not only as a global group but then also each car has to be tweaked. Many of the settings will be meaningless to many people and even those who have tweaked them still change their minds to what settings to use. They need simplifying and given real world names so people can understand what they do. Only half the settings actually have in game explanations you have to guess the rest. I have a feeling many people have settled on settings and still dont realise that the ffb could actually be reveresd and not working correctly.Due to the freezes and the ffb issues I can't give the game a good review. Any game that hitches or stutters is bad but more so when it is a racing game. If it freezes just before a bend you have had it and will crash the car as soon as it  unfreezes itself.

												Good game, however theres one thing that annoys the hell out of me and thats the cut track penalty you get even when your knocked off the track by the AI or other players... its a problem thats been there for awhile from my research on the issue so I don't expect it to be sorted anytime soon or ever..... but if you can look past that then its a great game.

												I haven't played a lot of it, just about 10hrs, but I can allready say that it is a legit racing simulator. It has a realistic throttle controll and steering, that's why it's a must have if you own a somewhat good of a wheel. I'm playing with an Xbox controller, so it is harder for me to straighten out the car and get good times.I'm not really into the career yet, mostly played multiplayer, but it seems like it will be quite fun too, because there is somewhat an NBA vibe to it with the ''twitter'' feedback from fans, that are changing depending on your results and the fact that you can look at your stats.I'm more a rally guy, but with all the DLC's it has a lot of cars and is very fun to play.

												The developers of Project Cars have nailed the driving experience to perfection.  The cars and tracks look fantastic, the graphics are superb and the user interface is intuitive.  Replaying your best performances is a joy.  There are some superb racing simulators on the market, e.g Assetto Corsa but Project Cars just pips it by a head.  I haven't played Dirt Rally but the review feedback looks very promising.  But if you are after a track bonanza then look no further than Project Cars. WELL DONE SLIGHTLY MAD STUDIO's for this game.Purchase 20 games on STEAM this month and this is at the top of the list for replayability and sheer fun.  Witcher 3 and GTA5 are taking a back seat to this game.			",35,0,4,4,7,1,13

This game makes the simulator really shine.  The physics feedback on  the simular are mind blowing.  This game is simply the best looking racing simulatino game EVER!!  I have a 2-way Nvidia 1080 powering 3x ultra wide monitors at 10K, and I'm just blown away at the details and the quality of the shaders.  The force feedback and audio are top notch.Small wishes...1.  The multiplayer mode suffers from small freeze when people join/leave the race. (quiters)2.

												I know that i only have 4.5 hrs of game time as of this review but I bought this game to play very casually, and just to experience a bit of fun.Simply put with a steering wheel (Logitech G29) this game is fun, am i a racing fanatic no, do i love cars yes, is this game accessible yes. Graphics are great , i run everything on ultra with my R9 290x with no issue, are the car sounds any good? certainly no worse then most i think assetto corsa has better car sounds but this has a better sound track, frankly i don't think many car games get the car sounds right so if anything the car sounds are on par with most.I do think the price is a bit steep but really there is enough content to keep you going if you want to practice till you get it right.Any bugs? only had a full screen problem when i first installed the game (game would always run in window mode, nothing a 20 second google search didn't solve).Am I satisfied after a quick blast the Azure Coast track? Yes, even my fiance loves taking the Toyota GT-86 for a quick drive down the coast!			",39,8,4,9,7,0,1

												Really good game,I highly recomment it if you love cars and car simulators.Very realistic and amazing  graphics!I own this game for almost a year and I have not stopped enjoying it.I wish it had more free cars.There 50 free (really cool most of them) but you can buy dlcs for more cars if you like(I have bought some of them and it's worth the money).There are a lot of race tracks!At the beginning you might find it hard to drive your car(especially if you turn all the assists off, like I did), but don't get disapointed you will get used to it and you will really enjoy it! It's a sim this is how it is supposed to be!!I am using a xbox 360 controller and it feels ok with me,but I think a gaming steering will be perfect for this game!The best part is you can use a vr to play this game!Gaming steering wheel and vr with this game is going to be awesome.For me this is the perfect vr game!My rating is 9.0/10 !

Posted: May 19, 2016
												Wonderful graphics. Nice Lighting. Beautifully made cars. But all that glitters is not gold:There are three things that let this otherwise brilliant sim down, and they do so in a way that begins as an irritation and ends with utter frustration. 1. There is evidence that the developers have applied an unnecessary and very counter-productive control freakery over the  complete lack of user-adjustments in very key areas. While there are endless user preferences for graphics there are almost NONE regarding sound. I find it extraordinary that a sim of this beauty does not allow me to adjust relative sounds, AT ALL. Balance between ai, crowd, engine, user car, tyre noise, skid noise HAS to be user-oriented. It is no good to say ""we know what is best"" because everyone's sound systems are different and everyone's hearing is different.For me the ai sounds and crowd sounds become excruciatingly annoying. Without actually being there, the visceral aid of tyre scrub and squeel is absolutely vital, however good the force feedback is. Yet SMS have, despite thousands of requests to provide proper sound sliders, ignored these requests. Since those requests were made, well over a year ago, they have issued multiple patches and several addon packs, but they have not listened to an overwhelmingly popular request for sound balance sliders. This simple function cannot possibly be hard to implement.Without these sliders the whole sim for me is ruined. You might think that sound balance is not important, but it is a vital part of what makes a racing sim playable.2. Some cars have decent physics, but the majority of them default to understeer. An example is the otherwise excellent Lotus 25 in the classic pack DLC. They have ruined this car by making it almost impossible to get rid of the inherent understeer. While the L25 is commendably stable in a straight line it is just too easy to drive around bends, even if you set ridiculously loose rear suspension. BTW the power diff is the wrong way round compared to the description, and that brings me conveniently on to the next big issue:3. The user interface and total lack of proper explanations and help are staggeringly inept. The interface is designed like a trendy blog with large on-screen squares and fancy graphics, but none of them give any proper info. You spend an inordinate amount of time clicking back and forth between these glitzy menu items to no avail. The whole interface is counter-intuitive and laborious. Let's give an example of user setups, car setups and control setups. None of these functions have a clear way of saving preferences. One makes adjustments and hopes they stick, but they often do not. There is no menu that says ""save your user file HERE"". There is just a save button, but WHERE is this function saved TO? And how does one recall or load these preferences?The user driver naming, career mode and creation and saving is preposterously confusing and poorly done. I created then deleted several times a new driver / user name but in the pit menu my name is NOT linked to my chosen name but my Steam nickname. Why? I create a career name but it does not appear in the drop down list of drivers, so what is the point of choosing a career name? If I have misunderstood this then I acknowledge it, but why do I have to run through hoops to understand it, or rather not understand it?Now we come to saving car setups. This is as confusing as it is possibly to be. In ""My garage"" there is an option to choose a car and a livery. You can make a car setup here which is odd because you are not on a race track when you do so. How counter-intuitive is that! But if you first go to a quick race and try to save a setup there, in the very place where setups are relevant, you can't, or at least not reliably. There is a save button but it doesn't load later unless you FIRST make a car setup before you actually go to the race/pit menu. You have to go back to the My Garage menu, save a setup there, then edit and save it within the pit menu later. Again I might have misunderstood and there could be ways around it, but I do not see how.Moreover, the setup saving is badly explained and further confusing. There is an option to save to ""ALL"" or to the track you are currently at. But if you try to save to ""ALL"" there appears to be no evidence that it is saved. There is no drop down list of your saves. I find this incredible. It appears that you cannot pick or experiment with several different setups from a pre-saved list. There IS no list! As far as I can see, you can only save one setup per car per track. rFactor, GTL, and even GPL from sixteen years ago had his function!MANUAL======I see a link to a ""digital manual"" and go there. It is NOT a manual! It is a brief explanation of some of the functions, but there is no detail. For example there is no in depth explanation of the many parameters in Force Feedback and nor is there any detailed explanation of any other function. They are broad headings with a terse paragraph or two but no clear guide to every function. How can a developer spend years making a potentially great product and then not bother to write a decent manual? If you buy for example a flight sim addon, there are typically several user help documents, many of them running to hundreds of pages with summaries, details and every single function explained.Conclusion: This could be a wonderful sim. It would be so if the key areas are addressed, and they are a very poor user interface whose slick graphics hide an essentially confusing and clunky user experience, questionable physics which seem to me to be somewhat dumbed down for the sake of games consoles/arcade users and xbox-type controllers, and a complete lack of user control of essential sound balance options.

												This game is so much fun. It is the first driving sim I've ever played, and I can tell this is something I will be doing for a long time. I bough a used Logitech Driving Force GT steering wheel, and it works great with the game. The car selection is awesome. Carts to F1, amazing road cars, GT cars, and classic cars. The tracks are fantastic. I have a lot of fun just doing time trials in various cars to see how I stand up against other people on the Nurburgring Nordschleife. Career mode is a lot of fun, you can start in whatever driving discipline you want, then at the end of the season decide if you want to move up, or stay the same. The AI is really good. I like being able to change their skill level so easily. I can get pole position at AI 70 most of the time now. The tuning options for each vehicle are fantastic. It is definitely difficult to get the hang of tuning, and find good set ups, but there is plenty of help online. Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in driving sims.

												For starters the game is very fun, and it looks gorgeous. I don't regret choosing it for my first PC racing game. In career mode I will say though that Kart One racing is VERY frustrating. The handling of the kart is just... stupid. Super Kart (the next tier) is much better, though it can feel unstable at high speeds. Rookie Formula is where things get pretty good. Throughout the game, the AI can be... a little inconsiderate. The moment I go off the track and into the grass, it's as if I'm not there to them. You can imagine what happens when I try to merge back onto the track. At the moment there are a couple bugs, one being that the racing guide line doesn't display the color green sometimes and only displays yellow and red. This can be a pain if I'm new to a track and don't have an idea of proper speed in certain spots yet. This is a rare bug mind you. I also think the game has an oversight in fuel load calculations. A max fuel load in Formula A (only time I noticed it) didn't provide me enough fuel to run a full length race, and in Formula A refueling during the race isn't available. Either I did something wrong with my tuning setup or it's an oversight and needs to be fixed, otherwise I'm stuck running 50% length races. All in all, the game is great. Lots of pros to outweight the few cons. If you have a racing wheel or plan on getting one, you should consider getting this game. It's a good deal for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those who think it's too hard to drive with keyboard, well here's something for you to see:http://dai.ly/x5b6asdThe only problem with the above video is that it was recorded with the default graphics settings which was a little too high for my laptop PC so it was a bit sluggish with the steering and throttle response.After lowering some options and restarting the game and race, it was a much better driving experience. Lots of ways to tweak for best results. Game is good at  it's current 80% off discounted price but i got it from Humble Bundle with a few other games at about SGD$2 more. Though i've only started playing this, i can't forsee any problem with it. AI behaviour at Novice setting is quite tame. Car handling is not a problem at all with keyboard.It's a 2015 release yet very much compatible with my 2011 hardware. Get it if you're brave enough to try; worth the price for its content. 8/10Here is the retry after reducing resolution to 720p windowed and other reduction in details:

												** edit 7/1/15Although they still haven't fixed the bug with the car setup resetting when entering the pitbox during career practice, I feel there have been a significant amount of bug fixes that I can change this to a recommended. The game is playable as long as I do my car setups in free practice sessions outside of the career mode.  Its not ideal, but there is no denying the gameplay is excellent and graphics are beautiful; recent bug fixes have improved performance in general.**edit 6-12-15**patch 1.4 still does not resolve the car setup problems.  Steam cloud sync is also an option available but ""not implemented, most devs stopping using it because it caused game crashes"".  **edit** a major patch (1.4) has been announced to address many of the bugs, however no release date has been announced as of today (6/10/15)I currently can't recommend this game.  If slightly mad studios would release some bug fixes, I might change my mind.  It seems they're more concerned with fixing bugs on XBOX.I waited for pCars to come out for a year...It's been out for a month and I haven't played it since the first week of release because of game breaking bugs that I do not have the time to work around.  The biggest one being that the car setup resets itself every time you come into the pits during practice.  This means that to tune your car, you have to write down every change you made and then redo them all to make a simple tweak to the setup. You'll also have to redo them for every session (qual and race). I also run an AMD R9  290 which was a big investment a year ago and it struggles with the high settings to keep 60fps due to the lack of AMD support (which they claim is an AMD driver issue, funny I don't have any other games affected by this issue that weren't poorly designed in the first place).pCars was plagued by delays to release a ""more polished version"" but I think it was still premature.  Now they have the audacity to sell us DLC's. The only bug fix they released was almost an insult it was so lacking in real bug fixes.  I was also unimpressed with the force feedback settings; they're over complicated (only devs would know what half the settings do) and the user guide doesn't explain themWait for a sale and some bug fixes before you invest into this game.

												This game is currently the best PC Racing simulation available that doesn't require the player to be an actual profesional driver to get any real enjoyment out of it.Pros- Fantastic visuals- Great driving model, that can be customized to be either accessible (while retaining most of its simulation aspects) or very realistic- Tons of tracks to drive on, way more than in other similar games- Lots of cars to drive, all of which feel very different- While a steering wheel is the way to go for a game like this, it's also surprisingly playable with a standard gamepad.- Frequent updatesCons- Fairly buggy game, particularly when it comes to racing rules- Requires a very powerful computer to get good performance. Runs particularly poorly on AMD video cards.			",288,67,8,53,28,6,51

												I quite like this game. I play using the Logitech G27 racing wheel and I find that it works very well with Project Cars. The graphics are great and the sounds are as well. The only drawback in my opinion is the car selection. I love racing the GT cars and whatnot but I would love to see a large road car pack to be released, even if it cost a fair bit. I came from Forza 4 which had many road cars and It was a lot of fun to challenge your friends in slower cars, especially the ones you could hope to own, and I think that this aspect would be even better on this game. Overall this game is a huge jump from forza and definitely on the same level if not better than Assetto Corsa.			",70,10,6,6,6,0,3

												I would definitely reccomend this game. I am defintely not a hard core sim racer, however i like a bit of realism with my g27. I play a bit of a lot of racing sims, and for plain fun, this is the best one. I know Assetto has better physics, however i wouldn't put pCars far behind. Plus the graphics are stunning. Runs smooth, however some extra cars and tracks would be nice. So easy to navigate the menu, and it's quick. No waiting for cutscenes or having to press exit 5 times. Just click it once and you're out!Online is so easy, just jump in a game, or make your own lobby! something most other racing sims haven't got right yet. It's fantastic being able to jump into a lobby, set my car and track and my friends just join in. If you want a game to play with friends and is great fun, this is it.Oh and the Weather is absolutely amazing. I would reccomend the game simply for the weather.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a heap of racing games over the last 29 years and this one has really annoyed me. Riddled with weird bugs that like to jump out at you at random times and a draving feel that feels terrible. Each car feels exactly the same in that they all handle like you're on ice. It's such a strange driving experience and it's very annoying. I've played the♥♥♥♥♥♥off Gran Turismo 1,2,3,4,5 etc and the Forza games and each car feels slightly different be it heavy, tail happy, understeering, fast on the acceleration or a mix of a few and so on. However, unfortunatly, the vehicles here all feel like you're playing Car Curling. Y'know the one, a long path of ice and you throw a heavy weight down it? This is what this game feels like. Point the car forward, accelerate and hope the wind or some other force of nature just happens to move you from side to side. Very unpredictable driving and a serious let down.

												Well, here we go with my initial impressions and I'm not going to sugar coat it.  The good:  Awesome selection of cars and tracks + an extensive career mode.  The visuals and sound is also brilliant.  Very nice damage model.The less than good:  The physics doesnt feel right for something that is supposed to be more sim orientated that an arcade game.  Dont get me wrong, this is no need for speed but somehow it feels like its not entirely there.  I have more fear of corners in GRID than in Project cars.  It just takes so much to unsettle a car but when that happens you have no idea that you are on the edge until you loose it and correcting the car is impossible as it feels like you are skidding on ice.  Getting  the force feedback on my wheel (G27) dialed in properly was an absolute nightmare and still it is severely lacking.  The lack of proper feedback through the wheel is terrible and it robs you of so much.  This is probably my single biggest issue as it makes it very difficult to figure out how close you are taking the car to the edge.  In Assetto Corsa I can feel so much more via the wheel and that title really lets you know what is happening with the car.  I am hoping that I will be able to work around this when I have Simvibe set up...but ultimately some fixingfrom the developer would be required. Performance wise, this is definitely a title that can bring your rig to its knees.  I run an i72600K (4.4Ghz), 16GB RAM and a GTX980 SLI setup and had to fiddle to get it to feel smooth (even at a framerate of above 100fps there seems to be lag with all settings on max).  Dropping the motion blur as well as the AA settings, fixed this quite nicely and the game is definitely not much worse off eye candy wise.  My verdict at this point is that there is still a lot of work to be done and some refinement is needed.  If you are looking for the best looking racing ""sim"" around, this is it.  To those of you who are used to Assetto Corsa, note that this will probably not draw you away from your AC fix, even when Kunos does an update and breaks stuff.  Project Cars is beautiful but does not rival AC for feel or realism.  Update (2015/06/30):  After spendig quite some time with this, I can honestly say that this game is sh*t.  It looks great but the physics and AI suck.  Cars dont get unsettled when you try to do so but the handling goes for a ball of cr@p FOR NO APPARENT REASON!!!  AI is dumb as SH!T as well.  especially in wet races.  So if you fancy a demolition derby game, this will knock your socks off.  Unless they fix the issues properly regarding the FFB and physics I will most likely end up not playing it anymore...  Simvibe helps with adding some feedback but you can only do so much with a flawed physics engine, dumbass AI and poor FFB.THIS IS RUBBISH...GIVE IT A PASS.  DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!As of Patch 9.0:The game has improved somewhat although the issues with FFB, AI and physics still persist.  SMS seem to be fixing some things with every patch but glaring omissions like triple screen support has been dropped altogether with focus being more on DLC.  Said DLC for the most part is not bad but it would be nice if the core issues with the game were fixed in full.   Unfortunately the physics and handling of the cars still feels somewhat suspect. Fps also seems to be inconsistent.  When i fire it up, it may run at 52fps or double that.  Seems like the luck of the draw.  I keep hoping that PCars will become what it said on the box...  Sadly 9 patches down it still does not exactly cut it and with PCars2 on its way, i wonder if there will be another 9 patches deployed to fix things before no 2 is all the rage and this one is left by the wayside.  Needless to say I will most likely not support SMS in their new endeavors.  PCars is no longer a flaming ball of crap...but a smoldering ball of crap is not a much better experience in the end.  It still stinks, just not as bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great Simcade (more arcade than sim), it's like a combination of Forza and NFS Shift. They fixed the input lag from the previous NFS Shift games. The cars feel quite good, though the physics aren't that accurate in my opinion. Cars sound decent, they covered alot of rare tracks ( e.g Hockenheim Ring or Oschersleben). I'm racing with my g27 (great rig btw) and the FFB isn't that good compared to Asseto Corsa. Just like I said, it's more of a Simcade than a Sim...

However, if you like racing games like Forza where you can upgrade various parts of your cars, and where you can buy the cars you use in ""Career"" mode, this may not be the game for you.  I really did like that part of Forza, and Project CARS doesn't have it.  It is, regardless, an excellent game.			",45,4,2,6,8,0,12

												Despite all the controversy thrown towards this game and SMS I have thouroughly enjoyed my experience with pCARS, thank you to WMD and SMS for all the hard work that's went in to it.In short it's a good sim but not perfect in every way but overall it's a good first step towards something potentially great. I use a wheel and the game feels good physically. it's a sim and no doubt about that. Maybe not as advanced as iRacing or even AC with their laser scanned tracks but it's definitely up there with the best of them. Personally I think pCARS offers more options out the box than any other racing sim out there. From day to night transitions and weather transitions to timed 24 hour races I can't ask for much more. Okay maybe i can but this game is taking steps in the right direction when it comes to what I want to see in a racing sim.The car selection is good if you are in to motorsport but it is mostly european based manufacturers at the time of writing/typing this. Don't expect to see rally or JDM or even your daily driver in this game as it's more than likely not in it, the list is growing and expanding with the release of reasonably priced monthly DLC which will continue on to be base content for pCARS2 though so it's nice to see the list evolving. I'd like to see more American and Asian manufacturers added to the list along with cars from racing series in each region, that being said we are expecting to finally see the C7R finally from March 1st onwards! The cars come track prepared or they are already fully prepared racecars and all fit nicely in to their assigned classes so there is no modifying the cars or adding aero kits etc. in this game, you can however alter the tuning set ups quite extensively which is the most important thing for me. pCARS has a very reasonable track list with enough tracks to keep a good balance of varition, most tracks are real world tracks bar a few which are fictional road courses or tracks such as Cali Highway, Bannochbrae or Sakitto which was the result of a failed licence attempt to obtain Suzuka. Laser scanned tracks are probably this games only downfall as it has none, it would be nice to have the track surfaces accurately represented but this would involve a lot of work and would probably result in less tracks overall. The detail is still good and the artisits have done a great job recreating the tracks but it would be nice to see SMS adding some laser scanned tracks in the future to fully take advantage of the in game physics. The multiplayer is no where near as dialled in as the service iRacing offers and there are always going to be the odd few silly people there to ruin races in open public lobbies but this isn't a subcription service, there are good racers online though and good races to be had especially if you want to use pCARS to host league races. The multiplayer has been a relatively stable experience for me but I have experienced the odd few random disconnects. I prefer multiplayer racing over solo career racing but i gave it a shot anyway. The career has a good concept behind it but maybe lacking some depth to immerse players in to the role of a race car driver. Also the AI is far too risky and aggressive when it comes to racecraft and track position, it would be good to see an improvement to this in the future as personally this is what put me off the career mode in pCARS. Also the Karts in pCARS don't quite feel right, you can still drive them fine but there's something a bit off about them and i've heard some people say that they're quite difficult to drive with a controller.The Monthly time trial events are fun to keep up with also if time attack type events are your thing, fastest lap wins, simple as that. To close this review i'd just like to say that despite a controversial start, this game has delivered enough to allow it to compete with other sims on the market, it's certainly worth a buy if you want to get in to sim racing or if you're already a sim racer looking for more features to add to your races.

												I already loved this game, because for me it's an almost perfect arcade/sim blend. That's all realy up to personal preference though. What isn't, is that Project CARS looks great. The latest update added VR support. I've played several races with my Vive now, and after I finish this review I plan on jumping back in, and not leaving the cockpit for a long while. The immersion is great, and it runs perfectly fine on my FX-8350, 8GB of whatever DDR3 was cheap, and R9 Fury.Now back to crashing.			",79,11,3,12,25,1,6

												bloody brilliant. nuff said. was my original review. Living with this game for a little while now the well documented bugs that they have just ignored spoils it. yes it is a great game when it works but you really have to keep your fingers crossed that it does.  its all ok though they have started on project cars 2 now. I think they should polish this turd for a little longer before making the next. Also this is gammer funded, so we pay them to make the game then buy it off them, and we fell for it hook line and sinker.			",101,13,4,12,8,1,16

												Very good game. The graphics are top notch, the realism is great. From highly detailed cars and tracks, to ever changing weather conditions, this game delivers a very photorealistic racing expeirence that is very enjoyable. While this game might lack a huge catalog of cars and tracks, the effort put into the cars and tracks that you do get makes up for it. The AI is decent, but has some flaws, they are notorious for trying to ram you off the track. Overall I really enjoy the game.			",9,1,1,2,6,0,3

												Nice game...except for the AI and Force Feedback.  Force feedback, out of the box (T500RS wheel) feels like just spring mostly.  Some cars you can't feel the car at all.  And the road (bumps and kerbs) are not very much.The AI are bad.  I mean the AI REALLY REALLY SUCK!  Haven't been able to finish a race because the AI drive right through me on the corners.  Watching the replay they don't even react util a split second before the hit me.  If they have a car in front of them (you or AI) they will dive bomb the corner and fly off the opposite side of the track.  I've had them go 3 wide into a corner with me...with all 3 of us sliding off the track.  They just don't drive a corner right, even by themselves.  Last moment braking, sliding thru the corner, no exit speed.  It's so easy to pass them...but beware the next corner because you will be taken out if you don't have at least a 1 second lead.I race offline for fun so I race AI all the time.  Game Stock Car Edition has great AI.  A/C lesser so.  But these AI are the worst for a newer game.  The old Simbin games are better, and they were bad to begin with.I still recommend the game, if only for the great graphics, and good car and track selection.  But I wish there was a undecided option.			",20,1,15,0,17,0,0

												So, Project Cars. This is my first steam review ever so pardon me if it's not that helpfulI bought this game in the Steam sale, and let me tell ya, it's fun. When you start.The game feels... weird. When you start out, with the go-karts, the game is great. Superkarts was great fun for me and i was getting progessively better as I learned what everything does and learned how to tune, what to tune and why.At this point I was having a lot of fun with the game, but as the game progressed, as tracks got more complex, you could start to see the cracks show up with bumps in the road that literally sent the car flying, AI cutting corners like it's nothing (and not getting punished by it), crashing into you when you're CLEARLY not doing anything wrong (following a racing line, and doing everything perfect), etc.When I left karting, I left this game. I played a couple of seasons of Karts, and won the second one when I already knew the tracks and was used to the car. I moved forward, only to see that the cracks that were simply annoying in Karting were gigantic and horrible in other disciplines. From being unable to heat up your wheels, to the AI straight up ramming you, to the AI not being affected by tyre wear or weather conditions, to tracks being bumpy where they're not supposed to, and oh so many more issues.I'll admit, I had my fun with the game. Karting was extremely fun and challenging and I was playing in the hardest difficulty and winning but not by too much. But then the cracks start to show and things start to get weird and you just get frustrated with the game and stop playing it.If you can get this game for less than 20 of your currency (dollars, euros, pounds), it is worth some 20h of playtime and you can judge yourself if that's worth it for you or not. But for the full price, the game is not worth it as you will not put enough hours into it to make it ""cheap"" so to say. Unless you wanna be a kart racer for the rest of your life.

												For those curious about how the game runs on AMD systems as of 02/10/16My specs: FX-8350 @4.0ghz, R9-290X, 16gb ram, 1080p. Latest AMD drivers installed.In game graphics settings: FXAA=HIGH (no other AA turned on), textures, enviroment, track detail=HIGH. Shadows, particles, grass=MEDIUM. Car detail=ULTRA.Tested for about an hour on only a couple of tracks and weather settings. Seems like those are the main things that affect FPS. With clear weather and daytime it mostly stayed around 60 but then I tried a race with heavy thunderstorms and it stayed around 25-45fps the entire time. Luckily when it does drop frames it's not too jarrring (like an action game would be for example) and is still very playable. Some tracks and weather conditions affect performance more than others and you probably won't have a stable framerate all the time. Because of this problem I don't recommend you buy the game at full price if you're playing on AMD hardware, I got it for 60% off and i'm fairly happy with it. Certainly not the best running game ever but not Arkham Knight either.			",122,24,1,20,11,0,7

												This game definetly has some perks, but i can't reccomend it, it has 0 customazation whatsoever, which i always thought was 50% of the fun in Forza or any other racing sim. the only cool thing about this is the contracts, and team sign ons, thats pretty cool, but you dont make moeny at all, so its kind of pointless, its not like any specific team is better than another, theyre jsut random names. when you sign on, it will give you a brief description on what kind of races youll be in. for example, the junior gt40, what does that even mean? lol sounds to me like go kart racing, which they do ahve BTW.  Pros:team sign onrealistic driving (somewhat)game runs smoothlythere is a qualifying roundCons:no customizationno currencytuning is not in depthcant chane tuning units (wtf does 1.8 bar mean?, how about some PSI here?)game seems more like work than actually fun, i would place 20th in the qualifying, but first in the race? i guess...game is difficult to navigateyou have no idea what your getting into when you sign the contractevery race all the vehicles are the same (i guess not bad for some, but i prefer vareity)if you like Forza or Gran Turismo, DO NOT BUY THIS you will be dissappointed			",10,4,6,4,26,0,5

Patching and fixing whatever is found, adding more options to races (Timed races , like in the Endurance series, are coming too), and the DLCs are not too shaby when taken for bang for your buck.Overall, after 200 Hours, so far i can recommend it. No, it's not perfect (show me a game that is), but all the major bugs have been iron'd out...Plus, it has Oculus Rift DK2 support!			",221,35,15,15,34,5,39

So im running a test bed on the Nürburgring in all the rear wheel drive cars , some are ok and some deffo need a new set upGraphics are decent and quite a few cars and tracks to play with..no complaints there and after 6 hours play im getting in the groove...decent game, you really do need a wheel for this.Using a Driving Force GT wheel...you can pick em up on ebay for under 20 quid..if you do have this set up i recommend not installing the recommended drivers, i just have logitec gaming software installed for my G700s mouse and the wheel works fine on all games, also set you throttle&brake pedal to 0 for both sensitivity and dead zone cause on any other setting the throttle and brake are either on or off.

												Great game... good selection of cars, great driving dynamics, great audio and great graphics. I have hundreds of hours logged playing gran turismo and many other racing games and so far, this is my favorite. The two things I wish it had are a wider array of production cars so I could drive my own car or something like it and performance upgrades on those cars. Thats one of my favorite parts of gran turismo that this game doesnt have. However, the things this game does, it does well. I bought iRacing and it is a good game but I like this better. I would much rather pay the 1 time price of this game than all the nickle and dime stuff that iRacing pulls. Not to mention this game loads much faster and doesnt have the stupid browser based login. The saddest thing of all, iRacing was released in 2008 where as this game was released in 2015. A 7 year headstart and project cars has already surpassed them in my opinion.			",52,2,5,6,1,0,3

												WARNING: DEFAULT SETTINGS FOR CONTROLLER ARE GARBAGE (you can fix it)WARNING: TO GET TRACKIR WORKING YOU NEED TO CLICK 'SHARED MEMORY' IN VIDEO SETTING(wtf?)Got it for $15 with all DLCs with that Humble Bundle deal. I got that bunble just for this game, others are just a number in my library. I've donated 14.01 to charity. .69 went to Developer and the rest as Humble Bundle tip.Something you should know about me:My prior exprience: GT Legends, GT5, Forza 5, Forza: Apex. Dirt 2, 3.  I played NSF but I don't like them (besides Snoops Dogg Underground - Riders of the Storm pimp my ride edition, that game was so good!). I do understand that realistic racing is hard, like really hard. It takes many years of experience just to get decent. Unless I'm getting paid for it I would get bored and move on to another thing before becoming pro-simmer (it sounds kinda gay being a pro at a simulator anyways, so why would I do that in first place?).  I'm also pretty bad at spelling and words I write have bad sentence structure.What I was looking for: Racing GAME. One that makes you feel that speed and sometimes let you do a sweet pass and feel good about yourself. Game that makes you feel like you are Michael Schumaher himself without years of experience or talent.  I only bought it because Forza: Apex doesn't have much content and I need something to scract the itch.This game is claiming to be Realistic. Looking at prior reviews it looks like some nerds are saying that this game is not realistic at all. They use homoerotic buzzwords such as laser scanner tracks, tire dynamics, rubber build up, track calculated surface condition, optimum track temperature...etcetera.. Sometimes they even spell tires with a ""y"" to sound smart.  Well to be honest, I don't care if this game is realistic, I'm here to have fun.  I've never raced a race car on a race track, I have zero reference point and so do 99% of people that make such comments. However I turn off all assists in Forza and give myself like 1 rewind per 5 laps, this gives me a plenty of challenge.This game also gives me a vibe that some old geiser who doesn't understand vidya games was in charge of some critical parts of this game.Negatives:- I'm 50% sure with full confidence representation of my racing experience that this game does not model real life racing to full extent. Tangent of tyre pressure doesn't seem to fit in equation θ=2sin−1(L2ro), this game just doesn't solve for x, y? Left rear passanger tyre slipage coefficient is not calibrated properly based on quantum entanglment of Pie divided by root square. I've also can tell that with seven sigma confidence that they used wrong wavelengt when they scanned some of the tracks, 14.136  nanometers is where its at, you proably noticed it yourself while passing 2nd turn on Monza. Right?- Career is garbage. You can control too much in it. That is no fun unless you are weird. I want some challenge. Imagine if in Doom 2 message popped up before you open a door and asked how many monster you want in the next room? Sounds kinda of stupid, well that is what this game is. There is no risk = reward. Why am I raging when I slipped on turn 5 on 7th lap? You don't develop Stockholm Syndrome with yourself? There must be outside source, alway. It is your job as a game developer to figure it out and give me an adequate challenge and present it in 3 or 5 setting (Hint: Middle one should not make me feel like a b**ch unless its that souls game). GT Legends, was great in that aspect. It cars that you can buy with money and you had to win races to get to another class. GT5 had a very good system too that involved money, but some japanese autists decided to sell cars for how much they are worth in real life dollars  (I would have to complete like 500 races to get that old a** ferrari that is not even that good, wtf? I spent like half a million dollars on that old Cobra that looked sweet. Var was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- too much oversteer, I raged so hard, it must a been pay back for Nagasaki I swear. Screw you Kazumori Yamachi !!! )- Menu music is horrible. Did the old people pick it? I googled the guy who composed all of the music. It is the same dude who did GT Legends, that menu music was good it was funky with that sweet guitar solo, not that robot fart noise they went with or that fat lady singing in foreground. W.T.F? Seiously google song called Zed from GT Legends, that song will make you want to race like a mothatf... What happened to that dudes talent? My guess: Like all music careers, it all goes to a breaking point of when drugs and fame will takea  hold of you.- Terrible AI. I realize that a novel can be written about those pesky other racers in this game, i will keep it brief. You can read other comments below to get more detail. It is ok if I ram other cars, not ok if they do. When I play a game I AM Gerald of Rivia, I AM Commander Shepard, I AM HALO! Not your B***ch that you run off the road. I don't think I've see one pass another in identical vehicle. - Some nerd is going to rage reading this: NO REWIND option in this game. Especially with AI kamikazi or glitches that was a ballsy move for them not to develop it. I understand that GT legends didn't have tha feature, and it is my favorite racing game, but that was decade and a half ago, back in 2006. We are past that point. I don't feel like restarting a race every time I mess up. It's no fun. Dude I'm a human being I make mistakes.   I've also have a job and other things to do in real life. I don't have time to restart 15 lap race cause I slipped on lap 10. This is not real life, there is no champagne bottle and girl won't kiss you on the cheek after you did good. What is the point? At the end of the day you are just good at some game, go ahead and tell your mom, she will bring you some tendies.- To change any graphical settings you need to RESTART THE GAME. - That pit crew guy is annoying. He nevers tells you anything legit that is worth your time. Just some useless pep talk like: ""Go faster and you will pass the guy in front of you"", Ok thanks Sherlock.- I use racing line in solo mode to dial in on the car and understand its limits. Racing line is garbage too. Neutral:- You get all cars right away. Which is kinda stupid. No sense of progression. But some impatient people might like that. - Not that many selection of cars in base game. I would be fine with it. GT Legends had 4 classes with like 15 cars or something, I only used 5 cars entire game (lotus cortina is the best!) . You don't need every single car in the world to be honest. It takes hours to learn just one car. I would be fine if it had like 2 cars per class. Amount of tracks is what counts.- Twitter? why? Did the geisers who picked the menu music thought that kids will like it? ""Hey There Fellow Kids! We got Twitter!""- weird microsoft metro menu layout just like in GT5. I hate tiles.Positive: - I'm 50% sure with racing experience that I've acquired by playing video games and driving my Honda Accord to work that this game represents real life racing. Based on my research utilizing 6 steps of scientific method I can say that in Theory delta pie variation of Camber angle is modeled properly. But that is just my Theory. I know those things trust me.- Graphics are great- Sound is very good- Track IR works as inended- Lots of vehicles that show Gear # inside the vehicle  (I like to play without HUD for immersion).- HUD is great too if you like to use it, it even lets you customize it!!!I don't recommend this as a single player racing game that has a CAREER progression. Which is sad because I really hoped to be balls deep in this game when I bough it. How ever I will start it up and do a lap every now and then.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game... good selection of cars, great driving dynamics, great audio and great graphics. I have hundreds of hours logged playing gran turismo and many other racing games and so far, this is my favorite. The two things I wish it had are a wider array of production cars so I could drive my own car or something like it and performance upgrades on those cars. Thats one of my favorite parts of gran turismo that this game doesnt have. However, the things this game does, it does well. I bought iRacing and it is a good game but I like this better. I would much rather pay the 1 time price of this game than all the nickle and dime stuff that iRacing pulls. Not to mention this game loads much faster and doesnt have the stupid browser based login. The saddest thing of all, iRacing was released in 2008 where as this game was released in 2015. A 7 year headstart and project cars has already surpassed them in my opinion.			",52,2,5,6,1,0,3

												Love this game.. absolutely love itfrom the way the rain runs off the windscreen down to the way the mitsy lancer ♥♥♥♥♥ its rear leg when you really push itRunning with a fanatec csr wheel with csr pedals and a logitec H shifter (maybe occasionally using my warthog flight stick as a hydralic style handbreak when sliding about because i have yet to buy the fanatec handbreak)this game can be a interesting race sim aswell as a noobie auto assist arcade like game (that means its eligeble for my 3 year old nephew can be laughing his head off doing doghnuts for hoursall along the whole time i wish that in a way there was more forza 4 like elements.. (forza 4 has been my yard stick to measure all racing games and sims by) with its customability and easy to navigate tuning pages, easy car sharing and a in bult decal and design features made forza one of the greatest racing games ever (in my opinion) so there is always a big space in this game that leaves me wishing i could be driving more personalised cars and the tuning element bringing a whole different aproach to racing and getting together online with friendsall in all a ****ing good game and as long as more dlc cars (preferably more slideways ones as well as rally based) is on the way.. there is still a couple of little bugs that need looking into but for certain nothing game breaking (eg pagani zonda if u turn the wheel and drivers arms off in the cockpit the wheel mounted rev needle still apears were the wheel used to be) lil nit picky things tbh.when this game first came out i was not impressed and after reading multiple reviews was about to ask for a refund for such a broken game, so i put the game down for a while and kept with asseto corsa (another top marks sim). after a little while giving what i thought was a fair time to iron out the creases i found there was still bugs (like car lights shining clearly through solid surfaces in fog) but the game was definately playable.. i short while after 99% of bugs had gone leaving only the nit pics i mentioned earlyersorry for the long review (just verry passionate about the genre)			",66,4,13,4,3,0,4

												A sublime, true motorsports game that finally feels like actual racing.One of the best parts of the game is that it stays to true to real racing; from karting to GT3 to Formula racing cars the authenticity of the career is simply unmatched. I love that the game doesn't punish me from not being the best driver, but I can actually focus on just trying my best against a huge grid of AI drivers that actually feel like human. I like that race weekend are properly simulated, but you can still individually pick the length of the race in percentages of the real life length. I like that the pit engineer actually gives relevant information for the race and for a slightly novice driver like me it's really helpful, not to mention it's pretty cool to have Ben Collins as the voice. The main downsides of the career so far have been lack of podium animations and some extra atmospherics stuff as well as partly missing pit animations, but luckily those are coming soon with a patch.The physics of the game feel very, very realistic too and you really have to manage your steering, your gas, your weight transfers, your tire temperatures and other. At the same time it doesn't feel alienating hard; you can pick up a car and drive it, but to truly compete you need a bit of practice with each car. The simulated weather conditions bring life to the racing as changing temperatures affect the grip, rain can wary from slight dribble to proper storms and you have to go change your tires. Proper 24h racing on all tracks is absolutely amazing as well and that combined with the realistic tracks makes the racing so amazing. Each car feels unique and you have to learn and tune the charasteristic to your taste. Only a few cars feel a slightly off and the default settings are very ""safe"" for new drivers, but overall the physics are sublime (apart from collisions, which don't feel so good all the time).It also looks stunning on my computer with a i920 and 280X, even though some AMD drivers issues haven't been fixed yet the performance is pretty good too. I especially love how the rain looks and the different conditions feel so life-like. Cars also look very good and detailed, though the car roster could certainly use some more cars, but right now the game offers such a huge variety of different motorsports it's obvious some concessions had to be made to achieve the vision of having so many racing series.So overall, I can't help but to recommend this to anyone who loves cars and motorsports. Novices might need to take a moment to learn the game and use some assists, but the game is still fairly easy to pick up. Even though I absolutely adore Assetto Corsa, rFactor, GTR 2, Gran Turismo and Forza......Project CARS is the racing game of the generation.			",290,72,17,43,23,4,50

												This is a great game, I have no issues other than a few minor things.  The graphics is superb if your machine can handle it.  The cars and tracks selection is a little on the down side compared to Gran Turismo 6.  But unlike GT6 all of their cars are well detailed inside and out.  The control and car setup settings are a little initmidating if you are new to racing games, but if you are not there are a lot of adjustments you can make to fine tune the controls and gameplay to your liking.  I play this game using a logitech DFGT which has 900 degree rotation so the game seemed to think I wanted to turn all those degrees to go around a corner.  But after i adjusted the rotation degrees limit to 360 in the logitech profiler (which is not in game) the turning control was a lot better. The career mode is fun and again you can adjust how you want to play.  For example you can start racing GT cars right away or start from the bottom in the go kart league and work your way to the top.  In every race you can adjust the AI and the amount of laps you want.The multiplayer is fun, you have warm up sessions and qualifying before the race.  The only problem is expect dirty drivers that will bump you off the road.			",12,0,2,5,1,0,6

												The AI is terrible. The physics are wonky - several tracks have inconsistent road surface, where it has bumps rather than a smooth transition when the road is going up or down (like in games from late 90s/earlier 00s)The car selection is huge, but there are too many supercars/formulas - not down to earth sport/muscle/casual vehicles.The sense of speed is so weak, driving slower cars is extremely boring.The visual rain simulation is just a marketing fluff. The raindrops may look good, but the visual representation of how they appear and are wiped off is pre-rendered and not simulated even in the slightest way.The force feedback options are so advanced, I don't understand half of the things mentioned - too robust for more casual people.This game is not a simulator, not even close. Look at Assetto Corsa in this matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a simulator, the game is pretty accurate. A lot of the complaints I read about this game were from people wanting a ""Need for Speed"" kind of arcade game where you can handle hair pins at 200 mph.However, the campaign is mostly junk. Theres no motivation to pursue the career, as you can just hop in at any point without having to unlock or actually pursue anything. The cars are just given to you, so you never feel like youre achieving anything.AND, even if you were to have some kind of garage in which you really tuned or upgraded your cars, theres a pathetic offering of the main feature of this ""project"". Even if you want to pay the fifty extra dollars to get all of the DLCs, theres still a massive lack of cars available. I paid ten dollars for this and feel like I still overpaid.			",41,5,1,19,0,0,5

												I have been playing games such as Forza both Motorsport and Horizon, Need For Speed, Grand Torismo, Test Drive and the long list goes on. I can happily say that this game feels different from them. While the current racing game market keeps shifting more and more towards the arcade style, Project CARS has delivered a true racing sim. It may have its issues and in my own opinion the physics while in karts is a bit screwy, but overall the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing. The in depth career mode is a great way to actually feel as though there is a point to continue racing by giving you that ability to move up by your own success. Unlike other games were you work though an event list or play a ""career"" were all you do is select a race and a car without any real reason, following a calendar and gaining invitationals again by succeeding in your current league keeps you engaged and gives you that want to just keep on going!

												I love racing games and Project CARS is the pinnacle of the genre.  It's been a long time coming and has actually drawn me away from Assetto Corsa.  This game is for sim lovers however does have many options to make it more accessible to the more casual gamer.  Normally, sim games are not your first idea of fun however playing it multiplayer with some other great gamers I know, it can turn out to be a great experience comparable to many other games out there.The main selling point for CARS (other than the racing experience) was the graphics.  They are beautiful even when you are not running everything maxed out.  Thankfully, SlightlyMad has left many options to tweak the visual appearance to suit your own preferences.  Don't like JJ Abrams  lens flare?  Yeah you can disable it or go through and select the type you like.The attention to detail is quite impressive.  The first time you get to race in a BAC Mono is an impressive.  The car model shows every curve and line from suspension arms to the exhaust in so much detail that you sometimes forget that you are looking at a game.  Project CARS does what it set out to do really well.  I just can't help but compare it to SlightlyMad's previous outing in NFS Shift 2.  I liked the career element in NFS where there was more incentive to winning than just the glory.  Also the ability to make the cars your own I think is something that could have made the game feel like you are not so much going through the motions.  I can understand why the devs went this way but it is a nagging little detail that plays in back of my mind.Overall, CARS is a great game.  It is the closest thing to Gran Turismo that us PC gamers have.  It is visually stunning and the gameplay is rewarding.  It will continue to get better as the devs have put already a lot of time into it and will continue to do so for a while.  Oh, and I suggest that dropping yourself into a multiplayer lobby and hoping for the best is probably a bad idea.  Build some hours up on track as this game will really test your ability.

												For now, it needs a clearer way of describing proper button mapping. Simplifying the button map process to make it more user friendly. I have a Fanatec Porsche GT2, combined with a CSR Elite pedal set and CSR shifter. I have been trying to set this up for 6 hours now, and it's slowly starting to frustrate me. Sometimes the pedals will respond, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they only half respond. Adjusting pedal sensitivity doesn't tell me what they do, they seem to respond the same. Graphically, it's rather pleasing. The physics are quite good, and a road car responds how I would expect it to as I drive and push the weight around.			",53,5,4,2,7,0,5

												Finally a game that has a better grip feel (tire model), if you use  FF steeringwheel offcourse.Cars are great and some circuits, like Azure Coast. Nice that you can feel all the bumps in the road and how it effects your grip!I only mis Zandvoort and more GT cars.One negative comment: when doing a timetrail to often your time is cancelled in the lap your driving when going off track. If you,re unlucky, even the next lap. I understand you have to do something against cheating, but this is ridicilus. In older games like GTR2 for instance the game looked at the amount of throttle you were on when off track.Make it beter Project CARS!!!But beside that I give this game an 7+Good job, but get rid of the stupidity!

												I have been playing games such as Forza both Motorsport and Horizon, Need For Speed, Grand Torismo, Test Drive and the long list goes on. I can happily say that this game feels different from them. While the current racing game market keeps shifting more and more towards the arcade style, Project CARS has delivered a true racing sim. It may have its issues and in my own opinion the physics while in karts is a bit screwy, but overall the game looks, feels, and sounds amazing. The in depth career mode is a great way to actually feel as though there is a point to continue racing by giving you that ability to move up by your own success. Unlike other games were you work though an event list or play a ""career"" were all you do is select a race and a car without any real reason, following a calendar and gaining invitationals again by succeeding in your current league keeps you engaged and gives you that want to just keep on going!

												Very realistic and fun for a few hours, but it does becomea bit tedious and repetitve at times. its fun when u get a rare but good matchup in online play, But for the most part u spend hours waiting in ""qualifying"" for other players to join. and when or if someone does they quit out if your settings arent perfect to their likings(like easy- ABS on TCS on ect) so the realism of crashing and recieving damage isnt usually accepted by most. so in a nutshell even though this game has major potential, it lacks that uumph to keep u playing hours on end. and maintaining interest. but overall it is a very satisfying feeling to go from 0-150 in an F1 car while monitoring ur gas tank and gear shifts and throttle control.  I love this game, but can ony handle about 3 hrs. before i feel like moving on.And in a game as realistic as this one, that should not be the case. My rating?  7 out of 10			",6,0,2,0,2,0,0

Posted: May 7, 2015
												A Review from a player with a G27.So I saw a lot of coverage of this game on gaming sites for a while now, but really wasn't that interested. I am more of an Assetto Corsa player and love that intense realism. I bought this game on a whim really not knowing what to expect, I was just hoping it wasn't going to be like Grid or Dirt, arcade stuff. All I wanted was something mostly realistic with good AI and a fun campaign, as that is lacking in Assetto.The driving is smooth, and pretty comparable to Assetto but a lot easier to get the hang of. The cars don't feel as weighty, but the driving with the settings on Pro is similar enough. This game has nice features like overheating brakes, mechanical failure, pit strategy, damage. All of these feature seem to work and work well. I have driven several  40+ lap races and having little things like a wheel nut lost in pit or random suspension failure are exciting and fun (don't worry it's not often).The AI is intense but good. They are a little stiff but I don't really know how they could be much better. They are fun to race. The one thing that’s troublesome is that when you race the AI you pick the difficulty before the race, which is good. I normally have them at about 80% strength and it’s a tough but good race. I win some, others I am in the pack somewhere. Still sometimes the strength is just horrible on certain maps. 80% will become more like 200% and they will drive the map like the rules of physics don't apply to them. I wish there were a standard for the percents. I don't expect to drive every map well and I don't expect to have to turn the AI down to 30% on one race in a series because they are dirty cheaters.The campaign isn't all that great you don't really get to feel like a race car driver and talk with your engineer, team or anyone. It's good enough though and it's fun to have the events focused and to be the champ in all the classes.One of the things I complained about in my initial review was that the physics from the carts where a bit ridicules. They seemed to fix all the wonky physics. Still on the technical side the game can be a bit…. troublesome. I can't host multiplayer games because sometimes the G27 just won't even work once the map loads in. I had a problem with the grass textures filling my screen nearly every other time I loaded a map. The grass thing was an easy fix, but the wheel problem is one that started with the last patch.Multiplayer is GREAT. It's easy to get in a game or to host one. All the other random players I have played with have been really good people and I have super slow internet (1.5 mbps) and have had no issues with latency.I have to say I'm finding the game really worth the money and it fits into a fun place that is separate from Assetto and other racing simulators I have played. It’s a great game and I really enjoy it. I have suggested tow others to buy it as well and they both love it.			",461,140,13,62,78,7,86

												Ranks right up there with Elite:Dangerous in VR experiences. The latest update(.7) works wonderfully with the Oculus DK2. The depth perception a VR headset can offer will really help you judge those apexes. Looks great on a monitor with the settings jacked.There are a ton of car classes however it comes at the expense of number of cars per class. I favor road cars(FORZA PLEASE COME TO PC) and would have liked to have seen more consumer level options. C'est la vie.The driving itself I only know with the 360 controller. Would love a new wheel but simply don't have the space. Controller racing is fine. A little twitchy at first gotta play with those deadzones.Online community seems scarse but I haven't run into a lot of a-hole drivers, which is nice. Hopefully the game will go on sale more often to help build on that.I recommend.			",299,27,16,12,35,1,28

												Project CARs is a realistic real-world racing simulation intended to bring together the most diehard racing fans from accross the world. Project CARS was released in Mid 2015 after a delay in production and has been releasing patches to improve the game ever since. After playing this game through many months of development, I have found the graphics are very appealing to the eye and certainly draw in race enthusiasts to the pleasing graphics of the game. Unfortunately, the asthetics and logic behind the game, especially the artificial intellegence are not quite up to par. After many patches were released in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the artificial intellegence, there was little changed, subsequently resulting in many deficcient release patches. This game is very useable with an easy to manage interface, and an in-depth career mode that will take you from zero to hero. The graphics and user interface of Project CARS are very unique in its class like no other, but is balanced out by an in-efficient artificial intellegence system within the game. The physics engine is for the most part very realistic with a few minor bumps in the road that can surely be fixed in the future. Other bugs include usability issues with the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. Often times during a race, the will will simply disconnect and you must reboot the game in order to continue gameplay. Positives Qualities:-Pleasing Graphics-Easy To manage User Interface-On Par Physics EngineNegative Qualities:-Below Par Asthetics-Unreliable Artificial Intellegence- Bug And Compatibility Issues Exist Within the GameWhile the graphics and user interface are easy to manage, the main focal point of the game which includes the artificial intellegence and gameplay are not always relaible and are twitchy eight times out of ten. This makes the game discouraging for the user playing it and will surely have many players leaving in no time. I do think Project CARS has potential for the future, but Slightly Mad Studios needs to get Slightly More Mad in order to win over the ratings with this one.Rating: 7/10			",4,0,5,0,0,1,0

Sometimes the pedals will respond, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they only half respond. Adjusting pedal sensitivity doesn't tell me what they do, they seem to respond the same. Graphically, it's rather pleasing. The physics are quite good, and a road car responds how I would expect it to as I drive and push the weight around.			",53,5,4,2,7,0,5

												A stunningly good racing game. Unforgiving to start with but repays your investment of time. I have a reasonably good pc and visually it is a treat too. Options to adjust length of race, qualifying and practice sessions and also ability to adjust number of opponents and their skill level. Enjoyed trying the different tracks in a variety of vehicles but really enjoying career mode. Over time will probably pick up all the DLC too as this is a keeper (made a start already).

												Project CARs is a realistic real-world racing simulation intended to bring together the most diehard racing fans from accross the world. Project CARS was released in Mid 2015 after a delay in production and has been releasing patches to improve the game ever since. After playing this game through many months of development, I have found the graphics are very appealing to the eye and certainly draw in race enthusiasts to the pleasing graphics of the game. Unfortunately, the asthetics and logic behind the game, especially the artificial intellegence are not quite up to par. After many patches were released in an attempt to increase the efficiency of the artificial intellegence, there was little changed, subsequently resulting in many deficcient release patches. This game is very useable with an easy to manage interface, and an in-depth career mode that will take you from zero to hero. The graphics and user interface of Project CARS are very unique in its class like no other, but is balanced out by an in-efficient artificial intellegence system within the game. The physics engine is for the most part very realistic with a few minor bumps in the road that can surely be fixed in the future. Other bugs include usability issues with the Logitech G27 Racing Wheel. Often times during a race, the will will simply disconnect and you must reboot the game in order to continue gameplay. Positives Qualities:-Pleasing Graphics-Easy To manage User Interface-On Par Physics EngineNegative Qualities:-Below Par Asthetics-Unreliable Artificial Intellegence- Bug And Compatibility Issues Exist Within the GameWhile the graphics and user interface are easy to manage, the main focal point of the game which includes the artificial intellegence and gameplay are not always relaible and are twitchy eight times out of ten. This makes the game discouraging for the user playing it and will surely have many players leaving in no time. I do think Project CARS has potential for the future, but Slightly Mad Studios needs to get Slightly More Mad in order to win over the ratings with this one.Rating: 7/10			",4,0,5,0,0,1,0

												Project Cars has its good and bad moments, but overall there are better options available, most notably Asseto Corsa and the F1 franchise. The game fails to fill in any gaps in the genre and doesnt offer a better experience over its competitors.PROS-Weather is visually great, affects car performance noticably as well-Game as a whole looks very good-Wide car selectionMEH-Track selection is ok, missing some good tracks and has knockoffs such as sakitto (of suzuka) that cheapen the experience-Career is alright but isn't really anything except a bunch of races on rails with scripited transitions from series to seriesCONS-Performance is just terrible, On a GTX 1070/i7 5820k/16gb Crucial DDR4 runs at 40fps at 1080p^May be an issue with my machine, so take it with a grain of salt-AI difficulty is more a measure of how suicidal they are instead of how fast they are			",73,3,6,2,16,1,4

												Been playing since official release. Was a great game then, its still a great game now.A number of significant patches have further improved the experience. Awesome list of tracks and race types, terrific variety of cars (though focused more so on the race and European side of things), huge amount of setup adjustments: everything you want from a racing sim. Career mode is fun and thorough too.AI is good for the most part, its nice to have AI in a racing game that is reactive to you and your positioning/speed etc.My main gripes are with the GUI and beginning career multi-stage events. After a few trail and errors, you get your head around how its supposed to work.			",53,11,3,7,8,2,15

												This game is beautiful. Game mechancis are magnificent when it comes to the career mode and to even quicl races where the game lets you customise everything. Customising weather, how many cars participate, what kind of cars, how will the weather change throughout the race, difficulty to opponents and to how many laps you have to do. When playing this game in cockpit view is most immersive racing experience I've ever had, even without my VR headset. The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a racing game and the driving feels great.I play with an xbox controller or the wheel so I haven't had any issues with controls as I've heard other people been having with keyboard or other.I totally still play this to date because of how immersive it is and never really get bored with it.

Even rFactor, that came in 2005, produces dramatically better feedback than this game do. I'm not even talking about perfect FFB in Assetto Corsa.

												Really awesome game! I love car games, and this one is by far the best. My only gripe is that there isn't a GTR in the game :/ Maybe in a future dlc there will be! So far I really like how realistic the cars feel, and look. The in helmet view, and cockpit view are the best I've ever seen in a game. I like the progression of the races, and I really feel like I'm part of a racing team, especially with the engineer giving feedback while driving. I find myself really engaged. I was kind of worried the damage simulation in this game wouldn't be that great, but I am glad I was wrong. I did a full flip with my car and totaled it. With an open wheel car, I was surprised that the hood covering the engine, and wheels came out to reveal the glorious guts of the car. As a fan of hardcore car sim games, project cars really delivers! ",8,2,1,0,2,0,1

I can't really comment on how it compares to real life sports cars, but clearly a lot of work has gone into the physics simulation and it feels great to drive those beastly machines! The graphics are fantastic, with some stunning day/night cycle effects and weather. It's the racing itself that I enjoy most though with really tough battles that can last multiple laps.

												I got it today (9/12/15) on sale and it came with the Litmited Edition DLC and is a better race sim than Assetto Corsa but it is not a better car handling sim than Assetto Corsa. If you want to race and have flags, pits, and all that then it is great and it is beautiful (I am running maxed out with AMD FX-6300 and Radeon HD 7950 with no problems). I would recomend this to anyone that liked the old Pro Race Driver series of games or the Grid series of games. If you are looking for the most realistic handling cars then get Assetto Corsa but if you want a fun race game then this is it.I use a Logitech Driving Force GT wheel and I would recommend you have some type of wheel for the game.Revision 9/14/15The single player in this game really does feel like racing, I mean your pit crew talks to you and gives you tips about passing the guy in front of you and you can have races with up to 40 cars on track. If Assetto Corsa had a single player mode like this it would be boss but if you want a good racing game with decent on-line racing and a great single player experience get this game.

												I spent a lot of time researching this game and various reviews before jumping.

If PCARS had a few more high-end car licenses I'd consider it worth the full price (and will end up buying DLC if they get the licenses I want).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not going to lie it does take a while to get use to . its definatly not like your average racing game like forza etc...8.5/10 The sound is amazing and the graphics are next level for racing games.

												Positive:- Incredibly good graphics, often indecipherable from real life.- Career mode is well made and makes single-player very fun- HUGE range of cars of all different varieties- In-depth car tuning system that lets you tweak the very finite aspects of the cars- Runs well even on weaker PCs- Good range of options for differently skilled players to choose fromNegative:- Contact with other objects (cars, walls, track outskirts) is really buggy and ill-designed- Lack of car aesthetic customization (eg. paint colour)- Carts WAY too easily mount each other.Overall I have to say I love this game. It's worth the price and is one of the best racing games on Steam.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an absolute delight to play! The reason this game has so many negative reviews is because the game is only optimized for Nvidia cards at the moment. The overall game play feels like something from the very first Gran Turismo on PS1. Physics wise this game is one of the best there is which is equally on par, if not further beyond that of Asseto Corsa which is a nice touch.The graphics are incredible and are miles ahead of Asseto Corsa! If you're looking for a TRULY next generation experience graphics wise, then look no further than this game!Project Cars has a nice list of vehicles to choose from, however, there are no Lamborghini's or Ferrari's. That may not be a problem to some, but it sorta hampers the overall product for me as I love Ferrari's.The game still appears to be in alpha, and for a product of this quality still in alpha its an absolute MUST BUY. The game is highly optimized for Nvidia cards, and SMS are apparently working on getting it worked out for AMD cards as well.Weather is really fun to race through, and actually has an impact on the performance of vehicles. Unlike so many other so called ""sims"", when it rains, the road gets slick and your car will slide very easily. It's also fun to start a race during the day time, and have a storm gradually build up overtime where it gets really foggy and rainy, completely changing the way you tackle the race at hand.The damage model is good as well, which makes the game much more enjoyable! At least to me!All in all I'd recommend this game to people who enjoy racing games. The game can be played with a Keyboard and Mouse, Gamepad, or Wheel. While people who own AMD cards may want to wait to purchase this until SMS has fully resolved the problem, I'd still recommend it to Nvidia users as the game runs very smooth and looks stunning! I'm truly looking forward to see what SMS has in store for this title!			",143,50,28,13,24,2,11

												As long as you have a decent steering wheel, use a nVidia gpu and are willing to try cars outside of Ferrari or Porsche, this is the game for you. Plenty of modes, career mode is a blast. Not a perfect game: AI can be quite dumb at times, hard to get an online match, etc.You will need to calibrate settings for your wheel to get good gameplay. The negative reviews focus on how difficult it is to drive with a gamepad. Its a racing game, you should be using a wheel.			",46,16,1,3,2,1,3

												Excels where all other titles failes! No silly ""Win 5 races to get a proper car"" no ""hidden tracks"" you only get after investing 100 hours of your precious lifetime! No need for ""artificial challenges""... I've waited almost two decades to see a car racing game, that lets you just drive a cool car down a highway NOT going in circles like a trained ape, if you just want some fun!If you want a good simulation, mix of physics and modeling, with believable handling, that feels like the real thing with your FFB wheel, you get it here...If you want a fun race with easy handling that is possible to manage with only keyboard or a controller, you get it here... simply adjust the settings.The philosophy of ""SlightlyMad"" to put the whole game into your hand and let you freely choose whatever you like,puts this ahead of most other titles I've seen in the past. On  PC as well as on Consoles.Thanks Slightly Mad, thanks to the great community behind this project, thanks to the external supporters, backers and whoever was involved in creating this gem!You did a great job! I personally love the result, though I suck at most of the courses... but, yeah, I can still set the AI to a level that gives me a chance ;-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased Project CARS looking for something fun and potentially deep to play in VR (HTC Vive).  I found the VR interface to be pretty awful, to the point where the game was unplayable. After I write this review I'm going to attempt to get my money back.The VR menus of the game are huge and up really close to your face, requiring you to move your head around to see the options.  The driving gameplay is seated, with a headless driver model that steers the car, which I found really weird and immesion-breaking. I'd rather not have a body at all than a body I'm not physically attached to and does not mirror my actions.Because the body of the driver and the car don't move at all inside the play space, they need to be centered on your head and adjusted before the driving starts. The first time I booted up the game, I was holding the headset in my hands, clicking through the installer. The game world centered on the headset while I was holding it, down low and pointed at a 60 degree angle away from my couch. I spent my first 10 minutes with the game with my head clipped half through the car I was supposed to be driving, searching (and searching and searching) for a way to fix this in the menus. There was no recenter option. I eventually found a settings page that let me pick when I wanted recentering to occur: at game start or at race start. Race start was off by default. There was no interactive ""recenter now"" option, which was incredibly frustrating, nor any controls to manually adjust the centering. I restarted the game holding my head as perfectly still as I could in a comfortable position until the main menu came up. The centered position was better than before, (I was in the car at least!), but not perfect, and the game provides no way to fix it. There were a few manual adjustments for seat position in the car but that was it.  This unacceptable in a $30 title. It would be unacceptable in version 0.1 of a fan-made VR conversion patch.The driving, once it started, was a little too simulationy for my tastes, even on novice. The cockpit view was super crowded and provided a poor view of the road. It was impossible to see where I was supposed to be going. All this made me feel motion sick after a short time. I couldn't help but feel like the experience I was having: discomfort, nausea, and calustrophobia was just a little too much authenticity for me.I do not reccomend this game for casual driving fans who are looking for something in VR.  I'm sure if I bought the game for hardcore simulation and was playing on a screen with a wheel, maybe I'd feel differently. For people who are not in my position, I defer to the other reviews.

												Project CARS is one of the most authentic, beautiful, intense, and technically-advanced racing games I have ever had the pleasure of playing and trust me, I have been playing racing games for a while.  Ever since the early days of the 2000's I have been obsessed with them, from playing the original Gran Turismo on the PS1 right through untill the latest and greatest car racing sims we see being released today, Ive played them all and Project CARS is right near the top of my list as one of the greatest car racing games to date, and when your playing with a wheel set up the experience is enhanced ten fold.  Project CARS isnt perfect but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun.			",57,17,10,8,11,0,10

												Firstly I would like to start off by saying that this game is fun and enjoyable, a great simcade. The cars are beautiful and the graphics are stunning. The career mode system, where you can start offf wherever you want is a great idea. The online is fun and the experience seems to be lag free. Unfortunately for me I am running a Crossfire setup, so I am using AMD cards, the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥on AMD cards so it would be hard to reccommend the game to an AMD user because of Nvidia Gimpworks. Overall the game is a breath of fresh air to the racing genre, but for the aforementioned reasons I think I will stick to Assetto Corsa. The game is a must buy for Nvidia users.			",19,1,12,0,3,0,0

												A great racing game that sits somewhere between an arcade and simulator. The online is questionable, but in single player you have plenty of track options to pick from and a good selection of cars. I'd reccomend starting out with some of the gt3 or gt4 cars as they are pretty forgiving to being pushed hard.For the love of god dont buy this if you dont have a controller or wheel.Also learn to go manual, you get better lap times.

This game is a ton of fun but takes a bit of practice to get down. Online isn't as bad as people make it out to be and I actually have a more positive experience online than dealing with the AI. I will continue to stay away from career mode until the AI is aware of their surroundings. All in all, I will be playing this beautiful game for a long time and look forward to future updates!

The career mode system, where you can start offf wherever you want is a great idea. The online is fun and the experience seems to be lag free. Unfortunately for me I am running a Crossfire setup, so I am using AMD cards, the game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥on AMD cards so it would be hard to reccommend the game to an AMD user because of Nvidia Gimpworks. Overall the game is a breath of fresh air to the racing genre, but for the aforementioned reasons I think I will stick to Assetto Corsa. The game is a must buy for Nvidia users.			",19,1,12,0,3,0,0

												I was sad to find atleast 3 bugs in this game1. When you stop in the road, instead of the cars crashing into you creating a big collision, they just pass through, thought   this is a real life simulator2. When you crash and you lost a wheel, and you turn left/right, the graphics of the car fuse in with the graphics of the road3. Started a race, at the starting line before the race started, all the cars were piled up onto each other, and when the race started they glitched and went back to the normal position.Overall this coukd be a great game, the graphics, the scenary, the visualisations looks perfect. But please... sort out the bugs before you publish a game, you give yourself a bad name in the end			",26,0,1,4,1,0,0

												My god, the handling. Or I should say the lack there of. With a controller you just can't steer any car around a corner with the default setups. To properly adjust things so the game is actually playable requires HOURS of work in the menus, which is just insane. Especially as I am using a Thrustmaster controller, and they partnered with the creators when this game was being put together. Also, I come to find out that streaming this game to an NVidia Shield will work, in the sense that an image appears on the screen, but it will not react at all to input from the Nvidia controller.

												Worst racing game of the modern era. All of its competition completely blows it out of the water.Playing this the graphics reminded me of Gran Turismo 4 for the PS 2. But thats about the only thing it had in common with that fantastic classic;There are an amazingly lackluster amount of cars in the game. Seriously, theres about 3 road cars in the game, and 1 or 2 cars for each class that all feel the same as the other cars in the class.There are a lot of tracks in the game but I imagine its pretty easy to add a lot of maps if they have less detail and less graphical fidelity than Forza 3. Controls with a controller are absolutely atrocious and if you plan on using a controller DO NOT GET THIS GAME PERIOD. I cannot even put into words how terrible it is with a controller, as many people on the internet forums have complained about. Bottom Line: THERE IS NO REASON TO GET THIS GAME WHEN FORZA 6 AND GRAN TURISMO EXIST.This game is worse than the competition in every single way, most importantly content. I actually find it amazing that a PC game managed to have worse graphics than console exlusives. Seriously, I think this game has less cars than that Ferrarri exclusive racing game.1/10 worst racing game I've ever played. The only reason it gets as high as 1 is because it has a great options menu. Oh ya, and some idiot decided to make the default post race button ""restart"" instead of ""continue"", so you have to scroll up before you press A or you'll be restarting your race. Seriously how stupid do you have to be as a dev to make restart default.			",106,3,1,7,12,0,34

												0/10 - Because review scores are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.This game had potential but quickly turned into a Cash-grab for SMS and became a joke of an E Sports contender, with all of the community events in 2016 focusing soley on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t E Sports market.Most cars and tracks are old models from other SMS games and the only insult to it is the price to pay for it.Some car classes are broken by the DLC cars, throwing old road cars in with old race cars or mixing F1 cars, the 72D will never keep up with the 78. AI selection is absent too, so doing a mixed field GT race will have ALL THE CARS with GT in their title in the field, ever wanted to race against a GT40 while doing the Bathurst 12 Hour in a GT4 Mustang while still having the GT3 cars to overtake you? TOO BAD!There also seems to be a load of bugs still, during online races I would often get wrecked just by tapping wheels, one time even being wrecked because the game glitched the grid, placing another car under me.The FFB took me a year to get to a level where I could enjoy driving it, being a confusing mess and I only sorted it when I stopped using FFB setups that would be considered ""Normal"" in my other wheel-based games.AI is great in this game, aside from a few bugs that have the AI pit on the last lap of a race if it starts raining (which ruined a perfect enduro race I staged) but aside from a few buggy classes of vehicles, most of the rest can kerb-hop and battle for position sometimes, if the game doesn't go and supercharge them like it is prone to do.You can have some fun with this game, offline it is a decent simcade mode.As I have said before with other racing sims, wait until the second game and even then, give it a few months before buying this one to see if the 2nd game can be improved over this mess, which could have cornered the Gran Turismo for PC market that some of us have been waiting for since GT turned to crap.

												After playing this game for just over 15 hours now and exploring single player extensively, I can still safely say it is the best racing game out there. Compared to Assetto Corsa there's far more variety in car types, I feel Assetto Corsa is focused on road and GT only, not much in terms of open wheel and prototype. Whereas PC's has prototype's, F1-F3, GT3-GT5, touring cars, and classics from all of these types as well as an extensive road car range. The track variety is also the best, there are many tracks in PC's I haven't seen officially in a racing game before. Having so many settings is great, the ai is perfect, best ever ai in any game!Attention to detail amazing too!10/10!			",82,24,22,9,36,2,6

												Right well after seeing all the Negative reviews my experience will come as a real breathe of fresh air. I do not have working Windows PC so was very concerned about splashing out my £40 through Steam, but I am absolutely chuffed, Project Cars runs beautifully and this is my hardware. 27"" iMac 5K  (2015) with the fusion drive it runs Yosemite and I am running Parallels and have a Windows 10 VM running on an external USB 3.0 SSD. The display card is the standard option that just happens to be an AMD card. The frame rate looks blooming good to me. I did though have fun sorting out all the controls on the Mac's keyboard and if anyone can offer advice on a suitable Mac compliant controller that would be handy. But from me Project Cars get a great big 9/10 and a big well done to the developers.			",3,0,2,1,11,0,0

												Short Version:  Get this game NOW!!!Pros:Excellent soundshort load timesmany (real) tracks that all look totally AMAZINGweather and night racinggood controller supportCons:Not as many cars as I would like (basically a ton of formula and high end racers but not too many road cars, muscle cars, or tuners yet), but each car feels differentCan't upgrade cars parts like in Gran TurismoMore info:Simply put, I don't yet have a wheel so I use a dual shock 3 to play. I have played a lot of Gran Turismo and some Asetta Corsa.  This is like a mix betweem both of those games.  The damage isn't spot on, but it is pretty darn great.  The sound though!!! This game really REALLY impresses me in that department.  The sounds are exquisite and make you feel like you're really there.  The cameras are awesome and in all, the game runs very smooth and fast, even on my laptop.  The main things to focus on here is the amount of tracks, this game has a LOT of tracks (and weather and night time), the sound is AMAZING, but the game needs a few more cars in my opinion.  I wouldn't call this one an arcade racer, because it has a LOT of sim elements going on and its pretty darn good.  If you need something to brush up your racing skills on, definitely give this a try.  I can tell that I will be playing this a LOT in the future.  The game is also very fast to load up and put you on the track.  This has become my new favorite driving sim/game.  I can't recommend this enough to anyone who loves cars and racing sims.  After spending HOURS of time driving around on different tracks and getting a feel for this game, I won't be going back to any other racing games or sims anytime soon.  Experiencing driving around in a Mitsubishi EVO 8 on Laguna Seca at night and in light rain and with raindrops reflecting everything and headlights lighting up the track, I just can't wait to finish this review and get back into the game!!!  I will be getting a wheel setup most definitely, this game is that good!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:Gorgeous carsGorgeous tracksVery good physics modelVery good tire modelGood FFBDecent AICons:A bit too many bugs at the momentTrack limit detection and (as a result) leaderboards are a mess (devs are on it and it should be fixed soon)Overly agressive AI at high difficulty (they take a lot of chances and are not afraid of trading paint with you)AI are all gods in the rain (should be fixed in the next patch)Missing feautures such as animated pit crew, custom championships and full-fledged flag system.Score:At the moment I rate the game 8/10, but if they can add the ""missing"" features, fix most of the bugs, make adjustments to the AI and most importantly fix the track limit detection, I would rate it 9.5/10 easily - yes that's how great the potential is!Recommendation:You might want to pass...- If you are very sensitive to bugs. You might want to wait a few months and keep an eye on the patch notes.- If you want to compete on the leaderboards, you have to do some off-piste and corner cutting (which has ruined a lot of the fun for me personally, as I just can't bring myself to cheat like that).You should get it...- If you just enjoy racing and can look past the issues I mentioned above.- If you just want to drive a lot of fantastic cars from different eras on amazing tracks for the fun of it. Personal experience:I'm so glad I bought it. For me it's worth every penny and I'm confident that most of the issues I have will be fixed over time. There are also a lot of DLC coming like the Indycar Series. They plan to keep updating and adding content for the next 2 years, so I see a lot of potential for Project CARS to become THE racing game for all platforms. They are not quite there yet, but the potential is enormous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project CARS is like having a genius baby brother. The idea of letting the Sim Racing Community help shape the development of this simulator is in my opinion what's missing from so many companies. The graphics are the best in the Class. And the physics engine is spot on in terms of speed. I haven't driven all the cars, but I could only find fault with three that I've tried. Most every car felt great and a few truly put me back in the cockpit of the real thing. I'm an open wheel fan at my core and have turned a few laps with the big boys, and prior to the release of Project CARS, I spent most of my sim time driving Code Masters F1. It was less than a year ago I converted one of my flight Simulators with a Logitech Driving Force GT and a copy of F1 2012. over the next nine months I've moved from F1 2012 to 2013 to 2014. Then I got caught up in all the hype about ""The Crew"", I bought a G27 Wheel and up graded my system. But ""The Crew"" was a big big let down. Then along comes talk about Project CARS, and I was hooked again. While waiting for its release I built my dream system at the cost of many thousands. Well Project CARS is here and it is truly amazing. So come on people, suit up and show up to Project CARS. I would have never believed I'd be posting a clip of me racing at Sears Point on Facebook and have so many people write me excited that I'm racing again after all these years and wanting to come watch. Some still think I'm kidding when I tell them it's a simulation.			",2,0,13,0,0,0,0

												Terrific racing sim. Stunning visuals, meticulous car design inside and out, faithful sound reproduction and great physics - the more edgy cars actually feel properly twitchy.Solid car selection and a healthy number of tracks with multiple layouts/stages to select for several of them.Honestly my favorite feature is the ability to set up dynamic weather which evolves as a full-blown race or casual cruise down the coast progresses. Going from light clouds to a thunderstorm to fog really enhances the whole experience. If I can think of a downside it's the omission of a few of my favorite car makers (Koenigsegg, Ferrari, Lamborghini), but understand this due to licensing restrictions, limited time to produce a game, etc. Also the game is heavily graphics intensive if you want to experience it in all its glory.10/10			",68,3,16,8,13,0,20

												I bought this game already owning Assetto Corsa, which I like very much. I was very skeptical and felt that the game was over hyped in the raceing sim community. I play on a dated laptop running with an old Nvidia 635m and use a gamepad. I was very surprised when I was acutally able to play this game at a decent frame rate (on very low settings), while on Assetto Corsa I can't get any reasonable frame rate. I was also very surprised to see that the factory gamepad setting were usable, I am constantly fiddleing with my settings on Assetto Corsa and they just never seem to be right. I am very pleased with the game for my setup.As far as it being a sim goes the cars in general feel much easier to drive than Assetto Corsa. In PCars there have been several situation where I felt that I had more grip than I should (playing without any assists), but overall its very satisfying and never really gives me the feeling that I am cheating the laws of physics too much. A minor gripe I have is that some of the cars I found shared the same brake whine, it really bothered me when I was driving a super car and the brakes whined under minor load when a 40 year old cars brakes whined in the same situation ??? I really liked the selection of cars in this game, although I would LOVE to see more vintage F1 cars (Licenses I know). Overall if you can, buy both PCars and AC, if you're poor like me just buy this.			",66,8,4,16,7,0,28

												Project Cars is definitley a good game. I have seen a few reviews online and ran in to the usual ""This game is bugged"" stuff. I decided to buy it anyway and I'm glad i did. I ran out and also bought a Logitech G27 wheel, which i highly recommend to anyone who dosent have one already, The only downside I see to it is that there are a very limited amount of cars in the game and I know they did that to cash in on the DLC of cars. Thats one thing I hate about gaming nowadays, you cant have one game come out without having to pay for ""Extra"" content. The graphics in the game are stunning, especially racing in the rain for the first time I felt like i was truly there. The actual driving of the cars is a bit different and expect to do some extensive tuning to get them to handle the way you want, but then again isnt that why we all play Sim Racers. The online community is okay but nothing great. Just hope you dont get kicked off the track on the first turn. All in all, Project Cars is a great racing game and I hope thsis review helps anyone on the fence about getting the game.			",26,2,2,6,1,0,1

												To be frank, I thoroughly enjoy this game.+Phisics are (for the most part) spot on. Many people on here who follow racing sims are saying its bad, but unlike them,     I´ve actually experienced cars just short of the caliber of GT3 cars, and I don{t think they understand just how solid these cars are. Games like AC over'portray body roll in order to please these people, but it{s to such an exten that they feel more soft they these cars really are (not to bash AC, but I do find this game more closely related, if not maybe just a tad too stiff on some of the lower level cars). +Graphics are probably by far the greatest selling point. I´m sorry if you have an AMD card, I heard its basically unplayable, but the game runs great for my Nvidia 860m and have virtually no lag even under extreme conditions (24 cars, rain, and max graphics)+AI is pretty rough. You have to be careful as they are extremely aggressive, but the game is still very playable even with them. Coming from a Forza and GT background (this is my first PC sim) I very much enjoy this game and would highly recommend to anyone that loves racing.			",31,1,3,1,4,0,2

												man, ppl who pre-ordered the game should get some car packs for free... just saying.  would be nice.  still the best racing game ever so far.  just hope they add a ton of cars and more tracks. to compare this game with Assetto Corsa it is way better. AC feels like ur driving on ICE all the time. PC has a nice realistic feel to it.  also, PC has way better graphics than AC.  only thing better in AC is the IRtracking works better, only cuz u can look all the way behind u out the back window where in PC u cant.  im use to forza where there is so many cars you will never drive them all, so i hope they add tons more... but i love this game, proly wont ever play any other racing game for along time...things i dislike about it... trackingIR could work better- pit stops could be easeir to figure out and most the time they dont even work-be cool if you could acually upgrade some of the cars... seems they are all stock, no upgrades-and maybe some hints about how to get the best out of tuning setups instead of leaving you clueless.cant say theres anything else i dont like about it, everything else is amazing.

												What a game! Just love it!Pros:- Track detail: After my friends visited Spa for a real race, they we're able to show me where they've walked in game. Even the toilet buildings are in the right place. People stand where they can stand in real life.- Physics: Using a proper racing wheel, everything the car does can be felt through Force Feedback. Also every car has it's own FFB settings.- Immersion: Play this game with all damage on, random weather, highest AI difficulty and realistic fuel and tire wear. It beats every other sim racer I own.Cons:- Requires quite a gaming rig- No 24h nurburg > combined nordschleif + GP- Sakitto, I hate it, give me Suzuka back!- I can't create my own tracks, yet.Conclusion:Buy this if you're into racing games. But only if you own a proper wheel!			",97,8,14,12,12,1,24

												A real shame, good game, fine mix of arcade and sim racer, but it is totally ruined by an AI worse than the AI in GT6 and the rain... It is always raining, and the rain is really local so it only affects your car and only the part of the track you are driving on at any given moment. This just makes it impossible to enjoy, and yes I do know that it rains, but I refuse to belive that Laguna Seca (in California, you know the place that is running out of water) has rain every weekend.But like i said, this is actually a good game, so it is a real shame that such minor problems ruins a potentially great game.Positive: Easy to get started, lots of different types of cars, tracks from around the worldNegative: The rain, the rain and the bad AI ",171,12,37,17,48,1,52

												I intially backed Project Cars through their WMD platform as a team member as I enjoyed Shift 2 & was hoping for something similar to Forza or GT on PC but more of a sim. So I was disappointed when the development shifted towards what so many racing sims on PC are, a non car customisable, choose your racing car sim. After becoming bored with the prebuilds I abandoned the forums & discovered on release that instead of receiving a copy of the game as initially promised there was a 50% off coupon in my Steam inventory. Thankfully after a few months the backers received payments from sales but as I was still disappointed from not receiving the game I avoided it until Vive support was added.Now being one of the few racing games to support the Vive I've been enjoying the game. Racing sims are hugely improved with VR, the ability to judge distances and being able to see elevation changes, just the immersion it offers.It's worth picking up if you have a Vive, but I won't be backing Project Cars 2.

												I consider myself rather adept when it comes to racing games, e.g. I usually play the hardest difficulty with assists off. However In this game, with my PS4 controller, I can hardly get a car around a track with the default control settings. I spent the majority of my time in-game trying to find the ideal controller settings until i eventually gave up because the process is far too taxing. If a game has controller support it should work functionally with a controller out the gate, I shouldn't have to spend forever adjusting controller settings just to make a game playable.In summary, this game is virtually unplayable with a controller. Would not recommend.			",81,11,4,16,6,1,9

												This is a beautiful gam, but sadly lacks intelligent AI. The game also has alot of little bugs and glitches but once you start playing it with friends all that does not matter. I recommend this game to any person who likes racing simulaters and beautiful graphics. If you don't have friends I can still recommend the singleplayer races, but who just wants to thrash a bunch of AI cars that drive as if they are Nic Hamilton (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)			",27,3,5,3,6,0,4

												Short version: best, most immersive pc racing sim I've played. 8/10Let me just start out by saying I LOVE Gran Turismo. When I got my first gaming pc I was truly devastated that the only racing sims available were either too graphically ancient to be immersive at all, or just filled with cartoon physics. Then I hear of Project CARS, and man was I excited. Finally a true racing sim in the works, I couldn't wait for this game to come out. Well here it is, and while it's not quite on Gran Turismo's level of polish it's definitely a solid game well worth my money. So at the end of the day I would say if you have a next gen console you'd probably find more substance in Forza or Gran Turismo, but if you don't have a console or would rather game on pc then this game is the way to go.

												For starters, let me disclose I was among those that bought into the game on the very fist day it was available, about 3 years ago (maybe more?).pCARS is at the moment the most complete Racing SIM available. By ""complete"" I mean a racing sim where there is a night/day cycle, pit stops, weatehr, a large number of cars on track and you can setup your car to a good level of realism (but not perfect yet), a very good selection of cars and tracks (and it will get better).The car Physics have gotten a lot better right before launch and the graphics and sounds, but especially the graphics, are legendary. Even on my once very powerful, but againg PC the graphics are eye popping.If you used to love racing GTR2 then this is for now its heir apparent. R3E may get there one day and it is already showing good signs of improvement, but if you want to race cars with the highest level of realism available today, this is one of the best games and hopefully it will get even better. I long for the return of the vintage tracks. We had them for a long time but they disappeared at launch, but we know they exist.Cons are there. From the suicidal AI to some issues with some of the cars, tires, grip, etc.. Personally, I dislike the inability to drive in the pits myself, I don't like that the race is over the moment I cross the finish line and the setup system is still primitive as far as being able to build and save setups. Ditto for the liveries. That's another big area of improvement. It is also not possible to pick your own multiclass field of cars. Racing lemans with LMP1, LMP2 and then a bunch of radicals is not very realistic. I'd love to be able to build my own LeMans field with some GTE cars instead of radicals.But once you are chasing that Aston Martin at SPA with your Mercedes GT3, you forget a lot of these things and just enjoy the race.

												This is a great racing sim.  Playing with a wheel and pedals is the only way to go.  Realistic driving physics and some really great cars to choose from (although not a huge stable) make this game have lasting appeal.The best thing about the game is the career mode.  Instead of playing as some kind of car collector like you do in GT or Forza, in this game you play as a racing driver; working your way from karting all the way up through the ranks.  It's very satisfying.With all of its strengths this game has one major flaw that I have to point out.  The AI often acts as if you are not on the race track.  You will get slammed into and barged off the track.  There are also other strange AI behaviors like shortcutting the track that will leave you scratching your head.Overall if you want a realistic racing game with a fun career mode, this is the game for you.  Hopefully the AI will be improved over time.			",19,0,3,3,3,2,1

												There are tons of cars and tracks to drive which can be very fun. Unfortunately there are still several bugs that have gone unfixed. An unnecessary amount of FFB settings means that you'll spend several our tweaking them in order to make your wheel feel the way it should by default. Right now the only thing moderately enjoyable is hot lapping because the AI is inconsistent at best. The game has potential to be really good, but it unpolished and at this point  still needs work.

												My first impressions of Pcars were good. Stunning visuals along with excellent cars sounds and vehicle handling realism. I race with a Logitech g27 wheel. The wheel support and custimization in game is very good. In game the vehicle handles as Id expect it to in real life which fora simulator game is a big deal. It Did not take me many hours though to realize that Pcars has many faults which in my opinion outweight the pros, he biggest of these being the career mode, car selection and instability. The career was dreadfully uncreative with no excitement beside actually driving a car which brings me to the next point; the lack of cars. This isnt all bad due to the fact it takes time to learn how to drive each car properly. Most of my game time was spent driving the RUF Yellowbird. I would have appreciated a few more road cars and more American and Japanese cars. The name itself is misleading since the game has well under 100 cars which are mostly European race cars. The stability of the game has also caused me grief even in the 10 hours of gameplay. Frequent crashes and fps drops make it difficlut to play. I cannot reccomend the game to people who seek a racing experience like i did. It is designed more for those who love Hot Lap simulators with not much else			",56,5,6,6,3,0,2

The AI definitely needs more work as they don't seem to be affected by tire wear or wet conditions as much as I am. I'm also one of the many people having a pit engineer sound bug.Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to recommend this game to anyone because they pulled a really idiotic move by announcing project cars 2 when this game is still so new. They didn't even deliver on their monthly free car promise. To date only 1 free car  (lykan hypersport) was given to players.I actually made the mistake of buying their DLC a day before they announced Project Cars 2.

												For starters, let me disclose I was among those that bought into the game on the very fist day it was available, about 3 years ago (maybe more?).pCARS is at the moment the most complete Racing SIM available. By ""complete"" I mean a racing sim where there is a night/day cycle, pit stops, weatehr, a large number of cars on track and you can setup your car to a good level of realism (but not perfect yet), a very good selection of cars and tracks (and it will get better).The car Physics have gotten a lot better right before launch and the graphics and sounds, but especially the graphics, are legendary. Even on my once very powerful, but againg PC the graphics are eye popping.If you used to love racing GTR2 then this is for now its heir apparent. R3E may get there one day and it is already showing good signs of improvement, but if you want to race cars with the highest level of realism available today, this is one of the best games and hopefully it will get even better. I long for the return of the vintage tracks. We had them for a long time but they disappeared at launch, but we know they exist.Cons are there. From the suicidal AI to some issues with some of the cars, tires, grip, etc.. Personally, I dislike the inability to drive in the pits myself, I don't like that the race is over the moment I cross the finish line and the setup system is still primitive as far as being able to build and save setups. Ditto for the liveries. That's another big area of improvement. It is also not possible to pick your own multiclass field of cars. Racing lemans with LMP1, LMP2 and then a bunch of radicals is not very realistic. I'd love to be able to build my own LeMans field with some GTE cars instead of radicals.But once you are chasing that Aston Martin at SPA with your Mercedes GT3, you forget a lot of these things and just enjoy the race.

												Graphics are great but the game itself is quite buggy but not to the point of being unplayable for me (playing casually on a keyboard). The AI definitely needs more work as they don't seem to be affected by tire wear or wet conditions as much as I am. I'm also one of the many people having a pit engineer sound bug.Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to recommend this game to anyone because they pulled a really idiotic move by announcing project cars 2 when this game is still so new. They didn't even deliver on their monthly free car promise. To date only 1 free car  (lykan hypersport) was given to players.I actually made the mistake of buying their DLC a day before they announced Project Cars 2. I will definitely not be supporting this bunch of greedy developers anymore.			",16,5,4,0,4,1,11

This game gives you ability to setup your own racing strategy, you get full race weekend (Training-Qualifications-Race) Good amount of tracks and some pretty awesome cars.

For tracks that arent laser scanned, theyre extremely well done.Excellent Performance on low-end GPU's (GTX 650)  Way past the Xbox One and PS4 Quality Visuals and nearly Matches the Consoles Frame Rate Performance.  Shocking.Cons: If your coming from console's, good luck.  It needs some work in general, managing the control options (Reset to defaults and Better explanation of all control / force feedback settings and proper Wheel and Controller save options)  Specific support for the Fanatec 911 Porsche Turbo Wheel, 6 speed shifter and ClubSport Pedals (Shifter and Pedals were not supported)			",55,6,3,3,1,0,5

												Sure is perrrdy.  I objected to the abundant grip and a few other things when testing this release.  In fact some of the corners being cambered in game when they aren't, or a track being wider than it should be, still drive me a bit crazy.  All things considered though, It's fun to play and looks pretty.  Unlike some other racing titles that look good however, Project CARS actually proviodes depth in tuning and vehicle degredation that the other eye-candy driving games lack. Finally SMS seem to be patching issues as they become apparent (cough Turn 10 cough) and their original funding model for this title necessitated that they listen to the community which they have.  I don't agree with every move they made with this title but at least they seem to be rational decisions made to please the most users.			",0,0,4,0,0,0,0

												Good simulation of car races, do not expect many cars or circuits. There are not any full official racing series licenses, but you can find good maked racing special cars in various categories. This game is main focused to car race feeling and do it well.  But has also some issues like AI, not ultra good GUI and if you want more content, you have to buy it. I recommend use gamepad or better racing wheel.+ Sound+ Graphics+ Feeling on track, like real cars+ Physics+ Many options and settings for races+ Night races+ Dynamic weather+ AI can make mistakes, not boring trainz- Small count of cars- Small count of tracks- Promised new content added, but you have to pay for it- Pit stops system, AI can not work with strategies and car setups, you can see pit stops in the end of the race just becuase AI has always soft tyres in good weather and can not calculate with race lenght - Game options just in main menu, it is not possibe to change simulation settings (steering, sensitivity, shifting...) during race weekend, you have to quick to main game menu and than return- AI drives formula cars like normal cars.

												Great graphics, driving mechanics, and the ability to customize the racing experience to any skill level make this game a must own for any car lover. for those looking for a true sim its not quite at the level of iracing, but its much better than just about anything else. If you are just looking to do some casual laps forza or gt style it also caters to that sort of arcady feel as well. over all im quite pleased with the game, and it feels great playing with all of the assists turned off on my Logitech G27.

												You want a full detailed review? Buy PC Gamer or any other magazine or see online, as this is just basically a LIKES and DISLIKES review.Ok: Plus points. Looks gorgeous with all options turned up. Sounds fantastic. Plays beautifully, even on keyboard, as I'm still deciding on a wheel. Good selection of cars. Good variety and and some really classic choices.Ok: Not-so-plus points: Overwhelming choices. Tuning. Driving. Tracks. Let me explain. I would think for a n00b user, you could get many ""wtf do I do now"" moments. The granularity of the game is astonishing in scope and variety. You could, and I did, spend hours looking at what you could do instead of racing. Maybe a possibly simplified menu option would have been good.Now, this one could be debated on many levels, but I'm saying...no Ferrari? Lamborghini? Jaguar? No classic cult cars? No classic tracks? I had expected more cars and tracks, though the lack of a Ferrari F40 or La Ferrari, or even a Porsche 918 or Carrera GT among others, is to be lamented.Overall? I LOVE this game as it stands, I think it's going to give me months of not years of enjoyment. I hoep we're getting more cars and perhaps at a later date, the cars we didn't get access to like the Procar BMW will be offered.4.5 stars out of 5			",94,10,9,3,2,1,9

												Well after thinking this was the best car sim I've EVER driven, I have not changed my mind. But, as with anything new, there are problems to be rectified.The Mk IV cars were a disaster as far as handling was concerned, plenty of power, but like driving on ice!One or two other teething problems, but I will hang in there.Oh, and the odd game crash is annoying.

												I was excited to see Project Cars come onto the scene especially with the open 'Free Practice' and open cars to pick. I've always loved Car driving sims and archade. In 1987 Test Drive came out (By Accolade) I used to start up on a IBC PC DOS machine. After a couple of releases from Accolade Sony came out with the Grand Turismo Series. I also injoyed the early Rally (Colin McRae) series. Great Car sims! Project cars is a great car simulator with really good graphics. Unfortunately it drops frames and the screen goes blank when I play with AI drivers. I have a Radeon HD 6870, i7-2600 Quad core processor and 16 GB of the best memory around. Don't get this game if you have a Radeon graphics card as it won't run. I have to go to task manager and cancel the game. To bad because I  really like the way the game is set up. Until Slightly Mad Studios fixes this problem I can't recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a true car fan, this game is for you. This game pays a great homage to everything about racing.

It is truly something special.Online play is a little screwy. Not sure if I was experiencing bugs or hackers but some really weird stuff happens on the track. hopefully they work on that. It did however seem to run smoothly in general while close to online drivers.No upgrades you can do on the cars, you can only customize small things prior to the race like tire pressure, camber, etc.There are plenty of cars and tracks (all unlocked) to keep you busy for a long time.

Don't waste your money on this game, if you want a decent racing game get Shift 2 or get LFS/RFactor/Assetto Corsa/iRacing. Those are much better than this.Stop downvoting this, it's true, try some of the other, much cheaper and better racing games out there and you will find a proper experience.			",6,0,2,0,2,0,0

												9/10 Just an amazing racing simulation and I've played many over the last 25 years, from Indianapolis 500, Indycar, Nascar, GPL  (basically every Papyrus title) to the SimBin series and recently Assetto Corsa. Project Cars is now my favourite racing sim despite some issues with the AI. They can often be way too aggressive and will force you off the road or even go off road as they try and pass other vehicles. Hopefully this can be addressed in a patch. Despite the AI issues, offline racing is still lots of fun. I haven't tried online yet but I highly recommend this game to any racing sim gamer.UPDATE: I haven't had time to try many of the new features or improved AI since patch 2.5 (and now 3.0!) but I will update my review when I do. Feedback since these patches has been very postive so I'm sure PCars is even better than when I first reviewed it after lanch!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not bother with this game. The developers sent out a sub-par product and instead of fixing what could be a great racing sim, they announce Project Cars 2. They are more worried about getting money out of pockets than producing a playable game. The Good: The cars are beautiful and the noises are great. Having sunlight light blind you as you enter the corner, not being able to see the exit, is an amazing experience.The Bad: The cold tires are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to warm up. You are completely worthless until they get warm and the AI just come screaming past. Can not touch the curbs, no matter the size, without spinning. Getting turned in on by an AI leaves me with 2 options. Take damage and ruin my race or get out of his way, spin and ruin my race. And the AI will turn in on you.The Ugly: The AI. The AI are overly aggressive and drive like drunken 12 year olds. They brake way too early or way too late. I can not begin to count the times I have been punted off track by the AI behind just being plain stupid. The AI get in each others way and cause pile ups. The AI can drive through asphalt, grass, tarmac, gravel, and sand all at the same speed. They do not lift off, just keep going with out a care in the world and rejoin into the side of whomever just happens to be there.			",12,2,2,1,3,0,2

												Total junk. I'm a longtime racing fan. I've played Gran Turismo from version 1 on. I've played Forza 2 and up. I've played iRacing, I've driven actuals cars in performance settings. I know cars and car games. It took me five tries to find a control setup that would let me control my car enough to get it around for my first lap, and after an hour of attempts I'm just uninstalling this game.Some things that are broken:The menus and user experience. I started using a controller because this game claims to support one. I pick ""pro"" difficulty which is supposed to turn all assists off, jump in a car and- it's stuck in automatic transmission. And there's no controller menu in the options menu, I have to exit the race to fix my settings. What crud! Did I mention all the annoying ""welcome to the game"" dialog that pops up on every new screen? Don't worry, it didn't actually explain any of this for me! And on one attempt to get into a car, for some reason my car won't move. No explanation why, no visual minder, it's just not moving. Turns out you can map a button to start your car- but next time I load the exact same mode, my car starts itself! Was that a bug? Did I hit a button? Who knows! Totally useless user experience, just awful. Don't even get me started on how you can't just hit ""right"" to go right on the menu options, once you hit the rightmost option you're not told that you need to hit RB to go to the next page. Who designed this? If I'm on the rightmost option and I hit right, put it together dummy, I want to go right.Controller support just doesn't work out of the box. I used an Xbox 360 controller, and the default settings were unusable. This from someone who can pick up any game in either the Gran Turismo or Forza line at any time. It's absolutely the fault of the controller support. They wanted to rope in those gamers, and they failed.Triple monitor support doesn't exist. There are some tricks you can use to force the game to run on 3 monitors, but out of the box, proper triple monitor support just isn't included. For anyone not in the know, you use triple monitors so you can see left and right during gameplay without using a control. It makes looking ahead in turns, or online racing with other people, a lot easier. This game? Nope. Have to trick it using external support.I'm already finding problems with the driving model- as many people note, track elevation is grossly exaggerated so that a track with slighy undulations looks like you're driving straight up the side of a mountain. Famous tracks are borderline unrecognizable, cartoony versions of themselves. Cars get into ""tank-slappers"" way too easily- clearly it's exaggerated just because someone thought that ""hard to control"" meant ""realistic"". All that means for me is that I have to fiddle even more with the terrible controller settings because I'm constantly fighting a car that wants to go sideways on hills that are straight out of a cartoon.I'm done. This game is a pile of junk. Do not buy.			",143,39,27,39,34,1,48

												As it stands, I can`t recommend this game; I`m only glad I bought it from Amazon rather than Steam, as it was £15 cheaper.You can have all the pretty graphics, single player and multplayer modes and options you like, but if the basics are broken -   namely the FFB and handling, you won`t be playing for long. The default FFB settings for my wheel (T300) are so feeble that they might as well not be there, and no amount of adjusting the ridiculous number of settings improves this. And yes, I downloaded the `tweaks` files from the forum.Also, despite the description of the game as a simulation, the cars handle more like they do in Grid, rather than Assetto Corsa or RaceRoom; that is, they stick to the road come rain or shine.Until the handling and FFB are patched to make the game more playable with less effort, I recommend passing on PCars and, for less money - and if you can put up with outdated graphics and mostly South American tracks - Stock Car Extreme.

												to anyone considering buying this game because they played forza. please reconsiderfirst, this is not forza.the landscape and tracks are beautiful and the cars just the same. but the control mechanics are sup par to the point where some vehicles are uncontrollable. the steering overly sensitive where a slight turn can put you in the wall. the cooled tires are over exaggerated just the same. counter steering is nearly impossible as it just sling shots you to the other side of the wall. the braking mechanics are a little slow where I feel a mclaren has the brake calipers of a 60's caddilac. assists do not really help the mechanics in the game. the driving lines when slowing down or brake are inaccurate where i mostl likely end up in the wall or in the field. the AI's, are either really slow or make perfect lines to the point where it looks like they are riding on rails.i had such great hopes for this game as i was looking for something to substitute forza and my xbox being in the military and unable to bring them with me.  i recently hope they might put out a patch for the game. I sure hope they do because i do see potential. but until then i dont feel i will continue to play this game!!			",16,1,4,8,7,1,4

												If you own AMD and crying about this sim it's your falt for buying AMD.  This game / Sim is awsome looking and feels great . If you know how to set up cars it's even better feeling. If you own AMD It sux to be you. Step it up and buy a real machine and enjoy a awsome graphical Racing sim and stop crying about the game not working for you....boo hoo. Lots of control over the game settings and setups for the cars and many different cars to chose from. I'm loving this. Much better than AC and easier to navagate. Many many ajustments to make it very fun and as real as they can make it now. My new wheel ..a thrustmaster 500 is just the perfect match for this Sim. Still don't have all the settings locked in yet but getting it closer to where I want it. Plan On spending time to find your settings and getting it to feel good for yourself then go have some fun. Looks like the online racing on here is improving slowly.			",14,0,17,0,2,0,0

It isn't as well optimized as it could have been for AMD cards, I won't argue with that but that's down to AMD no the developer, and AMD have stated they are working on it.I'm running a 7950 by no means a monster of a card which is some years old now, and I can run most settings on medium to high with a full grid, while recording and still get frame rates of 50+ [EDIT]			",38,2,13,3,13,0,14

												Not yet ready. The entire game is more like a beta. Many parts are not finished or buggy - some cars have broken physics while others are great, on some tracks the ai is downright broken, sound cuts out and session has to be restarted to get it back, HUD display costs 10fps ...This has the potention to be great but atm it stinks of an early release. Take a look a few months down the line if things have been wipped into shape via patches.Edit: After a few more days of driving I would not rate it either tumbs up nor down. The GT-races are really fun an intense. Other cars like to old classic F1 cars seem too much to handle properly for the ai resulting in chaotic races that are less fun. As it stands I would say 80-90% of the content is great and the rest need some patches. It sill remains an early release but it can be whipped into shape.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted a racing simulator were I could just jump in and drive against the AI and have them give me a run for my money. And THAT is exactly what I got with Project CARS. Along with outstanding car physics, a Force Feedback system I can tune to my liking, mind blowing audio, superb graphics, and more track layouts than I can shake a stick at. And there's more to come!! If you like pure racing machinery and less every day street machines, then this should be added to your Simulation library.			",66,7,6,7,4,0,1

												I've put in over 200 hours and I still continue to love this driving game. For me it is the best of the lot and sets a new watermark for all its competitors to try to beat. The graphics are astonishing, with the dynamic weather/ day/night feature something that just has to be seen. But it is the racing that just keeps bringing you back. The immersion, intense and accurate portrayal of each class of car is brilliant.I have an AMD HD 6990 card with an i7 processor and am able to enjoy the game at decent graphics settings. Just get this game. You will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												pcars is visually stunning but the physics and FFB (and graphics) really smack of a newer version of a ""need for speed"". It lacks the FFB and ""real road"" of rF2 but the graphics are incredible....I have a G25 and 3 42"" LCDs and get AWSOME frame rates. Its more game than sim to me but a BLAST to play on or off line. Its MY perfect companion to rF2. It lets you relax and ""play"". When I want to be ""serious"" and run a SIM, its still rF2 for that. When my friends are here and want to race in my rig....THIS is my new ""go to"" Game.			",5,0,8,1,0,0,0

												Amazing driving sim. The handling of the cars on my Logitech G27 wheel is really spot on, once you get the set up right which you can find online the way different cars,karts handle & you have to be quick to recover from a spin if feeling the back of car losing grip. I have other car games like AC which is a great sim as well BOTH are really amazing at the graphics & handling of the cars, All i can say are both well worth the money if you love driving sims, So don't just sit and watch youtube vids of the game buy it now and hopefully i be racing you soon online with the others :)			",34,1,6,2,4,0,2

												Honestly, here is my verdict;I have played both Assetto Corsa and Project Cars. Played Forza 4 and 5, and GT 4, 5 and 6.I do not have some 'super computer' by any means, in fact it is probably underpowered compared to most hardcore gamers. SSD, AMD 6 core, and a 770TI card...nothing too special.Project CARS is easily my go-to game now. I have not touched any other racer since, and sure it may not have all the cars, or it may have some bugs, but all in all it feels special...and I am running it between High and Ultra.It is very hard, but I have played with both a wheel and a controller, and it is definately do-able. I did not have a wheel for the first week it came out, but if you are able to play Assetto with a controller you can definately play this with one too. Quit complaining that a 'racing simulator' is too hard. It is supposed to be hard.			",10,0,3,0,3,0,0

												I have a hard time recommending this game at this point. Every single update that comes out may fix some issues, but breaks just as much. This game is not fit for public release at this point, even after multiple official patches. This latest patch refused to let me calibrate my wheel properly even after 3 consecutive tries. It's apparent that nobody quality tests these new releases on any platform. Car setups used to be OK, but even after fixing my wheel on the 4th attempt, they still feel like garbage. Any wheels off the track now result in penalties that slow your car down in the middle of the race making it dangerous for yourself and anybody around you. This is not racing. At this point, the game is a joke.However, the biggest joke of all may be the limitless level of unprofessionalism displayed by Ian Bell, head of the studio on their official forums. His conduct is enough to make anybody sick to the stomach. Silence the criticism, act like an immature child and employ moderators who somehow manage to act even worse. Say anything negative about the product and find yourself banned or accused of being part of some conspiracy. Full disclosure, I have never registered or posted on the forums myself. I heard of this through words of mouth and then proceeded to spend hours going through their major threads until I just couldn't stand any more. I would certainly encourage anybody who doubts these claims to go to the official website yourself, or look up some great YouTube videos including screenshots of all of this. This is one person who will not pay another dime for any add-ons or sequels thanks almost entirely to the conduct of their leadership.Beware when purchasing this game. Even if the bugs are eventually ironed out (and that will not be any time in the near future), you are supporting a studio who couldn't care less about what you think.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game looks beautiful and seems to have a lot of potential but feels very unfinished and unrefined.  My biggest problem with this game is the drive-ability with game pads.  I'm not a serious racing sim player and I use game pads to play games.  I love console racing games like Forza and GranTurismo and I've been playing these games for years and I'm pretty good at it.  So as a console racing game fan whose most comfortable with game pads, I found ProjectCars to be almost impossible to play competitively without crashing on every other corner.  I spent many many hours adjusting the controller setup and even tried out many setups posted by other people on the forum but it was still very much unplayable.  I have given up trying to play this game until the game developers can fix the controls so a casual player like me can actually enjoy playing this game.			",25,1,1,1,1,0,0

I strongly recomend this if you got a HMD (HTC Vive or Oculus), otherwise i would get that first. Funny part: I have room scale with the HTC vive, so im actually able to step out of the car and walk around it, funny thing happend... My brother started driving while i was walking around the car, and i accidentally fell backwards and started screaming. This is a must have for the Vive, also recomended to buy a Logitech G25 if you wanna get immersed times 10.			",51,14,8,1,31,1,14

												not finished at all.... only really any good on nvidia and even then it still looks bad.  the simplicity of a racer is gone, and its no sim, far too easy.... play AC and 'feel' the difference.  the FFb is broken completely and i just dont trust the latency of the controls - something is wrong at the core.  I cant beleive that 80,000 gamers helped develop this title, alls i can say is that they were Nvidia contributers and not AMD.  But that argument aside its still a poor title.  Im so sorry that a paid 39.99 for this, it kinda reminds me of Shift in many ways seems as buggy and just plain sticky.  I like the fluidity of racers and visuals and/or waving crowds are not part of the equation,  it seems that glitz overcame the glory.  The benchmark for me is Gran Turismo - it felt right and looked pretty good (and was always well above the usual 30 fps even way way back)  Polyphony always understood the need to get the game moving right before adding or not adding things that will get in the way of the drive.  Yes you can turn things down but it doesnt add more detail /definition to the handling of the car, the saved resources are not then spent on the physics they are just omitted, the game still plays far too arcady.   i dunno really it may be good for you but i much prefer AC, take a car around a track there and im sweating after, and spend time watvhing every bump and sway on a replay.  UPDATE - on finally getting it on win 10 with new 15.7.1 driver all seems well FPS wise, but it still looks really bad, it tears even with VSYNC (which i just dont get?) it all still looks jaggy, even in 2k with VSR - how is that possible.  Then there are the crashes.... system crashes, same error (cant remember it) I turned down the 290x and still same issues....  ill keep with it though cos it cost me 39.99 but i wish i hadnt have bought it... FFb seems better now though, on a plus point - but its still far from finished, and i hear they are already making PC2, the money merry go round never stops it seems....  and i read somewhere this is Playstations most popular racing title?  really??... i will be buying the PS4 only for Gran Turismo when released, we all need a new benchmark, i mean AC is good but i reckon GT will leave us all speechless....

See the devs politic : Instead of fixing the FFB which the majority thinks it sucks, they're expecting us, to tweak the FFB with third party files. There is a ""sticky"" on their forum about it when it should be directly in the game.I have a lot of games and this is my very first review because i'm mad that I haven't been able to play the game properly since 10 days.

												I will try to be as fair with my review as is fair selling this ""game"" for 50€.Prosvehicle varietygraphics may be considered goodConshorrible physics - To all who think this is simulator, I can assure you it is not. You can change the actual car grip by mashing throttle and brake inside corner and the car won't slide at any speed, try going smoothly and you are off the track. Some kerbs (those that are on the outer side of a corner) will throw you outside the track, so does grass which is apparently made from glue. Some kerbs however are not a problem for the car and you can cut low speed corners in full speed without punishment. Crests don't work at all. Collisions do not work at all. You go side by side and if you touch you are stuck the the other car until you hit the barrier. On the other hand you can bump into cars in corners without punishment and that looks really funny.horrible AI - they will keep crashing you on the inside in cornershorrible UI - you can not edit controls from race (only in main menu)If I find something positive about this game I will update this review. But now it is UNFINISHED and overpriced product. I am pulling my hair out now for buying it, should have waited for F1 2015.			",32,3,5,7,8,0,5

												Awesome simulator!  Yes that's right its a sim.  Ignore everyone else who says it isn't.  Get yourself a wheel, turn off all the assists and drive round Spa in the Wet....yep told you.  The game does have issues (what new game doesn't nowadays), sad but true.  There has already been a patch on PC with more to come no doubt. You will have to spend some time setting up the FFB if you have a wheel, I use the G27.  I'm on the PC and I haven't played with a pad so I can't comment on that, I can imagine the karts would be tricky with a pad but with a wheel they are crazy fun!  The actual driving part of this game which is surely the main bit is absolutely phenomenal!  One of the best interpretations of road racing I have played on PC period.  There are a large selection of cars all exquisitely modelled and they sound great too.  You don't have to unlock anything, it's all there at the beginning which is a refreshing change in my opinion.So like I said once you setup the feedback and dial in some settings the game comes alive.  If you expect to just jump straight in and expect to make competitive laps you will fail.  There is a learning curve but that's how I like it.  What you waiting for?  Go and buy it now.

												I had high hopes for this games release. I have 4 hours of online racing now, If you want a serious sim this is not the game you're looking for. The races are filled with people that don't know what brakes are, crashing at every corner, spinning you out to gain positions etc. I haven't had a single ounce of clean fun racing in this title yet. Also I hope you like waiting, because you'll do a lot of it in this game. This game also runs pretty poorly on a mid spec PC, so only bother if you have a high end one.

												Prior to this game being released, I watched a ton of streams and video's of this game because it looked amazing. Unfortunately I didn't put any money into the kickstarter project so I couldn't get into the beta but I could see that there was builds being released frequently which is really good, looking forward to see future updates.Game is now released and I've put a little time into it since the very moment the game got unpacked. The graphics are simply amazing, unlike any other racing simulator I've seen! The AI in this game is really fun actually, but they're a bit... dangerous. There has been multiple occasions where I have had a clean lap and an AI racer comes along like ""♥♥♥♥ OFF"", knocking me into the barrier.There are a wide variety of cars in which you can choose from, ranging from 4 classes from the Formula series, to a couple of Le Mans racer series. What's fun is you can do single player races which max racers varies depending on track, highest i've seen is 56 max racers I think... 56 ♥♥♥♥ING RACERS! There's three options you can choose from in terms of classes, you can either do mixed classes, the same class but different vehicles in that class, or the exact same vehicle that you are driving. The day/night cycle along with dynamic weather changes is just outstandingly beautiful, even on low settings.To conclude, this game is a MUST BUY if you want a really good and worthy racing simulator to play. If you get bored of just doing races without earning anything, the career mode is really good. In story mode, you make your driver, and choose a tier along with class in which you'd like to start from. If you do good enough in that class, then you can get offers from other temas in different classes in which you can accept to progress from tier to tier.			",227,25,14,29,39,4,43

When the AI are being good they are very good and give a very human and competitive challenge, none of that dull just follow the racing line and nothing else crap. The handling and physics and feel of the car are top notch and even if the car list is a little bit low, again it doesn't matter because each one is bespoke and completely different. It will take hours or days to master each car. I'd much rather have 70 bespoke cars than 400 clones that look different.Being in a retro DTM having genuine dog fights with capable AI is stunning. The weather is genuinely a daunting aspect of racing as the rain is not just a visual effect but actually makes a difference. If you have the PC and GPU to do this game justice then it is a stunning game. One recommendation would be to use the inbuilt Downsampling AA. 4xDS is the most practical. You can go higher but then it just a huge performance hit for no real gain. Also the same with Ultra reflections have it on High to save performance for little visual impact.It does have some problems and areas that need fleshing out a bit. But that does not matter when what happens on the track is this good. And SMS plan to keep adding and updating the game for a while so these maybe non problems in the future. Already heard that the animated pit crews will be added shortlyIf your a petrol head then there is no question if you should buy this game or not.Or if you like the GTR series then you will like this due to the fact it’s by the same core people.

												After playing this so-called racing sim, I'm pretty disappointed from what I've experienced so far. If you are expecting this game to be great out of the box, you'll find it frustrating. If you have all the time in the world and are some racing geek who likes to spend all day tweaking rather than driving, then this game is for you being provided with many options. Especially with all the delays, I expected some finished product rather than relying on the user to achieve what should have been. Force feedback is awful without any tweaks and some RACING cars will feel like a boat! It reminded of me driving an early 80's cadillac. I'm no expert and have absolutely no experience behind these cars but do understand that it shouldn't feel like driving a floating boat!I guess I don't have to mention about the awful AI but will remind you that it will ruin your game play most of the time, especially if you're not at pole position. No wonder this game have an achievement that rewards you to finish first after a crash in the first corner...lol.If the developer decides to fix all this and provide us user with at least the base minimum at default, it would have been great as it does have the potential.

												Project CARS is an awesome racing game that strikes exactly the spot of being fun but still feels very credible in the driving physics. Having a relative that is too rich I have driven a lot of sports cars in the 500+ hp category to the edge and this is one of the games that feels right. Modern sports cars actually handle more like a game than some might think ;)And it does not hurt that it is THE best looking racing game of all times :)			",51,6,9,6,24,0,18

												Project CARS is The NEW Generations of Gran Tursimo , it runs at smooth 60fps at 2560x1080 with all of the maximus settings , not one drop of frame rate . The team did a fantastic job on this racing game , it has everything from Cart racing , Formula 1 Racing  ..etc , for me to do a Full review on this game , would take me dozens of pages , all you need to know is ""that this game runs perfectly ....at consistant 60fps  not one drop Highly Recommend this game to RACING FANS			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Edited after coming back from my initial anger)I haven't played much at all but I am already very disappointed... The physics are a complete nonsense. I expected something arcade-ish like Shift2 without the ""on-off"" behavior, but it's actually neither realistic nor fun. The same car will understeer like hell on a curve, won't understeer at all in the rest of the track, high-end racing cars grip like a 60's Chevrolet... Tracks feel narrow and simplified.I noticed that passed a certain threshold, you simply have no control whatsoever when high-speed skidding during the first second, then get back in control when it's too late. I didn't identify the exact circumstances yet, The kerbs behave like ice blocks with some cars. (Edit) - Now I realize that when you break a bit hard, the cars goes straight, even when the wheels aren't locked.... your controls have zero effect until you stop breaking. I must say I didn't use any assistance, so I guess you need to turn on the ABS to have a more realistic brake system. Whatever. The physics are just ridiculous, I wonder who can still think that a winged racing car will slip everywhere as soon as you move the wheel a bit quickly, even on a tiny amplitude and at high speed. (/Edit)I expected much better graphic-wise. The graphics have clearly been optimized to look good during replays, or at spectacular times (dawn, rain). However, during normal plain-day racing, they are not that great.The AI is worse than in Assetto Corsa, although very random in quality. The noise engines, claimed to be a huge step forward in some forums are not as realistic as in Assetto Corsa... The sound is not as good as in any other modern sim. There are scripted pops and noises when you leave the stands, while the engine at constant revv... The sound is flat and lacks seriously of complexity. I wonder how it could souns so good in the Youtube video comparisons between P. Cars and other games.I expected it to be a good arcade-ish game to complete Asseto Corsa, but in the end, I do think it's not even as good as NFS Shift...  less arcade and yet much, much less fun to drive (Ok if you choose the 4x4 of course, high-power 2WD cars were way too wonky in NFS).Saw an article about all the hype being somewhat crafted. Actually, it does make sense: ten of thousands invested quite a lot in the game and are promoting it, flooding the forums, trying to get a bit of cash by multiplying videos on Youtube. Many of the comments are just hilarious when you realize how the game really is. However, the 'positive' wave is so overwhelming that it probably influences the judgement of many. I am looking forward for finding the first honest review on Youtube, by somebody who isn't afraid to be seen as a troll.A bad game? No. Just every other car game I tried is more enjoyable. This one simply has no specific quality in any domain.  And more importantly, the incredible hype has no justification whatsoever. If you want something more funky than Assetto Corsa, better go for the old classics, from the first Flatout to the olds NFS, GRID etc, even GTR2 (not arcade I know, but the races, especially over 24h, are still without equal; and it's not a such hard game). They are much more fun. This one feels dull, it's only vain noisy agitation. Even Test Drive Ferrari, despite its huge flaws, was more fun. I guess I'll wait for a career mode improvement in Assetto Corsa.Uninstalling ASAP, as it takes a lot of my SSD. At least I can get this back, unlike my 50 Euros, due to my pre-purchase.

												Since the release of Project Cars, I did put in a few hours on the various tracks with different cars and may say it is very enjoyable. Now to the nitty stuff!It took me a few days to figure out, how to set the video in order to get decent frame rates, otherwise your false teeth will come lose and eventually fall out. The manufacturer states that it is not a Game that belongs on a Laptop. My best guess, you'll be sorry if you do anyway.My system is made of a AMD 8 core CPU, 16GB DDR3 RAM, a HD Radeon (7950) and had really good trouble to produce a decent game play. As you can see all in my enclosure is AMD and there are lots of complaints that the Game was developed with Nvidia in mind and forget about AMD. Not really true, besides I can't proof a thing about this statement. Apparently, Nvidia Cards perform a lot better than AMD on pCars, however with a little patience and a number of tests, it is possible to get up to 60 FPS too on a 60Hz monitor and above Graphics Card.All the AMD gamer, will either have to wait until a major improvement in performance is offered or take what you got, or of course leave it.I'd chose to stick with it, because the Game has much to offer.It is exciting to drive at close to 200 mph in rain and at night, a feature that I have only found in Rally simulator.Pretty much all the legendary tracks are included with the base package. There are cars for pretty much every taste. I have seen older Racing Games, that can and do have 1200 or more community developed cars and hundreds if not thousands of tracks, but give me a break. What do I do with all of that, drive every day a different car on a different track for the next ten years or so?In the end they all do the same, fake a moving vehicle on screen. How good or bad, is another question.So, pCars has just enough cars to try and find the one that suites you best from various different categories.Tracks are excellent and plentiful, pretty much everything for every taste.Car physics are excellent in my opinion, I actually can drive without spinning around, when I was a little too excited on the throttle. I remember, real high power cars do that too, but one can manage on a real road. I believe pCars has just about the right recipe to give you the feel of a real car. It will punish you, if you overdo it.In short, I like the Weather feature (even real time weather), the car physics, the time of day settings, excellent vehicle models, Wheel support, realistic sounds, I am not much of a multi player fan, so I can't comment on that.All over it is very enjoyable.What I don't like, is the limited support (I don't care which end causes it) for the AMD hardware. I am a Fan of AMD ever since Intel used a so called Business strategy, that was supposed to put AMD out of business. Besides, AMD provides hardware at a much more affordable level, meaning, less money to spend for the CEO. (Don't worry, he/she will still have enough to survive)So minus score for the Video issue, since the Radeon could perform much better and we have to run the Game at lower settings.There was a few other things I fell across, but forgot, guess it wasn't that important after all.

												-Ignore the physics bashers, unfortunately even early contributors failed to understand the placeholders physics that were that, placeholders most of the development phase.You will find state of the art physics, absolutely varied car behaviors, from easily forgiving to punishing murderous old fashion beasts.-You can feel dynamically how the car is loaded on a turn (tested on G25 wheel) and naturally provoque the car on controllable slides, no typical always-snap cheap sims outcome.Graphics need no review, except the detail that being a natural pc title, performance is great and easily adaptable from minimum to best hardware, so you can always balance pc/gpu load to get the most.-Sound is amazing and if you dont have a good sound card you will lose some brilliance, i have tested both audigy 2zs and asus xonar DX and everything you can do to improve sound will dramatically impact immersion, from card to headphones/speakers.PROS: All of the above, plus the amount of tracks, instant controller response.CONS: Force Feedback! Right now it cant compete in car variety with multiple times the budget titles, but the base being there, that can only improve with time.UPDATE: After retesting Assetto Corsa, the negative aspects of FFB have become quite relevant, the FFB options are nauseating, should work right from start, and touching sliders dont fix the isolation and straight line numbness. Assetto was horrible too when it came out, but now is brilliant regarding FFB.			",35,2,2,4,3,0,3

The AI in the game is pretty silly really and makes no sense. To me the gameplay is not great, random sliding and braking dosen't really do what it is supposed to. Overall I give the game a 5/10 which isn't good enough for a £40 game. Not worth the money to me.			",304,38,16,31,35,1,26

												Let me start out by saying that I never write negative reviews about anything, at least until now. Alright, so I've been waiting for this game for some time now. I've always enjoyed racing games, and I was excited that the PC was getting a big sim release. I started the game up and as soon as I started playing I ran into my first issue: 1. The game runs poorly on AMD cards (and some NVidia users have also complained). I understand one manufacturer having the advantage over the other in a specific game, but a 290x being outperformed by a 760? That's a bit insane. My setup is an i7 2700k @4.4Ghz and an R9 295x2 with a 2560x1440 monitor, and I had to turn the settings down to roughly medium/high just to get playable framerates (45+, it's not very stable). Alright, so I managed. I was having some fun doing the online time trial, and I was excited to start my career the next day. So I got up, started the career in the Clio Cup, and something just felt off:2. H-pattern shifting DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. I figured this wouldn't be an issue, but apparently you're locked into using the exact transmission type that the car has. Yeah that's great and all, but what if I ENJOY using H-pattern? I personally hate flappy-paddle, and I can deal with sequential, but my Logitech G27 doesn't have a sequential option...So those two reasons might not throw everyone off, but for me it's enough to say that I should have waited until there's a fix or at least an explanation for these issues. Is it a fun game? Sure, if you can deal with the flaws. However, the game currently feels unfinished, so I'd wait until the issues are fixed or wait for a price drop. I REALLY hope everything gets fixed though :/ . So maybe soon I'll change this review to a positive one!			",133,15,11,19,21,0,10

												I am Logitech G27 owner with some mods. After I got used to Assetto Corsa (after about 100+ hours), I couldn't get used to Project CARS physics. Mostly because of almost dead force feedback. Yeah, the SIMULATOR which doesn't have proper force feedback! It feels like you are driving on a totally flat road (except moments when you driving on track border or somewhere on grass/sand and wheel starts heavily knocking and except Nordschleife, where your car feels like jumping on the road) which sometimes feels too slippery on some surfaces. You have to be extremely alerted in order to catch the feel when your wheel is lighter/heavier and where it goes. In rain you have nearly no information, your car just go sideways if you are not really cautious. No other information is provided unlike Assetto Corsa where any bumps, camber, dips are felt and you can react on them accordingly.Sometimes car setups are ridiculous and I don't understand people, who set Default Setups rule in multiplayer. F.e. setup on Renault Clio Cup with front and rear wheels toe-in set to 0.9 degrees. Seriously? Very stiff rear suspension on Toyota GT86 which makes her oversteery. Wat?Graphics is sweet, however, night on some tracks looks awful. But I love rainy days, it looks pretty nice.However, there are many other things that Assetto Corsa lacks as a proper simulator, f.e. night & day transition, weather conditions, engine/oil/brakes temperatures (brakes temperatures were implemented with last patch to some cars in Assetto Corsa) and soft-body physics for cars, but even in Project CARS these things doesn't make any real sense. I never experienced my brakes overheating (on any car they get stronger when warmed up, but on typical sport cars it is kinda weird, they aren't supposed to handle such temperatures), never experienced engine blow driving with around 115 degrees on engine and 122 degrees on oil in endurance races.So, If you are looking for a DRIVING SIMULATOR with a proper steering wheel, you'd better be looking for something else. I don't recommend this as a driving simulator but it is up to you to pick your poison.UPD: Just in case if anyone will have a question why the hell I am still launching PCars and play sometimes if I do not recommend it. PCars has a little bit more content, better graphics and features that I like, but still it doesn't mean that I changed my mind about driving simulation. We're buying games to have fun and make use of it, aren't we?And yeah, after last launch I had remembered one more thing - bad network code. People with bad connection or little bit of lags might ruin your race even if they didn't want to do this. Opponent's car can teleport right into you and launch you in the sky, chasing opponent can lag and punch you on braking point and happily continue to race pretending that nothing happened (which actually DID NOT happen to him and he just watches you running into a wall for no reason or because of ""small"" tap in your rear). Since the AI isn't really good and I prefer to play with people this is a really frustrating thing for me. And there are a lot of bugs connected with network code like missing cars on replays, wrong colors, non-functional wheel after joining session, desync, black screen after load and etc.			",135,26,5,7,2,1,9

												I'm going to fly in the face of opinion here and say PC is a disapointment.  The content and graphics are nothing short of spectacular.  However, a driving game sinks or floats based on its physics engine and this really lets PC down.  It is simply way too arcade-biased and suffers from myriad flaws that ultimately spoil the experience.  A case in point is that the F1 cars are more benign in handling tems than the likes of the R500 and the Atom.  The sound is also very bad for some reason and sounds like it's been presented at very very low bit-rates.If you love arcade racers, then jump in with confidence, but if you're looking for a sim, I'd look at Dirt Rally instead.  It's a real shame because PC is the best looking driving game every produced and has raised the bar for other developers.  If only they could have done the same with the physics model for the handling.			",106,16,4,5,4,0,7

THIS IS FORZA FOR PCThe game runs smoothly on nearly all high/ultra settings, and I'm running all of my hardware at stock speeds/settings. In certain situations I'm seeing 40fps, but normally 50-60fps with VSync on.My system: i5-4670k with an NZXT Kraken x40 Water Cooler (I believe it's the x40, I think it was discontinued) EVGA GTX 970 SC (Old Cooler, before the 2.0) Corsair XMS3-1333mhz (ddr3, stock clock) ASROCK Z87 PRO4 (All stock, no settings changed) Game is running on a WD Blue 1tb, 7200rpm. Loads fairly quickly, I'm impressed. EVGA 750W 80+ Gold Certified G27 Wheel, Pedals, and H-ShifterNot a mega power-house system but it gets the job done for sure. I race in full-manual, ""pro mode."" However, I still needed to go into the settings and turn off auto-clutch and other assists myself, anyways. Don't know why.Anyways, onto the juicy stuff.I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into sim racing. While the physics are fairly good, it doesn't outshine Assetto Corsa. What this game offers over Assetto Corsa is a more arcade-y feel, as well as more tracks and cars, and shinier environments for sure. (More trees and things on/off the track) Think of this game as Forza, but for PC, I suppose. Project Cars, in my opinion, is better if you want to see tracks almost how they are in real life. While Project Cars and Assetto Corsa laser scan their tracks, Project Cars puts much more detail into it. Like on the Nordschleife, not only do you get a prettier environment with a great skybox, you also see all the writing on the track, as well as skid marks and what have you on the apex's. Handling feels good, but I feel as if there isn't enough feedback, and if something goes wonky, like if you gas a car too hard, you don't really get this feeling of ""wow, I need to fix that"" while you attempt to initiate a save while your car is sideways--it kind of just happens and unless you clutch or let off the gas, there isn't much to do from what I've experienced. If your car starts to wildly sway left/right, or whichever way, there isn't much chance of saving it. It's as if inertia, mass, and traction are no longer a thing, and you're skating on ice. Hitting walls doesn't do much in regards to flipping you or throwing you, which is kind of dissapointing. Granted, I haven't played with the feedback settings yet, but the way the game comes, it seems that they're trying to entertain more casual players. More advanced players need to tweek the umpteen amount of feedback settings to get a better feel. I've found on my pedals that there is a dead zone when you tap it. With a little experimentation, you can easily find the dead zone. (pedal is less sensitive, so people that go hamfoot don't lock up brakes/overgas.)For fellow car-enthusiasts, certain aspects of this game versus, say Assetto Corsa, will find that the sounds in this game versus Assetto Corsa are FAR different. Turbo noises are different AND VERY ABUNDANT... I've barely heard any gearbox noises so far. (I have a 5.1 speaker system right next to me, so it isn't that I can't hear it) Engine noises sound ok, but not as throaty and mean as I would like (yes, I'll say it, Assetto Corsa wins engine noises, and noises in general. Further testing is needed)People on console were complaining that their controllers/wheels weren't working correctly, but I've had no such problems with my wheel (obviously on pc.)If I'm in the mood for a challenge, I'm not going to pick this game over a game such as Assetto Corsa (people also swear by RFactor, but different games for different people) It seems that in this game, every car I've driven (BMW E30 M3 Group A, Pagani Zonda Roadster, McLaren P1, Ariel Atom) makes the game feel as if I'm in a rocket ship. Yes, these are mostly track cars/race cars, but it feels a little awkward to me. If you're looking to work your way up into more ""advanced"" simulators with more realistic physics, this is a great place to start, as you'll definitely get a good feel for racing simulators, as this one can be FAIRLY forgiving, with certain cars. However, my friends and I will definitely continue to play this game, because, well, it's a racing simulator. :)I know I sound pretty one-sided with Assetto Corsa, but I've sunk a fair amount of time into Assetto Corsa to make judgments. When Project Cars was announced, it was hyped to be an AMAZING physics simulator, but I think that didn't go so well, so they decided to spend a lot of time making Forza, but for PC. I'm rating it positive because there is room to fix this. So this is how I'll rate a few things;7/10 - Garage graphics and car choosing, I have anti-aliasing and other things maxed out or at optimal settings, and I'll be honest, the car models look kind of bad. The colors are nice, but the models aren't. Too many small jaggies to be honest. On the track, they sunk a lot of time making these shiny environments, but there's so much, not everything could look spectacular. The teasers and promo videos made the game look super bright and colorful, but I'm not really getting those vibes. It's more bright and colorful than Assetto Corsa, I'll give it that, but there's so much going on that the little jaggies and whatnot are showing up.9/10 - Just the environment alone looks pretty good as I said above, if you just realize that the tracks/environment have a lot of time put into them, it's nice. It gives the tracks some character and feels more realistic, but not much. The tracks have the marring and graffiti and whatnot on them, which is interesting to see, while you blast cars with rocket boosters down the asphalt...9/10 - If you're a new sim racer with a wheel (I can't judge on an xbox controller I'm terrible with it, regardless of the game) the wheel setup is pretty good for beginners. It has a nice learning curve. Game is fairly forgiving. In Assetto Corsa, the way it comes stock, if you hit the brakes too hard you can easily lock up your brakes. I'll be honest, I'm experienced and I still sometimes do it in that game. But in Project Cars, I don't think I once went, OH CRAP if I hit the brakes too hard. I wouldn't say the pedal controls or anything are more refined, but again, they're appealing to the new guys, the people that go hamfoot (just kick the brake or push too hard).6.5/10 - If you're an experienced sim racer/casual/casual sim racer (I enjoy sim racers and play them frequently, but I'm not hardcore. However, I turn all assists and HUD off when I can.) this game feels like you're trying to eat pudding with a fork. Cars are drive-able the way the game comes stock, but the fact that the game makes you feel like you're on a one-way rocket ship to the next corner makes it feel like you're just going too fast to enjoy the corners or apex's. Apex's in my experience feel kind of flat. I didn't have an experience where hitting an apex launched me or jeopardized my lap because I hit it the wrong way or something. There's more, but I'm hoping you're getting the idea here. If you race with all assists on, the game is pretty easy mode (appealing to beginners and casual players).5/10 - Physics are really just not there compared to other games. Like I said above, if you're experienced it's like trying to eat pudding with a fork, and you know you can't really do it, but you flip the fork over and try and scoop with the handle (try and make the best of a situation) The physics exist somewhat, but don't expect anything fabulous.9/10 - Car selection is pretty sweet, but I haven't seen any slow cars. Many people won't say it, but driving slower cars not made for the track can bring new levels of excitement; something this game does not seem to offer.I'll be honest with you, I enjoy it but I'm not playing racing simulators for pretty environments and skyboxes.

Project CARS is a beautiful and in depth racing simulator with enough cars, tracks and racing disciplines to keep you entertained for months. With a slew of gameplay and realism options available you can pretty much craft your perfect driving experience.An exhaustive career mode features eight tiers of competetive racing and a fully customisable free race mode alows you to create any racing conditions you desire, including karting across the California coast in a thunderstorm!The tuning/engineering aspects could have done with some tuturialisation and the lack of a test track is glaring mistake.Those of you looking for an arcade racer may want to stay away, especially at full price, but those of you looking for some depth should definitely take a look.

												First off I like to know what computer someone is using and how does it preform.  I'm running an i7-4790K 4GHz, 16GB ram, GTX780, Window 7 64bit.  I'm playing with all visuals on ultra and maxed out and I have yet to see a single stutter.  Now the game.  Visuals are really nice, lighting, reflections, rain all very realistic.  I would be ok with a little more spray coming off the car in front during rain stints, seems the realism is lacking a little here.  I have played GT, Grid, Dirt, NFS and I feel Project Cars is a above all of these when it comes to car handling.  You have a lot of options in PC to personalize your game play and the challege level and I really like these options.  I was on the fence between PC and Assetto Corsa.  I really like games that lean more toward sims than arcade and I feel PC does lean this way.  I chose PC because it is a newer game and so I figured it would have more realistic graphics and from what I reaseached it leaned to the sim side.  I can't say if the graphics or game play is better than AC because I have never played AC.  The one BIG issue I have is with car damage.  I have my damage level in game set to ""Full Damge"" this should affect visual damge to the car and the performance.  If you slam into the walls enough you will eventually lose a hood or maybe break off a tire.  I intentionally slammed a wall head on during a race at 150mph.  I backed up took off and still won the race.  I looked at the outside view and all I had were a few scrathes on the front.  This part of the game is a joke.  There are no penalties for hitting the walls or other cars.  If this was real life at 150mph a wall would take you our of the race.  Minor contact with a wall or another car should at least leave you with some visual damage and maybe a slower or ill handling car at least.  If you are a player that doesn't like these effects then turn damage ""off"" or to ""visual only"" but for those of us that do want the full damge let us have it.  This is really my only beef with the game.  Fix this an you will have a great game on your hands.   Now don't get me wrong, it's hard for me to stop playing this game.  This is a solid racing game and it is a lot of fun to play.  I plan on playing this for a long time.  Just consider a patch to cause some more damge and penalize me for not racing like a real driver and I will be super stoked.  If you like racing games you can't go wrong with Project Cars, buy it now.			",19,2,3,2,7,0,0

												This is the most amazing racing game I have played in a LONG time since like GT2. At first my reaction was meh because I was karting in career mode, but then I decided to do a free race and chose the Zonda Roadster and my god let me tell you THE MOST GORGEOUS CAR DETAILING EVER! and then the sound was like a million raspy birds singing the song of the car gods. For sim guys this game is hard as hell which is great.This is one of the best and I have play ALOT of racing games from all the GT series to all the Need for Speed up to the new Forza(which is trash) Project Cars is with the best of them.

												EDIT:  Additional thoughts after 80+ hours with the game at the bottom.My current thoughts after 15 hours with the release version (50 total):Performance has been a pleasant surprise. I've got an AMD HD 7950 and i5 and have been rocking High settings averaging around 50-70 fps (extremes of 30-90 fps). Big improvement from the alpha builds. IMO it isn't the machine breaker its made out to be or that its great looks would imply.The single player racing has been really fun, but quite inconsistent. I love that the AI react to the player by avoiding contact (a minority view, I'm aware) and I've had some great side by side racing through corners. There are a few corners that the AI are waaay to quick or too slow, but this is something of a tradition for race sims. AI pace over the weekend, between rounds, and between series is very inconsistent though, so it is hard to find a single difficulty setting that provides a consistent challenge.The driving is fun, and I really enjoy the physics simulation pCARS uses (I like rF, GTR2, & AC too, so perhaps I'm just easy to please). I haven't tried many cars since release, and didn't enjoy driving all of them straight away (erherm Clio, Caterham) but they required an adjustment of technique, and when I did that I could finally understand what the tyres were saying and the laptimes improved. I think the tyre model is great, and I think also the engine torque modelling is very good and requires consideration when switching to a new car.  Really good.The graphics are great, the sound is great, the selection of cars and tracks is varied and most are exceptionally well realised.The interface and some design choices and... [long exhale]... actually pretty much everything that doesn't happen on track: the last 15 hours have been a constant struggle against disappearing setup changes, goofy pit exits, the worst setup interface I've ever seen, unknown fuel consumption, no indication of whether TCS/ABS/ASC/autoclutch are on or off, pit strategy that has no strategy element to it (its gonna be lap 2), always always driving as the sun sets, occasional near pitch black races, OMG unskippable 'invitation' events in the TC career, that old sim issue where time accelerating in qualifying means you are knocked off pole position by 10 seconds, a few janky gearshift issues (to be fair this may be my wheel finally giving in)... well you get the idea.  On a more positive note these are all things that will be easy to fix if Slightly Mad have the will to do so, and it would be fair to give them the benefit of the doubt, especially given how hard they have tried to make the sim as broadly accomodating as they can. The highly tweakable HW, SW, and car setup pages are testament to that, event if they make me want to weld my eyes closed.I think that along with AC, this will be a sim that I'm returning to in bursts and spurts for many years to come, just as rFactor and GTR2 were before. It is a shame that it is mod-unfriendly, as that will limit its longevity compared to AC. However if the online game is well supported then it could be an excellent gateway into racing sims for anyone that is wanting something more than the GT or Forza series.TL;DR: It's a really excellent game while driving, with excellent customisation, and just needs some polish of the menus and usability features.EDIT:Additional thoughts after another 40 hours with the release version:The performance has improved with driver and application updates.  I'm not running AA, but am not dipping below 60 fps very often.  People were (rightly) very grumpy about all the nVidia Gameworks BS, but it still runs very well on what is now a midrange system, and looks incredible.  Actually it looks better now than at release -- the rain effects are improved.  Having an AMD system is no reason to avoid pCARS.The interface has slightly improved, but the setup screen is still the ugliest thing out there.  I'm still very irritated about the handling of setups in general (only one per car per track, they still intermittently reset, no import/export, awful awful interface if i didn't mention that).  The ""Race Strategy"" is also still a joke, with no way to choose a preferred lap to pit stop or any graphs to aid strategy choice.  There is at least a weather forecast now and an estimate of the fuel range in laps -- very basic stuff for a race sim right?The AI really is great.  They usually race hard and fair.  The occasional d!ckhead shows up and brakes too late or accelerates away too slowly or sideswipes, but it is nothing you don't see at a real race track all the time, and it is fairly rare in the game. Wheel to wheel racing with the AI in pCARS is definitely far better than any other PC racing sim. The aggression and driving style also changes between the different categories, with GT and open wheelers much more respectful than the b@stards you'll find in touring cars.  And IRL.What it DESPERATELY needs is the ability to pick a single catergory/series and race that, not just when that series is offered within the career calendar.  How did this feature get left out?  It is also BS to have to alternate between events because of the calendar career system.  One catergory/series/event at a time please.But it really is an outstanding racing sim, and I'm still having a great time playing it locally with a friend once or twice a month, alternating sessions between us.

												The game has very good quality of graphics. Also they are focused on reality as we see. But there is a problem with cars. Lack of cars are biggest problem of this game. They need to make a lot of DLC to produce people better racing experience. Also some cars haven't another opponent team. As an example we can play only with Mercedes in DTM sessions. Also there is a retro DTM Mercedes car and it has no opponent. If there is at least 4 different teams for racing, game would be great. They can't buy trademarks of Porsche so they have Rufs. I wish they bougt Trademarks from Porsche. As a result of that there is no Porsche 919, also in LMP1 class there isn't too much competetive teams. Examples, Porsche 919, Toyota TS040 and recently Nissan will produce a FWD LMP1 car. It won't be in the game too.I wish they could prepare an Retro Le Mans Class. And in these class Porsche 911 GT1, Mercedes CLK GTR and a few more cars could participate.Also there is no Ferrari cars... They must buy trademarks of Ferrari. They did it before at NFS Shift 2 Unleashed. But EA was their support them. Now they are on by own but they need to buy Ferrari's trademark. In conclusion game is good but need to develope. They need a lot of DLC for cars. We would see what happen in the future.			",26,4,10,0,1,0,3

												Incredibly beautiful racing game. outstanding weather effects, solid racing game.  excellent in car view (NFS and every other newer racing game should have in car view as a standard)  so far so good. my only complaint is the lack of vehicles. yeah, it has a bunch of stripped down pan-am racers, but my god, i just wanna roll in a GTI, cobra, or a porsche, or lambo.  Hopefully in the future, ALOT more cars will come out. as it sits, not really that fun.			",171,6,12,4,2,2,6

												Started out playing Gran Turismo 2 in the late 90's. More recently got a bit serious with GT5 and GT6 and bought a proper wheel/pedal setup.This game is exactly what I was looking for!In GT6 i'm mostly interested in racing cars (not road) cars so Project Cars fits the bill here with its racing car roster.In GT6 i'd have to acquire licenses buy slow road cars which wern't as enjoyable to drive (to me anyway) and grind a bit to be able to play the GT3 race cars i really wanted to drive. Project Cars wins again with the ability to choose any car at any time.With the car list i'd rather have quality over quantity. So while pCars may have a relatively small car list compared to other titles they do seem well chosen as i'll see my self regularly enjoying/using ~50-75% of the cars in pCars while in GT6 i'd only use maybe ~5%. (Admitted, i became a bit of a ""Premium snob"" towards the end, not wanting to play ""Standard"" cars in GT6) But in pCars ALL the cars are ""Premium"" and modeled very well.Graphics.. cant say much bad about them. They're stunning.DK2 support -- i realize its in progress but i've found myself STILL preferring to use the DK2 even with its shortcomings (menus, less than ideal resolution, comfort). I think i'm slightly faster with the DK2 also, maybe more consistent for sure.Sounds are great. Again coming from GT6 it wont take much to impress me, but the Z4 GT3 car in pCars sounds incredible. (esp compared to the vacuum cleaner samples from GT6)Track list is amazing too. I was a lil bummed about no Suzuka, but i have to admit after running around sakitto its an amazing fictional track that loads of fun to drive. The California highway and Aszure coast point to point courses are amazing as well.FFB seems very good, although it took a bit of fumbling with some of the settings to get a good feel. There are tons of options of which i have no idea what they do so i expect i'll be able to dial in even better FFB as i get more familiar.One minor gripe is the lack of explanations in some of the options/settings menus. Some items are obvious, some items are described fairly well, but others have zero description of what the setting is for/does so it'd be nice to have more verbose dialog in these settings screens. Or enhance the ""online-manual"" to explain all of these settings. (The online manual is only a very high-level overview of the screens and doesn't go into nearly enough depth in my opinion)Love the ""Real"" assists option which applies assists on the car which are true to life.Would love to have better photo taking options. The only way i can see is to pause the game mid-race and snap one (or the showroom). We should have the ability to pause a replay and then move into photo mode and move cameras around etc..Is there any way to save in-game photos out of the ""driver profile""? that would be nice. As it is now I'll probably keep using the F12 steam hotkey.Seems very well optimized as i just ran 56 gt cars at road america in a thunderstorm and my GTX970 was only dipping to ~45FPS at the start. [Graphics settings all on Ultra/High AA=High]Highly recommended for and sim racing fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the most amazing racing game I have played in a LONG time since like GT2. At first my reaction was meh because I was karting in career mode, but then I decided to do a free race and chose the Zonda Roadster and my god let me tell you THE MOST GORGEOUS CAR DETAILING EVER! and then the sound was like a million raspy birds singing the song of the car gods. For sim guys this game is hard as hell which is great.This is one of the best and I have play ALOT of racing games from all the GT series to all the Need for Speed up to the new Forza(which is trash) Project Cars is with the best of them.

												First off I like to know what computer someone is using and how does it preform.  I'm running an i7-4790K 4GHz, 16GB ram, GTX780, Window 7 64bit.  I'm playing with all visuals on ultra and maxed out and I have yet to see a single stutter.  Now the game.  Visuals are really nice, lighting, reflections, rain all very realistic.  I would be ok with a little more spray coming off the car in front during rain stints, seems the realism is lacking a little here.  I have played GT, Grid, Dirt, NFS and I feel Project Cars is a above all of these when it comes to car handling.  You have a lot of options in PC to personalize your game play and the challege level and I really like these options.  I was on the fence between PC and Assetto Corsa.  I really like games that lean more toward sims than arcade and I feel PC does lean this way.  I chose PC because it is a newer game and so I figured it would have more realistic graphics and from what I reaseached it leaned to the sim side.  I can't say if the graphics or game play is better than AC because I have never played AC.  The one BIG issue I have is with car damage.  I have my damage level in game set to ""Full Damge"" this should affect visual damge to the car and the performance.  If you slam into the walls enough you will eventually lose a hood or maybe break off a tire.  I intentionally slammed a wall head on during a race at 150mph.  I backed up took off and still won the race.  I looked at the outside view and all I had were a few scrathes on the front.  This part of the game is a joke.  There are no penalties for hitting the walls or other cars.  If this was real life at 150mph a wall would take you our of the race.  Minor contact with a wall or another car should at least leave you with some visual damage and maybe a slower or ill handling car at least.  If you are a player that doesn't like these effects then turn damage ""off"" or to ""visual only"" but for those of us that do want the full damge let us have it.  This is really my only beef with the game.  Fix this an you will have a great game on your hands.   Now don't get me wrong, it's hard for me to stop playing this game.  This is a solid racing game and it is a lot of fun to play.  I plan on playing this for a long time.  Just consider a patch to cause some more damge and penalize me for not racing like a real driver and I will be super stoked.  If you like racing games you can't go wrong with Project Cars, buy it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Remember this game is really not a sim. It's a cross between a sim and a arcade game.It's like something between a real simulator like Assetto Corsa and a arcade game likeDrive Club. Most tracks are not laser scanned and the FFB (Force Feedback) will not beas good as Assetto Corsa.It is still a very enjoyable game. Developer will have to really do something to fabricatesome artistic licensed FFB on those tracks without FFB to really make the game kickfor those who are simulator fans and owns a set of steering wheels.I must say I bought this game for the weather effect which Assetto Corsa do not have.I am loving the weather engine ... every moment of it. So if you are looking for puresimulator as advertised ... don't be fooled it's not, and may never be.AMD cards owner currently seems to have issue with frame rate issue during AImatches, especially ones with too many cars involved. The frame rate drop is sodrastic it's not worth AMD card owner to get the game until it's resolved. I am usinga single nvidia GTX970 Asus with not much issues.The user interface could have been better design. It seems the beta ones looks betterthan the released version. Current one is difficult to use especially selecting the car'sskin can be tricky business. Others including tuning setup of vehicle has no graphicalrepresentations , eg graphs or charts ... all numbers. Given the time they spend ondevelopment and a few major shifts in release date , it's quite dissappointing.The focus quite alot on the career side of things. However you cant buy or buy partsto upgrade your cars, or keep a garage of cars which are made and tuned by you. Youcould however saves tuning setups on the stock models to load them up later.Which is very limiting for the arcadie side of the game.The multiplayer side of things is strange as well. The server searches for games in yourregion as defined by steam. So america players will see servers in america, and uk playersonly the uk ones. So for region with little players you have to literally change your regionon steam setting to get into a region with populated servers to play in.So ... here's my take on Project CARS.If you really wanna experience a good sims I would say Assetto Corsa still does it better, it just doesn't rain in AC's world.

												This is a very good game and has a great career mode. I love the features of the pit engineers and how the games is so vastly customisable. The physics are ok however with some improvements they can become as good as the physics of assetto corsa. The biggest problem for me is the ai or the computer drivers. They remind me completely of the original drivers in assetto corsa but with updates that game was mastered. The ai have no sense of the other drivers and are happy to smash into you and dont give way to let you overtake. They then crash into you you flip end up in 16th and are either out of the race or your car is in such bad condition you have no chance of catching up. In my opinion i dont want to have a rewind feature like forza does however if the ai are going to stay as they are you find yourself having to restart the race and then the same happens. I have spent up to 45 minutes trying to complete a race without being crashed into and forced to restart if i want to have any chance of winning the race. This game was hugely anticipated but it doesnt meet the excitement that it betrayed. To me Project Cars is in beta and feels like a very much incomplete game. With a few fairly major improvements the game can be fantastic and better than its rivals of Forza and Assetto Corsa. I would recommend buying this game even though their is a few major problems I think the developers will improve these features if they want to stand of chance of becoming worth the hefty £40 price tag. The reason I have given a Thumbs down simply relates to the price. £40 for a game that in my opinion is worth £25 maximum. Many may not agree but after playing for around 10 hours i seem to find myself aimlessly starting a race getting crashed into then pressing restart, on a constant loop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDITED 6/9;I'm happier now. I've had some luck tweaking things and making the game run a bit better. The title offers a LOT, and I feel like I didn't give it the fairest shot. It still has issues. It will probably continue to. The upcoming DLC are a draw- I'm hopeful, and willing to pay, if they bring interesting content.I'm interested to see how the game evolves and if some of my issues get solved in more satisfying ways than I've experienced thusfar. Is it worth a shot at full price? I still don't know. But I'm nowhere near as negative as I was a few weeks ago.I'd LIKE to like it. But I simply cannot.Project CARS shows promise. However, as is now common in gaming, it's unfinished, and not in the cute, rough around the edges ways people playing more niche Sim and strategy titles are used to, but in the ugly, broken, I can't run the damn game way...It's got a great variety of tracks and cars (with GLARING holes on the latter however, they need more licences!), It's gorgeous beyond compare, the driving feel is allright, the amount of tuning you can do is pretty nuts. It supports head tracking and VR. Has day-night cycles and weather which, well Assetto Corsa never will, and generally feels pretty polished.Until you crash to desktop because the damn thing is broken. I'm not talking about every once in awhile. I'm talking, drop in a race or practice session, it's about 50/50 as to whether it'll decide to keep running or not. And I'm NOT running on old hardware, either. (i7 4790K, GTX970, 16gb DDR3-1866 and the game is installed on a 850EVO.)  I've seen several reasons why this may be the case, that the game doesn't like overlays (problem if you're like me and want to record or stream your gaming,) that the game doesn't like overclocks... Whatever. It doesn't work for me.And of course, because I only get so much time before it crashes, I don't have a complete picture of the racing elements. But I'd argue that I don't need a picture of anything, when the game is as unstable as it is now. I eagerly await new drivers from Nvidia and patches from SMS that may address this however I'm not hopeful.For now, don't spend your money. Pros:Interesting, Varied car lineupGreat tracksWEATHER! DAY-NIGHT CYCLES!Awesome graphicsHead TrackingBetter FFB than say, codemastersCons;BROKEN. Holes in said, varied, interesting car lineup (One or two cars per class, missing key players in all. No Chevrolets either, I'm biased!)Possible AI issues? I can't tell, they've shunted me but I spend more time crashing to desktop so I don't rightly know.Fake sponsorships and cars abound! Other Thoughts: This game has the Lotus 49, 72, and 98T, the Ford GT40 Mk.IV, and the Mercedes Sauber C9, all amazing vintage race cars. And none of those cars have their competitors represented. No BRM's, McLaren's, Eagles, Brabhams, Coopers, Hondas, Matras, Tyrells, Shadow's, Ferrari's, Alpine's, Chapparal's, Porsche's or any of the other dozens of marques that'd have fought those cars on track. At least the Escort Mk.1 gets to play with that ugly Merc touring car, right?This is a sad trend that has been seen across many recent sim titles. Obviously licensing idiocy by the real world brands is part of the problem, here's looking at you Stuttgart, but in general this is really a bummer. Not a problem exclusive to this title and it probably will never be sorted out, but a thought I felt needed expounded upon.In conclusion, I'll keep playing and hoping that patches sort this wretched crashing problem out. Enjoy my money SMS!			",98,11,27,20,33,1,21

												Been playing this game since it was a Alpha after helping fund it on Weapons of Mass Development.Honestly it has came on leaps and bounds and the game has become so much more playable and the level of polish in this game is awesome. The crazy detail on the cars is great and the track detail is great too, honestly can't believe this is the same game that I played a few years ago.The online is often ruined by the people playing who will ram you off if you find a game lobby where no one slams you off you will have some great wheel to wheel racingEdit:I got a wheel and waited a bit until I got a new PC and so on and wow this game is leaps and bounds better it is so hard to not recommend this game.

												ENG:The game is good and bad. If you want a truly realistic picture of the car races and the rules here are today's most advanced game for you, but if you want more fun game where you have a better driveability and supports modding, so I recommend buying Assetto Corsa game. As a self-help, and I want to modding the game, so much to the dismay of this game does not support it so I prefer to play more Asetto Corsa for this reason but, on the other hand I recommend buying both.The only bad thing, and the missing thing in the game is my favorite car brand Porsche lack of car selection.I recommend the game, anyway! :3FIN:Pelissä on hyvää ja huonoa. Jos haluat todella realistisen kuvan autokilpailuista ja säännöistä tässä on tämän hetken edistynein peli sinulle, mutta, jos haluat hauskemman peli jossa on parempi ajettavuus ja tukee modausta niin, suosittelen ostamaan Assetto Corsa pelin.Koska itse tuen ja haluan modata peliä niin, harmiksi tämä peli ei tue sitä joten itse pidän pelata enemmän Asetto Corsa tästä syystä mutta, toisaalta suosittelen ostamaan molemmat.Ainut huono asia ja puuttuva asia pelissä on minun suosikki auto Porche merkin puuttuminen autovalikoimasta.Suosittelen peliä, joka tapauksessa! :3			",455,106,67,38,78,8,81

												Project cars; the visually best race-sim around even in 2016.I was long on the fence w. this one: Assetto Corsa or Proj. Cars?I tested both and at first I was leaning heavily towards ASSO'. Its customisation and add-on community are levels and leagues above Proj. C.'s. What reason other than greed or laziness that the devs. of Proj. C. hasnt made modding by the community possible I dont know. It would have added so much dept and re-playability. But then again: its certainly easier to sqeeze money out of customers for dlc, if they arent allowed to be creative themselves.There's one drawback w. a free modding-commnity: driving online becomes a maze where you scramble to fetch the latest community published tracks/cars/what-not's since otherwise you cant take part in the races. Since they'r community build ... you find yourself searching the web high&low for them. This is the case in Asso' much like it was in GTA, GTA2 & GT-Legends [Simbin Studios] during the last 15years, and in many respects Asso' reminds a lot of these games. Proj. Cars, well, its hard to pinpoint, but it posesses a style and feel of its own.Wether you choose Asso C. or Proj. C. I think comes much down to taste. There are details which are more 'sim-ish' in one, but then again other features that are more race-accurate in the other. Fx. ffback is definately taken to a higher level in Asso', but on the other hand there's a graphical degree of 'extra' in Proj. C. which just make you feel ""present"" on the race track in a way Asso JUST DOESNT DO.In Asso you may find yourself thinking ""Wow, I'm driving an amazinly detailed sim"". In Proj. Cars - you dont. Your' too occupied beliving that you are actually out on the track and juuust about to crash into the barrier or another car.-One thing which is an obvious miss and quite a letdown is the monumental absence of Oval Tracks in Proj. C. versus Asso C. who has them curtesy of the commnity.The Proj. Cars dev. sell Nascar & Stockcar [car] dlc. But... Nope. Not a single track to do the oval racing that these cars are build for in real life. I refuse to belive the developers are ignorant enough to have overlooked this obvios miss. So, once again the Proj. Cars devs. shine with a developed sense for Greed. Which can only disgust a customer.... And to get that gargoyl out of the shades: Yep', I'm one of those racers who occationally enjoy 'full contact racing', as its for example done in Stock Car races. It has a thrill and adds a First Person Shooter dimension which cant be described.

												 I have just started with P Cars and I think its stunning and there is no other PC game that I know comes anywhere near for the  realism it produces with superbly detailed cars and tracks.   Good on you guys thanks for producing such a quality product, and if any of you petrol heads out there are reading this go ahead and spoil yourself, Project Cars is well worth being part of your pleasure.

												Simply the best simulation on the market at the moment.- Great visuals- Stunning sound (the F1 sound is bone-shaking ... never heard something like this in a video game)- Excellent physics- Many tuning settings- Great online functionality- Breathtakingly intense racesAfter all the Gran Turismo, Need for Speed, and Drive Club garbage, this is what I have been waiting for since the first rFactor (no, I do not like Assetto Corsa).So if your PC can run this game and you are a die hard sim racer, there is not much you can do wrong with this one. Get it!			",197,41,12,35,19,3,19

												Been playing this game since it was a Alpha after helping fund it on Weapons of Mass Development.Honestly it has came on leaps and bounds and the game has become so much more playable and the level of polish in this game is awesome. The crazy detail on the cars is great and the track detail is great too, honestly can't believe this is the same game that I played a few years ago.The online is often ruined by the people playing who will ram you off if you find a game lobby where no one slams you off you will have some great wheel to wheel racingEdit:I got a wheel and waited a bit until I got a new PC and so on and wow this game is leaps and bounds better it is so hard to not recommend this game. I wouldn't use a controler though as there is no feedback on what the car is doing.			",195,12,17,14,8,1,13

												ENG:The game is good and bad. If you want a truly realistic picture of the car races and the rules here are today's most advanced game for you, but if you want more fun game where you have a better driveability and supports modding, so I recommend buying Assetto Corsa game. As a self-help, and I want to modding the game, so much to the dismay of this game does not support it so I prefer to play more Asetto Corsa for this reason but, on the other hand I recommend buying both.The only bad thing, and the missing thing in the game is my favorite car brand Porsche lack of car selection.I recommend the game, anyway! :3FIN:Pelissä on hyvää ja huonoa. Jos haluat todella realistisen kuvan autokilpailuista ja säännöistä tässä on tämän hetken edistynein peli sinulle, mutta, jos haluat hauskemman peli jossa on parempi ajettavuus ja tukee modausta niin, suosittelen ostamaan Assetto Corsa pelin.Koska itse tuen ja haluan modata peliä niin, harmiksi tämä peli ei tue sitä joten itse pidän pelata enemmän Asetto Corsa tästä syystä mutta, toisaalta suosittelen ostamaan molemmat.Ainut huono asia ja puuttuva asia pelissä on minun suosikki auto Porche merkin puuttuminen autovalikoimasta.Suosittelen peliä, joka tapauksessa! :3			",455,106,67,38,78,8,81

												Yes some of the cars have odd handling and I don't think it is a pretty as some say, but I am having great fun playing through the championship. Online seems fairly solid too, although I still haven't done much of that yet.  There is a real sense of accomplishment working through the various classes and I actually think the A.I is fairly good. Yes it isn't as hardcore as some of the other titles out there, but there is a great selection of cars (hopefully more to come) and great tracks. I would reccommend this to any car fan.

												Disappointing in so many ways.Force feedback was added late and it is still not properly done, you need to spend a lot of time tuning and configuring to get something decent out of it.Tire model? There are two levels of grip: plastic and not-plastic - both lack the flex or rubber tires. Not really the way rubber tires work according to different temperatures, does not handle properly things like flatspotting and heat cycles so it is not as ""lively"" or believable to drive with.Car simulations are overly generic and simplistic: not enough of vehicle-specific characteristics in the handling. There are values to change but they don't behave like you would expect.Visuals in promotions and trailers are nice though.As a game it might be decent but as a simulator it is not enough to satisfy experienced drivers.Accomplishments leave a fake feeling.There are better choices available.

												This isn't Gran Turismo or Forza. Just finished my 1st race of 20 laps @ Watkins Glen at 100% AI, damage. started on pole in the BMW Z4 GT3. Bad start dropped to 2nd, spent the next 8 laps trying to find a way past 1st. Got A nice run out of the bus stop right on his bumper followed him through the right-hander dove to the left and a clean pass on the inside on the following left hander. Spent the next 12 laps fighting off 5 cars in pursuit making numerous attempts at passing me each and every lap.After fending off the challengers on the frantic final lap I crossed the line 0.28 seconds ahead of 2nd.There is a lot of debate in the sim caring community where or not Project cars is a sim or ""simcade"". Personally I have Have driven a lot of sim races (GT Legends, GTR, GTR2, Race 07 + all add ons, Assetto Corsa. None of these have delivered a race like I just had.Don't listen to others, do yourself a favour, if you are a racer draw your own conclusion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												   Let me just start out this review with a short statement: This is the best racing game I have ever played in my entire existence as a human being.    As soon as I saw the trailers to this game, I crapped my pants. The Graphics were amazing so I thought i'd give it a try.Not only were the graphics amazing, this game's driving mechanics are second to none, I feel as if I am actually driving a Formula 1 car going 150 mph. In addition, PROJECT CARS has a large selection of cars to choose from ranging from little go-karts to amazing sports cars and Formula 1 cars. The track selection in this game is also fantastic. The selection includes many tracks from all over the world.    With the amazing mechanics, outstanding graphics, elaborate list of cars and tracks, I give this game a 10/10 with a BADASS seal of approval.			",59,3,6,8,21,1,23

												Let me keep this somewhat short and simple. Don't take the negative reviews too seriously. Project cars is very good. Not perfect. But in my opinion, very good. I've played NFS-Shift, Forza, and most recently AC. To be honest I like this the most with AC coming in 2nd. The graphics are indeed beautiful ( boohoo if using AMD) and the sounds are very lifelike. The game plays well, is very tweakable, and with my Fanatec CSR is great fun and a challenge.If your a fan of racing games or sims you'll want to give this a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project Cars is a realy good simulator if you want to play serious series of racing like gt or more, I've got 70 hours of plays and I'm still loving it! But if you want to play road car, like the BMW 1M, I recomand you to go buy an Xbox or a Playsation, The control of the cars is not event close of the real cars, it's feel to me like I was driving a Ford crown victoria with 15'' wheels on it. I take long time to try to ajust camber, suspension and everything and it still feel like a boat. On this point I'm realy disapoint. but for the racings class is a very recomendable game!

												Project Cars is one of the best racing sims I have ever played!When the game came out it had a lot of bugs and glitches which wasn't very nice but as far as I can tell they have been fixed for the most part. I do have to say I get some crashes on some online servers which I cannot explain, but nothing that really ruins the game.The game has outstanding visuals/graphics and mind blowing sound. Could not have been better in my eyes, but that is just my taste. The Physics in this engine are also one of the best I have ever seen. Tyre wear and Track Evolution are so well implemented that it allmost seems real. You really have to monitor the temps on the track and the tyres to get the best grip and stability. also don't forget to check how much fuel you need.You can turn all those things off and you will have a pretty easy racing game but... why would you? I'ts a racing sim and it's a lot of fun once you get to know the mechanics in the game.I do recomend playing this game with a steering wheel and not a controller. It's pretty obvious this game was designed with a steering wheel in mind as it is very difficult to control some harder cars with a controller.You have a very large collection of cars to choose rom but I would have liked to see some more road cars than racing cars. That's something I really liked about the Forza series. This game also doesn't have customization that Forza has but you can tweak everything about your car.Overal I think this game is an amazing racing sim and if you enjoy racing sims in general you should definitely try this one out. If you like arcade racing more it's probably not for you. This is one of those games you have to know beforehand if you like hard en realistic racing games.			",154,12,11,12,10,1,7

												This game is incredible. It's well optimized, and is one of the best SLi games I've played thus far. The cars look incredible, and the tweakability is insane. My G25 took a little bit of calibrating to get just right, but once it was setup and tuned, the experience this game gives is awesome. For $20 for the base game on HumbleBundle's store + $10 in expansions, this is well worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is on sale for $20! Only having played it for about 15 minutes, it is insane. I am glad I got it this cheap as I am sure it will be blast when I get a steering wheel and throttle controller to plug into my computer in about six-eight months. So far, as of right now, it is a little ridiculous. I jumped in really fast. Chose a really fast car, so it's all over the place. For now, I'd rather play Carmageddon. haha.			",72,5,3,6,6,0,8

												Project Cars is a realy good simulator if you want to play serious series of racing like gt or more, I've got 70 hours of plays and I'm still loving it! But if you want to play road car, like the BMW 1M, I recomand you to go buy an Xbox or a Playsation, The control of the cars is not event close of the real cars, it's feel to me like I was driving a Ford crown victoria with 15'' wheels on it. I take long time to try to ajust camber, suspension and everything and it still feel like a boat. On this point I'm realy disapoint. but for the racings class is a very recomendable game!

												Project Cars is one of the best racing sims I have ever played!When the game came out it had a lot of bugs and glitches which wasn't very nice but as far as I can tell they have been fixed for the most part. I do have to say I get some crashes on some online servers which I cannot explain, but nothing that really ruins the game.The game has outstanding visuals/graphics and mind blowing sound. Could not have been better in my eyes, but that is just my taste. The Physics in this engine are also one of the best I have ever seen. Tyre wear and Track Evolution are so well implemented that it allmost seems real. You really have to monitor the temps on the track and the tyres to get the best grip and stability. also don't forget to check how much fuel you need.You can turn all those things off and you will have a pretty easy racing game but... why would you? I'ts a racing sim and it's a lot of fun once you get to know the mechanics in the game.I do recomend playing this game with a steering wheel and not a controller. It's pretty obvious this game was designed with a steering wheel in mind as it is very difficult to control some harder cars with a controller.You have a very large collection of cars to choose rom but I would have liked to see some more road cars than racing cars. That's something I really liked about the Forza series. This game also doesn't have customization that Forza has but you can tweak everything about your car.Overal I think this game is an amazing racing sim and if you enjoy racing sims in general you should definitely try this one out. If you like arcade racing more it's probably not for you. This is one of those games you have to know beforehand if you like hard en realistic racing games.			",154,12,11,12,10,1,7

												This game is incredible. It's well optimized, and is one of the best SLi games I've played thus far. The cars look incredible, and the tweakability is insane. My G25 took a little bit of calibrating to get just right, but once it was setup and tuned, the experience this game gives is awesome. For $20 for the base game on HumbleBundle's store + $10 in expansions, this is well worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I 100% recommend this game. This was the first game I ever pre-ordered, I had seen the trailer and was stunned by its graphics and so I took the plunge - so to speak. I originally played this game on a steelseries SRW-S1 which is an accellerometer based wheel and I found the game to be excellent but once I bought myself a Logitech G29 it just totally transformed the game for me.The game excells in it's graphics and its content. Whilst there are lots of DLC packs to be bought, they are in fact worth it. Once you have the FFB dialled in the way you want it, the game really unlocks to you. I've seen some comments suggesting that the FFB is annoying because of the default set-up, but the way SMS have set up the FFB is that you can adjust so many different global FFB settings and more specific FFB settings on a per-car basis. The result is everyone (with a little tinkering) can find the settings that suit them.I will say that the Multiplayer can be annoying sometimes but I am more of a single-player, also the AI will shoot across corners with reckless abandon and receive no punishment from it unlike the player. Bearing these two things in mind, the game is not reaching its full potential but with out a doubt you will still definitely have fun with this game.   I know some people complain that the physics are basic. Having not played iRacing or Assetto Corsa, I can only compare this game to arcade games and for me the physics are outstanding. I really feel like I know what the car is doing. As for bugs, I have found bugs with the RADBULL drift car and some multiplayer connection issues but that is it in 550 hours of gameplay a very few small bugs so I don't quite know what is causing them for other people.The graphics are excellent and well optimised. I play on a laptop and have all the graphics on High and get 60fps so they have done an excellent job in optimising the game for Nvidia cards.The gaps in vehicles including in the game might put some off (e.g. no Ferrari or Lamborghini) however if you are patient, Machine Dojo Modding Team are working on free car models to include in the game. SMS rather helpfully released an update which makes it a lot easier to install modded vehicles.All in all the game holds it's own. The AI is a bit arcade-y and the multiplayer has some bugs in relation to people's internet connection (as many games fdo). Maybe as it is my first Racing Sim it seems more amazing then it is but to be honest from what I've seen of other sims; imo this game is very well rounded and is the best parts of acrcade and sim to make sure everyone has a good time.Also recommend checking out ApexOnlineRacing (AOR) leagues done on pCars to get a good idea of the level of racing you can achieve on this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game, if you've managed to spend time looking into the ffb on various sites.I seriously wanted to refund this after the first hour,the ffb on a g27 was terrible on defaults.Sorted it out,,took a couple of hours but glad i did.It captures the feel of racing better than some of its rivals, graphics are excellent on a decent rig.If you have pace, exactly know the braking points , the AI are fun to race. If you don't have pace, then they will steamroller you.It's certainly not perfect, but does more right than wrong imo.Been playing offline mostly getting used to the cars and tracks...Checking online , hopefully can add friends with some clean drivers.I'm late to the party, but i'm enjoying this game.

												This is the most fantastic racing game that I have ever played. The graphics are beautiful and the tracks are numerous and detailed. The cars are many and there are loads of driving views. There are many options available which can be a bit confusing at first, but if you take your time, you can set the game up to suit your skill level. You can set the weather, the skill level of the other drivers, the number of opponents, driver aids for yourself and so on. You can play through a career and start at whatever level you want or play a quick race or practice etc. It doesn't need a ninja machine to run on either.  It is hard to put into words how good this game is. Try it for yourself. I am pretty sure you will like it as much as I do.			",43,0,9,0,14,0,4

												Cars!This game is alot of fun, for the little I tryed it.at first I couldnt figure out why the car whent all over the place with my Logitech G920I figure it out at the end.When you calibrate it, first turn your wheel all to one side, then click next, you need to put it to 90deegree to the other side, this meaning going past 0 and going to 900 aka 90degree after 0When this is done, the game is ready to play.I do sugest to put engine start on one of the unused buttons and whipers to a other one, if you have manual shift and gearing with the gear shifter extra.This game was fun as is, but this has VR support to, and when playing in VR, this game got so much more fun.I do lack a propper driving seat, but they cost a bunch. but man its fun.All the cars have uniqe stearing, breaking, and such that the racing wheel trys its best to mimmic thge car it represetents, so its not like a empty shell on a same chassis you have in most other driving games.If you find this on sale, its worth picking it up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												!As I am not an expert in sim racing, my opinion might be wrong in some areas!Project Cars does a great job with a physics for a sim racing game. They are not arcade sim like Gran Turismo, but also, not on the hardcore level. The graphics are one of the best racing games had and racing a Formula 1 car on Barcelona track in stormy conditions was one of the breathtaking experiences with driving games I had. But this game has a few drawbacks. For example I still haven't finished career mode, as it was simply boring. Instead, I just was messing around with settings and participated in seasonal events. Multiplayer was dissapointing. Technically it was great and racing with other people is amazing. But there was no quick match options, like in Gran Turismo 6, where you can get into instant action. Instead, you are just browsing lobbies and hope that someone is playing on your favourite car class.Still it is amazing game and I had a lot of fun playing it. I recommend it.			",70,15,8,6,3,1,11

The configuration is limited with controller and no matter what I do I always feel like I'm being assisted. Not the game for me as of now. If I ever take the time to try it again. I'll do an update.

												Whoever made those unbelievably idiotic FFB-settings, should be lifetime-banned from game development!Also in comparison to Assetto Corsa the car-selection is dissapointing, and the physics sometimes questionable.Track-selection could be better as well, and there's still no actual campaign (with buying, tuning cars like in Gran Turismo).Graphics are good.Sound is good.And it's nice to have rain and night.That's it. Those are the only reasons I might boot up this game again.But if I want pure driving-joy, I will just play Assetto Corsa.			",48,11,7,11,6,0,2

												This is just a precursory review, but the game is phenomenal.  It's sim-like enough to give a satisfying driving experience, but not enough to beat you over the head when you don't practice like it's your second job.  It's everything I was hoping for... something like a GT/Forza for PC.  So far I've only tried the shifter karts and did a few laps around the Nordschleife in an Ariel Atom, but it's an absolute riot.  Not to mention the graphics are gorgeous.  It also supports my old Logitech DFP wheel right out of the box and the FFB feels good.  I was planning on only using an Xbox controller, but after trying the karts I had to set up the wheel.I probably won't cancel my iRacing subscription, but I have a feeling this is going to get more play.Looks phenomenal on my i5 4690k with a GTX760 at 1080p.  Can't wait to give it a try when VR headsets start coming out.			",192,19,31,11,31,3,20

												     看着开头的CG已经足以让我热血沸腾。说说游戏本身一个字“专业”（呸，两个字）没有改装但是调校部分很细致，画面很惊艳但由于本屌的垃圾显卡无法见证发挥全部实力的质量，车损做的很一般甚至比不上某xx飞车，但是引擎声，路面反馈，操控手感都很专业向，配乐也是一大亮点听着我都要射了（害羞脸）。目前使用xbox one Elite改了几个键位玩着还算舒服，不建议使用键盘。。。车类游戏我觉得用键盘都很蛋疼，有能力的上盘子当然最好。本身没有官方中文，查着字典大概搞懂了常用选项的翻译能凑合着玩，汉化包没去找怕出问题。     先码这么多吧，总之推荐喜欢车，热爱车，尤其是赛车的你入手。     老子的血管里涌动的是汽油！！！			",27,2,1,1,1,0,2

I somewhat enjoy the challenge of no flashbacks. But why no option to turn it on or off just like restarting I don't know.			",163,47,16,17,15,2,19

												Let me start by saying that I very nearly did not buy this title due to the negative feedback left here on Steam. Even when it was just £12 in the Humble Bundle I read a few recent reviews and thought maybe not, but then what the hell, why not, how bad can it possibly be?After loading up, electing to drive an Aston on Snetterton as a free run, all default settings except for loading the suggested Steam controller configuration I set off for my first lap, full of trepidation for just what a car crash this software was going to be, no pun intended. Well that was a surprise, I’m pleased to report that I’ve no idea what planet the other reviewers were on, but after 45 minutes of roaring around the track having great fun I’m pleased as punch that I bought this title.Previous reviewers have said it’s unplayable with the Steam Controller, that seems to have escaped me. Others have said they spent hours configuring it just to make it playable, guess I did spend 30 seconds loading the Steam Controller configuration. The graphics are apparently not up to other titles, not sure what these titles are, I thought they were awesome. I’m told that the fps is appalling, well I have mine capped at 60fps, and the game ran at exactly that at all times, and this is on a GTX960 with an i5 3570; maybe I need to go into the graphic settings and tweak them to get lower fps?!Maybe after just 45 minutes I’m not yet fully qualified to give a review, but I’m only doing so as I was nearly put off buying this title at £12 due to the reviews of others, and I think it is without doubt one hundred percent worth the money.

												If you like racing games, go for it, because it feels just right, it drives extremely well, controls as it should and it's a great experience!If you don't usually like racing games but enjoy a nice peaceful drive along some cool scenery and long roads in dream cars, this is also for you with the full track of Nurburgring at your disposal and the full length of California Highway, both being the longest tracks in the game at a wooping 12+ miles each, both with point to point configurations as well!If you have a VR setup, get ready for the ride of your virtual life!Get it, now!

												This is by far the best racing sim to date.   The cars actually handle very well with no adjustment.  The only hard part so far for me was setting my F430 wheel,   After that resolve,  what can I say the graphics are awesome the AI are forgiving,  you can  adjust the cars to handle even better if required.   I see people in the forum complaining about this or that and my recommendation is to stick with it and you will figure it out.  If you are  experiencing a bug they will fix it. I cant put my finger on it but their is something about this game that feels so real..  ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is clearly unfinished ! Dont get me wrong its a very pretty game but there is a lot of little things that will bug the hell out of you, such as the unhandled exception crash which effects the majority of people ! The handling feels as if you are driving on ice, online is poorly thought out and the a.i in single player are all over the place. I feel this game was rushed for release. NOW for my major concern - i posted in the forums stating that i felt the game was clearly unfinised and isnt quite ready for release, it was deleted in a few hours !!! thats CENSORSHIP.........

												Oh my god, this game is amazing. Most details are superb and of high resolution quality, the games phsyics mechanics feel pretty solid. You defo need a racing wheel to play this, keyboards & xbox controllers do not do the game justice. There are hundreds of settings for cars and even more for Grahpics/Audio/Controllers.Good resolution support, I have tested with 1920*1080, 2560*1080 and, 2x DSR'ed 2560*1080, 2x DSR'ed 1080p.Slight lack of cars & tracks at the moment in comparison to something like Gran Turismo 6 or Forza 4, but more are coming :DIt even manages to make a GTX980 drop frames with settings maxed to Ultra :O Well, after some more game time, the game is getting better and better. DLC seems great, new tracks and cars coming soon too, can't wait.  Just gotta find more time to play :/10/10 imo (I'll probably do another review / edit this one as I play more)			",14,0,7,0,4,0,3

												The gameplay for project cars is fantastic, the cars feel great, good sounds, decent graphics. While all of this is good, when I went to play online there were only 2 games found and only one of which actually had more than 1 player in it. If you hope to play online, forget it, there's hardly anyone playing and its only a week old. As for single player, it just seems like they threw it together last second. You can start from pretty much anywhere you want, with unexciting results for finishing races. There are no rewards, nothing.

												Project Cars is a great game.  I haven't had a chance to fully explore making adjustments to driving dynamics yet, but it is amont the best out there.  While some talk about bugs, it really is quite polished for a PC game at this point.  I feel like the servers do not have enough games right now and that is a disappointing aspect as being able to compete against real drivers is what makes gaming fun.  I also wish there were a few more cars.  Don't need 400 cars, but still halo vehicles of each brand should be included.  VW GTI, Toyota GT-86, Audi RS4 etc.Overall game is good but I hope bigger updates and better DLCs come out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent racing simulator, albeit hindered by SMS's shady business practices.If you manage to snag the game with all of it's respective DLC for $20 during a sale then it's worth the money, but I can't justify it in any other scenario.Not to mention, support for this game was almost immediately dropped in favor of SMS's next Project CARS 2.The game itself is remarkably good, the force feedback holds up to most simulators, and the driving is unforgiving and challenging.Tuning is pitiful. There are a grand total of like two final drive options. Why?Don't buy this game then immediately put the difficulty on max. You will lose.I have experience with racing simulators, and I still spin out from time to time.This is especially true if you don't have a racing wheel, because a controller cannot mimic the wheel response needed to tell when the car is gripping or not.Don't use your peasant controllers with this game please.Please. Don't.			",50,1,4,2,1,1,0

												I play this game using a FFB wheel and I think it's great, I think the physics are really good. In my opinion this game is up there with the best. Ive played a lot of racing sims, the likes of Grand Prix Legends, iracing, rFactor to name a few and this game is up there with them for realism. I love the career mode, where you work up through the ranks, I've never played the multiplayer mode so I can't comment on that (but you've got iracing for that anyway).I'd give this game a 9/10. I'm dropping a point because of th AI, they are not the best, they have a habit of hitting you, if you try and outbrake them into a corner and you are on the inside, they don't seem to recognise you are there and will hit you. I have tried using this game with a controller also but I'd definately recommend a wheel, the controller seemed very twitchy.			",5,4,14,1,16,0,1

												As much as I loved the graphics and UI, the driving experience was so glitchy that it made the game unplayable. The car would randomly jerk to one direction when my wheel had not been moved. The wheel would also be very twitchy and twitch to one side and then back to the center very quickly. About every third shift I would make (with the paddle shifters) would not be registered in game. It is worth noting that this wheel worked perfectly fine in every other racing game I tried with it including DiRT 3 and DiRT Rally. Very disapointed.			",18,1,3,0,3,0,1

Posted: May 22, 2015
												I'm the saddest that I have to give a negative feedback to this game, because it could be by far the best racing game available.In short: This game is unfinished and in its current shape, doesn't worth the price they ask for it, and will be soon replaced by Project CARS 2 anyway.The physics are great. The graphics are beyond anything I've saw before, Each car has its own unique characteristics. Each track is different, ther are a lot of them, you can try anything from karting dromes to coastal roads of France. The car pool is not the biggest, but definitely impressif from go-karts to roadcars, super sportcars, Formula cars and LMP-1 racecars.Why is Project CARS is still a bad game? Because it is unfinished.It has some bugs, that could be excused for a freshly released game, but it jsut cries out loud that there were areas which were completely dropped during the development.What am I talking about?1)OPTIMALIZATIONThe game is basically unplayable unless you have an nVidia card. Any ATI GPU and you're done for. I'm lucky, but many others are not.2) CUSTOMIZATIONThere are a fixed amount of possible liveries, but they have no connection with teams or anything. Basically you can run any livery you want.Meanwhile you can not choose or edit your own helmet or driver suit. The game will choose one for you for every race. So even during a championship you will most likely drive in different helmets and suits, even though they may not even match your car's livery.3) CAREERIt cries out how much they wanted to put into this one. For instance, when you start your career, you have to pick your nationality and favorite number. That's great but they are never ever used in the future. You'll never hear your national anthem, you'll never see your flag. And as I already said, you choose from a pool of preset car liveries which have fixed numbers on them so unless you find a livery with your favorite number on it, you will never race with the number you have picked.The whole career is flat and pointless anyway. Basically you win races to be invited to other races where you have to win again to get some more invitations. End of story. It is shallow, uninspired and has no point whatsoever.There are a whole set of drivers and teams for any level of your career form karts to LMP-1, but all the drivers and all the teams have the exact same abilities. There is no better or worse driver or team. Heck, they don't even have their own livery, they just randomly pick one form the livery pool. So basically there is no point in switching teams in the same championship, because there are no ""better teams"" who could help your career more.5) NO AMERICAN RACINGThe game totally lacks American-style racing. There is not a single oval track, not to mention championships. There are only tow signs that they were planning to add them as well. The first is that there is a NASCAR-type car you can drive, although I didn't find any race during the career they would be used. And there is a ""Coming soon"" section of the career mode where presumably the oval races should have been...4) AIOh, my gosh, where should I start? This is by far the worst and the most unacceptable part of the game. The AI is not affected by tyre wear, tyre temperature, brake temperature, track temperature, mechanical failures, rain, trackside objects (kerbs, grass, sand, gravel) basically anything that would make your life harder. It's the worst during long  races when you must concentrate on saving your engine, brakes and tyres while the AI can push as hard as it wishes.In the rain the AI loses maybe half a second per lap. Heck, sometimes AI is even faster in the rain than it is on dry!Did I mention that AI cars are almost like concrete blocks? They have no problem ramming into you and you'll fly off the track into the wall, but should you touch them.... you fly off into the wall.Oh and in every single-make championship AI strength is totally randomized, so basically anything except the LMP and GT series is a mess, you can easily win the championship without actually winning a single race.6) THERE IS NO SUPPORTSine the release of the game, the developers are basically disappeared and they barely help those who have issues with the game. Even worse, they are already talking about Project CARS 2. Previously, they said that the game is a platform they intend to constantly expand and develop, so if you buy the game, it will be a long-time investment.Staff members already said on the official forum that the game will get a mere 2 years support and in 2017 Project CARS 2 would be released.So do not pay for this game. It is unfinished, and not the game we have expected it to be. Its technical support will be suspended soon anyway, so my suggestion is to play whatever simulator you already have and wait for Project CARS 2, which hopefully will make us forget this game..

												Such a shame really. When I heard about this game, I though brill a game to beat Assetto Corsa. OH how wrong I am. The AI on this game is terrible, they will just ram you constantly and spin you off the track. The game will lag the moment you add AI, and I'm running a 4790K and SLI GTX980 yet I still can't get solid frames in a race.I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Infact, Ridge Racer back on PSone is better than this game.Okay, the graphics are beaitufl I won't lie. The cars are really detailed, as are the tracks. But... It's just shocking. They've had ample oppertunity to optimise the game... But no they're now focusing on releasing Project Cars 2, which I'm sure will be just as bad.			",101,5,10,6,22,1,0

												I don't understand why a lot people hate this game. Yes it has problems and I don't think its as good as Asseto Corsa or rfactor but its still a decient racing sim in my opinion so here are my pros and consPros:Handling is great once you get used to it. I use a G27 and it gets along well with PCarsGraphics are amazing.Music is enjoyable to listen too.The game can really challange you to keeping the car on the road, one slight mistake and your gone into the gravel or in the wall. Cons:Crash physics aren't that great, I took an formulaA car and crashed it at the end of the hanger straight in Silverstone at just under 200mph and only lost one wheel with the rest of the car remaining in tact.AI can be quite brutal and not afriad to put up a fight but they can be cheeky most of the time by cutting corners or even ignore your presence.My overall score for this game is: 8.5/10It has it's issues like I said but its still a lot of fun in my opinion.

												First off, this game is beautiful. Playing on a GTX 670, I can run everything on full (except AA) with about 50 fps.That should how well optimised this game is, as I can tell you that the graphics' are akin to SW Battlefront's.Then there is the gameplay. Depending on how you want it, Project CARS can be more like an arcade racing simulator oran actual drive around a race course. It's has it's 'WOW' moments, especially when you've finally completed a difficulttrack without any scuffs. The game works very well with the controller, for those of you who don't have a steering wheel.Two problems though: 1) ""Where do I start!"" Beginning can be quite difficult, and the tutorials are a bit slow and annoying.I recommend jumping into career mode and doing phase 6. 2) There are those qualifying rounds which are hella slow. I mean, I just want to jump into a fun race, not drive around endlessly trying to get a fast lap time!Overall 8/10. A very, very fun simulator once you get into it.			",27,2,1,2,1,0,0

												A great racing sim.The visuals are stunning.The handling of each car is superb with individual charactristics captured like the RUF Yellowbird, bags of fun to drive but captured it's woeful stopping power.  Fun = RUF Yellowbird at Bathurst and then a sprinkling of rain just to make things really fun at The Chase....Setting up the g27 was a bit of a mess around but there is some fantastic guides out there that will help you find out your wheels input lag and guide you through the setup menus in game.  I can't recommend following these high enough, yes it takes some time to complete  but the results are more than worth it.  It makes the game so much more enjoyable. I followed this guide http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?22122-G25-G27-Wheel-Setup-Guide-Patch-6-0  Pay particular attention to poirqc's Linearity Guide at the bottom.  It is well worth trawling through.My Only gripe is the lack of saving in Endurance races. I understand it's an endurance race and I have no problem doing one but I just don't simply have the time to do a massive race in one sitting..  As of now, it's 23:45 I want a race in my career but cant as the next race is a minimum of 2 hours or 25 hours for the full race.....If you have a wheel buy it,			",282,114,40,22,26,7,28

												Project Cars is a solid racing simulator, although it loses its ""new car smell"" relatively quickly. I had been waiting for this game for a long time, and now that I've played it, I can't say it was 100% worth the anticipation. What throws me off early on in the game is the ridiculous amount of time they force you to race go-karts for before you can start racing real vehicles. I spent a solid 5 hours working through two full seasons of go-kart races before I was able to move up to an actual car. Also, I prefer having to earn and save money to go and buy the car I want like in Gran Turismo or Forza, but with Project Cars there is no money system, and your rewards for winning races comes in the form of racing team contract offers which net you a new car to race with. Don't expect any visual customizing either, aside from preset paint schemes.Its a good game with a good selection of tracks and cars, but it lacks the refinement and small details that other racing games have gotten right in the past (the surprisingly low resolution images of each vehicle when you are picking out the car you want to race with in Free Mode and the non-controllable, PAINFULLY slow panning camera when you want to look at the actual vehicles come to mind).You will most likely enjoy the game if you are into racing games, but don't expect to get the same 200-300 hours out of it like you did with Gran Turismo back in the day.Update: Game crashes every 10 min or less. For some reason I was able to play the first 6 hours with only one or two crashes, but now I can't make it through a single race without it freezing up. I probably won't be buying Project Cars 2, and its offensive that you would start developing a new game before the first one is completely stable. One more customer lost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really disappointed in this purchase. Simply put the game is just incomplete, both in content and QA testing. To sum up my experience below, it's a 6/10 game. Outside of graphics, there isn't one thing it does great, or even better than other options out there. I would say casual race fans looking for a ""sim-light"" experience should pick it up on sale, but the game breaking bugs make me hesitant to do even that. Look for one of the many better, cheaper games available for sale. Visually it's quite nice, and although it doesn't quite compare to the previews, it still looks better than pretty much any racing game out there. However there are several graphical glitches that still need to be worked out. Most that I've experienced have been cosmetic, but one seems to cause the framerate to speed up after breaking . It messes with the physics and throws your car off the track. It's hard to describe: the framerate is still smooth, but it's like your car suddenly has a jet strapped to it for a few seconds. I have a pretty beefy rig and didn't have this problem when I first started playing, so I don't know what's causing it. It only happens in the rain so I'm unable to race in what is supposed to be one of this game's big selling points: its dynamic weather (which otherwise looks great and the ability to set multiple weather conditions during a single session is awesome). Additionally, there are a plethora of other bugs relating to the gameplay itself, but are far too numerous to list here. You can even find an acknowledgment of several specific bugs from the developers themselves, though even those are a fraction of the whole. The user interface is horrible, and I can't think of anything positive to say about it other than at least the text is crisp and clean. I thought Codemasters had horrible menus, but I had no idea. Everything is counter intuitive and buried in pages upon pages, to the point where changing your vehicle's livery is an adventure. If you're planning on using a controller with this game just forget about it. I have no idea how anybody could control it with a standard Xbox controller or Dualshock. Using my Logitech G27 wheel has been fine, but the force feedback leaves a lot to be desired. I swear I spent more time reading through pages and pages of forum posts and guides on how to fix the FFB model in this game, rather than playing the game itself. There are a lot of customization options, but most are beyond your average user. When I bought this game I didn't think I was enrolling in a course on the finer points of FFB tuning/modeling, but that's what I was forced to sit through. Even then it wasn't enough. Many have just downloaded mods to improve the FFB. Bottom line is that it doesn't work well out of the box after calibration. The driving model itself is ok (think an improved version of Need for Speed Shift), and depends on the car. This isn't close to the sim its been advertised as, but that doesn't mean it's poor or that you can't enjoy yourself. Most of my time was spent with open wheel racers, and I felt that the lower class formula cars were really fun and felt good. I tried to work my way through career mode but unfortunately the karting is atrocious. If you set the camera to follow behind, you can actually see them unnaturally gliding over the surface of the track, like some kind of buggy hovercraft. The reason I finally shelved this game was because of the hyper aggressive AI. Now I don't think ANY single player racing game has nailed the AI, but at least they didn't ruin the races. Anything under 80% was too slow, and anything above was like racing your friend in Gran Turismo back in the day. They just slam into  you constantly through corners, totally ruining any chance of a race. After I got into the grove with the Formula Rookie cars, I started a new career from that level and was finally having fun. However I soon got to Sonoma and the AI made turn 1 impossible. Every single time I took the turn an AI car slammed into me, throwing me off the track. I restarted the race no less than 18 times. It happened again, and again, and again. The last time I just sat on the track spun out sideways, blocking another AI driver to see what would happen. After about 30 seconds of just sitting there, he decided to ram into me and physically push me out of the way. DIdn't even try to go around. That was it for me with Project Cars until the developer does some serious work. There are other issues with the accuracy of feedback from the community (I bought this game in part because of content supposedly on its way, but turns out it was just backers with a financial interest meaning that ""they have faith the developer will add the features), the developers willingness to listen to feedback, their intent to fix issues, and the typical DLC/funding nonsense (we were supposed to get a free car each month... so far only paid DLC packs and an announcement of the sequel's funding campaign(, but this review has gone on long enough and you can find all of that with a simnple Google search.

												Game is pretty...but I hope they release more road cars in the future...while GT and Le Mans is nice, I find myself hopping in the evo and hitting the track most of the times.  Really wish there was a nice STI in this game.  Well, back to Forza I go.  However, this is a pretty game, the physics are nice, and the cars feel like they are gripping and aren't floating around the track.  They did a great job with that.  I love the sound of the cars too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When maxed out the game is beautiful.  But at that point you just stare at it, don't race, don't even move your car.  I paid fill price and quite honestly have no idea why.  I have 980's and i can't max this game out, and even when i do moving in a race whether maxed out or playing optimal nvidia settings i still either way lag out, get choppy and its just a painful experience.  About to drop the setting even further but at this point i scratch my head if the console version is this buggy. Just like all of BANDAI Namco games you get all the BS of buggyness. I thought this would be the end all of racing games for me but i just might pickup a xbox one and buy forza because at least that game is beautiful and plays beautiful. And at this point its a game i feel i need 4 980 TI's and still couldn't run it smooth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still the most complete racing simulation currently available. Now with Vive support, so currently the best racing experience with native support. VR and Pcars go really well together, I wasn't too sure what differences to expect going from a single screen to VR, but they are huge, which I will try to explain later, but first navigation and play.The menus and options are all available and selectable while wearing the headset, it uses a look cursor which pulses when you rest your gaze on any menu or option, and on the third pulse the looked at menu or game option is actioned, this works smoothly although not as quicky as selecting using d-pad and your select button on a controller or wheel if you have one. Pcars centres the display during start up and sometimes I have not sat still through this procedure so I have mapped a button for centering the headset in the controls options, this is not required but can be useful if you change your seating position after starting the game, tho in the VR section it does allow you to set auto recentre when starting a race.Having selected all the driving options you want and going to the pit or race start the screen places you as usual sitting in the cockpit of your ride, this is where Pcars VR becomes a different experience, rather than looking at a flat representation of the cockpit and the world in front of you, you are sitting IN your car, just feels right and anything else, even triple screens cannot compete in terms of the feeling of being there. Now all the work that has gone into creating these virtual replicas can be seen and admired very close up, the instrumentation, roll cage, pipes, the windscreen is actually away in front of you and if you are running with rain on then you get to see that the rain is not on your pc screen but just on the cars windscreen or if you are in an open seater then it's on your visor as well as on whatever screen your vehicle has, it just all makes sense, there seems to be so much to take in and this is before the car is in motion.Once the driving starts from the confines of your cars interior which ranges from the suprisingly claustraphobic of lmp's to the open aired freedoms of open wheelers, you just drive as you would hardly noticing that you can check mirrors look into a curves apex, no matter where you look you see what you would expect to see from your driving seat, the door leading to the landing has gone, replaced by the left hand side of my cars interior with the wing mirror in which I can now clearly see aproaching competitors. The 3D world around allows for far better judgement of distances for manouvering in the pack,close racing just gets closer and I can now look at them as they draw alongside and stare them down visor to visor as I pass, may be offer a gesture ( or two ), even with AI it becomes more personal.So the 3d immersive experience that the combination of Vive and Pcars offers is one of the best available for native Vive users at the moment, but there are imperfections as you would expect ( cos life is like that ), first the old screen door, it is there and on objects drawn farther from you the reslotuion seems low because of it, the effect though is soon filtered out by some eye to brain magic during racing, also if you want to race with large grids of over 24 cars in thunderstorms you will need a 980 or better, my 980ti managed up to about 30 on the grid in a storm at night, but above this the start was a little choppy.I now find it hard to return to Assetto Corsa with it's better feedback or Dirt Rally for the offroad blast ( in fact I haven't since getting the Vive ),  as I feel odd sitting in my room and racing rather than sitting in a VR car and racing.

												The game is still in beta as far as I'm concerned. Don't bother complaining on the official forum either; criticism of any kind will not be tolerated (as per the official instructions of Ian Bell, head of SMS) and if you do you will get banned from the site (just as I've been). Here's a very small preview of he known bugs (patch 1.4)- when I leave the pits and I tell my crew to not refuel or change my tyres they still fill my tank up and give me tyres that overheat from the first corner (yes there is a bug within a bug, we're through the looking glass people). - In replays debris from previous sessions are shown and opponents' cars change into different models.- In sector 3 of road America the split times of the cars is broken and will show you timings that are minutes out.- There is also an invisible wall that will very rarely and randomly appear on the start finish straight of road America. Hitting this wall at racing speeds is all but guaranteed to end your race. (Has not happened to me directly but I have been in a session where my friend's car suddenly stopped and said he had hit an invisible wall)- A.I cars do now actually pit in wet conditions, but they often do it too early while it is just beginning to drizzle and when it does turn into a full on storm they won't pit again to change from intermediates to rain tyres. - A.I drivers occasionally fail to do mandatory pit stops in races or leave it until the last lap (doing so reduces the time lost in the pits)- FFB will occasionally run into issues ranging from minor (lack of feedback in the wheel) to game braking (wheel will forcefully turn itself to full lock, even when cars are in perfect condition) requiring me to turn off and on my wheel, or in rarer occasions I will have to restart the PC (does not happen with Assetto Corsa)- When joining a MP session that has already started and is in practice/qualifying mode you can occasionally be stuck in your pits unable to go to track. You can also join a lobby and be stuck there unable to join the session.I'm sure there are more that I have forgotten about (that have happened to me or that I've witnessed in game) but I've made my point. Not all of these are game breaking but all of them are capable of ruining a race/session. I also haven't even begun to talk about the non-bug related issues.When it works though (which  is 30% of the time) it's probably the best racing game money can buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great love it. Very complex at first so its defaintly not for casuals but if you insist on driving please go into the settings and play around with them a bit. That being said mine is with a logitech wheel 920steering dead zone = 0 Steering sensitivity = 100Throttle deadzone = 0 Throttle sesitivity = 60break deadzone = 0Break sensitivity = 60 clutch doesnt matter speed sensitivity = 65 controller filtering sensitivity = 65 force feed back 60 and then i changed the wheel spin in the logitech program to 80% sensivity All pretty basic settings will help you control a car alot better if you are using a wheel. Dont forget to tune your car to the track. Very big rookie mistake that people forget. to all the whinngers that say its a crap game dont know how to race and change settings.

												One of the very best racing games of all time, the diversity in cars and tracks is sublime, the AI is great and the customisation available makes this game top of it's class.Even better is there is a full career mode but you don't need to grind it for hundreds of hours to unlock the cars you want to drive! This is a must buy, not just for racing sim fans but all gamers! 10/10			",116,7,7,0,4,2,3

												Great game, default controls for xbox one contoller could be improved, but once tweaked the cars are responsive and feel great. Physics are great, it's a shame the AI doesn't suffer from less grip on cold tires, which can make the start of races difficult on higher AI settings, the game compensates for this somewhat by having the AI start off slower but having them affected by tire temperatures would be an improvement. Overall this is a great game, a huge step up from games like Forza and Gran Turismo, a true sim style racer, it gives a great impression of speed and the cars are difficult to master. I'd recommend this game to any racing sim fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most overrated racing game on Steam.I've only played this game for a short while, but I've already found so many cons:- Propably the worst AI I've ever seen in a racing game. It collides, goes off the track, etc. And what makes this even more ridiculous is that in this game the player gets penalized for going off the track, the AI does it all the time but gets nothing.- The handling is super unrealistic, cars start sliding for absolutely no reason. It's not about skill, it's not about g-forces or grip, they just slide because they're made to slide. Yet if you're driving straight you can accelerate to ridiculous speeds then brake without any worries about sliding or losing control. - Good graphics? Sorry, but I can't see it. Sky and spectators are both 2D, lighting is also very dull and many effects such as tire smoke look just awful.- It's almost impossible to wreck your car even if you choose full damage from the options. If you smash it against a wall driving hundreds of mails/kilometeres per hour the changes are you'll lose a tire, but you won't wreck your car.TL:DR This game is clearly arcade, not a simulation, and it's only decent. If you're looking for realism look somewhere else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can only recommend this game to people who have the latest Nvidia or AMD cards, especially when it concerns AMD. The game was co-developed together with Nvidia and thus runs better on Nvidia cards, and not as well on AMD. This is not Nvidia's fault of-course, but SlightlyMad's ... who should have ensured the game runs well on AMD before launching it.I really like the content of the game, it has a large number of tracks and a good selection of cars. I also enjoy the driving physics, it is very different from the other sim racers in my collection (RaceRoom, Stock Car Extreme, Assetto Corsa etc). Being different is a good thing, because it means you get to learn and experience something new. I don't want my sim games to share the same kind of physics, that would be very boring. I enjoy racing games and want to experience as many of them as I possibly can.There are traces of Shift 2 in the physics, in the way the cars are eager to loose traction or grip around corners. However there's definitely more depth in the physics than what you got in the Shift games, as evidenced by the complex tuning or setting options. Ignoring snide comments, the game can be played by anyone since there's a wide range of assists you can use. It plays really well with a controller, though you may need to adjust the car settings for smoother steering. The Career mode follows the usual PC sim racing system, where you are free to do whatever you want basically; there's no linear path as in console sims like Forza and Gran Turismo. A detail I appreciated was the track narration and engineering comments, which reminded me of Grid Autosport and the F1 games. It's something which makes your progression in the game feel more personal. I wish my other sim racing games had this feature.Another nice detail is that the game actually offers a helmet view, something I've only seen in the later MotoGP games. I don't use it that often myself, but it's a very cool addition.The AI is respectfully aggressive, it is neither too passive and neither too aggressive. The perception of a racing game's AI often reflects the player's own temperament: if you are not a mature and level-headed sim racer the AI in Project Cars might seem overly aggressive, but being rather experienced with sim games I do not share these sentiments.As far as multiplayer goes, the game seeems to have lost some ground to Assetto Corsa and Dirt Rally, so it's probably not as easy to find online races as it used to be. People who mainly play multiplayer modes tend to migrate to other games rather quickly, usually the very latest big budget game. So if you mainly want multiplayer gaming you might be better off waiting for F1 2016.Visually the game looks great, but that is also a negative aspect of the game: there's too much fluff and flair. I know the prupose of this is to attract a wider range of consumers, not just sim racing fans but also mainstream gamers, but it also alienates many sim racing fans who don't have powerful PCs. Most other PC sim racing games do not have the same high requirements.In contrast, the games by Reiza Studios, ISI and Sector3 (ex Simbin) can be played by people with OK or Medium PCs. Project Cars is not as generous. Focusing on graphics and fluff over user accessibility is bad for the sim racing genre. In summary: if you have one of the later graphics cards, post AMD 7700, this is a great game; it has lots of single-player content, challenging physics and a career mode that feels more personal than in other sims.

												I began sim racing in 1996 at 31 and you would think that after all of these years that game makers would start taking notice of what the long term gamers are doing and what hardware and equipement they are running, but still to this day only 3 of the game makers (Racing Games) cut the mustard. The rest will need to make huge inprovements in order to escape the realm of kiddies game makers. I run both rFactor 1 and 2 and also Assetto Corsa, I don't like iRacing but that is more of a personal issue rather than about the game itself. These games are the only racing games to date that cater for hardline sim racers, they cater in everyway for every sim setup whether VR, Multi Screen, single screen, cockpit etc. All the rest are merely glorified console versions which cater for single screen and occasionally VR. They will never be regarded as true simulations because they do not cater for the 10% of us that build or buy multi screen cockpits for ourselves. Today I purchased and installed Project cars and all associated packs. I immediately liked the clarity of the image, very good indeed. But was put off straight away by a very poor and primitave User Interface.  I am in a homemade cockpit with 3 x 27"" monitors running 5760x1080 resolution, these monitors are in a fixed position with a roof over them for a better sense of imertion. The left bezel of the left monitor and right bezel of the right monitor reach back at 45 degrees from the centre monitor to just behind my ears giving me a realistic drivers seat view. Project cars supports as many monitors as you like but they must be run side by side in a straight widescreen line with no more than a couple of degrees of angle, so basically it is stretching 2400 x 1080 res over my 3 monitors with some horrible stretching and incorrect angles going on to the left and right monitors. This basically makes the game unplayable to anyone used to multiview. So before buying this game take in to account that it is not directed at the hardline gaming community it is a childrens game for laptops or single screens, in short it is nothing but a 1990's arcade game with pretty pictures. The cars have a very arcade feel to them even with all driving aids turned off. So, don't waste your money if it's games like rFactor, Assetto Corsa or iRacing that get your rocks off because this is nothing more than Grid with a different user interface although just as bad of an interface. Now I must attempt yet another refund from Steam for yet another childrens game. If it supported multiview I could get used to it for nights when I am tired and want an easy drive, but in its current state it is useless			",0,0,3,0,0,0,0

A lot of the driving issues, what with the AI or various things (stuff like Pit issues and the like) have thankfully been patched out of the game, there are still some issues with menus and especially now with DLC differences that sometimes make the game hiccup in odd ways.However, when everything works out, when its just you and some friends racing down California Highway in a nice fancy GT car, the sounds of it, the look, the tension is all there and it works wonderfully.Do note, that probably my biggest gripe is the lack of easy to understand Force Feedback presets or instructions. A LOT of the negative reviews if you read them mention how its either better on joystick or better on wheel and how they don't understand why this or that doesn't seem to feel correct or just tosses them into a wall. And I had that feeling too at first due to the fact that the default presets for Force Feedback, least with my Driving Force Pro wheel, are complete♥♥♥♥♥ If you need advice on how to fix it to work a lot better, here is my suggestion: http://forum.projectcarsgame.com/showthread.php?25046-bManic-s-latest-FFB-experiments-possibly-working-universally-for-all-wheelsFollow BManic's advice and set things to how he sets it. Works beautifully with minor adjustments with a driving force pro wheel. And while I understand that supporting ALL wheels correctly would be almost impossibly difficult especially on a PC (where you are working with theoretically all wheels ever made) some better defaults, or hell just some better info or a 'basic' mode for the force feedback changes would be SO helpful for a lot of people.

												Being part of this project from the very early stages of beta testing has been a great eye opener into the work that goes into making a game to this standard. Its evident the creaters have a passion for motorsport and have really tried to push the racing sim experience. I highly recomend ProjectCARS to all that enjoy the smell of an oily rag.

												it honestly does feel broke to me in some areas but awesome game none the less...did a 30 lap race yesterday on mohave with I think 16 cars on difficulty set to 90 and I came 1st ..and that's because mid race all the cars decided to pull over onto the side of the road, ha ha..kind of funny to watch but I was hoping for a bit more of a challenge than that tbh. .loving the game none the less but there are some issues that need sorting still....can't wait for the pits to be in and see how that amps things up a bit			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the very best racing games of all time, the diversity in cars and tracks is sublime, the AI is great and the customisation available makes this game top of it's class.Even better is there is a full career mode but you don't need to grind it for hundreds of hours to unlock the cars you want to drive! This is a must buy, not just for racing sim fans but all gamers! 10/10			",116,7,7,0,4,2,3

												This is by far the best racing sim to date.   The cars actually handle very well with no adjustment.  The only hard part so far for me was setting my F430 wheel,   After that resolve,  what can I say the graphics are awesome the AI are forgiving,  you can  adjust the cars to handle even better if required.   I see people in the forum complaining about this or that and my recommendation is to stick with it and you will figure it out.  If you are  experiencing a bug they will fix it. I cant put my finger on it but their is something about this game that feels so real..  ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is clearly unfinished ! Dont get me wrong its a very pretty game but there is a lot of little things that will bug the hell out of you, such as the unhandled exception crash which effects the majority of people ! The handling feels as if you are driving on ice, online is poorly thought out and the a.i in single player are all over the place. I feel this game was rushed for release. NOW for my major concern - i posted in the forums stating that i felt the game was clearly unfinised and isnt quite ready for release, it was deleted in a few hours !!! thats CENSORSHIP.........

												Oh my god, this game is amazing. Most details are superb and of high resolution quality, the games phsyics mechanics feel pretty solid. You defo need a racing wheel to play this, keyboards & xbox controllers do not do the game justice. There are hundreds of settings for cars and even more for Grahpics/Audio/Controllers.Good resolution support, I have tested with 1920*1080, 2560*1080 and, 2x DSR'ed 2560*1080, 2x DSR'ed 1080p.Slight lack of cars & tracks at the moment in comparison to something like Gran Turismo 6 or Forza 4, but more are coming :DIt even manages to make a GTX980 drop frames with settings maxed to Ultra :O Well, after some more game time, the game is getting better and better. DLC seems great, new tracks and cars coming soon too, can't wait.  Just gotta find more time to play :/10/10 imo (I'll probably do another review / edit this one as I play more)			",14,0,7,0,4,0,3

												The gameplay for project cars is fantastic, the cars feel great, good sounds, decent graphics. While all of this is good, when I went to play online there were only 2 games found and only one of which actually had more than 1 player in it. If you hope to play online, forget it, there's hardly anyone playing and its only a week old. As for single player, it just seems like they threw it together last second. You can start from pretty much anywhere you want, with unexciting results for finishing races. There are no rewards, nothing.

												I do but at the same time I don't reccomend this game.- Weather changes are weird.- Weirdly no pit crew.- Game has many options I was suprised to see no flashbacks, but I kinda understand why.- Career feels somewhat unrewarding compared to other racing games [only 6 hours played]  I really hope career mode gets better as you play more, but I have douts.- I don't like how your [somewhat] forced to drive go karts.- Not worth much more than the $15 I paid for it.I understand this is a race sim. I somewhat enjoy the challenge of no flashbacks. But why no option to turn it on or off just like restarting I don't know.			",163,47,16,17,15,2,19

												Let me start by saying that I very nearly did not buy this title due to the negative feedback left here on Steam. Even when it was just £12 in the Humble Bundle I read a few recent reviews and thought maybe not, but then what the hell, why not, how bad can it possibly be?After loading up, electing to drive an Aston on Snetterton as a free run, all default settings except for loading the suggested Steam controller configuration I set off for my first lap, full of trepidation for just what a car crash this software was going to be, no pun intended. Well that was a surprise, I’m pleased to report that I’ve no idea what planet the other reviewers were on, but after 45 minutes of roaring around the track having great fun I’m pleased as punch that I bought this title.Previous reviewers have said it’s unplayable with the Steam Controller, that seems to have escaped me. Others have said they spent hours configuring it just to make it playable, guess I did spend 30 seconds loading the Steam Controller configuration. The graphics are apparently not up to other titles, not sure what these titles are, I thought they were awesome. I’m told that the fps is appalling, well I have mine capped at 60fps, and the game ran at exactly that at all times, and this is on a GTX960 with an i5 3570; maybe I need to go into the graphic settings and tweak them to get lower fps?!Maybe after just 45 minutes I’m not yet fully qualified to give a review, but I’m only doing so as I was nearly put off buying this title at £12 due to the reviews of others, and I think it is without doubt one hundred percent worth the money.

												This game has its pros and cons, but is overall a really good simluator/game.The Graphics are stunning; the Cars are incredibly detailed, weather effects are gorgeus and the racetracks look amazingly realistic. There are a ton of options to personalize the experience to your preferences, covering beginners to professional player settings. The HUD and Menus are really well done, the colour sceme is a nice touch. The Career is interesting and engaging, the missing cutscenes (like cheering your victory on a podium etc.) are replaced with a ""twitter"" system, where computergenerated users will tweet hashtags and messages about you current standing and driving style.On the other side however, the driving style and behaviour of the cars are something you´ll have to get used to. You should really start the game with low-tier cars like karts to get a feeling for the handling before grabbing the wheel of a real car. I would definetly recommend a Controller or a driving wheel to play this game, since its hard to control the car correctly on a keyboard.Overall, i can definetly recommend this game for someone whos looking for a realistic, up-to-date racing simulator. You need, however, the patience to master each car seperatly since they have their very own unique driving style.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game from its early alpha versions in 2012 right through to the current release. It tries to be everything to everyone and rather than focussing on doing a few things well , it does all things average. Patched with layers upon layers of bandaids , the wounds continue to bleed and infection has set in. This game is terminally ill and will never recover. The developers deny this , and don't take kindly to their customers pointing out that their baby is on its death bed.If you want a good driving sim , avoid Project Cars at all cost.

I have to turn everything down to low because of my GTX970, but it still runs fairly well and I'm willing to accept less eye candy for the experience.  I'm sure it will improve when I do my new build next year.Great feel of sitting in the car and being able to look around at the competition and into turns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short: Online maybe. Offline No. If you want to play offline in carrer look for something else. After 19h of gameplay it deletes my savegame(No Error/Crashes)....nice....btw. there is a know bug where you lost your savegame. maybe kinda related and still not fixed.2nd time savegame got randomly deleted.F1 2013 has a better rain (only the graphic is better) and better AICons:Ai(intelligence(boring), effected by rain(not), cold tires(not), scripted)Difficult 60 and 69 make no difference, instead of 100 ""different"" they could have 1-10 would be the same.Difficult works like in nearly every sports game, they getting faster in better carstats not better driving they drive the line in every difficult just a little bit faster. like on 80 they have slightly more acceleration(clio) but not more speed. And they drive the same pase every round like real pros which is kinda boring because in the clio cup it works like one big line.Same in Quali and training one line and every 500m a car, very rare 2 cars together.Scripted mistakes: If they doing a mistake, it is all on the same point with the same line they drive back in. E.g.In Brands hatch the last curve, no matter what car, if they do a mistake there it is all scripted. They brake to late, got off track and get back in in the same line every car.The radius that they can see you is like 10m. You notice that when they overtack you. Looks good. They come closer and gor left/right at your back and overtack you. So far so good. the Problem is that the do this even you stand still. They come closer 10m in front the try to get left/right buuut its to late and crash into you. every. single. ai. car. What kind of a hand brake did they use, that it works when you stand still but not while driving? Srsly what kind of bs is that? On front wheeler  it didnt work at all, and rear wheeler it just ""removed"" the acc, like you dont trigger your acceleration button. Nothing more.Rain its starts 10sec later of light rain, the track is wet like heavy rain of 10min, but same other around it stop rain, it needs like 20 sec with no other car to get dryQuali(clio cup) start(im in the box) warning for cutting the track. start, tires are cold so need 5 laps to get warm and not sliding. to bad that the rain starts in lap 2 at the end it stops so i could go out again. tires changed...damn sliding up to r3Cutting the track cost you 2 rounds that doesnt count, what the f* is that bs? the one that you cut and the following.Quali is like 10 min and its over. Training is like 10 min and drive the round to the end...-> after more races it looks more random if you can drive till endExample Rain Main-Race: Track is wet in Round 4 half a round later it starts raining. Ok he told me not to do my pitstop so i go on this round. It goes ok. But now i really have to go to the box and change my tires to Rain. But again no stop. So basically at that time i drive on ice, where my car spins with 60km/h 40(?) miles/h without acceleration. Ok Why i dont just go manually into the box? well it make no difference if i lose 30 sec on track because of the rain or i have to do 2 box stops. Yes i have to do 2 because the first wouldnt count as a mandatory box stop, because my engineer didnt told me to come into the box. Rip Rain races against aiMenu is horrible at least for controllerCan you change tyres while on track in the box? i just can change it while in the garage.. not really cool but ok for quali. should test it in race.Overtaking is pretty slowly(clio), because there is no slipstream. you really have to work your 0,5 sec that you are faster. Its actually a pro but that no slipstream is a con. That makes the race a little bit boring.As long as i dont do some major mistakes i will be no lower than i started, i start at 4, i will be >4 if i start 2 i will be >2 you can so easily block the Ai away when you did a mistake and they just cant overtake you (Dif: 80/same cars) even if they have a lower lap time and should be fasterNo Statistics/monitoring about your roundtimeAny round/sector times overview? Could find it yet if there is one.No option while racing, no sound nothing.Race/carrerWhat kinde of bs is that second race? you do 2 races and one with a forced pitstop? does this really happen in reallife? dont know much about touring racesI hated the karts so i skipped that. They are also buggy, im in lap 3 and still L1/3. after one season with the clio cup i have to drive the karts. So it goes from tier 6 back to tier 8? Normally it have to go to tier 5. Finished clio as 2nd. The guy(my teammate) who wons the cup had 0 wins. It is so nice that you can save your setups, but why you cant load any setup?So it is 1 setup each track which is loaded and which you can save, but no other. So if you want to load a setup from another track. It is just not possibleAfter a race is finished you get a fet options like save replay, restart, exit... Which is selected is random... seriously who build this ui?  In the most situation there is a reason the car slides away(and there is nothing you can do to prevend it(controller), but if you dont know why your car slide away, i can tell you what it is. Its called momentum. So to say, there is no real reason. it just happens, because the game want to, to make it less pepetitive. That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that i hate fifa for a few years ago.Pros:GraphicLove the cockpit camthat you have to get close by 0,5 or so by round, feels like a real racei add more if i notice something			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

TL/DR REVIEW: Pretty goodProject CARS is a sim(cade) game with some of the best graphics in the industry and with physics are good enough to suspend my disbelief. It's super easy to set up a (private) mutliplayer session to drive around with some friends. The public lobby racing quality is, as expected, atrocious.Physics under and on the limit feel believable, however once you break loose car control feels very weird and badly simulated. For me driving itself is not as exciting and raw as in say Assetto Corsa, but for its low cost, possibility to race in a variety of weather conditions with a good amount of content in the base game, it is worthwhile. Note 1: I don't have any experience with the AI, so I can't comment on that. Note 2: I played with a wheel, and for the complete experience I recommend you to do the same.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

												This is by far the best racing sim to date.   The cars actually handle very well with no adjustment.  The only hard part so far for me was setting my F430 wheel,   After that resolve,  what can I say the graphics are awesome the AI are forgiving,  you can  adjust the cars to handle even better if required.   I see people in the forum complaining about this or that and my recommendation is to stick with it and you will figure it out.  If you are  experiencing a bug they will fix it. I cant put my finger on it but their is something about this game that feels so real..  ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is clearly unfinished ! Dont get me wrong its a very pretty game but there is a lot of little things that will bug the hell out of you, such as the unhandled exception crash which effects the majority of people ! The handling feels as if you are driving on ice, online is poorly thought out and the a.i in single player are all over the place. I feel this game was rushed for release. NOW for my major concern - i posted in the forums stating that i felt the game was clearly unfinised and isnt quite ready for release, it was deleted in a few hours !!! thats CENSORSHIP.........

												Oh my god, this game is amazing. Most details are superb and of high resolution quality, the games phsyics mechanics feel pretty solid. You defo need a racing wheel to play this, keyboards & xbox controllers do not do the game justice. There are hundreds of settings for cars and even more for Grahpics/Audio/Controllers.Good resolution support, I have tested with 1920*1080, 2560*1080 and, 2x DSR'ed 2560*1080, 2x DSR'ed 1080p.Slight lack of cars & tracks at the moment in comparison to something like Gran Turismo 6 or Forza 4, but more are coming :DIt even manages to make a GTX980 drop frames with settings maxed to Ultra :O Well, after some more game time, the game is getting better and better. DLC seems great, new tracks and cars coming soon too, can't wait.  Just gotta find more time to play :/10/10 imo (I'll probably do another review / edit this one as I play more)			",14,0,7,0,4,0,3

												The gameplay for project cars is fantastic, the cars feel great, good sounds, decent graphics. While all of this is good, when I went to play online there were only 2 games found and only one of which actually had more than 1 player in it. If you hope to play online, forget it, there's hardly anyone playing and its only a week old. As for single player, it just seems like they threw it together last second. You can start from pretty much anywhere you want, with unexciting results for finishing races. There are no rewards, nothing.

												Project Cars is a great game.  I haven't had a chance to fully explore making adjustments to driving dynamics yet, but it is amont the best out there.  While some talk about bugs, it really is quite polished for a PC game at this point.  I feel like the servers do not have enough games right now and that is a disappointing aspect as being able to compete against real drivers is what makes gaming fun.  I also wish there were a few more cars.  Don't need 400 cars, but still halo vehicles of each brand should be included.  VW GTI, Toyota GT-86, Audi RS4 etc.Overall game is good but I hope bigger updates and better DLCs come out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After about 50hrs I decided to do my first ever review. Whilst I own all the latest sims I won't be making any comparisons between them nor nominate my favourite. I have never driven any race car IRL nor any of the road cars currently in the game so I have no idea whether the physics are close to realistic or not.Pcars is far from complete with a number of features either incomplete or missing at this stage. There are a number of annoying little bugs that no doubt are being worked on (some are fixed but missed the latest update). These have led me to choose ""private practice"" and TT's for now.I agree with many that the FFB is not quite up to it even after all the tweaking. For me, everywhere on track is fine except the kerbs/rumbles. I have no confidence using them on almost any track. Very unpredictable. FFB settings are way too convoluted, I've never seen so many sliders and not a lot of explanation about what they do. There are however, for those that don't mind reading lots of forum posts, a number of tuts available to assist you.No ability to save multiple setups and no control of your own car in pitlane will be game breakers for me as far as actual racing goes if not addressed.The AI is ordinary at best, though not a big deal for me as I don't normally race them.I like the car/track choices even without the DLC's and no doubt these will get even better over time.Visually stunning even on a 750ti and I get rock solid performance with no stuttering with any car/track combo I have tried so far.Whilst it has a way to go I think this title has huge potential that I hope will be realised as time progresses. There is something in this game that, bugs and missing features aside, bring an immersion I haven't had for a while in race sims.Is it worth the money? Yes, but you will need some patience. For mine it's not the ""polished turd"" some have described but very much a ""rough diamond"" at this time. Up to the developer's to cut and polish now. Please don't let us down.In conclusion I should add my specs:PC userASRock Z97 pro4 Moboi5 479016Gb DDR3GTX 750tiLogitech G27 Wheel and pedals with GT-EYE brake mod. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to like this game, but it falls short to other racing sims and simcades. The roster is strong, the driving is great, and the tracks are represented well from their real life counterparts. Physics are top notch giving each vehicle its own unique quirks and driving styles, but the short list of available vehicles and limited customization leave a lot to be desired. While earlier games (shift 2 and shift) from the devs had bugs of their own, they were easily fixable through editing files. Although the game also suffered from a small roster, cars could be upgraded, tweaked, modded, and personalized by the player. Not possessing the same complex physics however like Project CARS shift 2 and 1 were both delivered an enjoyable racing experience that was more varied than the rigid and strict environment Project CARS offers. There's also the penalty system that was created by Stalin himself. Touch the grass? INVALIDATED. Go wide and slow down? INVALIDATED. Hit a wall or car? INVALIDATED. Personally it’s comical to read in patch notes how penalty implementation is constantly being tweaked and updated to be ""fair"" under the guidance of the community. There's nothing fair about it when 6 inches off the track on the backend of Nurburgring instantly invalidates your current time as well as the time for the next lap because going wide in a turn was such an advantage. The community must be full of simracing Hitlers never even spending a second on an actual track that want to make sim driving harder than real life for 'muh realism.' With Forza 6, Horizon 1 and 2, Grid, and Shift offering a better simcade experience with customization, and Iracing, Simbin, RaceRoom, and RFactor offering a better simulator, it's hard to explain what Project Cars is striving to be. Unlike niche games like DiRT Rally that offer an entirely different motorsport discipline, Project Cars is competing with other platforms that simply do it better with more to offer. Even Assetto Corsa, which is in a similar state as Project CARS, at least gives the ability for consumers to add their own cars, tracks, and other mods to the game. Project CARS needs a defining quality that sets it apart from the rest of the available sims and simcades while delivering a less restrictive playstyle. Pretty graphics and physics can only go so far if the content and game mechanics are lackluster.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realistic as they come. The game has great viewpoints in and out of the car, it has a great career system, a great practice system. I will say that it seems damn near impossible to beat the computer lol, but it is a challenging, interesting, and beautiful looking title.I remember playing Gran Turismo, and I really enjoyed building my own car; I have only played a little bit of this game so far, and I don't see the option to play that style of game. You can adjust your car's ratios etc... but there is no ""money"" system where you can buy and setup cars. This was the only disappointment for me.			",42,9,1,16,3,0,14

												This is a hard one.  Project Cars is possibly the greatest Racing Sim I've ever played.  Graphically amazing.  Completely unforgiving physics that makes you feel like a pro when you get it right.  But...The online play is HORRIBLE!!!  I'm putting it down to poor servers, as the lag is ridiculous!  Also, there needs to be some kind of player racking system to create game filters, as some drivers just ram others off the road and receive no punishment for it, when others take racing seriously.  Which is what this game is, a serious sim for serious racers.SMS, sort this game out and I'll recommend it happily!			",145,22,13,10,14,2,22

Pros:-Realistic Physics and Gameplay-Wealth of tuning options to improve the car-Fantastic graphics-Dynamic environments keep racing interesting-Online play is competitive-Easy to have casual races or competitive races-Easy Wheel compatibilityCons:-Many issues with crashing when leaving a race-Online play is miserable unless you have good and fair racers (would recommend joining some racing group or clan that weeds out wreckers and poor racers)-Track selection feels limitedSide note:Someone please please please add oval cars and some oval/""roval"" tracks to the game. Good to start with tracks that also feature a road course so that it would be an easier transition to having some ovals. Would recommend Daytona, Indianapolis, Charlotte, Iowa, Bristol would all be great options to start with. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You can tell this game is big in the UK - the amount of moaning in the comments ;) For me, this is the best racing game I have played to date in 30 years of playing race games. Sonny Jim. I'm running this on a 970 gtx with Ultra settings/1080p and it is the most realistic looking race game I have played by miles.  the way the lights falls, and hits/plays on surfaces, Water on tracks and the changeable weather really adds to the tension of not only qualifying, but the race. But it's not just looks, the cars feel fantastic and there is a decent learning curve and the opposition is tough. AND there's some mad dogs out there amongst the AI occaison - which is what you get in real life racing, but overall I think the AI is hard and fair, once you bump it up 70 or better. If any of you need a little enouragment to clean the cobwebs out of your wallet and invest in a new card - here is that encouragment, cause it is really worth it. The tracks are all Beautiful and it has a best-ever Nordschleife which is reason enough to own this game. Start a race there at a challenging skill level from the back of a 32 car pack, and try to win. Come on, Rift. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Better graphics, sound, and more believable immersion.  It's still a fantastic game and is best enjoyed with a wheel/pedal/shifter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gets a solid 5/7 =)I have had a lot of racing games, and this one is my favorite racing sim of all time. Assetto Corsa got nothing on this, and I really do mean it. Racing around the Nordschliefe is both relaxing and entertaining. Multiplayer is not cancerous, people actually race and don't crash into you unlike other racing games.What I would wish, is that it had more street cars. It is very race focused of course since it is a race sim, but I would love some more street cars such as the Cayman GT4 or the Corvette C6 Z06 - track hybrids, and definitely would like some concept cars like Gran Turismo has (FT1 and when the Porsche 918 was a concept)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project CARS is definitely a benchmark game, Without doubt it is one of the best looking games around. Gameplay is both addictive and satisfyingly Fast paced, with more than enough cars and tracks to choose from, pCars offers many hours of great fun. All cars are available from the very start of the game, so you can hop into your favourite classic Lotus and hammer on the gas at nordschleife or battle it out in career mode. Project Cars will take its rightful place in the Hall of Fame of Racing games and has much to offer the casual or hardcore simmer, this game is a must buy for any Racing Car fan. Simply Brilliant  10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A perfect case of a waste of money.Played this game at a friend's house, we were both huge forza fans before we switched to PC, game was fun so I picked it up on sale. Since my first race it has had a bug that will make it lag a few seconds, then go in fast forward to catch back up. Makes it completely unplayable. I really wanted it to work so I began searching for a fix. Tried everything I could find, even going into my bios and changing CPU settings that may have been causing it. Which they shouldn't anyway, since all of my 100+ other games worked completely fine with the cpu just the way it was. While in my trying to fix it (starting the game up, trying to do a race, still didn't fix it, try something else, still didn't fix it, etc.) I went over my two hours and am now stuck with it. Judging by how the forum posts of people having the same problem were from 7+ months ago, I'm sure it will never be fixed.I really wanted to like the game, and when it works is so fun, almost better than my beloved forza days. However when the game goes into warp speed and sends me through a turn into a wall it outweighs the good. Another shining example of why early access is garbage. Why would they fix the game or make it work for everyone? They've already made their fortune.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game at a very good discounted price, now at 20 Euros/$. You might need some time to get used to and fiddle with controller or wheel settings, once that is done, it's a very enjoyable Racing Sim. Harder to get used to than most other racing games,  although this one has the best graphics out there by a mile. Most complain about early bugs and there were loads when it was released but most have been ironed out.The good : Best racing feeling ever! Different cars have completely different handling, how it should be.The bad: Still somewhat twitchy controls ( Better default setups needed) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is my pleasure and absolute honour to review Project CARS.This game is by far one of the best and most enjoyable simulator car games I've played.I'm an avid fan of all types of racing games, from arcade to simulator and a cross of both.If you are a simulator freak, then this game is for you.Firstly, the selection of cars that are available on this game will be abundant enough to keep you playing for hundred of hours. From Road cars to Touring and GT cars, to Formula A/B/C, vintage racing models (and even GO-KARTS!); players will be busy running through all the different competitions and racetracks in career mode.The track selection is quite ideal; they have long racing tracks for fast cars, small tracks with lots of turns for the nippy lower CC cars, even smaller tracks for go-karts, and also highways (YES HIGHWAYS) for road cars.There is however, no rally/drift cars and tracks available (I heard they are releasing this in Project CARS 2 - something to look forward to).The graphics is appealing, the cars and tracks are well designed to look like their real life counterparts. The physics is astonishing. When it is raining you can hear the raindrops pouring/dripping onto your windscreen and even on the roof; then comes the sound of your windscreen wipers as it brushes the water through, which to me is so immersive that I felt a sudden rush of cool air as I was driving (sounds crazy right?!)You can change the paintjob/decals of your cars in the garage which I think is pretty cool. Career mode is great. You can alter the length of races so for those who don't want to grind it out, you can specify the amount of laps per race they are willing to race. Or why not challenge yourself if you are a freak and do the 24 hour Le Mans race?! =) The choice is yours. As you win races in career mode, your newsfeed/Fan chat lights up with Twitter messages showing praises/criticism (depending on your performances) from all around the world. You will progress and secure better contracts for better teams OR promoted to a better Tier of racing.Last but not least, the car setups are so realistic that you could spend hours just practicing and finding the ideal setup for your car on each track. As for driving itself, you can turn off all aids and immerse in the full manual experience with manual clutch and shifters and even manual start your engine when it stalls (oh my god right). Or if you're not so hardcore, you can always use paddle shifters/manual sequential (and of course Automatic, but who drives on Auto!)A small minority of people have said that the online experience can be quite buggy, personally I have found the online system to have no bugs/glitches/lag so far. I've even managed to play with my cousin for a few hours on 450 ping with no issues. That being said, the single player experience is enough to keep most players engaged and appealed.I could go on forever but I'll end it here. Project CARS is an amazing simulator experience. The only negative I would point out is the AI. When you are driving certain tracks and heading around corners, they just seem to stick to one racing line and if you happen to cross their line, they will bump and clean you up, causing you to spin/crash etc.I'm giving it at least a 9/10, and looking forwards to writing my review for Project CARS 2 when it comes out; if they input in rally and drift cars/tracks. Recommend to play this game on a good set of wheel and pedals, with decent gear shifters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How to discribe Project C.A.R.S...First of all, the bright side of Project CARS.+ Best graphics of all the racing sims+ Nice cars and tracks, unfortunately most of the good cars are DLC+ Each car feels like one of a kind+ Day and night cyclus+ All weather casts are in this game.+ Nice singleplayer mode, you can start in every class, or climb up into higher classes.+ Easy to learn, Hard to master?The downsides of the game- Replay camera's are outdated, AC has more and better camera angles/distances/depth without spiky movements - You need an expensive (€100,- (or more)) wheel to play this game propperly, before I got my Logitec DF GT, I had a Ferrari 458 Italia steeringwheel from my xbox360. (budget wheel, I know) My Ferrari 458 didn't work well, like if I had a deadzone of 25% and I couldn't change the options so I could race normal.- Awful netcode (example: On your screen, people are pushing you off the track, while on their screens they just drive away and hit nothing)- Scripted grip levels in tracks, practice zero grip; after 1 hour and 25 cars, still no grip, while at the last minutes of the qualification session there is more then enough rubber on the track even when you are alone.- No Co-op mode, this was one of the reasons I bought the game, so I could play with friends in 1 team, but they scrapped the plans, couple of monthes before the release.- Multiplayer with only GT3 or Formula A cars.So I give Project C.A.R.S. 7.5/10Even with all the downsides, it's still fun to play with friends or in a lobby with good connection.

This game seriously lacks Mazda love and i have to say I probably play it less than I would if there was a awesome Mazda DLC. I hope we will get this in the near future, cause I have been waiting, since launch.

												It's a great racing gaming, beautiful graphics but there are things thati don't like:1) Automatic traction control is not that great on cars like Formula A. On games like F1 2015 (codemasters) you can choose between full/medium and off. It is difficult on keyboard to drive many cars on low speed corners.2) AI is not that great, they hit you and other AI's too often.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would hope after spending over 140 hrs of my life with pCars I can add a useful comment for prospective purchasers.I love driving games be they arcade, simcade or sims, although I prefer sims.I think the negative comments are wrong. If your PC is totally up to date and you can get the best out of pCars, it's awesome. Constantly updated, (Which can be a pain as it often means reconfiguring settings lol)People that have slated it in the past probably didn't/don't have the specs, equipment or haven't kept on giving it time with the updates.I play on 4k 3840x2160 with 2x 980Ti's with a wheel and pedals and it's brilliant.The new announcement about Vive support has pushed me into placing an order :0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sounds... immersive, looks amazingly real and you can feel the track come alive beneath you!Project cars, iRacing, Assetto Corsa or others? -Below- The graphics are simply amazing and the best within track racing today (2016).As a 'Sim' it's unique and offers a high level of realism photographically with it physics and a high level of tinkering for the time trialist.The online communities are there however as with any online play, do so at your own risk for the very few that disregard edictate make for a memorable expereince, hence try a league over public play.The game does have a few flaws such as the AI for single play however the devs are active and there is a reason why this is the number one selling racing sim... there are others however they don't particularly affect me and other reviews record them.Project cars, iRacing, Assetto Corsa or others? Pcars has the aesthetic goods, AC the mods with a middle line simulation between iRacing vs Pcars and iRacing with a competitive ranked online play with a licensing system... and others don't stand out with specialties such as these titles... If you're unsure about these titles I can highly recommend Project cars for either the controller or steering wheel racer enthusiast!!!8/10 losing points with no mod support and user complicated online lobbies.

												If you're like me and you just love games for the simulation, this game is perfect. I couldn't care less about the career, I just want straight up simulation. I mostly play solo too, just my car and the track. With the Logitech G27, it's an amazing escape from reality. Some people need the ""story mode"" style to make it enjoyable, but I don't see Project CARS as a game. I see it as a simulator, and it does great at being that.Sources: I do this sh*t IRL. With a racing wheel, it's pretty damn accurate for a $29.99 game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE as of 6/4/2016:In my previous review, I did not recommend this game because it kept freezing in the same spots, and game performance was spotty in the last couple weeks.As it turns out, these were indications of a Hard Disk Failure; essentially not the games fault. In my old review I thought the performance issues were from the game, when it was really my hard disk giving up the ghost. In any case, here is what I think about the game:PROS:- The game is beautiful, and the locations look faithfully rendered. I've actually been to both Laguna Seca and the northern parts of CA Route 1, and I can say that they really spent some time on getting details right, although I feel as though some of the locations are holdovers from NFS Shift and Shift 2, like the Nordschliefe.-The Cars look good and perform well, and they sound pretty faithful. Although, I feel a lot of the cars they are releasing for DLC should have been included from the beginning instead of being part of specialized packs.CONS:- There are a few bugs. Every once in a while, the car decides that it want's to do it's own thing and run into a wall when I gently nudge the joystick (I bet that doesn't happen on a wheel). Other times, I've run into an invisible wall, or clipped something invisible. That doesn't happen often though.- The handling model still needs some work. Sometimes the cars feels like they're breaking traction and they're skating around, making them a little more difficult to control. Other times, they aren't responsive until you turn too much and then end up backwards and facing the rest of the pack. You'll need to tweak the controls to your liking, but there is still that level of unpredictability.- The DLC packs. I understand that this is a way to keep interest in a game and make more revenue, but when the game was first released, the car list made me go ""meh"". There wan't really any cars that I was itching to drive except for a handful, since a lot of racing games have the same cars. They should have had the cars from some of the DLC packs from the beginning, instead of trotting them out pack by pack. Also, for such an anglo-centric game why are there no TVRs? I would love to drive a faithfully rendered Tuscan Speed 6. Or a Cerbera Speed 12.Final Thoughts:Project Cars is exactly what it says on the box...er..Store Page. It's a graphical powerhouse of a racing sim aimed at people who want to have faithfully rendered cars and tracks. It's a game about the cars, not necessarily about the racing I feel. Even though they billed it as the next major racing sim, when you make an achivement in the game, it doesn't really feel like an achievement. This is probably because all of the cars are unlocked in the very beginning, meaning that you don't unlock car classes the farther you go in your career. I feel as though thats a very important thing to have, as now there's no real incentive to complete the career mode.Instead, I end up spending most of my time on my home tracks (Laguna Seca and CA Route 1) with some of my favorite cars in single races or time trials. In that case, this game is closer to the Test Drive series of games than it is a full on racing sim.Still, taking a McLaren on the Coastal Highway isn't a bad thing at all.			",65,2,8,7,4,1,4

A few days later i'd brought myself to the conclusion that this was totally unfair and deleted said review.  I'm 86 hours into it now and it truely is THE most rewarding game i have ever played.  It doesn't reward 'banzai fast' laps or suicidal dives down the inside.  It doesn't reward sideways driving or cutting corners.  What it does reward is consistency.

												This is my first Steam review and although I've always enjoyed project cars on and off. Now that it has Vive support I've gone and bought all the extra content too, Not just to experience it but to say thanks to the dev team for pushing forward with the vive support which has changed me gaming life forever as an experience I recommend evangelically to anyone! :)Also, quick notes on VR/Vive support. I recommend an absolute minimum of aliasing on 2x for now, even if you have to set everything else at minimum as it makes an insanely big difference to distance you can see and jaggies/pixels//shimmering. The other stuff (on a 980 at least) to set high is car detail (for up close cars passing by) and maybe the rest at low or medium.Set the screen res to 640 lowest too as that seems to be just for the preview. Also, a small detail is that the two ""head"" camera views are slightly different in the way they behave. One will keep your head movement relevant to the cars angle so that if you hit a bump, crash or go up a hill, your head moves at the same time the car does. That can be off putting for low frame rates and isn't that smooth. The other view though will make the head movement absolute so that if you go over a bump you see the car move up or down but your head stays fixed to the horizon and stays stable, same with hills, it's much smoother. Not sure which is better though to be honest. I think the first is more realistic but might be too much for some ;)Slightly mad studios. If you read this. You might need to have an additional sound option for VR as the mix could do with adjusting for such a visceral experience as VR. ;) Things like road noise, wind, tires and other cars need to be a bit louder I think to stop it feeling a bit claustrophobic in VR and maybe bring some of those great external engine sounds you get in the 3rd person view to make it even more lively. Anyway.. I hope there's even more optimisation coming but this is an amazing start for my favourite car game. Like others here.

												Project CARS is definitely a benchmark game, Without doubt it is one of the best looking games around. Gameplay is both addictive and satisfyingly Fast paced, with more than enough cars and tracks to choose from, pCars offers many hours of great fun. All cars are available from the very start of the game, so you can hop into your favourite classic Lotus and hammer on the gas at nordschleife or battle it out in career mode. Project Cars will take its rightful place in the Hall of Fame of Racing games and has much to offer the casual or hardcore simmer, this game is a must buy for any Racing Car fan. Simply Brilliant  10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A perfect case of a waste of money.Played this game at a friend's house, we were both huge forza fans before we switched to PC, game was fun so I picked it up on sale. Since my first race it has had a bug that will make it lag a few seconds, then go in fast forward to catch back up. Makes it completely unplayable. I really wanted it to work so I began searching for a fix. Tried everything I could find, even going into my bios and changing CPU settings that may have been causing it. Which they shouldn't anyway, since all of my 100+ other games worked completely fine with the cpu just the way it was. While in my trying to fix it (starting the game up, trying to do a race, still didn't fix it, try something else, still didn't fix it, etc.) I went over my two hours and am now stuck with it. Judging by how the forum posts of people having the same problem were from 7+ months ago, I'm sure it will never be fixed.I really wanted to like the game, and when it works is so fun, almost better than my beloved forza days. However when the game goes into warp speed and sends me through a turn into a wall it outweighs the good. Another shining example of why early access is garbage. Why would they fix the game or make it work for everyone? They've already made their fortune.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game at a very good discounted price, now at 20 Euros/$. You might need some time to get used to and fiddle with controller or wheel settings, once that is done, it's a very enjoyable Racing Sim. Harder to get used to than most other racing games,  although this one has the best graphics out there by a mile. Most complain about early bugs and there were loads when it was released but most have been ironed out.The good : Best racing feeling ever! Different cars have completely different handling, how it should be.The bad: Still somewhat twitchy controls ( Better default setups needed) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is expensive. But is it worth it? That is what i will be telling you here.PROS:This game has a plethera of tracks. Ranging from dubai to the california highway.Not to mention the sheer amount of track and race settings:You can:1) choose the amount of opponents2)choose the date and time of day3) choose the weather settings(either current weather, if time and date is set, or your own choice. AND there are plenty of choices here.While it doesn't lack in car variety at a guess there is probably around 60 cars to choose from. Ranging from the 1960s to the present day (i also think there is a 1920s/30s racer in there) these cars all handle amazing (tested)Now the handling:The handling in this game is amazing! (using even a crappy wheel) i do recommend you use a wheel though.CONS:If you had to configure your wheel or controls manually. There is no way of manually saving it (as far as i can see) this happened to me because i took my computer away from my wheel (yes that is the right way round) i used an xbox 360 controller for the game. When i came back and switched back to my wheel settings. They were gone. This is my only gripe so far. Overall opinion:If you have managed to read this far you are probably wondering how i can review it so in depth with barely any hours on it. During these hours i thoroughly studied almost every aspect of the game. And to be honest. I dont think you will get the game for a career mode. But there is one. Well its a grand prix. Its confusing dont ask.So should you spend £40 on this game. Short answer.Its your choice.I personally got this game for £25 so for that price or even £30 i cant argue with it. But £40 is a bit steep for me.Overall rating out of 10:8/10 worth whatever price you are willing to pay. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game with a road car roster of Forza or GT would be hard pressed to be the king of racers on any platform. The game is great if you enjoy cars/racing. Emphasis on racing. You do not feel attached toward road cars, however this game will make you a better racing gamer. If you want to fantasize about your favorite car, play forza. If you want to challenge yourself as a racing gamer, play this game. I'm a casual sim racer FYI.			",23,2,2,5,1,0,2

												I only have 2 complaints.1. You NEED a controller or a wheel to play this. It's almost as if they don't know how to make stuff work on a keyboard. Good thing I have a pad.2. Upping the difficulty above 60 (in my experience) for the most part doesn't make the other drivers better, it just makes them able to screw physics more to make themselves go faster while you're stuck having to drive like an actual human being.Still fun to play though despite issue 2.

												I cannot recommend this game, be it for VR or not. If you've played racing simulators like NFS Shift 2, or Forza, then you'll be in for a disappointing shock with Project Cars. The graphics are sub par despite what the pretty screenshots look like, and yes, I have a powerful enough PC to run this smoothly at its highest settings. But I can live with that. The deal breaker for me is the driving mechanics. It's as if the game has very poor or limited driving physics simulation as the cars do not react the way a real car would when turning, especially at sharp corners, it's noticeable and completely breaks the immersion.So unfortunately I cannot recommend the game.

												Project Cars is probably one of the best games of all time that I've played. It's graphics and range of motorsports are astonishing, something that I think will not be matched for years to come. With Project Cars 2 coming later this year, (another crowd-funded game) you have to ask yourself where did all of the excess money go from the current game's fundraiser?Back onto the subject, Project Cars is probably also the most realistic racing simulation avaliable too! There are lots of options to tune your ride, ranging from camber angles to tire pressure. There are tyres for different weather conditions, and also some very restricted visual customization as well. There's many famous tracks from all over the world that you can race on. The range of cars in the game is very small however, without any of the expensive DLC, considering the game's initial price. Project Cars does require a medium computer to run, which is actually quite surprising considering the intense graphics. I currently get 50 fps all around, with occasional dips down to 40 and even 30 in some places, my laptop specifications are listed below.I will rate Project Cars an 9/10 due to the minimal visual customization options and poor multiplayer gameplay (server availability is terrible)Intel core i5 4310m 2.7Ghz Dual Core Processor8GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA Geforce GTX 850m GPU1TB 7200RPM HDD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, this is a good game.I'm a wheel user, I have only played this game once on a pad.Online is pretty solid, way better than it was at first launch. You can have competitive races if you find the right lobby. But most of the time, be aware that there are always 1 or 2 noobs who take people out (in a 20 people lobby). Another downside is that there's no proper penalty system, though you get slow-down penalties for exceeding track limits, you can get away with ramming most of the time. Sometimes you can get DSQ'd for ramming.Offline is decent as well. You have a massive amount of tracks and weather options. You can adjust a lot of things in solo races. The downside is that especially on higher AI difficulty, the AI can be over-aggressive and sometimes squeeze you off, try a stupid divebomb on you, exceed track limits and get away with it.The graphics are really good, even on low, they are still decent. The physics are very realistic. The sounds are very good as well, but some cars appear to have the same car sounds so that's slightly lazy from the devs. A small problem is that this game can be too realistic and can be really hard without assists, especially on a pad or keyboard.There are still a few minor bugs here and there, but frequent patches keep improving the game.So I recommend this game for league/sim-racers, but not that much for people who aren't sim-racers and don't like aggressive AI too much.Overall rating: 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first Steam review and although I've always enjoyed project cars on and off. Now that it has Vive support I've gone and bought all the extra content too, Not just to experience it but to say thanks to the dev team for pushing forward with the vive support which has changed me gaming life forever as an experience I recommend evangelically to anyone! :)Also, quick notes on VR/Vive support. I recommend an absolute minimum of aliasing on 2x for now, even if you have to set everything else at minimum as it makes an insanely big difference to distance you can see and jaggies/pixels//shimmering. The other stuff (on a 980 at least) to set high is car detail (for up close cars passing by) and maybe the rest at low or medium.Set the screen res to 640 lowest too as that seems to be just for the preview. Also, a small detail is that the two ""head"" camera views are slightly different in the way they behave. One will keep your head movement relevant to the cars angle so that if you hit a bump, crash or go up a hill, your head moves at the same time the car does. That can be off putting for low frame rates and isn't that smooth. The other view though will make the head movement absolute so that if you go over a bump you see the car move up or down but your head stays fixed to the horizon and stays stable, same with hills, it's much smoother. Not sure which is better though to be honest. I think the first is more realistic but might be too much for some ;)Slightly mad studios. If you read this. You might need to have an additional sound option for VR as the mix could do with adjusting for such a visceral experience as VR. ;) Things like road noise, wind, tires and other cars need to be a bit louder I think to stop it feeling a bit claustrophobic in VR and maybe bring some of those great external engine sounds you get in the 3rd person view to make it even more lively. Anyway.. I hope there's even more optimisation coming but this is an amazing start for my favourite car game. Like others here. I'm not even a big car nut but project cars with a wheel, VR (and some to be ""simvibe"" vibrations) is a must have experience! Don't pass on it!...hmm. lastly.. PLEASE devs.. also get round to adding even just a basic multiplayer/co-op career mode. It would be much appreciated!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It doesn't reward 'banzai fast' laps or suicidal dives down the inside.  It doesn't reward sideways driving or cutting corners.  What it does reward is consistency.

Felt like driving on glass, endless spinouts. Maybe I'm just not a good driver but the constant crashing and system freezes didn't lend themselves to gaining experience. No other games freeze or lock my PC like this. It was cool trying on the Vive and is quite an experience. I may come back to this if it gets some patching and stability and a lot of work on vehicle and driving physics. As it is though it just isn't worth it to me.

												This game is so addictive! Had this game a while now and never really got into it until... I got a steering wheel it totally changed the game for me, I was used to playing it with a PS3/ps4 controller but the wheel completely changed the way I raced. I\'ve had a wheel in the past but I suppose the games weren\'t around back then, the menus of the game are easy to get around is personally suggest you do some race weekends before hitting career mode to get your eye in, I like it most because of the local tracks it has. Oulton park being my favorite!If I was to pick up on a couple of things it would be I would like a better selection of road cars,The kind of cars you see on a daily basis. And you can never have too many tracks or track variants,Having said that though, I\'m very happy with the tracks that come with the game and the variety of cars,I\'d be more than happy to pay for cars and tracks on a dlc bundle tho,From what I here though there\'s a new game being developed in the form of project cars 2 so I can only assume we\'re stuck with what\'s there now. I can live with that though.As for online racing and mods I can\'t comment on as they\'re not my area of expertise I like single player games mostly, having said that I do like the time attack and that the leaderboard is online and I can compare where I am in the world			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Project Cars is probably one of the best games of all time that I've played. It's graphics and range of motorsports are astonishing, something that I think will not be matched for years to come. With Project Cars 2 coming later this year, (another crowd-funded game) you have to ask yourself where did all of the excess money go from the current game's fundraiser?Back onto the subject, Project Cars is probably also the most realistic racing simulation avaliable too! There are lots of options to tune your ride, ranging from camber angles to tire pressure. There are tyres for different weather conditions, and also some very restricted visual customization as well. There's many famous tracks from all over the world that you can race on. The range of cars in the game is very small however, without any of the expensive DLC, considering the game's initial price. Project Cars does require a medium computer to run, which is actually quite surprising considering the intense graphics. I currently get 50 fps all around, with occasional dips down to 40 and even 30 in some places, my laptop specifications are listed below.I will rate Project Cars an 9/10 due to the minimal visual customization options and poor multiplayer gameplay (server availability is terrible)Intel core i5 4310m 2.7Ghz Dual Core Processor8GB DDR3 RAMNVIDIA Geforce GTX 850m GPU1TB 7200RPM HDD			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has its pros and cons, but is overall a really good simluator/game.The Graphics are stunning; the Cars are incredibly detailed, weather effects are gorgeus and the racetracks look amazingly realistic. There are a ton of options to personalize the experience to your preferences, covering beginners to professional player settings. The HUD and Menus are really well done, the colour sceme is a nice touch. The Career is interesting and engaging, the missing cutscenes (like cheering your victory on a podium etc.) are replaced with a ""twitter"" system, where computergenerated users will tweet hashtags and messages about you current standing and driving style.On the other side however, the driving style and behaviour of the cars are something you´ll have to get used to. You should really start the game with low-tier cars like karts to get a feeling for the handling before grabbing the wheel of a real car. I would definetly recommend a Controller or a driving wheel to play this game, since its hard to control the car correctly on a keyboard.Overall, i can definetly recommend this game for someone whos looking for a realistic, up-to-date racing simulator. You need, however, the patience to master each car seperatly since they have their very own unique driving style.			",69,5,4,5,7,0,3

												Firstly, I was a backer of the game, not to get money from the sales but I was interested in following the development of a game so I could be considered biased.  I'm not a racing sim aficionado more of a casual player (I use a pad not a steering wheel) but I really enjoy this game. It's probably the most fun I've had in a racing game since the glory days of the Geoff Crammond Grand Prix games. I haven't got a high end set up.  An i5 760, GeForce GTX 560 and 8GB of ram but the game runs fine for me. (Not sure how accurate FRAPS is but It says I'm getting around 60fps on medium to high settings). Clearly some people are having genuine issues especially those using AMD but for me there are only a couple of problems I'd like to see addressed. AI cars in the rain seem to have no issues with the conditions even on slicks. They continue to post lap times close to what they achieved in the dry. Second, don't punish me by discounting my next lap if I spin off near the finish. (I know it wouldn't happen if I was a better driver). Overall,  a fun game and worth persevering with. The more you put in the more you get out.			",139,40,14,24,28,1,19

												Now I Race in real life and I have to say that every racing game is still hard for me but this game takes that to a new level I only played for about 1 and a half hours and i can tell you if you don't understand the heel pressure, Break pressure, and esc. even a little leave this game alone. This is definitely a hardcore racing game if you want to drift they may has well made the car tell you ""are you crazy drifting in a car!"". But there is some good parts unless hardcore is good for you THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING but with good graphics comes issues like RUBBER BANDING, and tremendous lag!!!!My computer doesn't have a bad a graphics card its actually pretty good its a nividia 700 series and i run the game on all medium so to me this is unacceptable. 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It doesn't quite work as a product. It lets you navigate the menus with one xbox controller, but only drive with another.For me it crashes in the second corner of the second track in career mode. Consistently. Ammendment: I recently upgraded to an intel based system (was running an 8core amd before), and it no longer crashes. Maybe they patched it, or maybe it just doesn't like AMD. However I still don't like the game as a whole. There are still things in the main menu listed as 'comming soon' despite it supposedly being a finished product, and the gameplay's rather restricted from my point of view.The first commentary I heard in the game began when I was halfway thru the kart series - I didn't even think they had comments until then. Having played some 30 minutes in the 'kart1' kart, I find the game monotonous and uninspiring. There's no urge to finish the season or do anything. Doesn't feel like a finished product. I'm going to uninstall the game now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would be amazing if it were actually finished yet. Too many bugs to mention - some game breaking, some are minor but extremely annoying. The AI is an abomination. At higher difficulties the opponents are extremely agressive. Above 85% it's practically a bloodbath. Below that you can zoom by the entire pack at the start of the race and finish with a 10 second gap to 2nd. Very disappointing.Hopefully Ian Bell can get it together and actually finish this game because I think it would be fun to play if it were properly done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, this could be a long one.This game has lots of pros and cons, so lets look at the details.POSITIVES- This has got to be the best looking racing game I've ever played, maybe even one of the best looking video games of all time. On maximum graphics that is, and frankly, the majority of people wont be able to run that, Putting that aside however, this is a fantastic looking game, as i said, probably one of the best looking video games of all time.- Tracks list is very impressive, over 100 different track layouts from all over the world, very nice selection of locations to race. I havent even raced on them all yet with over 12 hours in the game.- General game stuff, this game runs well, very few bugs and crashes, its well set out (the menus etc), racing wheels set up easily, its all those little, well functioning things that make the game what it is.-The sounds..... OH GLORY THE SOUNDS. Engine sounds, perfect, when you listen to them on a decent set of speakers or headphones, oh man its glorious, and the soundtrack, wow, the best soundtrack for any racing game, its so suiting to the feel of the game, the feeling of determination, passion, speed, its amazing. 10/10 for sounds in this game.However, there are the negative things, as with any game.- Cars list, yes there are a lot of different motorsports, from karts right up to Formula One, however there isn't much selection within each of those categories, with some classes only having 3 or 4 cars to choose from. Still an impressive layout, but not quite as nice as Forza or Gran Turismo.- Driving model, this game is supposed to be a simulator, close to reality. As a real world motorsport driver, I dont think it quite lives up to that. Sure, its more realistic than Forza/Gran Turismo, but not quite as real as IRacing or RFactor. This depends on personal preference, it depends what the player wants from the game, whether they want it to be realistic, or arcade like, its all up to personal preference here.- Career Mode, ok and heres the big one. Career mode. Frankly, in less than 4 hours of playing career, it got too boring and repetitive, so i stopped playing it. It just felt like I was playing the same thing over and over again, and to top it off there is no rewards system, such as in game cash etc, so you dont feel like you earn anything by playing career. Frankly, career mode in this game is a bit of a flop to me. With career being such a big part of a game like this, the game as a whole began to get a little boring after the 10 hour mark, until i found other things to do in it such as running my own time comparisons etc.So it has its positives, and its negatives. Based on facts alone, for $70 US, $90 AUD (what I payed for it) this game would simply not be worth that. I know its new, and future updates may improve the game, but as it stands now, it wouldn't be worth that if we rated it simply on facts. There is something else to this game though.Its the feel of this game. Its the feelings you get while playing it. Its crazy how soothing and nice it feels to blast along the French Coastline in a supercar at 1am on a rainy morning in a game that looks this good. It just feels.... right. Based on that, I would recommend this game to anyone, it needs lots of work, but Its a great title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game. I would put this game in my top 10 favorite Racing game for sure. Game play is solid, some people call this game a sim, but I wouldn't say it's that realistic. No game will ever give you the feel of driving a real car. The learning curve is a little higher than other games but that doesn't make it a sim. The most important part about this game is knowing your breaking line and when to down shift for an up coming turn. If you like game like AC, iRacing and Dirt Rallly where the learning curve is  harder  you'll love this game for sure. I play this game with a G27wheel and my review is base around that experience. I don't know how this game feels with a controller or keyboard. The FFB and road feel is awesome. One thing I do recommend you doing is spending time on setting up your wheel profile correctly and the in game wheel setting. Once you have it tune, the game drives like a champ. I would recmmend this game to anyone looking for a solid racing game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll keep it short; contrary to the product description, Project Cars is by no means a racing simulation (if you compare it to rFactor, iRacing or Assetto Corsa). That said, I still have a lot of fun with this game. Jumping in to a BMW Z4 GT3 and taking it onto the famous Nordschleife (with fancy graphics) for a <7 minutes laptime, no prior tedious setup required whatsoever, really felt awesome. But it leaves me afraid of going back to those simulators, that actually require me to use proper gears and braking to survive.			",192,33,7,45,33,0,21

												I bought this game to play it with my Oculus Rift DK2. I'm running this on a Corei5 4460 (4x3.2Ghz) and a Radeon 290X. Unfortunately I don't get the required 75fps for smooth VR gameplay even though I put all the graphics options to low. I'm running the most current Oculus Runtime and have up-to-date drivers. I blame this on the deep integration of Nvidia Gameworks in the title. Would not recommend th game and if I could get my money back I would.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How to discribe Project C.A.R.S...First of all, the bright side of Project CARS.+ Best graphics of all the racing sims+ Nice cars and tracks, unfortunately most of the good cars are DLC+ Each car feels like one of a kind+ Day and night cyclus+ All weather casts are in this game.+ Nice singleplayer mode, you can start in every class, or climb up into higher classes.+ Easy to learn, Hard to master?The downsides of the game- Replay camera's are outdated, AC has more and better camera angles/distances/depth without spiky movements - You need an expensive (€100,- (or more)) wheel to play this game propperly, before I got my Logitec DF GT, I had a Ferrari 458 Italia steeringwheel from my xbox360. (budget wheel, I know) My Ferrari 458 didn't work well, like if I had a deadzone of 25% and I couldn't change the options so I could race normal.- Awful netcode (example: On your screen, people are pushing you off the track, while on their screens they just drive away and hit nothing)- Scripted grip levels in tracks, practice zero grip; after 1 hour and 25 cars, still no grip, while at the last minutes of the qualification session there is more then enough rubber on the track even when you are alone.- No Co-op mode, this was one of the reasons I bought the game, so I could play with friends in 1 team, but they scrapped the plans, couple of monthes before the release.- Multiplayer with only GT3 or Formula A cars.So I give Project C.A.R.S. 7.5/10Even with all the downsides, it's still fun to play with friends or in a lobby with good connection.

												I would hope after spending over 140 hrs of my life with pCars I can add a useful comment for prospective purchasers.I love driving games be they arcade, simcade or sims, although I prefer sims.I think the negative comments are wrong. If your PC is totally up to date and you can get the best out of pCars, it's awesome. Constantly updated, (Which can be a pain as it often means reconfiguring settings lol)People that have slated it in the past probably didn't/don't have the specs, equipment or haven't kept on giving it time with the updates.I play on 4k 3840x2160 with 2x 980Ti's with a wheel and pedals and it's brilliant.The new announcement about Vive support has pushed me into placing an order :0			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I mostly play solo too, just my car and the track. With the Logitech G27, it's an amazing escape from reality. Some people need the ""story mode"" style to make it enjoyable, but I don't see Project CARS as a game. I see it as a simulator, and it does great at being that.Sources: I do this sh*t IRL.

												WARNING DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME:Career mode is absolutly terrible as you will no doubt rage quit due to the ai that will literally crash you off the track. Realism - basically an arcade racer, dont think about even coming close to certain curbs as you will just spin out even if you only put your front wheels on the curb the rear will spin around, secondly the ai manage to go over the curbs like their nothing, i follow the ai for hours figureing out how they did it. However if you carry the same amount speed they do, you will spin out, making it impossible to overtake on certain areas. This game cannot compare to the likes of rfacter and iracing, with realism. However this is one of the few semi realistic games that offer a career mode which is a plus, also the graphics are quiet good compared to other racing games otherwise its a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to what is already out there.

												Decent racing simulator, albeit hindered by SMS's shady business practices.If you manage to snag the game with all of it's respective DLC for $20 during a sale then it's worth the money, but I can't justify it in any other scenario.Not to mention, support for this game was almost immediately dropped in favor of SMS's next Project CARS 2.The game itself is remarkably good, the force feedback holds up to most simulators, and the driving is unforgiving and challenging.Tuning is pitiful. There are a grand total of like two final drive options. Why?Don't buy this game then immediately put the difficulty on max. You will lose.I have experience with racing simulators, and I still spin out from time to time.This is especially true if you don't have a racing wheel, because a controller cannot mimic the wheel response needed to tell when the car is gripping or not.Don't use your peasant controllers with this game please.Please. Don't.			",50,1,4,2,1,1,0

												As much as I loved the graphics and UI, the driving experience was so glitchy that it made the game unplayable. The car would randomly jerk to one direction when my wheel had not been moved. The wheel would also be very twitchy and twitch to one side and then back to the center very quickly. About every third shift I would make (with the paddle shifters) would not be registered in game. It is worth noting that this wheel worked perfectly fine in every other racing game I tried with it including DiRT 3 and DiRT Rally. Very disapointed.			",18,1,3,0,3,0,1

												Sounds... immersive, looks amazingly real and you can feel the track come alive beneath you!Project cars, iRacing, Assetto Corsa or others? -Below- The graphics are simply amazing and the best within track racing today (2016).As a 'Sim' it's unique and offers a high level of realism photographically with it physics and a high level of tinkering for the time trialist.The online communities are there however as with any online play, do so at your own risk for the very few that disregard edictate make for a memorable expereince, hence try a league over public play.The game does have a few flaws such as the AI for single play however the devs are active and there is a reason why this is the number one selling racing sim... there are others however they don't particularly affect me and other reviews record them.Project cars, iRacing, Assetto Corsa or others? Pcars has the aesthetic goods, AC the mods with a middle line simulation between iRacing vs Pcars and iRacing with a competitive ranked online play with a licensing system... and others don't stand out with specialties such as these titles... If you're unsure about these titles I can highly recommend Project cars for either the controller or steering wheel racer enthusiast!!!8/10 losing points with no mod support and user complicated online lobbies.

												UPDATE as of 6/4/2016:In my previous review, I did not recommend this game because it kept freezing in the same spots, and game performance was spotty in the last couple weeks.As it turns out, these were indications of a Hard Disk Failure; essentially not the games fault. In my old review I thought the performance issues were from the game, when it was really my hard disk giving up the ghost. In any case, here is what I think about the game:PROS:- The game is beautiful, and the locations look faithfully rendered. I've actually been to both Laguna Seca and the northern parts of CA Route 1, and I can say that they really spent some time on getting details right, although I feel as though some of the locations are holdovers from NFS Shift and Shift 2, like the Nordschliefe.-The Cars look good and perform well, and they sound pretty faithful. Although, I feel a lot of the cars they are releasing for DLC should have been included from the beginning instead of being part of specialized packs.CONS:- There are a few bugs. Every once in a while, the car decides that it want's to do it's own thing and run into a wall when I gently nudge the joystick (I bet that doesn't happen on a wheel). Other times, I've run into an invisible wall, or clipped something invisible. That doesn't happen often though.- The handling model still needs some work. Sometimes the cars feels like they're breaking traction and they're skating around, making them a little more difficult to control. Other times, they aren't responsive until you turn too much and then end up backwards and facing the rest of the pack. You'll need to tweak the controls to your liking, but there is still that level of unpredictability.- The DLC packs. I understand that this is a way to keep interest in a game and make more revenue, but when the game was first released, the car list made me go ""meh"". There wan't really any cars that I was itching to drive except for a handful, since a lot of racing games have the same cars. They should have had the cars from some of the DLC packs from the beginning, instead of trotting them out pack by pack. Also, for such an anglo-centric game why are there no TVRs? I would love to drive a faithfully rendered Tuscan Speed 6. Or a Cerbera Speed 12.Final Thoughts:Project Cars is exactly what it says on the box...er..Store Page. It's a graphical powerhouse of a racing sim aimed at people who want to have faithfully rendered cars and tracks. It's a game about the cars, not necessarily about the racing I feel. Even though they billed it as the next major racing sim, when you make an achivement in the game, it doesn't really feel like an achievement. This is probably because all of the cars are unlocked in the very beginning, meaning that you don't unlock car classes the farther you go in your career. I feel as though thats a very important thing to have, as now there's no real incentive to complete the career mode.Instead, I end up spending most of my time on my home tracks (Laguna Seca and CA Route 1) with some of my favorite cars in single races or time trials. In that case, this game is closer to the Test Drive series of games than it is a full on racing sim.Still, taking a McLaren on the Coastal Highway isn't a bad thing at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off, this game is beautiful. Playing on a GTX 670, I can run everything on full (except AA) with about 50 fps.That should how well optimised this game is, as I can tell you that the graphics' are akin to SW Battlefront's.Then there is the gameplay. Depending on how you want it, Project CARS can be more like an arcade racing simulator oran actual drive around a race course. It's has it's 'WOW' moments, especially when you've finally completed a difficulttrack without any scuffs. The game works very well with the controller, for those of you who don't have a steering wheel.Two problems though: 1) ""Where do I start!"" Beginning can be quite difficult, and the tutorials are a bit slow and annoying.I recommend jumping into career mode and doing phase 6. 2) There are those qualifying rounds which are hella slow. I mean, I just want to jump into a fun race, not drive around endlessly trying to get a fast lap time!Overall 8/10. A very, very fun simulator once you get into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Comparison between AC and pCarsAC has better graphics and the racetracks look more real.AC makes the rear of the car feel like a lose cannon ready to overtake you at any moment.AC has the weird intention of completing a 360° whenever you lose control of the rear end even if you're driving only 10km/hAC feels as if you are far from the car's limit until you're suddenly over it.AC makes is close to impossible to regain control once the car was over the limit making a crash almost certain.pCars is inferior in graphics. pCars feels more immersive because of TV helis flying above the track (which you can also hear) and ppl next to the track, firetrucks n stuff like that.pCars has the way better menu and shorter loading times.pCars gives me a better feedback of when I am about to reach the limit.pCars so far makes it easier to regain control once you were slightly over the limit making it fun to push for the limit.I am not a racecar driver and have no experience racing cars. I did do kart racing semiprofessionally for 8 years, so I only have a buttom-o-meter for karts and not cars. That results in the conclusion up above. AC feels like it has WAY too low mechanical grip, making all cars feel skiddish, whereas in pCars I have the feeling I can grasp the change between aerodynamic grip to mechanical grip through my T500RS wheel.Will update once I have more time on both games. However, atm I will be more likely to play pCars as it is more fun for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Should of bought a gaming steering wheel set.. When using a keyboard, forget about precision driving and going around a tight corner without doing a burnout especially in a Formula 1 race. It is less felt with the more slower cars giving me a sense of relief that the game is still playable. The visuals are next generation, the game does very well in simulating how the car will perform in real life and the damage level when smashing into other cars is purely satisfying.

												SOUP, Magnusson here doin a lil review on Project Cars.For thoes of you who like to have a highly customizible simulation racing game, then you will be in luck as Project cars has pulled it off. Though I'm not saying, "" It's a perfect game and nothing is wrong with it."" I can see some minor hiccups and unwanted features as I find some features for example the the "" guid line\brake line"" that helps u to improve the methods to attack the connors and the braking do not dynamically change for each and every individual car including if the car is upgraded unlike in FORZA 4, but I do learn new things in this game as I keep on playing. The only other complaint I have is some of the collision noises and engine noises are not ""EXPRESSED"" enough as in feeling like u just crashed or reving the car in the right way.All in all it's a detailed, fun, makes u giggle like a little school girl from time to time and intense game; additionally I recomend it to the people who love to race and the rare type of cars including F1.(P.S. make sure to have a really good Computer to play this game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Summary: Bad AI and bad crash physcis, difficulty is not enoguh for skilled drivers (I can win 100% races in certain cars and I'm not a great sim racer) still very fun but I think Assetto Corsa is probably a better choice. Also with Project Cars Two in development I would try and wait because that will probably offer a lot more including Rallycross and Hillclimb, and then you can make a choice on which you like more.--- Example of bad side impact physics:

I had a tough time deciding whether or not to recommend this game. I still feel it's very incomplete and WMD have already announced PC2. It seems to me they just used PC to earn money and start PC2. But ignoring that I still feel PC is a bit of a let down. A huge issue is the physics and AI. The graphics are top notch even without having them maxxed out its a beautiful game.AI- The AI are horrible, certain tracks they will crash in the same turn over and over, on others they will have 5 car pile ups going into the first turn. They also dive bomb going into the turns often running through the grass and crashing into you mid way through the turn. They also hate racing close. When your going downa a straight side by side a lot of times they'll swerve away from you going through the grass or hitting the wall without any reason to. The difficultly is also too low. The cars I race (Ford Focus for example) without any tuning or practice on the track can beat the AI at 100% difficultly. I don't consider myself a very good sim racer either, but even in cars I have a lot of trouble controlling I can keep the AI over 90%, and in the Focus I can have them at 100% and easily make it to the front of a 30 car race.Physics- The driving physics I'm not too sure about. Some cars feel great, others I feel I have no control over. But that might just because they are suppose to be harder to control. The real issue with physics is collisions. In some cars you can slide into a car, without too much speed and end up either shot off the car in a wierd glitch, or sometimes you end up sliding up the car until your car is almost horizontal. Basically you have to avoid any contact with the sides of other cars or wierd things start happeningExample of side impact physics (same video as above):

Force Feedback- I'm not going to comment on the force feedback because I'm worried my Logitech G27 is dying and causing force feedback issues. I will say the tweaker files did improve my opinion of the force feedback.Verdict- Ultimately I bought this because I wanted a game close to Forza 4. Something close to realistic I could mess around on, with many different settings on car count, enviornment, race length, and AI settings. In this Project Cars met my expectations. I really do enjoy this game, although I only drive about 3 cars because I havent figured out how to control the others well enough for a good race. But the cars I have gotten used to I love (Ford Focus in particular is my favorite, front wheel drive can save you from a lot of mistakes). But if I had the chance I would definitly go back and buy Assetto Corsa instead, from my understandign its much more sim like with better AI, as well as allowing MODS which is huge to me. If you decide to get this game try and pick it up under $30 I was able to get it for about $35 and redeem it through Steam.Example of how easy the AI are, I take the first lap very slow because you can easily pass 20+ cars but I like to let them spread out first. I make plently of mistakes, and still win a minute, lapping most of the field:

												This game is amazing. I have a low end Pc and it runs very nicely at an OK frame rate.It's my favourite racing game since the original forza on the old xbox. Forza 2 was good also. It's far better than the latest ps3 Granturismo games. I did however love the original Gt on the original PlayStation. I enjoyed the demolition derby in Grid, I liked the arcade fun of Nfs Shift... Microprose F1 on the Amiga was the game that help me learn the tracks, Carmageddon taught me to run over people. Test drive dual and Test drive unlimited were also favourites of mine. Mario kart will never be beaten for what it is.What I'm trying to say is I have played many driving games for many years but this is the best.. Just get the damn game!			",27,3,4,2,5,1,0

												Have yet to play with a wheel, but so far the game is fantastic! Cars, scenery, and all the effects look absolutely gorgeous. The way the weather affects both visibility and handling is great and minor details such as ignition, windshield wipers and lights all being able to be mapped to the keyboard or a button box makes this feel really cool. I will definitely be picking up a racing wheel in the near future to play this game with! The career setup of being able to start in whatever Tier you'd like, and work your way up the ranks is really awesome. Love the diversity of Motorsports.

												Best racing game ever, except for two things. The first one: the physics when a car is raised to the air in a crash is very unreal, looks like the car has an extreme gravity forze and goes down so quickly. Also when the car has half flips, it's like the floor of the track has obstacles or something making the car crashing with something invisible against the floor.The second one: This game may has the best crash simulation of racing games. but still looks bad in slow motion replay. It would be the perfect game if the developers includes a crash simulation like BeamNG Drive.			",12,2,8,1,1,0,1

Driving around Donington when it started to rain and just for a moment, I actually thought I was there, seriously! You've done what all others have failed to do, that is create a realistic and convincing environment to race in because after all weather is a major factor in virtual all motor sports.

												This game is the ultimate racing simulator. I'll list some pros and cons!Pros:+The menu is very user friendly+Options and settings are very descriptive and allows you to have the best experience+The graphics, even on the lower end settings, do not disappoint +The way you can tune your car (tire pressure, brake pressure, etc) makes the game great+A variety of maps and cars that never leave you bored+Real life situations (mechanical issues, fuel, tire wear, etc) -- they can be turned on/offCons:+A controller or a wheel set-up would give the ultimate experience+If you don't know how to tune a car and only use stock settings, drifting can be difficult+The multiplayer base is small because the game just came out+AI are pretty stupid, for example, rain doesn't affect them at all like it does to you+Oversteering is a little too exaggerated and you'll sit there and spin outThis game shows promise. Personally, all the pros make the cons not that bad. Of course this game is going to be buggy for a month or two while they sort out the problems. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do!

												I'm a huge Forza nut, and have always wanted Forza for PC. Well, pCars may not quite touch Forza yet for sheer scale and content, but it meets and exceeds it in every other area you can imgine. Graphics, physics, handling, playability... pCars is simply the best racing sim I've ever played. And I haven't even hooked my wheel up, yet, because it's at my friends house. I've been playing this game with a controller, and not only is it totally playable but it plays better with a controller than any console racer I've ever played. I tweaked some of the settings a little bit to take some of the twitch out of it, but other than that it's magnificent.Soon, I imagine pCars will meet or exceed Forza's massive content, be it through mods or official DLC. You can already make your own skins for the cars if you have the artistic talent. This is a game that will be around and growing for years to come, I can tell.Highly recommend this game, 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First impressions... Not great i have to admit!  Coming from Assetto Corsa, first thing i did was boot up a practise session:  Areil Atom, Nurburgring...  And was promptly met with wooly weak FFB effects, you can't feel the car unless something has gone wrong that needs correcting, steering felt ""off"" and i just couldn't get on with it.Jumped into the Clio races to start off my career, and OH MY!!!!  This game NAILS racing like no other before it, whether you side on whether its a driving simulator or simcade, Project Cars just comes to life when other cars are on the track with you.  Coming out of the pits in practise with cold tyres whilst other competitors are flying round bends on optimal temperatures is a weird, but awesome highlight of mineI doubt i'll ever just hotlap a car over and over and over like i do with Assetto Corsa, as the feeling of the car just isn't there - but i am going to race my little♥♥♥♥♥off, bumper to bumper, against a.i. not prone to doing weird♥♥♥♥♥♥corner after corner, and have more fun doing so than i ever have with AC, GT and Forza.A more apt name for this game should have been ""Project: Race"" due to all this, and the fact the car list is VERY track day oriented (something to which i actually appreciate, but a couple of friends who prefer fast road going machines have expressed their disappointment over).

												Best racing game to come out in years! It really feels like you're racing in Project CARS. The AI is smart and focuses on clean racing, unlike other games where they just follow their racing line no matter what. The sounds and visuals are amazing. Driving is a balance of sim and arcade, with more emphasis on sim, but it's accessible to everyone.			",73,8,8,2,2,0,6

												A bit underwhelming so far. My main point of criticism is the car handling which is pretty much hit and miss. For example the Radical SR8-RX is nearly undrivable without driving aids and even then tends to spin out in slow turns at the slightest push on the throttle.  Also most of the options and settings are poorly explained, if at all. The ""digital manual"" is a joke and not helping at all when you want to know what some hard to comprehend menu settings are all about. Also I am not sure if the career mode will hold my interest for long with no incentive other then achievements. But this is more of sandbox racer and with that I am fine as long as the racing is thrilling. AI is very convincing already and can only get better with future updates. As for now, I can't really recommend a purchase and adivse to wait a few weeks until most of the problems have been fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a fair bit on this game, and I can say it's a great racing game. The career is superb, with lots of options to suit your preferences. The online community is okay, lots of clean racers out there that make for great intence battles! The only problem I have so far with this game is the AI, which is just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It doesn't follow any rule whatsoever, so prepare to get rammed into at any given time and they will cut corners without losing any grip too. Trying to do the 12hrs Nordschleife is pretty much impossible with the AI's as they currently are, which I guess makes the whole thing even more rewarding if you complete it.. Anyways, this game is still a lot of fun, for beginners to experts, you sure can find the thrill of racing in this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. I have a low end Pc and it runs very nicely at an OK frame rate.It's my favourite racing game since the original forza on the old xbox. Forza 2 was good also. It's far better than the latest ps3 Granturismo games. I did however love the original Gt on the original PlayStation. I enjoyed the demolition derby in Grid, I liked the arcade fun of Nfs Shift... Microprose F1 on the Amiga was the game that help me learn the tracks, Carmageddon taught me to run over people. Test drive dual and Test drive unlimited were also favourites of mine. Mario kart will never be beaten for what it is.What I'm trying to say is I have played many driving games for many years but this is the best.. Just get the damn game!			",27,3,4,2,5,1,0

												Well i ummed and aahhd about buying this game for ages and reading a fair wack of the reviews i was still in two minds when i did buy it, but i am a car game nutter.me and a friend have been sitting side by side every sunday night and racing each other for years. we have played many hours of the following,we started with grid 1, then we went on tolive for speed(we still play this every now and then), then grid 2 (neither of us enjoyed this), then grid autosport (meh), then assetto corsa (we both have over 200 hours logged)and nowits project cars all the way.of all of these the best comparison for pcars would be ac and for me pcars smashes ac.First thing i can recommend is spend some time setting up and dialling in your wheel and ffb settigns, when i first got pcars my first impressions were i had just wasted my money on a verypretty arcade racer. however because i spent the money i decided to get into setting up my wheel.i have a g27 and my mate uses a dfgt. after about 3 hours of fiddling, googling,testingi can report it was well worth it and it transformed the game into simulation splender, another point i feel some people miss is there is two screens of ffb settings per vehicle in the screens where you can edit each cars setup and after getting the main feel of the cars right , setting these right brings the driving ffb to a new level. i feel just about everything i want about what the car is doing. these ffb settings in the car setup seem to be consistant with all vehicles for me, i mean i use the same settings in the car setup ffb for all cars.also wipping up a lil spreadsheet of settings to print out was a time saver for me to remember what was what during testing phase.my mates dfgt settings were different to mine to get the feel he likes but the car setup ffb settings are the same for us both.once this is all done tho ..o my. we went backe on assetto corsa and did not really like it any more, best description is that it feels like the cars drive on one central wheel at the centre of gravity in assetto corsa now. graphics in project cars are just incredible , the level of detail is spectacular and the time cycle with day and night is awesome and the weather i love, the rain is really for fun and icant drive in the wet very well , especially with dry tyres on lol. the ai what lil i have done with ai was fun , i allways set then low skill and skip all the qualify and see if i can getto first before end of race but i play the career mode just for messing around tbh, its time trials and online for me.so to rap it up, if you like car games and are a lil worried by reviews accept that you will need some time and effort to setup your wheel and ffb settings, but after that you are going to have the most fun you had in ages , i think i got 60 odd hours now and the game still gives me that lil boy chuckle and makes my butt clench during races :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Online seems fairly solid too, although I still haven't done much of that yet.  There is a real sense of accomplishment working through the various classes and I actually think the A.I is fairly good. Yes it isn't as hardcore as some of the other titles out there, but there is a great selection of cars (hopefully more to come) and great tracks. I would reccommend this to any car fan.

												This game is pretty freaking amazing!!!I have played Assetto Corsa, and iRacing, and this one is better than them both put together! I use a Logitech G27, so that might have something to do with it. The cars drive amazingly, and you can adjust the force feedback, so you get a feel for the real car, but it doesnt rip the wheel out of your hands for new racers. (Like me!) The car/track selection is quite large, but is missing some important assets. I think that there needs to be a few proper NASCAR tracks (Ovals and Tri-Ovals), and some cars to go with it. (Talledega, and the 2015/16 series cars to match.) I also think it would be awesome if we could drive on the 'bowl' at Mojave Boa Ascent. I think there should be some more supercars as well, like Koenigsegg, (One:1 please!!!) Ferrari FXX-K, and some Lamborghinis and Ferraris.Overall, I would rate this game 10/10, 11 if the previous improvements are made. I love this game, Thanks Slightly Mad Studios for an awesome addition to my steam library!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Single Player is great, works as expected.Depending on the circuit, AI could either be buffed or nerfed.Multiplay is good when it works but 1 in 3 races will incur a bug.1. Joypad looses all functionaily - Must restart game.2. Changing from qualifying to race, Car gets stuck in the last location it was on the circuit before changing to the race (whilst all other drivers line up on the grid) - Cannot exit to menu - Must force close (ctrl+alt+del) and restart.3. Duplicate cars start on grid. You can control one, but the other stays in it's original position - thus getting in the way of other drivers (and yourself of the next lap).4. Occasionally, before the lights go out on the grid - cars smash into each other before player has control causing damage and penalties.5. Cars spawning backwards, sideways on grid.6. Rolling starts - in large races with lots of racers the last 6 or so tend to be way off the rest of the field before the lights go out and player takes control.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was waiting for this game for 2 years, and I finally got me hands on. Well, as much as I wanted this game to be awesome- it is not. Okay, so we all know that no matter what we say graphics are very important, and if you ask me, this game is the one most beautiful racing game on the PC, especially if the it's raining. Now it's the only thing about this game that I can say is good. U see, there is not enough cars, no visual customization (tho in this game it does not matter), the career mode is no good, and even the steering is not THAT good (it's just fine).Still, this game is fun to play, and I will definitely spend some time in it. Overall 7/10 or Aria/John Snow ...u decide. One last thing ... the keyboard is REALLY NOT recommended(it will work just fine and all but u better grab a steering wheel).			",242,30,14,15,10,0,5

												I bought this game with hope of great ""new gen"" career mode and a lot of beautiful cars. Career is just like a nightmare, I started with karts and now I have to slowly progress throughout every season with hope of getting contract for F1 or GT... UI is confusing, number of cars available in this game made me laugh... controller settings are not explained, hard to set up for Xbox controller.Game is extremely boring, you dont feel the car like in other games, engine sounds very similar in same category cars, low number of players playing online You may like this game however I prefer worst graphic with Gran Turismo 6 on my PS3.

												Beautiful game with great playability, but a serious and ridiculous show stopper of a bug causes it to insta-shutdown on my PC.  The head of the game development studio is extremely rude and argumentative with people reporting bugs, leading to the impression (the correct impression) that he doesn't give a crap about customers.  Painful customer service in a complex and unfinished game. Pretty kickstarteresque.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The gameplay has been fantastic. SP and MP. For those complaining about handling etc. Perhaps they have never handled a car at high speed. Also, for a better experience, turn those assists off, turn the damage model to full, the fuel and tire wear to REAL, etc.As your tires warm up, your fuel burns off and so forth your car will change handling. Something that 99% of all driving games have been getting WRONG forever.The mechanical failures and damage are some of the best around when you set Damage to Full and Mechanical Failures turned on.As to graphics, sound etc? This game is so far beyond GT that it is not even funny. For a simple example, go fire up GT5/6 and run Cote d'Azure, then fire up PCars and run the Azure Coast. Same track but done so much more beautifully/realistic looking that the cartoony effect of buildings, crowds, lighting etc from Polyphony. I loved GT. I don't now. Matter of fact, I think now I understand why phony is part of the name.			",60,3,2,8,11,0,11

												I dont think I have ever written a steam game review before but PCars has forced me into it. The first couple of times I played it it didn't really hook me, It feels a bit clinical if you know what I mean, clearly very good but something didn't excite me in the same way playing iRacing against real people did then I put it on again today and messed around a bit with realism settings and I found a difficulty and realism I liked. Keep in mind that I use a T500RS with seperate pedals.Then I got my Oculus Rift working with it and started a Karting career and I have to say I am totally blown away by its feel and imursion. I cant see how you could make a racing game feel any better for me. I came off it and thought I needed to review it . Although currently you struggle with menu's using the Oculus  you can definately get by.  Switching the Oculus off brings up the menu on the monitor, select what you want then switch Oculus back on and your straight back in.I'd sum it up by saying (enter own swear word here)......awsome . I paid for 2 years subscription a while ago to iRacing but I wonder if I'll make much use of that now...we'll see. If you like racing and have a wheel it's a must buy.....if you also have an Oculus its a masive bonus. Well done to the producers  I wasn't a backer this is an independent review.

												project cars is a racing game suited to all audiences. project cars is a balance of a sim racer and arcade racer with stuning visual and a lot of content making this one of the best overall car racing games on pc to date. project cars is very easy to get used to and does not have a steep learning curve like other racing games on the pc. I would recommend this game for people who like games like forza and the GT series games as project cars has a similar feel to those racing games. overall this is a solid racing game with content to keep you occupied and entertained for hours.

												Well, what can I say........Had a few things to do this afternoon, but bought and downloaded this by 11am.It's now 11pm....... inbetween eating etc, my day has gone and I have the ringing of engine tone in my head :-/Epic game! This is not a Forza or Gran Turismo clone as such, it's a proper raw simulation and if you have ever done track days or raced on tracks in real life, you will fall in love with this one! Handling is superb, albeit in real life, you can drift a car a lot easier than in this but then may just be settings. *Nope, just read, default tyre setup is slicks.....no wonder I kept spinning out, lol*I have a sh*tty old Madcatz 2 wheel from the xbox 360 but it set up ingame an absolute charm and have better control over the cars here than I had on any 360 game including all of the Forza series. Excellent bit of programming by the devs!The only niggle I have is the AI is majorly aggressive especially in a pack of 40 cars!, but that just gives you the opportunity to flash your headlights on and off at them to get out the way for funny replays.Gorgeous tracks, gorgeous weather effects, gorgeous cars, it's just car porn really which sets a scene and puts you right behind the wheel of an epic and true racing simulation.I'm running on max settings with the equivalent of their top recommended rig spec requirements and it's stunning, but even without that graphical splendour I would have still ""wasted"" the entire day on this.Majorly recommend!!!!

												So I went from an the F1 series which is something I was following for years to Project Cars. The first thing that gripped me just from play-throughs was the A.I. The A.I actually attacked you into every corner which was such a breath of fresh air coming from the F1 codemasters games. The issue they had at the time was that they would not back out and wipe you out. However patches were released and I could finally race my seat off. The next feat I love is the sense of speed and this is also twinned with gear changes. When you change gears you feel the car reacting to every shift which leaves a delightful and engaging feeling everytime.  Overall this is such a great breakthrough for a passionate racer and I say it was worth every penny at full price. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping this would be a PC verion equivelent to Forza Motorsport. I was sorely mistaken. The controls are horrible, the graphics are really nice, but not Forza good, and the game has so many glitches. Half the tracks won't load for me, and I get locked in menus often. The menus are clunky as well. Regardless of the driver aids I put on, the second a tire goes off the track you are SOL. Do you enjoy restarting races 10+ because you made a single mistake?

												Best racing game ever, except for two things. The first one: the physics when a car is raised to the air in a crash is very unreal, looks like the car has an extreme gravity forze and goes down so quickly. Also when the car has half flips, it's like the floor of the track has obstacles or something making the car crashing with something invisible against the floor.The second one: This game may has the best crash simulation of racing games. but still looks bad in slow motion replay. It would be the perfect game if the developers includes a crash simulation like BeamNG Drive.			",12,2,8,1,1,0,1

												Great graphics, realistic car handling, a good sense of speed is where Project Cars gets it right. Unfortunately the AI leave a lot to be desired. What may be seen as banging doors on certain models, the same behavior doesn't work for open wheel. It is literally frustrating and atrocious that the AI don't even seem to acknowledge your existence and will run completely through you. At times when they do acknowledge you, they will ram directly into you, which in turn makes it no different than the average online experience. This is a shame because the handling, force feedback, physics and graphics are second to none. Race Room Racing Experience does a wonderful job with AI and Assetto Corsa to a lesser degree. Project Cars AI are just downright rude, blind and stupid. 3/5 -2 for bad AI in regards to open wheel models, which is what I like to race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I really like this game despite alot of bad reviews. I love cars and driving fast but kinda hate racing, so the fact that i dont have to win impossible races and give myself hypertension to unlock the cars. Instead every car and track is available, and the real challenge lies in learning each car and track inside and out. So progress is measured through you becoming a better driver, not getting faster cars etc. Now as I said i dont care for racing, Im more of a time trials guy, and since most complaints are about the ai and bugs with the races themselves, Ive had nothing but awesome experiences. I can understand people thinking it didnt live up to its hype, but thats kinda the point of hype. Is to sell you somethingm so dont be mad that youre a sheep consumer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A bit underwhelming so far. My main point of criticism is the car handling which is pretty much hit and miss. For example the Radical SR8-RX is nearly undrivable without driving aids and even then tends to spin out in slow turns at the slightest push on the throttle.  Also most of the options and settings are poorly explained, if at all. The ""digital manual"" is a joke and not helping at all when you want to know what some hard to comprehend menu settings are all about. Also I am not sure if the career mode will hold my interest for long with no incentive other then achievements. But this is more of sandbox racer and with that I am fine as long as the racing is thrilling. AI is very convincing already and can only get better with future updates. As for now, I can't really recommend a purchase and adivse to wait a few weeks until most of the problems have been fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game lacks the amount of content of a Forza or GT, but what is missing in content is made up for greatly with quality.  The game runs smooth as silk less the very rare momentary freeze.  If you have a wheel you will love this game.  Fanatec wheel feels great with this game.  Ive heard from friends that the controller support is at least as good as Forza.  For people who love racing games, this and Assetto Corsa are the best Steam has to offer.Specs:i5:3570k8gb ramGTX 760 4gb			",131,2,8,16,1,2,22

												THE OIL SLICK DRIVING SIMULATOR. Trying to drive a car in this game is unpredictable. It's like driving on super soft dragster tires and then suddenly having a set of cheap bald-to-the cords set of tires and the road being covered in PTFE and motor oil. I spent around 4.8 hours of playtime attempting to make it more playable to no avail. Setting everything to the EXTREME side of low sensitivity and such helped slightly but its like, again, driving on plastic toy car tires. I know how to drive and am no amateur with racing. This isn't realistic at all. Pertaining to the AI or what little I did play with AI, it seems fine.. I drove with rain on the track and its not much different from dry conditions. Graphically its nice, sounds are good (except for tunnel sounds, its a bit harsh), wearther effects are nice as well. Selection of cars are decent, but to get more requires DLC and there isn't many everyday road cars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredible. I am in awe with this developers ability to polish a turd into a brick of gold. I don't have much play time, but I'm more than aware of this game's stuttering start, and I fully expected it to crash and burn. I just started a career from the very bottom at go-kart level, and I'm just blown away thus far. The AI is strong and aggressive, the racing disciplines are many, and the graphics are just beautiful and I'm running at 80+ FPS near Ultra with a GTX 970. I hope to someday see visual customization of the cars themselves, and play a mode where you can start your own team to rise through the world of racing. Until then, this is THE premier PC racing sim, and is a game I've been seeking for a long time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who does real-life track racing, I can tell you the physics model is stupidly unrealistic. If you go into any corner as fast as you do in real-life, or even maybe just 30mph (in any in-game car) the tyres will suddenly, completely and unrecoverably break loose and you'll  just slide straight into the outside barrier no matter what you do. If driving was really that hard in real life no one would ever even complete a lap without an accident.			",38,16,1,2,8,1,1

												Slightly Mad has built a beautiful game. Truely mind blowing graphics, decent physics, good AI. Shame they failed to work on -> BASIC FUNCTIONALITY <-. Steering setup is extensive but numbing if the defaults don't work well for you and they probably won't. Driving with an XBox controller either doesn't work or is so twitchy as to be virtually unplayable. Slightly Mad has demonstrated themselves to be yet another developer who enjoys working on making their game look fancy before making their game actually work. It's a trend in the industry that needs to end.			",33,24,5,4,20,2,3

												I bought this game on a Humble Bundle for 7 bucks and is not even worth that money.Trying to make it work has been the most frustrating experience of my gaming life.Config problems:I have a DFGT and it would desconect every 30 minutes, first the pedals and after that the wheel itself.It won't remember the layout so every time I restart the game to make it work again, have to check them.It activated the braking help on its own once, spent 1 hour messing around trying to find why would the car stop accelerating on the middle of the main straight or when one car is side by side.Driving feeling:When the pcars gods decided I deserved 20 mins of straight playtime I found the driving mechanics sketchy at best. Even with all aids off It baby sits you to the point it won't let you brake and turn at the same time.Graphics and performance:	This is the only good thing this game has right. Good graphics and no stuttering or input lag. However one time I had a black screen at the start of the race followed by a crash.Content and menus: 	It has a decent amount of cars and tracks but the menus are packed and confusing.Creating your own server is easy once you know where is what.Beware tho as the server page lacks ordering servers by ping, cars or racetracks (are you serious)Final thoughts: 	Bought this game to play the career mode hoping to fill the lack of it on Assetto Corsa but is not worth the hassle.Can't believe after 2 years a game is so broken			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Patch 7.0 has completely broken the force feedback on my DFGT making it impossible to race competitively. Constant sawing motion going around any corner. Weird thing is that it seems to work fine offline. Devs, please fix your game! The game looks great, sounds great, handles..... on a controller it handles terribly still but it's better. But the main flaw with this game is playing online. It's purely unacceptable the way cars bounce around the track due to poor servers. I can't recommend this game anymore. It's beautiful, there is no doubt about that but the online experience is so flawed. Having contacted the company and having no response is also very unprofessional.

												Very recommended simracing game. If you're a fan of this genre you should get it for sure. I've played around 150 hours now (only here on Steam, but more through the off-Steam development phase) and I trully enjoy it, both offline and online (mostly in closed servers with friends).I've been a PC simracing fan for years (back from the Microprose and Papyrus days) and yes, this sim is not perfect. But the same can be said about any other simracing game out there (iRacing, rFactor 1 & 2, Asseto Corsa, Simbin/Sector3's titles, GPL, etc). The fact that is not perfect doesn't neglect all the good features this sim offers.The worst: the force feedback, which needs to be tweaked depending on your steering wheel model, etc. to feel good. Once you've done it is more than good enough though.The best: the immersion feeling. With those beautiful graphics, day/night and weather transtions and once you're used to the physics/FFB the racing experience is awesome.			",57,6,18,1,5,0,1

												Edit: It is apparently just my inability to squash the bug I have with this game. After many tries and walk throughs for solutions, that I am clearly not alone in needing, I have not been able to play past the first two events in my progress of this game. I am appending my original review, because I essentially repeated all of the mentioned solutions again, and attempted at least three new carrers before ultimately having them deleted as mentioned previously. After a mere ~40hrs 'in game' and denial of a return, I have come to the final option of uninstalling this game even without my refund.I have wanted to be positive about this game, but the struggle has become too much. Yes, the graphics are sweet, the management of the vehicle is super detailed as I'd like, and I was able to get good control with my Steam Controller. But the repeated crashes and loss of progress have now made selecting a between race menu option for fear of eminent crash/loss more stressful than the (possible) enjoyment of the game.Original review: I have tried playing this game multiple times. Multiple times meaning, after maybe a race or two it's crashed and erased my progress. I cannot get past the first event wthout a TOTAL loss of progress. To not have any form of game save back up is unacceptable in the era of gaming. Even after mangaing settings, reinstalling, browsing the discussion boards, verifying the installation, there is not a fix. Getting to the point of suggestions that mention removing steam overlay, which then makes using the Steam controller impossible. Again ruining the playablility of the game. Now that the game has become functionally unplayable, this game has become a waste of the money spent on it.			",25,9,5,6,19,0,17

												Holy snap I didn't expect it to be this good. Exceeds your expectations in every possible way.  The perfect videogame, period.Graphics - Just ridiculously good.  Never seen such high models in a car game before, it's the first game that actually sorta looks like the store page pictures in real-time.  Optimization - Right on the mark.  System is reasonably stressed for the options enabled, always room for improvement I didn't see my GPU pinning at 100% usage so hopefully later on we can squeeze a bit more FPS out of the game.Physics - Seems to be pretty well exactly as I would imagine.. a real car performing in a lot of those situations.  Very close to reality, obviously not, but it helps your judgement in driving when the car behaves as expected.Menu - Absolutely a gem, the whole interface of the game is incredibly well put together.  You never feel lost, everything is just a click away, it doesn't matter if you use a controller or the keyboard it is just as user-friendly whichever you chose to use at that moment (no switching back and forth via a setting).Stats - Probably the best you could expect, quite literally, it's a great screen to look at.  ""Career stats"" or I guess player profile information.  It breaks down for you the amount of hours spent in-game, spent racing, qualifying, etc and gives you very sexy presentation of the tiny pointless tidbits which we hope would be there.  And they are.still editing and adding to review ^^ expect 3-4 more paragraphs			",4125,1558,197,486,660,69,658

Posted: May 11, 2015
												So here’s my review of Project Cars. I had been massively looking forward to this and had originally missed out on early access with the community funding by literally a few days so I had to wait some significant time to get my hands on it, to say I was excited was an understatement. I’d already promised myself when the game arrived I’d be taking the Lotus 49 around Cadwell Park which is my local circuit in real life and also my spiritual home. This combination of car and track had big shoes to fill as I’d spent hundreds of hours with GPL years ago with these two. I’m adamant that game playing as a teenager (using a joystick!!) taught me to drive and if you can master this you can drive anything. The Lotus 49 will teach you all about weight transfer, coming off the brake pedal trail braking into corners, steering the car on the throttle and the importance of being smooth yet not hesitant and brave enough to occasionally bully the car. First impressions of the car were excellent and it was immediately obvious this car would demand your full attention and respect, high in the rev band on acceleration it would be prepared to bite you at any point. Initially on the base setup there was far too much understeer for my driving style. I have lots of real life track driving experience and my style requires a pointy front end and I’m happy to sort out the rear midcorder and steer on the throttle– the same applies to games for me. The Lotus 49 was responsive to car adjustments and behaved in the correct way when decreasing the front tyre pressures and softening the front antiroll bar. I’m looking forward to spending much more time with this car and setting it up to my tastes accordingly. It took me right back to GPL and the fun of it all – the car is as I imagine it to be in real life. So that’s a big thumbs up for the car now moving onto the representation of Cadwell Park itself, it is a track I know very well in real life. I’d completed a track day there literally a week beforehand so I’d say I’m in a good position to comment on the accuracy of the layout and also had my video footage of the trackday to compare it to. The track is almost spot on and gets the “feel” and atmosphere of the place which to me is the most important factor. If I am to nit pick however there are three minor changes I’d like to see made with the representation of the track; these are the bump coming out of barn onto the main straight. This bump is not there in real life and it’s much more of a gradual compression. The second is coppice has more positive camber in real life and you can really throw the car into there and finally again at Coppice there is a bump which upsets the car in Project Cars which is just not there in real life. Everything else is absolutely spot on which is an amazing achievement and as previously mentioned it just feels right, The Mountain and Hall Bends is absolutely spot on. So after a bit more driving I decided to take to the track online. I was certainly not disappointed. The most fun filled race I had was at Oulton Park in its various layouts with the Radical SR3. The host had a set a clear day with a shower 2/3 rd’s way through the race’s returning to dry. There were five of us all lapping within a second of each other and after a spin on the first lap and having to make up time I passed all the remaining field I had to settle for second nose to tail behind the leader. It was great stuff and very rewarding. If this is what online racing is like which I haven’t really attempted since GPL and a few dabbles in the original rfactor which just didn’t do it for me I’m hooked. The standard of driving was high and clean and I can see this fast becoming addictive. The radical SR3 is a beast and as I’d imagine however it to be pretty much however it seems just a little too easy to stomp on the throttle and get away with it. However I can confirm that the amount of grip in the wet on slicks is accurate. I have driven Oulton Park in real life on radial slicks on a cold changeable wet Novembers day and there is a surprising amount of grip to be had from them – this is also true in Project Cars and they are just as progressive as the real thing if common sense is used -  a true testament to Project Cars tyre model and the work they’ve done on it. Finally I tried the Formula Junior at Oulton Park. I like the rewarding experience of having to heal and toe and just the nature of that type of car. The one thing I picked up from this was that you could mash the throttle pedal and literally not have the rear step out or spin up. I know this not to be true in real life having driven formula fords and it seems to be a trend amongst the cars I’ve driven so far in Project Cars that it’s just too easy to accelerate out of corners with steering angle still applied and completely get away with it. Now I’m not saying I want to have the problem which I’ve found with other driving games that you have the rear step out in an uncatchable manner leading to a spin but if Project Cars could nail the progressive catchable back end stepping out it’d have it all. It’s pretty dam close already and I’ve only scratched the surface and being very particular here. Overall I’m massively impressed with my few short hours on Project Cars. It’s the game I’d hoped for. Whilst some may think it’s arcade like I disagree. Even if it there was truth to that the bonus of being able to lap consistently without incident and have massively entertaining races outweighs any feeling of this. I’d prefer that something is predictable/progressive and not like certain “sims” which just don’t feel right to me and are all too eager to bite for no obvious reason leaving me feeling that it’s sterile and frustrating as I know certain characteristics simply not to be true. Cars are progressive things and those I’ve driven in anger in real life FF1600 & 2ltr Van Diemen Multisport are more similar to project cars than anything I’ve ever played. A true testament to the good job done. Nit picking again a few minor things/tweaks I’d like to see are:Cars seem to loose kinetic energy quickly on the grass if you go off. Cars just don’t lose their inertia at speed on grass like that.The mashable throttle on certain cars – just needs to be slightly more challenging yet not ready to completely bite. It needs to remain driveable as computers are lacking the seat of your pants feeling in real life so a compromise is required.I’d like to see a much better way of saving car setups. It seems I can only save one setup per car per track unless I’m doing something completely wrong. What am I to do if I want to save a wet setup etc or A/B certain setups?FFB not there but already there are user setups for wheels in the community. I’m using a G25 and I’ll have a look into tweaking this. With the scope available I’ve no doubt I’ll get there. I think everyone has their personal preference with this and own ideas on what feels right.My overall verdict is 9.5/10 I’m sure SMS will be working hard to fix various bugs reported so I’ll look forward to seeing these. I can see this being a great game for years to come and be thoroughly enjoyable and it’s already a classic as far as I’m concerned. It’s the game I’d been waiting for and I am literally blown away by it all having avoided racing game in recent years waiting for this. If SMS are taking requests I’d like to see Croft & Mallory Park make an appearance at some point!			",3,0,5,0,2,0,0

												- No progression- Can't own any cars- Very little personalization- Horrible controller controlsIf you enjoy doing nothing but racing then this is the game for you.If you actually want some content then unfortunately you're going to have to buy a PS3 or Xbox One to play Gran Turismo or Forza Motorsport/Horizon. Once again PC gaming will still go on with boring racing games.			",191,22,9,18,13,4,15

												Installed this game a few days ago and it has been a blast so far. There is a good selection of different classes of cars and they are all fun to test out without having to unlock anything. The AI cars in solo or career races are the best I have ever seen with realistic reactions to your driving behaviour and can have their skill dialed up or down to suit your own skill level.Had my first online attempts last night and everything ran smoothly. Even hosted a couple of quick races and although I'm still way off the pace of most racers I still enjoyed the lag free experience of some close jostling for positions.I only have a medium spec pc and the visuals are nothing short of amazing with plenty of choices of views. I love the helmet view with its depth of field properties to really add some atmosphere to your races.Couldn't recomend this more if your into LSF or iRacing or any of the more sim rather than arcade franchises.

												After spending too many hours on Assetto Corsa trying to shave milliseconds of my laptime just because it was fun I came here expecting I'd get somewhat of the same experience in a game that offers quite a bit more variety. I was hugely disappointed. Mostly because the lack of fun and challenge compared to driving in the actual simulation game mentioned above.And what comes to variety? The cars feel too generic. Jumping from everyday roadcar into a full blown monster is more meh than anything else (again, comparing to Assetto Corsa, where the♥♥♥♥♥clenching is real). The career does not offer much in terms of achieving anything, as it gives you the opportunity to go race in any league/serie you want from the very beginning. Then you just grind onwards and it's meh.So, if you're a fan of awesome simulator games, move on.And if you're looking for awesome arcade game, move on..meh/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love driving games, but for something realistic I have been confined to Gran Turismo, so now there is finally a damn good driving game for PC. Project Cars has full support for my Logitech G27 wheel, loading a decent starter button configuration, which only needed a little tweaking to add buttons for TC, ABS, SC, etc. The AI is superb, offering a 0-100 slider to fine tune the ideal difficulty, resulting in a challenging but still fun Career mode. The Community Events are a great addition, seemingly inspired by the Gran Turismo online events. Haven't had a chance to play a full online multiplayer race yet, I've been too busy working through the Clio Cup! I would also recommend looking at DashMeterPro for Android, provides a really good HUD integrated seamlessly into the game, leaving the game screen free from any kind of HUD.			",108,24,10,9,24,2,13

												so after playing assetto corsa for a while, i decided to try project cars again and see if it's physics were as realistic as assetto corsa's are.they are not.they. are. not.in project cars, even if you are driving a very powerful rear wheel drive vehicle with ALL assists off, mashing the throttle in corners and putting full steering lock on, while it should be making the back end swing out into a nice powerslide that you can then control with throttle input. it does not. instead, it grips more. IT GRIPS MORE!!!!!!!!! WHAT????that should be enough. dont buy this game. dont play this game. buy and play assetto corsa. AC needs a bit more polish but if you are looking for a true to life car driving experience assetto corsa is it.project cars is for fools distracted by pretty graphics.PS: the sounds in Pcars are GARBAGE too. its in DOLBY, so theyre not real at all.

												If you're into racing, or cars in general, you need to buy this game: > Best graphics in a racing game to date.> Excellent sound (especially with a good set of headphones)> Dynamic weather & time of day add spice to the longer races.> Authentic racing experience> Good multiplayer support & stability> Career mode is excellent and engagingHopefully they'll add a wider range of road cars (a Ferrari or two would be nice). I can't see these avaialble to buy as DLC anywhere, so I expect they'll be in the works, and more F1 circuits wouldn't go a miss. Highly recommended.			",94,22,3,13,12,0,17

												This has the making of a great racing game. However its missing tons of auto manufacturers that should be standard for an auto related game in 2015. I'd give up 80% of the current vehicles in the game for a Ferrari, Lambo, Vett or Jag. The driving mechanics are damn good,  I will say that!   Im only in the game a few hours and mostly doing solo races and having lots of fun.  I really wish it had, Deep customization and personalization that would keep me playing for hours on end off the track.. I use NFS Shift as a great example of the this. The racing in that game wasn't the best but the customizing and personalizing of your vehicles was top notch. I dont think alot of people really understood or had the patiance to fully take advantage of its features in the car appearance editor.  I spent hours and hours doing this, making fantastic looking cars. Then jump into a multi palyer match and show it off.  And it was all in the game, you didnt have to use photo shop or some other complex pay software. Watch a replay of a race and see how long it takes for you to pick out the car your driving when your in the pack.  I understand this is considered a ""Sim"" but a little customizing and personalizing would really set it apart from the others. I dont care about adding turbos and bigger brakes and stuff like that.  I'll go play a PS1 or Dreamcast for that. As is the game is fun and looks great.   ",20,2,7,0,4,0,0

												Unfortunately unable to value the full potential of the game, due to bugs. Therefore cannot recommend game for everyone as I do not consider this game as stable enough.Pros: - Music- Career- Lots of tracks/carsCons:- Very CPU intensive (I had i3 3225, it was bad). More than Assetto Corsa or Grand Theft Auto 5 :-/ Why?- Buggy: slow motion bug, almost cannot play. I upgraded to i5 3570K and GTX 970 OC result not improved much, having 60+FPS I do expect same bug. No feeling of smoothness.Medium graphic settings on my previous GTX 650 Ti does not looked so incredible, Assetto Corsa looked better. I upgraded to GTX 970 OC graphics look good, but slowmotion bug still appears from time to time.They should have made Early Access before final release as Kunos did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jacko Rating9/10 At last a driving game for the PC gamers in the spirit of GT and Forza.  If you like proper racing on circuts and tracks, setting fastest laps to beat your mates, tuning your car to perfection and prefer a simulation to an arcade racer then this is your game.Project Cars is a foundation for a franchise and will definately become so in the coming years.  It is a brilliant car racing simulator (toned down from the real sims), the physics and feel of the driving is very slick and somewhat realistic.  The graphics and options that go along with it are superb and very PC friendly, the Audio and car/egine sounds are good but not better than the visuals but the big winner here is the way the car feels on the road.  Not since Forza have i had such a great feel for the road, combining this with various camera views to drive from and you have your self a very good racing game indeed.With a career mode and online races to compete in you have your choice of where you want to race and who you would like to race, no silly drift rubbish or other non racing events that make you cringe when having to actually play them in spite of you buying a racing game, this is a real racers game for racers who like to master a car on different tracks and are racing or car enthusiasts already.To say that this is a great racing game that is true to the real world tracks and cars is a gross understatement and I am truely happy to see a game like this come out.  It had to be publicly funded of course as the big players in the game industry are more devoted to releasing rubbish that doesn't even work properly than selling a properly tested product, 2014 is clear evidence of this.All in all the best racer I have played on PC and a good match for GT on the PS4 and Forza on the Xboxone.Brilliant!!

												Sorry, but I really cannot bring myself to enjoy the game... It's already boring with 10 hours of gameplay, and I'm even going to argue, the road car selection is horrid, It needs to be more extensive. The pros I guess, first person in the rain looks absolutely stunning but the third person driving physics are disgusting, It's all wonky and arcade. I feel like the devs could do some drastic changes, before they ask for DLCs. I love the concept but, honestly 5 years of production is quite hard to believe, and the graphics aren't exactly matching the previews I was obssesed with...If theres no drastic changes soon, I would do anything for a refund, I'll update my review later, but at the moment, this game is on the edge, lots of steering wheel players complaining about handling and movement although I use a controller and on most cars it feels great.Pros:-Decent graphics-Sound on some cars is alright-Racing custimization is really deep-If you like rFactor, you'll like this-Fabulous rain driving experience-AI is better than most games-Decent smooth 60 FPS on GTX 970 Superclocked Maxed outCons:-Career mode is so bland-Car selection sucks (Sorry but it's true, theres barely ANY Japanese cars)-Some cars handle like its in Alpha development -Future DLCs that will spam the users-Road cars are really squishy with horrible braking.-Theres not really any skid sounds-Really overhyped damage, the damage SUCKS!-Pit crew? You mean the guy standing there with a sign?Sorry, I can't recomend this $69 game to anyone who loves sim racing like I do, I'm just providing constructive criticism, I hope all changes and Project Cars truly overcomes it's barriers and becomes one of the best racing games out on the market.

												UPDATE! I've been told that it is possible to map a button to the ""reset view"" option. But it is not located in the VR menu as I expected. Rather it is in the controls menu somewhere. I haven't tested this myself, but thought I would update my review.--------------Bought this game for VR, and even though it is the best racing sim I've tried in VR, it is just too rough on the edges for me to recommend. ""Gaze to select"" can't be disabled, and if you edit the xml files to disable it yourself, you can sometimes end up not being able to exit a race because the reticle is needed to make the controller selection reach the ""continue"" selection.Graphics are pretty disappointing in the game overall. Cars look stunning, but the tracks are low-poly and with smudged textures. Plenty of z-mapping problems going on in many places aswell. The scenic routes are basically a nice road with some rough estimation of the terrain beside it. Several rocks sortof just lie halfway into the ground with the edge being really visible due to how they are placed one after the other. Just looks rough overall.Car handling seems a bit weird to me. Car starts sliding really easily, but perhaps I am too used to arcade handling, so I'll let that be a neutral point.Overall Project CARS, as a VR game, disappoints me for the roughness of it all.

												There is a lot to like about this game.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend it unless and until they actually finish the game.  For me, Steam's new refund policy came at the perfect time, as PCars was the first game I bought after it was announced, and is the first game I've wanted to refund.I'm not going to list the bugs I encountered, as that would take too long, and other reviews do enough there.  I'll just say that I finally initiated the refund process after the AI put me into the wall during a rolling start.			",81,12,3,3,12,1,24

												The thing that I would like to start off with is that I havent played this game that much. This was my first real racing sim that I bought. I was very hyped and I really thought that I would love it. Now I didn't, because I was too overhyped and I do not like the game. I don't like it, because I was overhyped, the sounds of the cars sounded like they were recorded with a cellphone. I personally do not recommend it, but if you're a hardcore racing fan, and the game is for sale, go for it.			",23,1,4,2,5,0,1

												First up, I was an early backer of the game but pulled out (and used the money to buy Game Stock Car).First impressions were not good - I watched one video on you tube and the cars seemed a bit 'floaty' - as if they had no mass and were tip-toeing around the track. Plus, being old fashioned I bought the physical copy of the game - and noted that a game-pad is recommended - no mention of a wheel anywhere on the box.First couple of races not good - again found the cars a bit floaty, although turning up the shadow detail has helped this.Now played for 3 hours, and while racing is ok there are some issues which ruin the immersion for me:1. Qualifying - like Codemasters games, it ends qualifying as soon as time runs out - you cannot complete the lap you are on. 2. When leaving the pits the exit lights are always at red.3. When entering pits you drive straight through any a.i. cars in your wayThe game has been in development for years but it just doesn't feel like it.Bottom line is I will probably persevere for a bit, but a definite disappointment.

												Hello there! The game is pretty good with stunning graphics!It has loads of settings,many many cars and also a wide variety of tracks to race on!The game also futures a very in-depth car tuning system which i found a bit confusing (I am a newbie) but i managed to get away with some simple car tuning!The car handling is very good as well!It's a great racing game but there are two things that are a bit on the downside.First of all,when you crash your car, the damage is a bit akward cause after the crash the car is like a creased tin can with a wheel or two getting off! My point is that the game feels and it is indeed very realistic except the car collision/damage in my opinion.And finally the second one is that it may not support older steering wheels (I have a Thrustmaster Ferrari GT Experience and i had some issues with that,but it might have been my fault i'm not so sure about that.) ,mine is not in the supported steering wheel list,which you can find on the official game site,but it works,with some problems at the beggining but afterall it works and thats fine by me. :PAll in all, this is a great game to sink some hours,especially if you like car/racing games!It has beautiful graphics and it feels very real!And it has a plethora of cars and tracks! From karts to hypercars and f1 cars! And from kart tracks to f1 racing tracks and many many more!			",82,4,3,4,7,1,7

												This is a pretty good racing game. It may even be one of the greatest sim's available to console players. However, I think it's a pretty bad PC sim. I play iracing, rfactor2, GSCE, and assetto corsa. In my opinion, all of them feel better to drive and have more realistic physics. PCars has good variety of tracks and cars but none of them feel particularly great. Just my opinion, but I strongly suggest you look at GSCE or AC unless you really want a structured (yet bland) career mode.			",149,21,18,12,38,1,26

												Very fun racing game, especially for those who want something on the lighter side, but can eventually tweak the settings to the more advance side. Graphics are decent on the highest possible settings, though nothing too spectacular from what I've seen in other racing games. It works though. especially the car details, and weather effects. However, the game can use some serious optimization, as there are some strange frame drops at many points in the game.As the more important question that I cannot answer fully: is the car handling any good? Because I use a game-pad, it can feel rather good at times, and the other not very good. It's very tricky, and you have to be precise about your driving and not go nacho libre on it, which is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you don't want to try. Games like Grand Turismo, or Asserto Corsa shouldn't be used to compare to this, because in the end, all of these games have their own ways of enlightening the players. This brings me to the online component: it is... err, decent, if you can handle some of the worst drivers ever, who think 100% of the time the game is just a pinche demolition derby. You'll be dodging and worrying about colliding with them more than being focused, which is why I recommend to stay away from it for a while. Te van a mandar a la jodida. This isn't DiRT, Burnout, ect. It is a track-based racing simulator, and if you are looking for all that demolition fun and crazy game-modes, look elsewhere. Please, for the love of god, drive properly, don't be a pinche jodido.In place of the online players, the AI is horrible, and I mean horrible. They are not only aggressive as hell, but you probably will have a hard time battling against them. They'll ram you, block you, and try their best to demoralize you. Sounds a lot like the online players, except these guys keep going instead. At times, they may glitch out and clutter up in a corner of a racing track. I say it needs a ton of improvement.Anyways, I definitely recommend this game if you are into racing sims, or just want to get a feel of the tracks, with some decent car variations, and track variations. I will probably give this a more update if and when I obtain a racing wheel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say it is NOT only AMD users that have issues with this game, been waiting for them to update it so I can play it. I am running a 3.2 GHZ i5 with 8GB RAM and NVidia 760 GB you would imagine I should be able to run it fairly easily, like most of the games I own which have very little issues. Alas no, the game just sits using 100% CPU constantly and no game should be able to do that in my opinion.Personally I think there is some bad coding here somewhere as the game looks fantastic, but just doesn't perform, there is absolutely no reason why it should sit using that much CPU power and I would personnally recommend most people should avoid this game until it is fixed with some updates and starts working properly.All my other games I can not only run maxed out and reasonably FPS, but I can also STREAM or RECORD for YouTube at the same time, this game won't even run with no background tasks....10/10 for effort, but 2/10 for quality. :-(			",43,6,11,5,54,0,19

												Developer has focused on quantity rather than quality - a lot of nice features like dynamic weather, day-night cycle, great rain effects and (compared to other sims like iracing or AC) a large amount of cars. However, i cannot recommend it to those who are looking for a real racing simulator. AI is way to dumb and agressive. FFB offers thousands of different paramter combinations to adjust but it still lacks an authentic feeling (at least with my T500). Despite all that the lead developer seems to be quit arrogant and rough in the way he deals with his customers (e.g. banning people from the forum who criticize the product [in a constructive manner]). Go for AC if you are looking for a solid simulator with a great ffb and relativly smart AI (after the 1.2 update). Join Iracing when seeking for the ultimate MP experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not get this game if you have a controller!!!I'm someone who enjoys racing games on all platforms, I play on system ranging from a Assetto Corsa with a Thrustmaster t500 + Oculus down to Xbox sims Like Forza, I also go-kart, a lot...This is the SINGLE MOST FRUSTRATING racing game i've ever tried to play with a controller. In these games I want to be able to put my car to the limit, drive in horrific conditions and still feel like the car is reacting the way I want. The problem I have is not with the physics but with the input! Games such as Forza and GT have a sort of AI controller assist which helps with things like oversteer and tiny corrections; this is because its impossible to be as accurate when using a controller over a wheel. This system helps keep the car stable. Project cars however seems to just have a bunch of rubber bands round the steering and a driver that turns the wheel like he's on crack cocaine. Meaning, you oversteer in a Ginetta Junior and you either countersteer into an unrecoverable tank slapper or (with other settings) sit with the gas off in full slide waiting for the idiot steering angle to get just a little bit bigger (which it never does). The end result is: the controls destroy the fun, race after race as you spin into the grass, you just get to pick whether you prefer the inside or the outside of the track.You guys were so close to making this awesome! I cannot imagine how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people will be if they got this for xbox or ps4. I guess i need to get a seriously good wheel and test that... Jeez, this is a £500 game...			",8,0,5,1,0,0,0

												Do not get this game if you have a controller!!!I'm someone who enjoys racing games on all platforms, I play on system ranging from a Assetto Corsa with a Thrustmaster t500 + Oculus down to Xbox sims Like Forza, I also go-kart, a lot...This is the SINGLE MOST FRUSTRATING racing game i've ever tried to play with a controller. In these games I want to be able to put my car to the limit, drive in horrific conditions and still feel like the car is reacting the way I want. The problem I have is not with the physics but with the input! Games such as Forza and GT have a sort of AI controller assist which helps with things like oversteer and tiny corrections; this is because its impossible to be as accurate when using a controller over a wheel. This system helps keep the car stable. Project cars however seems to just have a bunch of rubber bands round the steering and a driver that turns the wheel like he's on crack cocaine. Meaning, you oversteer in a Ginetta Junior and you either countersteer into an unrecoverable tank slapper or (with other settings) sit with the gas off in full slide waiting for the idiot steering angle to get just a little bit bigger (which it never does). The end result is: the controls destroy the fun, race after race as you spin into the grass, you just get to pick whether you prefer the inside or the outside of the track.You guys were so close to making this awesome! I cannot imagine how♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people will be if they got this for xbox or ps4. I guess i need to get a seriously good wheel and test that... Jeez, this is a £500 game...			",8,0,5,1,0,0,0

												+ Nice graphics.+ Nice physics, it feels quite realistic.- Awful camera work.- The number of cars is a complete joke. I know this game's focus is on the actual driving rather than collecting cars etc but still, there are just too few cars in such a big game like this!All in all still quite a nice game.7/10			",200,67,21,52,30,3,56

												Im sure this is a great game, but after a whole night of trying to get my controls to work, and my TrackIR to work, no luck. I would not have refunded this game, had I were able to get it to work with Xbox controller and TrackIR. The game sounds great, the reviews are pleasing enough... My review is personal and based on forum search and myself trying to get the contgroller and TrackIR to work. I think in a game that is supposed to be immersive, the design has to be as such, where the gamer would interact with it and not have to even think about controls. This game, at start (where I have been up until I refunded it), crushes the life out of wanting to play this game. 3/10 because the game is impossible to get started. I have many other games to play, which had allowed my to stave off the frustration of losing a whole night, trying to get this game to work. Im sure the Devs are awesome... But, this game killed my buzz.			",62,2,2,2,8,1,0

												so i have spent a great deal of time with this game so far and its honestly amazing, from the graphics to the cars themselves. im only running this game with a gtx 760 2gb and it runs very well with optimized settings through geforce experience. from what i can tell its basically high settings. i cant recommend this game enough. the track detail is very high and look amazing whenever the rain poors down or the sun is shining, its not dissapointing to look at.the cars handle very well (even when using the ps3 controller). the sounds of the cars from what i can tell is very nearly spot on, each car sounds very different to the last. the damage system seems very good and you can literally destroy your cars it seems.this is without a doubt worth a buy for racing fans xD10/10			",29,6,1,4,0,0,1

												To start with its the first racing game I have found where i have been able to use it with my gtx970 in 2 screen surround (I can't physically get a 3rd screen in) as you can change the camera view in the car to get the whole dash in with the one screen being the main view and on 2x1080p screens it looks amazing. I brought a second hand g25 wheel for this and it was found straight away and had a preset configuration which allowed me to get straight on with having a drive and it played great and the force feedback was superb except after 2 hours i was knackered. I also tried a xbox 360 over in home streaming to the lounge tv and it was easily playable as well and looked great on a large screen.I haven't been online yet as I'm in need of a lot of practice before i can trust myself not to crash into everyone. I did however try a few vehicles out round laguna seca and really enjoyed the variety of how each feels, the caterham with a back end that likes to race the front around the corners, the renault clio that felt like my road car to drive at normal speeds and then understeered like a cow when i pushed to hard, and a supercar which i burried in a barrier so hard the wheels fell off. It was fantastic. I then tried a 5 lap  race against 19 AI cars and although i came 18th it was great fun.I will add more to this as i go but would defintely recommend even with the small amount i've played with so far.

												If anythign the Sounds are superb alongside with the Graphics. This is a first trully great looking next gen game. Physics and movement/reaction of cars to the surface/movement is very nicely done. Each car feels different and that alone creates a long learning curve. Online options are very nice (weather,conditions,public/private sessions,etc..its all there), you can host your own games (fill in with AI's if needed) and invite your friends to play with. Of course it lacks features like racing teams, but who cares as long you play with friends it should not matter that much. The community is overall very polite and do not have many crashing players like in other racing games. Helmet camera also adds to the immersion if you looking for this kind of ""simulation"". I tested the game with a logitech DFGT and the FFB effects are very nicely done I must say. The game is also perfectly playable with a gamepad or even keyboard which is surprising. You can tweak the assissts to suit your style or level of realism. If you looking for a grindfest aka Grand Turismo or Forza, this game is not for you. Here you do not unlock upgrades, you do not earn money or have a feel for progress. Instead you are given everything since the begining and you can consider this a racing sim sandbox. Comparing with Assetto Corsa it is up to the taste I believe since both sport great FFB,physics and graphics. The content is better in PCARS, noone can argue with this. In short if you fancy racing sims this is a game to get! In fact it is the only game to have atm until Assetto Corsa offers something more.			",230,23,13,23,14,2,27

Handling and physics are pretty much spot on with loads of customization available to suit your preference. Worth the money so if you have a good wheel setup get it!(First review so sorry if it isn't any good haha) just think the game needs praise because this is up there with Forza H2 on the Xbox One for me!

After so many delayed release dates I did not think this day would ever come but it is here and with the prior release of AC, I really didn't think that PCars would be all it was hyped up to be but by God..... it's here ........and  with vengeance!    Options? Well there are a s hit load of them for whatever you could possibly want according to your hardware specs, and PCars brings a breath of fresh air to the old XP term of Plug and Play for peripherals because they have thought of everything! Logitech G25 was detected and works flawlessly.TrackIR, (Ok, took me a Google search to find out that it works in Head Cam only) works flawlessly.PCars Dashboard App..........( Andriod/Apple OS ) works flawlesslyI have not tried multiplayer as such although I can imagine public lobbies to be more like bumper cars but there is a option to create your own lobby and play with friendsConclusion: If you want to buy a racing game this year.....Project Cars is the way to go.

												Let me start by saying that I was SO excited for this game. After playing for just a few minutes, the main thing I noticed was the sound design. It is so terrible that it completely ruins the game for me. To be fair, being a sound engineer and musician probably makes me a little more critical than the next person, but this is truly awful sound design. The engines don't sound right at all. They clearly sound like several samples being used that use pitch bending between said samples. If done right, it can sound great, but this is just not up to par in terms of professional sound quality. Every racing game or car centric game I've played that uses FMOD tends to sound this way, so to be fair that's probably a factor. Every game that I've played that utilized wWise middleware sounds so much cleaner. If you have Dirt Rally or even just Dirt 3, listen to the revs in that compared to this. Night and day. Also in terms of sound, certain sfx like hitting a guardrail on highway one sound way too loud, and then stay at the same volume until you slow to practically a halt. You could even still be moving, grinding against the guardrail and the sound would be gone. If you accelerate along the guardrail again, the sound is still stopped, which tells me that it's more an issue with implementation. The visuals are great, and I can run at almost max settings with my GTX 770, but the lighting doesn't really do it for me. The physics are just okay, but the car is WAY too stable in a straight line. All in all, this game feels unfinished. The sound design is its most obvious flaw, and I think to really make a top notch product, they need to step it up in that area.			",179,66,17,20,26,0,29

Posted: January 23, 2016
												Throughly enjoying this game. I really couldnt care less what anyone else has to say about forums and the attitude of developers, that was not why i bought this game. I bought it to race cars around a track and have fun doing so and that I am. Graphically its really nice, tracks are really well mapped, physics are crazy good :) Game is awesome.Over the years i have played many, many, many racing games dating back to the late 80's to present day so i would like to think i know a little about them when it comes to reviews, but i wont go all technical ill just say this is one of the best i have played, although its not perfect and i do have some issues with it, i wont let that put me off what i beleive is a very good racing sim.The downsides i have to this game are the penalties for cutting the track even if you are rammed onto the grass by A.I. and dont even cut the track at all you get penalised and lap times become invalid, do this more than once and you get kicked from the race, this is annoying especially when its not intentional, sometimes just touching 2 wheels on the grass at the edge of the track will result in a caution and lap time being invalid, slightly annoying and frustrating. The second issue i have is, I dont own a £250+ steering wheel which this game would benefit from having, I use a xbox 360 controller which works fine but needs some tweaking to really get it working nicely thankfully the game has a awesome options menu allowing you to tweak everything pretty much so it was no biggy, plus today i tried it with a xbox one controller and that worked so much better amazingly so i will be buying a XBONE controller very soon. The only other issue i have is the fact its called project cars yet there is a distinct lack of cars, they are all variants of the same car so you'll have 3-4 mclaren p1 cars stock, slightly modded, touring, and some other suped up beast, but still the same car pretty much, this can be said for many of the vehicles. Yeah you get about 50 cars and some in the dlc but its not a lot for a game called Project Cars. Oh i nearly forgot to mention the A.I. has no consideration for you on the track at all, you can be as cautious and professional as possible when racing against them but they will slam into you, force you off the track and be down right♥♥♥♥♥♥♥no matter the difficulty setting you put them on, this is not a major issue but it just reminds me of the forza games with overly aggressive A.I. which wouldnt be like that in real life due to being disqualified etc if you forced someone off the track.  So apart from the few issues i had with the game i will still recommend this to anyone who wants a challenging realistic racing sim that looks nice and has some great cars (although not many) and tracks, with a insane amount of customisation and a fantastic interface that i found very easy to use and quite deep. I rate this game 8/10 near perfect but has issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thought I had found my answer to Forza on PC, the physics feel like rocket league's moon grav modifier, the car choice is absolutely laughable, could not find settings for my wheel or joypad that made the game pheasibly playable before my refund time limit ran out, AI is on rails and it doesn't matter what you do it will feel like your trying to navigate a white van down a one way street whilst the AI is playing go karts on an airfield. Rubbish game no matter WHAT you do to tweak it. Just glad I wasted money on this whilst it was in the sale and hope my refund gets accepted.			",54,5,2,4,5,1,3

												This is the WORST sim car I've ever play, and I have many of them!!!!! (and many steering wheels)I spected a Lot of this game and I'm very Cons:Very complex to undersand the software, not the gameplaySmall list of cars, and no exotics like lambo or ferrariYou cant completely tune your car, and AFTER A LOT OF TIME OF WORKING ON IT YOU REALIZE THE CHANGES WERE NOT SAVED (VERY FRUSTRAITING)Small list of tracksImposible to show the HUD in the cockpit cameraYou don't have a pilot profile to choose helmet or accesoriesThe graphics are good but not so good as spected for the Nvidia GraphicsI HARD RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY IT, IS A COMPLETELY WASTE OF MONEY!!!WHY IS SO HARD TO FIND A GOOD SIM CAR ON PC?

												Project CARS is a brilliant achievement combining a sublime mix of simulation and excitement. The cars are engaging to drive and the AI are actually doing more than just following an invisible line on the race track.The lighting is probably the most impressive thing about the graphics engine which puts every other racer I've seen to shame.I love the Forza series, enjoy the driving in Gran Turismo (hate the menus and lack of 'game') and enjoyed GP1,2,3 & 4 back in the day. Assetto Corsa is okay, but I find it a bit too 'dry' an experience for my tastes.To my mind, this is currently the pinnacle of the genre.I have only played with a wheel and would recommend one to get the most of out this.Having seen how far the developers have come since the start of this year (I'm an early backer) is amazing. The passion this team has for their game is easy to see.Sure the are some bugs and some hardware configurations don't cope that well at this point (AMD graphics cards in particular) but if you had seen the state that the game was in early 2015 you would have to feel confident that there will actually be a series of patches to fix them. Codemaster's F1 series this isn't.			",24,1,8,1,3,0,0

												Birthday gifted from Asif.Cheers fella.Did not expect this to run so well on my modest machine.(A10-7850k/R9-280)AA off.runs like buttery butter on quality crumpets.Almost everything maxed.I stayed well away reading online low fps horror stories.Wrong;green hell ten cars,stayed above 60fps all the time.Light rain can also be swiutched on with my spec.Assetto Corsa would have been no more than 45 fps with same settings,admittedly the physics and ffb in ac are big number crunchers.A great racing game,The sound and visuals are toe curling great.FFB needs improving;i've done seventy hours with Assetto corsa,so i reckon its a fair comment.Where are ferrari,lambo,Nissan,R32,34,35 ???Choice of cars is good;i expected much more cars,and yes i bought a couple of dlc packs.More cars as dlc or free please.How about xj220 v EB110 SS ?Track choice is top draw quality.Amazing choice almost blinking perfect.Excuse me ,i'm off racing.

												If you are into sim racing games this game is amazing. it looks great, the cars are amazing and drive fantastically and the tracks are a plenty!  There are a few niggles, especially with the online in that most people just crash into you as they have no idea how to race properly although if you manage to qualify at the front it definitely softens that.  there is no matchmaking although they are bringing that in with PC 2 and that is something personally i think would be great. ultimately an amazing game tho. all about the driving which is just quality although the game could use a tiny bit of polish.my brain says 8/10my heart says 9/10			",49,1,1,5,6,1,2

But all in all one of the best racing sims with enough settings to tweak it to a ""normal*"" racer, since long.The plenty of options during setup of car and setup of track is TOP NOTCH and sets the standard for ALL racing games out there!*normal: e.g. help stability control etc, etc..

												If you're a racing game fan then this game is for you. It's not Need For Speed where you can just throw cars into corners and crash into walls to win, it's a simulation game where you have to use all your knowledge about driving to win. There are minor bugs, which I'm sure all the negative comments complain about, but there's nothing which is game breaking. There are times you'll lose to something wrong with the game, but it's not very often - So much that it's never happened to me.The driving physics especially on a wheel are just amazing. Although career mode isn't what I had hoped, it's not bad in the slightest. Put it on 100% difficulty and after 2.0 patch, the AI are ridiculously good and depending on how much practice you put in it will feel like you're racing online. Pre 2.0 patch the AI were slightly too aggressive, but now they're basically perfect, not too aggressive but not too passive. Online is where it's at though, find yourself a league and you will be loving it. Even in random lobbies you will find people who want to race fairly, although as with every racing game, there are some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who hit you off in every corner because they don't get enough attention at home from their goldfish or whatever. GT3 are the main cars online, but thats definitely my specialty so I don't really mind! SMS are going to still be developing more on this for the next two years, so it's not just going to die down any second now. It may not be iRacing (I've never played that, so I can't compare) but it's definitely the best racing game out there which you don't have to pay a subscription fee. PS. If you're not a racing game fan, this is not a game to start at.			",46,10,27,6,11,1,16

												This is the Racing game i've been waiting for all my life. Forget Gran Turismo and Forza, this surpasses them both by miles. The graphics are sublime with a level of photo realism I've never seen before in a racing game. But foremost is the handling model, with my Logitech GT Driving Force Wheel it's feels so right with an amazing feeling of weight to the cars and very precise control. The Force Feedback is another joy, i never realised my steering Wheel was that good but it's uncanny how you can tell how the car will behave just by the Force Feedback, the bumps on the road and the loss of grip. Brilliant.I can't recommend this game highly enough. it was worth the wait.			",23,0,11,3,4,0,0

												THIS GAME IS AMAZING! I am not.  I am not hardcore enough for this game!   I thought by purchasing this game, that I would finally be graduating from Gran Tur Forza into the true sims like the F1 series.  I was SO wrong.  There is no upgrade or money system.  I can't take a base Honda Fit, and slowly upgrade it into a track beast (Bad example, I know the Fit would never be a track beast, but a boy can dream.)  The THOUGHT of qualifying gives me a panic attack because of my inability to have a ""clean"" lap.  The weather effects are BEAUTIFUL; but whenever it so much as sprinkles, I might as well quit because I WILL spin out.  I know the process of practice, qualify, race comes from the real world; but I lose interest half-way through qualifying.  To sum up, I will make a comparison.  This game is Rocksmith, and Forza/Gran Turismo is RockBand.  Rocksmith is trying to teach you to be a real musician, like Project CARS is trying to make you a better driver.  Rockband just wants you to have fun playing on plastic instruments.  At the end of the day, I'll keep my plastic guitar.			",366,58,26,70,31,2,47

												I started playing racing games approximately 15 years ago, when I was very young. For a stretch of about the last three or four years, I have been largely disappointed with the majority of racing games I've played. And when I saw that this game was selling well and getting awesome reviews, I decided to do some research on it. Bottom line is: I bought it. AND I LOVE IT! It brought me back my love of racing games.It puts you in the seat of a real racer, with real tracks that actually exist around the world. Do the real Le Mans, Brands Hatch, or Laguna Seca tracks. Did I mention you can do it in just about any racing machine you can think of? From the elite McLaren F1 or Formula A cars, to the goofy GO-Karts. The choice is yours.I haven't dug very deep into the career mode yet, but I've played against the AI several times now in single races (or ""Race Weekend"", as Project CARS calls it). Some people say the AI is ""buggy"" at times, but that just means they don't remember racing games from the 1990's and early 2000's.One more thing to mention- I have run this game on both my 1GB AMD HD Radeon 6670 and my 4GB NVIDIA GeForce 760 GTX. Not only does it perform better on the NVIDIA, but there are a few quirks on the AMD. However, it could just be the difference between a 1GB and a 4GB card, and I didn't see any game-changing malfunctions on the AMD like some people describe. It runs beautifully on my NVIDIA!Overall, great game! And if they were to come out with a new Project CARS, I will likely be one of the first to buy it!			",14,3,6,0,9,0,5

												If you are used to simulation style games where you can mod your vehicles like gran turismo this will be a let down. The dynamics of the game are ok however i like racing games that allow you to customize your vehicles. that was a deal breaker for me. i had to return the game. i liked the feeling of grid a little better.  and there are so many cars to choose from in gran turismo! People may say I'm comparing apples to oranges but i thought with all the vehicles in this game there would be some kind of customization.			",34,0,2,1,0,0,1

												I'm not sure that I recommend this game, its more of a ""I don't NOT recommend it"". I don't think it lives up to the hype, but honestly where else can you go? Lots of people on PC hail iRacing as the best you can get on PC, but you have to constantly keep paying to keep playing, so f*** that. The next best thing according to the PC community is Assetto Corsa. Have fun playing with the same 3 cars on the same 2 tracks. Its pitful how they added barely anything since the day I got it in Early Access, and now to get any meaningful content in that game you have to pay. So f*** that game as well. Which basically leaves us with Project CARS. It has a real campaign mode unlike the other two. It definitely has the best graphics out of the bunch as well. The feel of the game isn't quite up to par, but I think that's more of a force feedback issue rather than physics, although cars in this game tend to get air on crests where they probably shouldn't be leaving the ground. It has a TON of tracks and a very good amount of cars, if anything, it could use more street cars, but overall MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than Assetto. That alone makes me recommend this over AC, because this game actually has content, this game is made by devs that know what they're doing. The day cycle and weather is also fantastic in this game, better than anything else out there.My biggest complaint about this game is a BIG one however, the AI ABSOLUTELY SUCKS. It's beyond terrible. Even Assetto Corsa's bad AI is better than this. They stick to the racing line like glue, then make extremely jerky movements to overtake, and will not hesitate to ram you off the road mid corner even when you 100% have the right of way. My other, much leser, cons of this game are again that less-than-stellar feeling behind the wheel, and that you can't change ANY option in-game, you have to back out to the main menu and adjust from there, which gets really annoying when you switch between cars in races and want to set shifting from H-pattern to flappy paddles to match the car. It's not the end all be all of racing games, but its the best of what's out there. You pay for it once and you actually get content. The other racing giants can't say that.			",27,14,7,4,12,0,1

												First racing sim ever that has given me AI that is fast enough to be challenging.I love this game for what it is, a good nice racing sim with a bunch of track and cars.AI is bad when they are right next to you, for some reason they ram you of the road a lot, but looking at their speed, they're fast without cheating, and they give me a real sense of accomplishment when I win a race.That feeling is something I have not had for the last 15 years that I've played games like this.The AI is far from perfect, but it's the damn best I've ever had to race against.Usually if they ram you of the road it's because you made a mistake.Most other games that are praised for good AI have cars leaving their line or braking early to give you way.That is exactly what we should call bad AI.Anyway, the non important stuff, graphics and all, are fine.I really don't care for that stuff.But damn, the soundtrack in the menu's of this game ;-O holy mother of god, you even feel epic before entering a race.It's so good to just sit down and listen to.I often catch myself drifting off just sitting and scrolling through the menu, listening to the soundtrack.For me, it's the best soundtrack I've ever heard in a game, let alone a racing game, which usually has a horrible soundtrack.The career mode is actually the first time a career mode in a racing game has not felt grindy to me, but really gives you a feeling of going through the ranks, if you so desire.You can also take a shortcut and go do directly what you want.But just starting with formula rookie, and making your way through the classes, reallyy epic.The hard AI really helps.Taking the win with 100% difficulty AI and all the assists off, you'll feel like you're god!Downside of this game is mostly Online. Online is infested with bad drivers that break all the rules and kick you from their server when you're clearly a better and much faster racer than they are, it's a real shame.The system works flawlessly, it's actually a really good online experience once you're paired with normal and serious drivers. But all the 'I will kick and scream if you don't let me win' type of kids are ruining the online mode here.But luckily, for online stuff I have iRacing to fill that void.But honestly, if I want a quick and challenging race against AI, Project Cars is what I boot up.I also have Assetto Corsa, but to be honest, for me that is the worst racing game I have ever had the displeasure of trying to play.Steering wheel support is artocious in that game, it just never works correctly, always feels disconnected, graphics are meh, AI is terrible, simulation is terrible.I honestly can't feel why people prefer that game above PCars.But he, I'm having a lot of fun with this.

												Project Cars huh.Well I think it needs alot of work. Starting a online race is utterly rediculas. No voice chat. The replay UI stinks to hell and a hand basket. This sim looks to me like it was rushed out the damn door. I would personally would be embarassed if I was a dev on this project to release it the way it is.It does drive well and the cars and graphics are good. But seriously you all need to work on in it. Worth the price of admission? Definitly not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game when it first came out and I really didn't like it. Too little cars and tracks and the game didn't have much to offer, so I played forza for a few months. I just recently came back to it and fell in love with it, infinitely more tracks and cars and the handling is so much more realistic than that forza crap (motorsport 6) although you can't really drift  which is one of the only reasons I still play forza, project cars is one of the best racing simulators I've ever played!

												Project Cars; a nice racing simulation for you and your friends.And that's it, because the AI is an utter piece of crap. When you first start playing this game you are amazed by it's stunning graphics, vast number of tracks and the big selection of cars to choose from. Starting the campaign in the lower tiers, karts or clio cup for example, can be a bit frustrating. But if you skip that and head straight for the higher tiers like GT3, endurance or FormulaA/B/C you will have a great time.But then, after mastering the class you like best you will want a bigger challenge and a bit more in depth realism. If you turn up the AI difficulty you will face a new problem. Now your not in front of the pack but have to actually overtake them. And this is where the AI seems extremely aggressive or just oblivious to your presence. They seem glued to their racing line and simply do not care if you are on the inside of that corner or just anywhere near, they will hit you and make you rage! Turning up tyre wear has similar results, the AI will not pit (there is no option to force a mandatory pitstop in multiplayer or a single player quick race), resulting in punctures (and with punctures i mean 90% of the pack will drive around on 3 wheelrims with sparks flying everywhere) and slow moving zigzagging AI that is even more dangerous than the normal AI. However, if you decide to buy this game along with some friends and play it together you can have an amazing experience. The online lobby works well, with only a few connections issues encountered. Settings for the multiplayer games are limited. Options like ""endurance settings"" (time limit, a selection of multiple car classes) are lacking. But options like time progression (allowing for day/night cycles in a more reasonable time) make up for this. I've had amazing races with my friends, with fights for first position that lasted the full 20 lap race!Another positive point would be the extreme customisation you can do on your car setup. You can change EVERYTHING absolutely everything, I've played multiple racing games like the F1 series, but this is just so much more complex. However saving setups and pitstrategies seems to be a bit buggy. If you make changes you can never really be sure it actually saves it, leading to unnecessary refuelling or wrong tyre pressures.On my I5-4670K @ 4.4GHz and Asus GTX780-DC2 3GB graphics card this game runs very smooth, 70+ FPS on max settingsTrackIR works out of the box, no configuration requiredMy Logitech DrivingForce GT worked out of the box aswell, just to be sure I calibrated the brake and throttle, but I don't know if that was needed, no further setup was required but again if you want your FFB setup different there are many options you can change.Overall I would recommend this game if you have people to play it online with untill the AI is updated and improved.

												Graphics are really very good, track detail is amazing, car detail is brilliant, surrounding detail is probably some of the best i've seen but that is as good as it gets i'm afraid.The game play is some of the worst i've ever played, the driving physics are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor (and i'm being gentle there), the only drivable car is the caterham which seems a bit odd.It would be a great Andros Trophey race sim, as it is like driving on ice most of the time.I've played with a keyboard (don't even bother there) and with an xbox controller (nomilly better) and have not found a way to corner tight to the apex without either massive understeer or total oversteer snap into the grass or gravel or wall.I have to imagine it might be better with a game wheel but that is out of my realm.I also don't like the way the game run's, always having to 'continue' and go through annoying screens and read ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t social stuff that dosn't really add anything.Not a game I would recommend spending money on.

												If you liked Forza, you'll like this.  But in order to fully appreciate it, you'd need a full racing setup ($$$).  But if you go this far, you really should buy Asseto Corsa instead.Pros:- Out of the box Vive support.- Reasonable selection of tracks and cars (even without DLC).- Large library of wheel presets, but happened to exclude my wheel.  Tedious/difficult to set up other wheels.- Nice looking environments and car interiors. Really shows the lack of resolution on current-gen VR HMDs.- Many knobs and dials.Cons:- This is an arcade racer, trying to be a sim racer.- Audio is not good: engine chords abruptly cut out. Ambient noise is static -- birds are chirping in the middle of the night, noise at tracks is indescernable and annoying.- Difficult to determine when you are in control in the pits, and when the autopilot is.- HMD based pointer control is diffcult to use, and cuts in when you haven't touched the mouse for a few seconds.Note: I haven't tried online or AI play in the game as yet.

												If you're a racing game fan then this game is for you. It's not Need For Speed where you can just throw cars into corners and crash into walls to win, it's a simulation game where you have to use all your knowledge about driving to win. There are minor bugs, which I'm sure all the negative comments complain about, but there's nothing which is game breaking. There are times you'll lose to something wrong with the game, but it's not very often - So much that it's never happened to me.The driving physics especially on a wheel are just amazing. Although career mode isn't what I had hoped, it's not bad in the slightest. Put it on 100% difficulty and after 2.0 patch, the AI are ridiculously good and depending on how much practice you put in it will feel like you're racing online. Pre 2.0 patch the AI were slightly too aggressive, but now they're basically perfect, not too aggressive but not too passive. Online is where it's at though, find yourself a league and you will be loving it. Even in random lobbies you will find people who want to race fairly, although as with every racing game, there are some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who hit you off in every corner because they don't get enough attention at home from their goldfish or whatever. GT3 are the main cars online, but thats definitely my specialty so I don't really mind! SMS are going to still be developing more on this for the next two years, so it's not just going to die down any second now. It may not be iRacing (I've never played that, so I can't compare) but it's definitely the best racing game out there which you don't have to pay a subscription fee. PS. If you're not a racing game fan, this is not a game to start at.			",46,10,27,6,11,1,16

												This is a story of my thoughts about this game given my exposure of the near entire development of this game.I was on board with this game ever since the game was available for alpha testing. I purchased the full copy option that was  available since I loved the idea of aiding in creating what could be, and was proposed at the time, the greatest new generation racing sim. Every month I would play the newest build, pleased to see the development happen before my eyes.  In the early days the game seemed to be going in the right direction with likeable content, menues being refined, ect. And then it seemed something changed. Almost as if someone made the decicion, ""We no longer want to make the most realistic racing sim. We want to make a racing game that poses itself as a racing sim for everyone to enjoy, even console gamers."" From then on it seemed that everything that was done was to make it enjoyable for EVERYONE, even the casual racer. This path pogressed and the game was released. I was appaled at the release of the game. It still had issues from before the game was delayed. This turned me off completely. I left the game in the back of my head and as time went on I've seen that the developers did indeed make multiple patches through time and months after the release i decided to give it another go. I played it again and am even more let down than I was before. These developers have a horrible trend of fixing issues and in doing so introducing new ones. It's been like this since the begining.This game could have lived up to the name that the developers originally had for it but it didn't because they changed what the game was ment to be halfway through its development. That is why i feel the game suffers as many issues as it does, because they had to make changes to things that should have never been changed at all.I'd like to mention that about 65 of my 70+ hours in the game were from before the game was offically released. not to mention the uncounted hours from before the game even made it onto Steam.

												If you are into sim racing games this game is amazing. it looks great, the cars are amazing and drive fantastically and the tracks are a plenty!  There are a few niggles, especially with the online in that most people just crash into you as they have no idea how to race properly although if you manage to qualify at the front it definitely softens that.  there is no matchmaking although they are bringing that in with PC 2 and that is something personally i think would be great. ultimately an amazing game tho. all about the driving which is just quality although the game could use a tiny bit of polish.my brain says 8/10my heart says 9/10			",49,1,1,5,6,1,2

												If anyone is interested in drifting, my setup is listed in the description of this video for the Scion Rocket Bunny and MX-5 RADBUL. I'm aware this game isn't particularly built for drifting, but if you set your car up correctly it works and it's so damn fun, especially with the new drift tires they added to the game. It's what I do 90% of the time I play this game.

You decide how to play.. you can even set how long each session is in the career..AI that will race you hard, but fair (and can be adjusted before every race)Playable on gamepad too (I have a second account with 320+ hours racked up on pad)Solo or MP.. this has it covered in spadesEasy to get into, hard to master.. just how real racing should be..

												Easily one of the best racing games I've ever played. Most likely IS, but I need to give it more time.Once I configured the graphics to optimal settings, this game became a beautiful looking, beautifully running masterpiece of a racing game. The car list leaves a lot to be desired but the CRAFTSMANSHIP that went into each is amazing.Now one thing that is huge for me that this game has is DAMAGE. Im not talking little bumps and scrapes like all other racing games; I'm talkin runnin a Mustang Cobra TransAm into a wall at 100 MPH and that thing smashes to pieces, with the wheels and hood and who knows what else flying off the car. Just look at some of the screenshots of this game and imagine that with something FAR more realistic than GranTurismo.9/10Excellent graphicsRuns beautifullyAmazing car detail inside and outSATISFYING DAMAGEVery realistic sim driving with steering wheel and Oculus Rift supportGreat career mode that allows versatility and rewards good racing rather than farming trophiesI sat for a moment and tried to think of something negative to say, but I can't think of anything...

												I am using logitech driving force g29 and I am shocked that in this ""driving simulation"" every car has 900 degrees steering wheel rotating angle. It is ok when driving ordinary cars but if I go race with formula car and have to spin my wheel like mad man it is not okey. Sure I can change the angle always when I change to different car but that is too awkward to me. In DIRT RALLY wheel rotating angles changed automatically for each car. I cant understand why not in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great racing game. Note I do say game because I feel like this is on the game side of the simulator scale, but not the simulator side of the game scale.What I mean by this is that a game like GRID: Autosport is on the more simulator(ey) side of games, unlike mario kart or something similar. This game is very realistic but still has plenty of fun and enjoyable game-ish features unlike some other pure and true to the name racing sims.I would definitely recommend a wheel... I think this game would be like torture without one, but who knows, maybe not. If you are someone looking for a much better sim than GRID but not as simulator(ey) as iRacing or Asseto Corsa then I would recommend this game to you. It really is a great example of a game that can do both simulator and super fun game. ",230,33,13,20,42,7,15

												If you're looking for the single player experience, play Asseto Corsa instead. If you want to race wheel to wheel with people around the world, get Project Cars. I honestly prefer Asseto Corsa, but I haven't touched it since getting Project Cars because of how much fun the Multiplayer is.I highly recommend anyone picking up this game to invest in a decent wheel setup. I run a G27 and I would not enjoy it any other way. In the end its worth at least $30-40 so maybe wait for a Steam Sale if you're on the fence as some of the others have stated, AI is a bit rediculous and there are still bugs.

Its actually better on PC, but more flawless on Xbox One, due to its lower settings.Career is boring, all I do is jump in multiplayer sessions and drive.

This is THE best sensory experience I've had with any racing game, ever. Handling and FFB are good, although the surface texturing is not as good as some other titles. Car lineup to be fair is a little thin on the ground, but all the cars I've tried so far have been great experiences (all killer, no filler) and there is a ton of tracks, variations and weather combinations.Thinking of skipping work tomorrow to play some more 9.8/10BSHHH			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love It! If you are looking for a game more serious than Grid Autosport then this is a good choicePros:* The audio of the cars is fantastic* Multiple cameras in and out of vehicle* Lighting in game is great* Detail of cars especially the dashboards is great* Rain graphics are great* Feel of the cars is great. Handling results from the cars is really good and handling changes with weatherCons:* Smoke effects could be better* Difficult to play using a keyboard* Cannot change graphics or difficulty settings in gameProject Cars is more serious than Grid Autosport so it is a good ""level up"" in terms of simulation. Grid is more casual and less serious to play against friends. I usually play on keyboard but had to purchase an XBOX one controller for PC for more precise acceleration and steering. I struggled on keyboard to keep the powerful Rear wheel drive cars on the road. This may just be a skill issue though :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a bad game, graphics are quite simple and gameplay isn't very realistic, however I prefer games such as the Dirt series. I'd reccomend this for someone who enjoys having a wide range of vehicles and tracks, and doesn't want a very big simulation factor. 7/10.			",23,2,2,0,14,0,0

I have been trying to get it to work for over a month and it freezes almost every time I start the game, one time I made it into a race and it was pretty cool for about 15 seconds before it froze and I had to hard boot the computer.

												cars dont all handle realistic and numerous updates have changed the charactistics of a few cars from being fairly easy to drive on the limit to being impossible to drive, has a slightly arcady feel to the handling and most settings dont really change the character of the car like it does in real life or haven forbide it, like the gran turismo series. the fact the gt series from a console is more sim than this game has been shows how unpolished this game is. this game showed so much promise that i pre ordered from day dot and ive stayed around hoping it would be improved but the fact the devs went straight onto making the next game instead of fixing the imperfections on this game that couldve made this the Ultimate simulation racing game, instead they release some over priced dlc and nerf the handling for a lot of cars.they had the formula right for the cars included and tracks but let down by the poor handling mechanic			",175,11,15,10,46,1,6

												This is a massive dissapointment to say the least. To start, the controls on this game are so twitchy that it is simply unplayable. The game just leaves me entirely frustrated. The steering is the biggest issue. Not only is it disgustingly twitchy, it feels so numb. Drifting is simply impossible. If your tires break loose there is no way you can correct it and you will inevitably crash. I play and am quite good at Forza, and this game should take notes. It is a complete miss. I do not recoment this game at all. Waste of money. For a game that was designed by car guys for car guys, this was a complete failure. This a car guy saying that this is one of the worst racing games I have ever played. To call it a sim is quite false. The audio is also aggresively mediocre. The engine sounds are extremely poor. The only thing this game has going for it is the graphics.			",114,6,14,11,8,1,12

												Project CARS is fantastic and the most realistic racing simulator I've played. It has good scalability from kart style racing for the kids to fully realistic, white-knuckle, Formula One style hyper-realism for the most hardcore racing fan.The car selection is a little light. I imagine more car packs will come out for microtransaction, which makes me feel a little cheated, but the core game is well designed and a ton of fun.			",94,10,4,11,21,0,10

												I have a number of racing games, and was looking for something new. After some research (I also considered Ride, Formula Truck, Moto GP and Assetto Corsa) I chose to purchase Project Cars (and all available DLC) when it was on sale.  I've since put in about 60 hours so far, and have absolutely no regrets.  The kart racing alone is practically worth the sale price.  Thus far I have flipped my ""Super Kart"" end-over-end, and managed to get the front end of my Porsche underneath the car in front of me - sending my opponent flying through the air.  I haven't tried the multiplayer yet - but the single player has been completely satisfying.  The two Steam achievements I am most proud of thus far are for getting my brake temperatures above 1000 degrees C, and for crashing into an AI player named after an actual Project Cars employee.

It give so much satisfaction, and experience almost like in real driving. The best car game Ive ever played, and with good racing wheel, awesome!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*I have not (and will not) play the game outside of VR so keep that in mind.First off, this game is gorgeous in the HITC Vive. Both the cars and the tracks look amazing. This does come at a cost though since even with an i7-4770k, 980ti & 16GB RAM I can't come close to running it will a full grid or max settings. Of course given the current limitations of the VR headsets on the market at present time, even toning down the graphical settings still leaves you with an amazing looking game. And even without a full grid of cars to race against, it's still infinitely more fun than racing games I play outside of VR. I don't see myself needing more than 16-20 competitors on the track. It's harrowing enough working my way through the field as is.With a G27 wheel to go along with the headset, it's an absolute joy to play this game. I can feel when I'm spinning the tires, when I'm losing grip in the turns and when my brakes have locked up. It's so much more immersive than trying to play with a controller setup.Overall though, it comes down to ""is this game fun?"" and I would have to say wholeheartedly yes...yes it is fun. It doesn't offer the best physics or AI. But it's fun. The graphics in VR aren't mindblowing. But it's fun. It's by no means a perfect racing game, but it's fun. And to me, that's the most important part of it and why I highly recommend this game to anyone with a VR headset.There is just something so satisfying about being able to sit in a McLaren F1 and lean and look all around at the unique seat setup. Or how natural the feel is during racing to just be able to turn your head towards the oncoming corner instead of having to worry about buttons or sticks to maneuver your view. And a couple of the most awe-inspiring moments in gaming for me have been stopping on the Nordschleife to peek over the edge of an F1 car and just stare at the puddles on the track and also the first time you take the Nordschleife carousel. I've taken that turn literally thousands of times in various other racing games...from console to PC...TV to monitor to triple monitors...but nothing prepared me for the scale of dropping down into it the first time in VR. It was a close to being at the actual track as I will probably ever come.So to anyone with an HTC Vive (and even an Oculus Rift) and a love of racing games, do yourself a favor and give Project CARS a go. I don't see any way you wouldn't enjoy yourself.			",979,316,62,77,87,6,80

												Loaded it up, car defaulted to an LMP1 and so I took it for a wee spin on the Nurb... My jaw dropped at the visuals, then I grinned like a child at the screaming engine and the massive BSHHH of the wastegate when shifting at the redline. This is THE best sensory experience I've had with any racing game, ever. Handling and FFB are good, although the surface texturing is not as good as some other titles. Car lineup to be fair is a little thin on the ground, but all the cars I've tried so far have been great experiences (all killer, no filler) and there is a ton of tracks, variations and weather combinations.Thinking of skipping work tomorrow to play some more 9.8/10BSHHH			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I grabbed PCars while it was on sale, And was a bit apprehensive considering the reports of performance issues on AMD setups. I have to say that i get a stable, smooth 45FPS on max settings running my:FX-9590 @5GHzR9 280 3GB @ 1100MHz core, 1400MHz Memory.16GB RAM Win 7As for the overall feel of the game? the game feels wonderful, smooth, the career mode is challenging if the bots are set to a higher difficulty, although that depends entirely on the players base skill. I have not tried Online, although i still expect it to be full of ramming people.9/10, better than Assetto Corsa IMO. first good racing game on PC in a long time.			",165,19,9,25,13,1,14
