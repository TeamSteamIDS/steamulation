												Addicting time management game, Cooking Dash will keep you distracted for some hours and maybe days if you're into dash games like I am. The gameplay is fast and it has cute comic book graphics to tell the storyline.			",1204,500,76,128,128,16,153

												Like all DASH games, the formula is the same but the toppings are different. If you like these kinds of games then this one is a no-brainer! Great for wanna-be cooks!			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												お店の店員になって客をさばくゲーム。最初の方はまったりとできるが、レベルが上がるに連れて某ハンバーガーショップのランチタイム並に忙しくなるので効率の良い動線を探り、調理時間や客のストレスを計算に入れて動かないとすぐ詰むので気をつけよう。			",219,11,3,20,13,0,7

												Cooking Dash test how fast your are at learning food orders and sending them out. This game can get pretty hard, but Its enjoyable. My wife and I love to beat each others scores.			",187,24,4,36,26,4,30
