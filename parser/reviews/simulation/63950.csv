												Okay, hopefully you're reading this in the most recent order? So if you're you'll see this as one of the latest and most up-to-date reviews?Firstly a little about me. My username is Mysticpuma and I am one of the team of modders who go by the name ""Team Fusion"".Since the simulation was abandoned by the developers (in a pretty bugged state) our modding group of community members, all flight-sim enthusiasts, have been fixing, patching and adding to the simulation COMPLETELY FOR FREE so that players will get to experience the true version of the software that should have been released.IL2: Cliffs of Dover is a masterpeice in the flightsim genre BUT due to financial constraints was released in a working but bugged condition. Since that release there were two official updates from the developers (applied automatically when installed using Steam) and these fixed a host of issue....but not all!As I mentioned before, Team Fusion are all members (unpaid) of the Flight Sim community who have given 1000's if not 100's of 1000's of hours of their time so that the Simulation becomes one of, if not the, ultimate WW2 Combat Flight Sim.The detail that has been created, improved, fixed, upgraded has been vast and this also includes multi-player netcode, now allowing huge online battles to take place.Our team are currently working on completely new aircraft, completely new flyable aircraft (and variants of existing), shipping, vehicles, mission builder objects, effects, sound, new map(s), a new map tool builder and much, much more........and will be given to the community COMPLETELY FOR FREE!!! No paid expansion, no micro in-game charges, the patches, fixes and updates are FREE!! All made by community members for community members.Whilst I could sit and type for hours about the changes and fixes here are just a few features and video links that should give an idea of the level of depth Team Fusion have and are going to in an effort to give you the Flight Sim enthusiast, the best experience possible:Firstly a link to our videos on the VImeo page (we have now moved to Youtube). These should give you an idea of the level of detail in the software, what has been updated and where we are heading:https://vimeo.com/teamfusion/videosNext our Youtube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/user/TeamFusionMod/videosIf you don't have time to scour through all the video here are links to 3-4 highligh clips:A Taste of Fusion. This video clip gives an oversight of the history of the software and what happened since it's release (don't worry....it's not a documentary!) :https://vimeo.com/88650686Some of the effects work:

New aircraft:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzymlVgixcUIn finishing I'll just say that hopefully this information is of use to you. Yes the sim was abandoned due to financial constraints....but for just a tenner, once you apply the Team Fusion (FREE, did I mention FREE?) patches the software is completely playable on Windows 7 (64-bit) upwards including Windows 10. It has a thousands of new features, fixes, effects, etc, etc and we are also (and have a working version) looking to utilise Oculus Rift support after upgrading the software to use DirectX 11.AND IT'S FREE!!!!!!For more news and updates the best place to visit is the ATAG Server where Team Fusion are based and can be found here:http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/The Team Fusion Facebook page is here:https://www.facebook.com/teamfusionmodThere are also some other great servers and forums out there including the Air Combat Group and Storm of War and these use this software with the Team Fusion patches and regluarly have hundreds of online players taking part:http://aircombatgroup.co.uk/forum/index.phphttp://www.stormofwar.org/phpBB3/If you take the time to go through the videos and visit the forums linked to you'll see the software is far from abandoned, it is true to say that the 'Vanilla' version is bugged (but not unplayable, just frustrating), BUT, by downloading the FREE Team Fusion patches, you will have access to one of the best WW2 Combat Flight Sims available and that is still be worked on, updated, having new maps and features added......AND ALL FOR FREE.Team Fusion are made up of our community and are building and creating this for our community.Cheers, Mysticpuma ",24,1,1,2,1,0,2

												This is the best WWII combat flight sim out there at present..BAR NONE...It is the most complete WWII fighter pilot experience you will get....I have tried other WWII flight sims on the market and they are all very arcade like...This is the REAL DEAL...I have flown this sim over 1000 hours and I am still amazed at how real it feels, how good the landscape looks, the flight characteristics, the damage models, it is breathtaking!..and it is still being improved When this sim originally came out it had flaws that put a lot of people off and gave bad reviews on sites like this. Unfortunately this has marred what is now quite literaly a brilliant sim. Its taken a while (2 years actually) but for those of us who gave this sim a second chance we have not been disappointed. For that reason I feel that I should make people aware of what they are missing if they don't get this game, but don't take my word for it..checkout the recent youtube videos.. The online experience is probably the best part of this game...To fight in the skies over Kent and the Pas-de-Calais in real time, scan the skies for enemy contacts, wing with a buddy and engage a deadly foe, it is exhilarating. You can change your shells to whatever shells were available at the time, you can change convergence settings so that your bullets hit exactly the same point, you fuel up to what amount you need which will influence your aircrafts balance and weight. The dogfight tactics are still the same from 1940, the flight characteristics are different for each aircraft and at different altitudes too....You can also fly bomber runs in 1940 bombers and take control of every manned gunning position as you try to fend off hungry attackers. Even for new players there is plenty of help on youtube with 5 minute startup procedures, and how to dogfight in every flyable aircraft, you can be up and flying in just a few minutes. The best online server is ATAGS and they also have a website (link at bottom of this review)to checkout which is a must for new flyers with questions. Most importantly a large group of WWII aircraft enthusiast program techs have taken this sim and are constantly modifying it for a more complete experience. They are called the Team Fusion (TF) and they also use the ATAGS website as their base for discussion. The issues that once surrounded this game have now been resolved and the TF are now dedicating their time to making game enhancing changes like contrails and reflective cockpit canopys. Thats where this sim is at now. If you want to fly online with us (and I would highly recommend the dogfighting online as its so much more full on than offline)...you must install the patches that can be found on the ATAGS website..and also for any questions...link to website here: http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forum.php So my advice is to ignore any review earlier than 2013 as Cliffs Of Dover is as different now to when it was released as night and day and is nowhere near comparable with those early reviews.

												Cliffs of Dover is an excellent World War 2 flight simulator, recreating what it is like to be a British or German combat pilot during the Summer of 1940. HOWEVER, it is excellent only if you use the Team Fusion patch. Let me make that clear. Cliffs of Dover should have been an excellent product from the first. Its vision and the designed scope of improvement over other WW2 flight sims was, and still is, truly next generation. However, the sim was a commercial flop - for a variety of reasons. More than anything, the effect its release had on the flight simming community was to generate at first epic anger, and later, epic sighs of disapointment. We all had high hopes, but they were decisively dashed after the initial boot-up of what has become known as IL-2 CloD. Frame rates when the sim was first released were slide-show poor, stability was enough to make Job tear his hair, and menu navigation was inexplicably difficult. These and a myriad of other major issues kept anyone from feeling they got their money's worth. Most who had purchased Cliffs of Dover, eagerly expecting the best WW2 sim experience possible, quickly shelved it after vigorously (and justly) lambasting the developers online. The issues with which this product first shipped are unacceptable for any entertainment product if it is going to succeed. And, therefore due to the quality, or lack of it, succeed IL-2 Cliffs of Dover did not. The vision was there, the scope was there, the basics were there - but the execution left all the positives absolutely irrelevant.Now fast forward in time to the present. Over the years since release, a series of patches from the developers have addressed many issues in the software, partly to silence their critics, but also in an effort to salvage their reputation for further software development. The most recent developer's patch, however, came with a statement: No More Work Will Be Done. Although the official patches fixed many issues, serious flaws still remained unaddressed. Seeing that CloD had been abandoned by the developers, a small group of historically-minded flight sim enthusiasts took it upon themselves to fix the glitches that remain, adding content as well as restored functionality. The result has been, literally, a game-changer. Frame rates are at 60FPS on modern machines, flight modeling is impressive, software stability is great, and the single player campaigns have even been re-written. Multiplayer is fantastic. 50 to 100 human pilots routinely fly together, in one server, over the English channel and French and English countrysides, re-enacting the dramatic days before, during, and after the Battle of Britain. You can find your aerial combat fix nearly any day or night on the ATAG (TF) multiplayer server. Team Fusion continues to poll the community for needed changes, and to add more content and bugfixes regularly. Their forum, and their patches, can be found at: http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=91I highly recommend IL-2 CloD if you are a serious WW2 flight sim enthusiast. To date, it has the highest degree of period engine and flight modelling that a complete WW2 flight simulation product  has delivered. You will feel as if you are piloting a piston-powered, 1200 horsepower, state of the art (for 1940) aircraft into realistic and deadly combat using nothing but a compass, high-power guns, crosshairs gunsight, and your wits. It is not an easy sim. It is a realistic one. If that is what you want, you have found it. Just make sure you use the TF additions. -Venturi			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a commercial airline captain and a former USAF ""Hog Driver"" (A-10 pilot) I have to say ""IL-2 Cliffs of Dover"" has kept me occupied on many nights off. The aerodynamics of each aircraft get about as close to accurate as a flight sim. can get. My only issue with this sim. is that you're limited to France and England, I wish there was more map.

												Not a horrible sim, but was marred by a horrendous release. It's now very good and is actually really fun with the Team Fusion Mod. Get this on sale for sure.UPDATE 7-7-2014: The game is now well worth a purchase at its full price now that it's gone down. Installing the latest TF Update will provide you with a criminally underrated flight sim. It's awesome.11-1-2014: Just a test, Steam reviews seem weird.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												   This sim is the best WWII filight sim I have ever flown and I have over 25 years experience in flight sims from way back in the 80's until now.  The game in itself had some issues that made alot of people put this sim back on the shelve (I almost did as well)  But the community rallied, a mod team was formed under the name Team Fusion and this sim came back to life and went way above and beyond it's expectations.  The realism and immersion are top notch and the community is one of the best in the gaming world and very helpful and patient with newbies.  Even now in early 2014 the game is still being modded by TF and getting better all the time with new content, updated and better fps friendly graphics partical and visual effects.  The flight models and damage models have been revised and more historical and are still getting better with each new patch.  You can now take control of tanks and ground pound (wip) and the next mod release (coming very soon) you will be able to take control of flak guns and defend your base from enemy stafing it.  This game will still be here in ten years no doubt and just keep getting better as it goes.  The ATAG(AIR TACTICAL ASSAULT GROUP) server is the best host for this sim and there are always people on it willing to help newcomers out and get started.   I have over 1200 hous on this awesome sim and will probably get to 10,000 plus in the next 5 to 10 years.   And the best thing is the price is right, for under $20 you can't go wrong.  Although now with the TF mods it sould be worth at least $60 and probably more.  I definitely recommend this sim to any flight enthusiest out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been flying Cliffs of Dover for well over 400 hours now and I cannot recommend it enough. If you like World War 2 history and have an interest in flight simulators, look no further: this is the game you’ve been waiting for. You will relive the Battle of Britain like you have never seen it before. You will find yourself crammed into a claustrophobic cockpit and fight for either the Royal Air Force, the Luftwaffe or the Regia Aeronautica Italiana. If you are an aviation buff, you will be pleased to find an impressive selection of aircraft used during the battle, even less known aircraft like the Boulton-Paul Defiant, the Supermarine Walrus, the Short Sunderland, the Dornier Do-17 or the Vickers Wellington. Of course, not all of these aircraft are flyable yet but the iconic planes like the Spitfire, Bf.109, Hurricane, G.50, Blenheim IV, Ju-88, He-111 and Br.20 can be flown. You can fly online with up to 100 people, which makes for very impressive battles with friends and foes.The story of Il-2 Cliffs of Dover is a long and complicated one. When Ubisoft and 1C Game Studios dropped support for the game, a merry band of volunteers decided to create a free mod in order to fix the many issues Cliffs of Dover had back in the years 2011 to 2013. They became known as Team Fusion, and they keep modding CloD to this day and are slowly expanding the game to a whole new level. Sound mods, graphical fixes, performance improvement, flight model adjustment, new flyable aircraft, additional war theaters… these guys transformed this sim from the buggy-and-barely-playable-piece-of-junk mentioned in early reviews to what we have today. The difference between pre-mod and after-mod is mindblowing and it is the only way to play this game, trust me.The strength of the game is that it is a happy medium between the complexity of a study sim like DCS and the accessibility of an arcade sim like War Thunder. You can jump into a cockpit and fly like you’re really there. You need to keep your engine temperatures (oil and water radiator) in check by maintaining proper RPM and manifold pressure settings (which are controlled by prop pitch and throttle controls) that should come with any cheap joystick you can buy on the market. Just like in real life, your aircraft will be prone to stall, spin and attempt to kill you if you do certain types of manoeuvers. You will learn how to takeoff and land by maintaining proper rotation and approach speeds. You will also learn how to navigate using either a magnetic compass or a gyro compass, just like they did in the 1940’s. You can also do high-altitude bombing with the real bombsight and autopilot controls if you like more advanced stuff. And if you think this stuff is too hard to learn, have no fear. There will ALWAYS be someone to explain these things to you if you ask for help. How do I know? Well, simply because I gave up on this game three times before Team Fusion finally modded the game and I asked for help on the ATAG forums (more on that later). These guys taught me everything I know and it is my pleasure to train new guys on a regular basis.Cliffs of Dover wouldn’t be where it is today if it wasn’t for the efforts of Team Fusion, but I must also mention something else about CloD. There is a sense of fellowship in its online community that is unique and has no equal anywhere else. ATAG, also known as the Air Tactical Assault Group, is an online community where it all started. ATAG hosts the most popular online server and their forums are THE place to go if you want to learn how to play this game. There is a virtual Flight School where people request lessons with volunteer teachers. People can join Virtual Squadrons, discuss History, create multiplayer events, online campaigns, and have lots of fun on Teamspeak (which is a must if you want to fly online and coordinate with your fellow pilots). Whether you are a flight sim veteran or someone who has never even seen an aircraft, there is always place for you among the skies of Dover. If you like competition, you will find in multiplayer some of the finest virtual pilots with thousands of hours under their belt. If you want to learn how to fly from scratch, you will find someone to teach you the basics, from how to start your engine and get your butt off the ground to advanced techniques on how to shoot down enemy planes in flames. Guaranteed.Overall, Cliffs of Dover is now living up to its promises and it is a real blast to fly. There is nothing more intense in the history of gaming than trying to shake that Messerschmitt off your six o’ clock. The next Team Fusion patch will include (for free) a new theater, new flyable planes (among them the mighty Wellington bomber) and all sorts of new goodies.And If you don’t believe me, here are some videos of the game in action.The Killer Angels

												At launch this game went from one of the most anticipated Flight Simulators ever to the most vilified in a very short space of time.  I originally purchased my copy from Russia about four months prior to the European release. Ai was atrocious Lots of crashes, but you could see that if they were given time this would be the new Definitive WW2 Flight SImulator.Unfortunately, the team was disbanded just as major headway was being achieved.However now thanks to a dedicated bunch of modders going by the name of Team Fusion, Cliffs of Dover has risen phoenix like and is an outstanding simulation with the ability to not only control the air war but also to move ground vehicles (Beta).This game truly deserves to be given a second chance and at the price of two large coffees you haven;t got anything to lose...Reach for the Skies ",457,123,32,33,98,5,82

												This is by far one of the BEST WW2 flight sims out there. Alright, first things first. The Metascore is low, that is because when the game was released it was extremely buggy and the developers couldnt be bothered to fix it or ran out of funds to do so. Then a cool group of people developed the Team Fusion patch which fixes the entire game. There is a big community around this game and the servers have people in most of the time (Usually around the 40 mark). Again, this is by far one of the best flight sims for ww2 I've ever played. Also, the learning curve isnt as steep as the one in DCS, making the game enjoyable for newcomers (You still need to get your head around the basics). 10/10			",51,4,4,3,26,1,17

												As a long time IL-2 1946 player, I'd always shied away from this game having read reviews. I have to say for ten dollars, half that during a good sale, this game is plenty worth it.  The game is breathtakingly beautiful and as always the combat is exhilarating. The content is a little limited but let's not forget IL-2 1946 is a compendium of several titles along with patches; in addition to a plethora of community made content. I have not personally run into any crashing but the game does have other obvious bugs(Windows 7 x64), the game supports Track IR and spanning across multiple monitors.  Certainly a worthy addition to a flight simulator enthusiast’s or fans of the IL-2 series collections.			",355,37,4,32,109,1,42

												This game is unplayable in it's purchase form.  The developers produced a game that promised to be great and could not even be played.  I bought this game when it first came out and it was bad even at it's lowest settings.  I put it aside and forgot about it.  The develpers bailed out and ran with the money.  Then Team Fusion came along and picked up the ball and with several patches have made the game playable, but there are still many bugs.  I rate this game as poor at best.  I play the game daily, but only because of the fixes that Team Fusion provided.  The game is very frustrating when it comes to saving user profiles for different planes and gun loadouts, sometimes they save and sometimes they don't.  The game is more in a developers mode than in a finished retail product.  Buy this game only if you are sharp enough to install the fixes provided by the good guys of Team Fusion.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

CLIFFS OF DOVERIF YOU CANNOT GET THIS GAME TO RUN OR IF IT IS VERY BUGGED, PLEASE VISIT THE ATAG WEBSITE[www.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com]Grab the TEAM FUSION patches at teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.comFrankly, this is the BEST WWII sim on the market. It perfectly balances the amount of realism, has the best damage and flight models out of most sims, and the community can not be beat for friendliness and support.When CloD was released in 2011 it was a mess. Buggy and unfinished. In 2013 the devs abandoned the game. So, the community decided to create a patch. It was called Team Fusion, and it fixed so many of the bugs and turned the game into the best WWII sim out there. Now it's on the third version of the patch (4.3) and 5.0 will release this summer, with many new aircraft and a new theatre (most likely a North Africa or Malta theatre)New content in the new patch will be:Flyable aircraft:Bf. 109FSpitfire VWellington BomberBeaufighterBf 108 TrainerP-40EF4F Martlet/WildcatPerhaps the Gladiator and CR42Tiger Moth with guns and bombsOther ContentA new mapMultiple new ships like RN Battleships HMS Rodney, HMS Warspite, German Schnellboots, British PT boats, (Many with mannable flak guns), new merchant ships, and more.Trains with flak gunsbarges with flak gunspotential for so many new mission scenarios.The multiplayer is outstanding, with servers up to 100 players and special events like the ATAG events and the 401/ATAG ""War Machine"" persistent campaign which is currently running every Saturday.Overall, with the TF patches, for $10 this is the best WWII sim you can buy, no contest.ATAG website[www.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com] ",48,1,3,1,14,0,5

												Was hesitant about buying this game at first, after reading a lot of negative reviews, declaring lots of problems and bugs with the gameThen I realised all the the negative reviews were before 2011.It seems This was when the original company decided to not continue with the games developement, and a team of enthusiast programmers took over the project calling themselves Team Fusion.Since then the game was improved beyond all recognition.Great graphics, great gameplay, whether in the many Single player missions, or online Multiplayer with up to a possible 128 players in a single game. I myself have played in games with more than 80 players at a time.Once bought on Steam it will download the original game. Then there are 5 update files you must download, which are simple to install, which updates to the latest excellent version, download them from here.http://teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/There ar quite a few servers which can be accessed fron the multiplayer menubut recommend this site to join up and play on their servershttp://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/index.phpPlus there are lots of people at the site  with lots of knowledge about the game, and any problems you may encounter.The game is about £10 on Steam at the moment, really great valueThere's a bit of a learning curve initially, but well worth it, with a great feeling of satisfaction. Having played the game for some time now, I can thoroughly recommend it.If you like air combat games, don't hesitate, just buy it, you wont regret it ",85,1,0,6,19,0,3

												Cliffs od Dover with the free Team Fusion Mods = WWII simulator bliss.Ever since TF has taken the code and put out updates CLoD is where it SHOULD have been at launch. Sounds, Flight models, graphics, ground objects, mass air combat, damage model.....you name it, its here. For the price, you cannot beat it, and even though its older, it still trumps the newer BoS by miles. Do yourself a favor, pick it up if you are even remotely interested in WWII air combat.

												The game now comes with the Team Fusion mods built-in, direct from Steam.  So--no more downloading and installing a whole parade of mods just to get the game to work.Instead, it works right out of the box. So, if you've been thinking about trying CloD, now's the time.  It's one of the best flight sims ever, has a large and active online multiplayer community, and the price is right.Give it a try.			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

												This has quickly become my favorite flight sim for many reasons. I've avidly played all the flight sims that have been out since the 70's.Yeah that old.  This sim is the closest out there for the World War two experience in my opinion.I love the engine management, reminds me of and old Classic MicroProse ""European Air War"".The ATAG group has made this awesome group of patches which takes it to another level. KudosIf you aren't out playing Multi player on this sim, you're missing a great experince in flight simming.The fact that historically this was a pivotal point in World War II, and you get to experience the drama in the skies over the coast of France and Southern england, makes this a must have.I dislike the War Thunder (not real) matchmaking. Too much non historic, childish, crap in that experience.With this Sim the learning curve keeps out the less than mature crowd.Come fly with people dedicated to World War two aircraft sims, the way they should be played.As real as possible! If you want to shoot down biplanes with jets, then play War Thunder.ATAGhttp://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/index.phpPatcheshttp://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5058&p=52711 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm glad I purchased this game. I really like WWII Fight sims, and I really enjoyed Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 1, especially 2, and sort of 3. Then I found IL-2 1946, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. So, I'm glad to say this game is pretty great as well.Please bear in mind, this is not an action packed game, it's pretty much a sim, which means some aspects of it can be mundane; but if your too broke to actually afford a pilots license, and unable to Uncle Rico your way back in time, then this game will do fine. It's easy to learn, and not nearly as painstakingly thorough at some of the other air combact sims out there (which are fun, but require a lot of time, and aren't exactly jump on when you get off work games).If you're using a joystick, you'll need to assign all of the functions, including the X and Y axis. Don't forget to assign a key to the map, or you'll get lost like my dumb♥♥♥♥♥and get scolded by the AI squad leader in his oh-so polite English accent.The flight controls are nice and fluid, they don't snap into dead-zones like some games, and they are quit comunicative if you have a force feedback stick. Even at medium the graphics are good. I still need to learn more about the games options, because in the 'cockpit' some instruments, especially important once like your heading compass are completely blocked by the stick. Again, the gps/map will save your butt. As good as the game is, it still leaves you wanting something more, but for a 4 year old game that's been modded to function much better with really good patches, you can't beat it for the price. Good job, ol' boy!			",21,0,2,0,12,1,1

												If you are a fan of WW2 planes and of the battle of Britain take this game. It the best multi-player experience that is out there and by far. I am a sim enthusiast and I own them all, Cliffs of Dover with the Team Fusion Mod installed beat them by miles. It is tough, the learning curve is steep but this sim so rewarding.

												There isn't a WWII sim out there that comes close to the CloD experience. The game was years in development and it shows through in the incredible amount of detail. Everything, from the finest cockpit detail to the huge expanse of the map is a real labour of love. The overall effect is nothing short of stunning.Now that word is finally getting out that Cliffs of Dover is fixed, more and more people are joining the community every day and the online community is thriving.Ignore the one star reviews of the buggy release version - the game runs smooth as silk with the latest TF patches, and I've yet to experience a launcher crash at all.See you in the Skies ~S~			",8,0,0,0,2,0,0

												This game easly encompasses the most realistic WWII flying experience ever. For those of you who are already into flight sims, you wont be dissapointed, and for the newbies, if you are looking for an authentic and fully realistic aerial combat atmosphere, this sim is the way to go.I must admit this game was really buggy when it was released back in 2011, but everything got fixed after a couple of years by the Team Fusion modding team and the thing works and looks like a charm. Go to http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5058&p=52711 to download the Team Fusion mod. They also have some nice guides and tutorials for newcomers.			",43,0,4,2,3,0,4

												When this game released it was a bit of a disappointment with too many issues to list effecting most areas of the game. However over time this was patched both officially, and unofficially (through mod projects like Team Fusion[teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com]) and this game became actually playable. And it has to be said that for the Battle of Britain Theatre of WW2 specifically you won’t find a better Flight Simulation title as of writing this (it’s a good game to move on to from playing other BOB games which have become graphically dated by now). In terms of content, this game comes with several flyable aircraft, about 12 - excluding the vast selection of variants of each of these. There are several more ‘AI’ aircraft included, that you could also make flyable with modifications. The in-game map covers the South Coast of England (up to and including London), the English Channel, and Northern France. On highest graphical settings the game is still nice to look at and immerse yourself in the game-world.So if you are interested in WW2 combat in the skies over Britain, and want to fly British, German and Italian aircraft then you should certainly get this title. But I would say really anyone interested in aviation as a whole may like this title as it currently sells for only £9.99 and there’s certainly hours of usage you can get from it - even if this involves solo flight without combat (if combat isn't something you are interested in).On a final note I will say this game is unlikely to run at stock without patches and 3rd party Team Fusion mod. This game is compatible with Windows 10 with these mods and patches – but will not run without them from experience.			",429,87,42,38,43,4,93

												  This game is a bit hard to review as there is the game itself and then there is the game with the Team Fusion mod/patches.  So which to review?  I'll go with the TF mod version as it's what you'll find on the multi servers.  The original game suffered from a lot of performance issues, these mods/patches have cured that and it is a completely different (in a good way) game than without it.    While the single player experience is a bit ho-hum, there are other various other mission packs you can install if that is your sort of thing.    The best part of the game to me is on ATAG's multiplayer server.  While the settings are Full Real, they aren't so complicated as to make it overly hard to learn in a short period of time and the community over there is extremely helpful so you can get off the ground and up in the air in no time.    My only wish right now is that Steam would include the Workshop for this game to make it easier for those who may not know about the game saving Team Fusion mod to get it and also install it (there are helpful videos describing the steps though over at the ATAG site).

												IL2 has developed into an excellent WW2 flight sim, thanks to Team Fusion. Great flight and damage model, beautiful cockpits and many online missions have been developed by the community. For those thinking that the theatre; the Battle of Britain, is limiting then the next update will include a new theatre, North Africa and new planes. This sim was released broken, however it has grown into arguably the best WW2 flight sim available. Runs on Windows 7 through to 10 with no issues (with the Team fusion patches). Great online community and servers that cater for up to 100 players. I was initially sceptical reading about all the issues with the game on Google, but I can assure you that those were written about essentially a totally different game to how it is now.

												Downloading the Team Fusion patches for this game is a must. My favourite combat flight simulator with a great representation of the Battle of Britain. The TF patches also add a Luftwaffe campaign as well which I am having an absolute blast on!There's nothing like going on a sortie in a BF-109E-4 and feeling the adrenaline rushing through your body as you prepare for battle. Once you cross over the English Channel and see the White Cliffs you know you're flying into a sh*t storm. The game is a must with the Team Fusion patches, otherwise, it's a mediocre combat flight simulator with little content. I would personally recommend buying it from somewhere else though as the price on Steam is a little steep,			",100,17,6,7,23,0,17

												TL:DR: With Team Fusion patches, this title still beats newer sims in terms of multiplayer experience. It's cheaper now too so a win win for all. Forget the BoS/BoM as your first title.  Go with IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover as your first entry into the genre and you'll likely never look back.Team Fusion are set to release their 5th patch in the coming months which opens up a new theatre and expands the airframe set.  IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover has a bright future and really is the #1 choice for anyone looking a full immersive experience. Full review:It is October 2016 as I write this review. For the record, this game came out in 2011  March 22nd. I've over 675hrs in game, much of that flying with a virtual Sqn.I am writing this review now because I can but also to highlight that this title is still the 'go-to' title for WW2 Warbird flight sim enthusiasts.In short, this ugly duckling has grown into a relatively elegant swan (I know, ducks and swans are two different biological lines .... but take that up with Hans Christian Andersen  ....)The ugly duckling part: This is well written and reviewed and I am not going to go over old cold coals other than to say that the then developer of IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover released a flight sim that was beautiful, full of promise and quite badly failed the performance test when released. It was full of ugly bugs, ran terribly and was soon consigned to the 'what a load of rubbish ... and it could have been so awesome' bin. The grown into a relatively elegant swan part: Enter the Team Fusion mod group. Mod groups do their thing and take released titles and polish them up. They often are responsible for taking titles what had been set to 'end of life support' status by the original developer and keep them supported. There are plenty of cases also of Mod group essentially taking over from defunct developers such as Falcon 4 by MicroProse and Richard Burns Rally by Warthog Games. Both these developers are no more yet their titles live on being developed even to this day.Team Fusion are the effective custodians of  IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover's continued development. The developer, C1 Company, to be fair, did make a final last ditch effort to iron out the show-stopper bugs before they abandoned the project. They succeeded in that effort and thereby can be credited with a base game that is today ... playable.However, the salute goes to Team Fusion, for taking this almost but not quite product and dragging it kicking and screaming through 4 patches of development into what I will describe as the shining star of multiplayer WW2 warbird flight simulators today. The name ""IL-2 Sturmovik"" can be found today in other titles. Sadly, these title do not, in my opinion, represent positive forward evolution of the genre.  IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover with Team Fusion still reigns supreme if a truly immersive flight simming multiplayer experience is what you are looking to achieve. There are a number of servers still running with two servers standing out. ATAG, basically a dog-fighter server, known for it's association with Team Fusion, (Team Fusion needed a virtual home and ATAG server, an independent entity provided that ) is a server that new folks and returned players regularly go to for fast turn PvP experiences.  http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/ACG is a long time realism server group which are regular stopping in places for the more experienced CLoD flight simmer. With missions and campaigns from time to time and large multiplayer sessions, ACG youtube videos are famous and beautiful. http://www.aircombatgroup.co.uk/server/clod.phpThe last server of note is Storm of War.  SoW replays the BoB campaign. Every reply is unique in many respects. Presently in SoW Season 4, it is the goto server for the more experienced sim pilot which is seeking a multiplayer campaign experience. This is particularly true if you have a group of friends you like to fly with. SoW has developed it's own statistical system which provides Sqn level statistics as well as individual sortie reports even and  accommodates groups of players with their own dedicated operating bases, custom airfield configurations, managed airframe stocks, real life TOPHAT in fighter command... the list goes one. http://www.stormofwar.org/So 5 years ago, no one could have imaged that in 2016, IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover would still represent the top of the pile of WW2 Warbird flight sim experiences. Newer titles, some even with ""IL-2 Sturmovik"" in their names (e.g. BoS & BoM) fail to match what IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover brings to the table today. In terms of multiplayer, BoS / Bom are not yet as successful.If asked, my recommendation could not be easier or clearer. Forget any reservations about CLoD being 5 years old title ... it really isn't that old due to Team Fusion patch updates. Enjoy the fact that you will save money and have a superior product (assuming you install the team fusion patches!)S!			",13,1,7,3,17,0,1

												The TEAM FUSION update/mod is now available through the Steam client! I know a lot of potential players out there were turned off by the complex installation process, never got the game running, and then left bad reviews.  Do yourself a favor and give this brilliant piece of work another look. The download and startup process is idiot proof now and it runs fine on WIN 10. If you are interested in REALISTIC WWII combat flight sims you'll love this sim. If you want something easier to fly and to be able to just jump in and shoot other planes down, this might not be the right sim for you. Without a doubt the most accurate recreation of the Battle of Britain out there. I've been playing them since LucasArts: Their Finest Hour in the early 90's. And if you are a new pilot and want to take on the challenge, there is a great community of players to show you the ropes and answer any questions you might have. The learning curve for engine management, navigation, gun sights, and aerial marksmanship can be a little steep, but if you invest the time you will be rewarded with an incredibly immersive experience. And I don't even play the online servers! These guys actually recreate engagements from the Battle of Britain with players from the US, Britain, Germany, and all over the world. What are you waiting for? It's only 10 bucks and it's not even on sale!And now that the game is up and running like it's supposed to , don't be the guy to leave a bad review because you only had a keyboard and mouse. You can't play flight sims without AT LEAST a joystick, preferably throttle and pedals as well.			",37,1,0,4,6,0,7

Single player or Multiplayer options available, of course.  The best part is the community is very open and friendly to new people, and there's usually always someone willing to help you if you have a question, or even fly your wing if you're looking for a little help.While I wouldn't have recommended this game when it first launched, I can't recommend it enough now.

I have installed this game on two different systems using the patches as directed and haven't had any issues running it. In early 2017 you wont have to patch it as it will be an update through Steam. Now with Team Fusion and 1C coming to an agreement and giving the Team full access to the source code they will only be able to make this sim even better. The upcoming Tobruk map and P-40 will only add even more playablity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When Cliffs of Dover was released, it was frankly a mess, the publishers made efforts to improve it, but then lost confidence, leaving the game pretty much a half finished affair.Since then Team Fusion have taken up the reins and set to work improving the game, to say they succeded is an understatement, improvements in all areas has led to a game that is nothing short of the pinnacle of WW2 flight gaming, and this from a volunteer enthusiast group of programmers!So have they rested on thier laurels, hell no, Tf5 is in the wings being readied for release, with new planes, a new map and a huge number of yet more improvements, add in a great community and you have a game for real flight sim enthusiasts.Would I reccomend this game? as it comes from the publishers no, but download the TF patches and it's a whole different ballgame, I spent years on the old IL2 1946 and was dissapointed when I changed to the original Cliffs, but since following the majority and joining the Team Fusion game it's left the old 1946 in the dust, is it perfect, no, but it's improving alll the time and I could not go back to 1946 now, nor have I been able to migrate to other sims, I tried  then came back to Cliffs of Dover!For me this is the best WW2 sim out there.

												For me one od the best WW2 combat simulations out there, i've played War thunder a reeeeally long time, and also played Battle of stalingrad for some while, but they are not as in-depth as this. Being able to set up your aircraft every button, knob and lever in your virtual cockpit is so much more fun than just pressing keyboard keys (which you could actually do too if you like). Joining a squadron is recommended since there are huge events on sundays with multiple opposing squadrons.  Of course the Team Fusion mod is a must-have, but it's really easy to install (just google team fusion mod, the rest is self explanatory).			",150,14,5,18,17,0,4

												IL-2 Cliffs of Dover (CloD) is an extrodary flight sim/game that is so detailed in it's Flight Model (FM) that it's unimagenable. But to say it hasn't had it's problems would be an understatment. As to why it went south as it was released unfinshed to the public is to speculate all day. But as with many such products that are incomplete or abandoned, the community took up the banner and via Team Fusion (look it up on youtube and Vimeo) CloD has been reserected. It is fun to fly and and gives you the feeling of participating in the Battle of Brittain 1940. I payed the full price off the shelf of $60 dollars and nver regreted it. Still don't as I enjoy it daily. At the present price of under $10, there is no way you can go wrong. Now, with no offense to you who fly War Thunder, this is NOT an arcade game. You will have a learning curve and it will be challenging. So grab you a copy and hop over to the ATAG forums to patch up with the TF patch and enjoy a great flight simulation experience.

												IL-2 CloD is a great realistic WW2 combat flight sim, and i really recommend it!It had a bad reputation at the start, because few reasons: it wasn’t ready when it was released, there wasn't really a manual (just a general information manual), off course it had to fight the original IL-2 series, which had much more planes/maps, which is natural situation with new series. and personally, but maybe more peoples also had a similar problem with CloD as me with the performance of the sim, my laptop and Desktop PC i had then, was not powerful enough to run it, and it was completely unplayable. (only 2 years after it came out i could play it with the PC i have today).Because all of those reasons the public opinion was very negative for this sim, and i assume the sales impacted by that, so, eventually, while the developers worked on the second sim in this new series, the company shut this series down and we left with only the first module. but, IMO, they had to give it a chance, it’s take time for peoples move to a new sim.After few years they started the current IL-2 Series(BoS), which is, btw, also great.So, CloD isn't continuing developed officially, but! fortunately, a modding team called ""Team Fusion"" continuing to develop this great sim. they already improved the sim very much, and they're still improving the sim, and will add new planes, sounds etc..in the future. so, if you are interested in this sim, those mods are a must. And today, thx to the community, we have many guides and manuals.About the sim itself, IL-2 CloD focus on the Battle of Britain theater, in a very detailed way, the map of the channel is large and pretty. the visuals are good and realistic.for a first sim in a series, there are plenty of flyable planes, fighters and bombers.The physics are good, much more detailed and realistic than the original IL-2 Series. you have the feeling of real flying, you can still fly with missing a major part of the wings, aerodynamic forces are modeled very nice, spins and all what we expected from this kind of sims.The damage model is also very detailed, the modeling of the construction of the plane is very in depth, the resolution of the hits is great. also, fire model is great, in which, a fire can start at one point in the skin of the plane and it spreads slowly to other areas in the skin of the plane. the systems damage model is also very detailed, almost every sub system can be damaged by many reasons.The systems of the planes are modeled very nice, and it’s a clickable cockpit with the mouse. There are a very few minor systems that are not modelled, for instance, the battery which is always on and you cannot control it, but the most systems are modeled, and in a great detail! The plane feels real, the gauges are shaking, the ADI is losing calibration by maneuvers, you can turn on and off the gunsight, you can change the range/target size of the gunsight etc..engine management is great, you can over revving the engine and the engine will damage, off course there is an over heat, under heat etc..The configuration of the weapons and ammo is very detailed, you can choose which guns to put in the planes, convergence, which ammo belts, and even make your personal ammo belts.There are many players online, for instance ATAG server is very popular. there is some minor graphic downsides, such as the animation of the controls of the planes which aren't smooth, and the mirrors dosen't work, but, those not so a big deal IMO, and i think that working mirrors are on the roadmap of Team Fusion.For summary, a great WW2 combat flying sim. IMO, this with DCS and the new IL-2 series are complete each other, and are the best sims for realistic WW2 combat flying sims.			",119,5,8,4,9,0,9

												Cliffs of Dover + Team Fusion Mod = EPIC WINthis game is finally playable and with this mod the best ww2 flight sim out there.Warning!!!this is not a game like war thunder or Hawxyou have to adjust and put some time to get used to it. its not an arcade shooter in any respect, but after you master the basics its one of the finest and most rewarding ww2 flight sims out there.in my opinion even far superior to warthunders realism gameplay, because the flightmodel doesnt feel odd - it feels just right! every plane is different and does accordingly to its specs very closely it should have been controlled as far as i ve experienced.in wt like in wings of prey (same gameengine same gameplay) the flight model is sometimes out of touch with what you would expect a plane will do in the air at alli have played wt far over 250h and wings of prey (its predecessor) 136h.  in CoD/CloD +Team Fusion Mod you have an immersive feeling of wind and weather, you have a full interactive cockpit and even free configurable voice activated commands are supported by third party softwares  :) . did i mention full interactive cockkpits? all that named is covered in beautiful graphics. the mod implements not only a new look and feel but even new missions and campaigns.the only drawback is a missing pacific scenario and with it some of the planes we learned to love and hate in il2 1946. its clear battles over the channel so far, but maybe other mods will fill the gap (hopefully)if you loved il2 1946 with its mods, you ll definitely like this with the team fusion mod. grab it! it dusted far enough in my library and maybe your too, for sure.  last but n ot least!finally friends are able to join your plane, take a seat in it and control bombers and multiseated planes on missions with you together. yeah you ve read right. :D, finally together.with the new mod and communitywork there are up to 255 player battles over the channel possible and a waste amount of bomber, scout, attack, raidmissions to be played for some tons of hours with your friends. just do yourself a favour and molest the next search engine for ""cliffs of dover + team fusion mod"" or youtube.graphics will look like a charm too.  Runs smoothly at max settings with  GTX 670 i5 2600k 8 GB Ram Win 7 64biti dont do reviews often but this game deserves a second chance :) in my opinioni would rather recommend to wait until il2 battles of stalingrad (IL2 BOS release Oct 2014) is patched to the max before putting a ton of money in an unoptimized product, overpriced DLC planes and spent the waiting time with Cliffs of Dover +TF Mod in favour.kind regards and hals und beinbruch			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not the same game that it was way back in 2011. Cliffs of Dover has improved ten fold and with the Team Fusion patches that you get the now quite well known ATAG site it has become the best WWII combat flight sim out there imo. The best way to see  how far it's come is to  look at the player videos on youtube. If you don't want to shell out 100 bucks for IL-2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad get this. Cliffs of Dover is a better simulator in my opinion..... 5 out of 5			",0,0,0,0,2,0,0

												I owned a retail copy of IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 and enjoyed its gameplay and realism quite a lot, enough to forgive the clunky user interface and spotty performance, to be expected in an obscure flight sim from 2006. Finding this 2011 release of IL-2 Cliffs of Cover on Steam, I had hoped for a more polished experience, but was left terribly frustrated after hours of simply attempting to get the game to run properly. When a game is made widely available on Steam, from a huge publisher as Ubisoft, I should not be expected to need to manually edit a bunch of .config and .ini text files buried deep within the installation directories just to get it to run! Yes, there is apparently a strong user community whom have created mods and patches to make this a much more playable game, but, again, a full-release paid-for title on Steam should not require any of this. There are early-access and pre-alpha release games that perform and play much more reliably than this. If you're willing to spend hours scraping online forums for user mods, configuration editing instructions and fooling with text-file jibberish, then perhaps you might find some enjoyment with this game. However, you shouldn't have to jump through those hoops, and this game shouldn't even be for sale on Steam. Remember, you can't get a refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you serious ? CLODO won't launch right off the bat ? The game in itself is great, but the install process under win 8.1 64 bits is a joke and the lack of support by the developpers an insult to the customers. If you want to play you'll have to download patches from a modding team (many thanks to them for providing support the devs failed to deliver).Granted, most players would probably use the Team Fusion package, but the sim should be playable without any mods whatever great they might be.As one who played massively Il-2, I'm utterly disappointed by 1C Maddox Games. For now, I'll stay away from Battle of Stalingrad and wait for a steam sale in a few years.  I've learned my lesson.			",340,55,4,68,45,1,88

												Now that the Team Fusion Mod is an official game update, easily installed via Steam, IL2 Cliffs of Dover can finally claim it's rightful place along side the very best WW2 air combat simulators.

The rough diamond has been transformed into a true gem of a simulator.PRO's:Realistic flight models faithfully recreate the true characteristics of the turn fighters v the energy fighters.Various bomber types allow you to man the crew positions and carry out level/skip/dive bombing.Active online servers are always busy at peak times and offer a variety of game modes and mission objectives.Welcoming and helpful forum dedicated to getting new pilots up to speed.CON's:Steep learning curve to become successful in online combat, but ultimately very rewarding.Demanding on system specs. Upper mid range processor and graphics card are required for smooth gameplay.			",0,0,1,0,1,0,0

												When this game first came out the it was riddled with bugs, bad performance and left an impression of an unfinished product. Forwarded to 2015, the game still feels lacking meaningful content. That being said, the community has come to save the game by introducing a mega mod called Fusion Mod.The only way to truly enjoy Cliffs of Dover is by installing the mod really.Multiplayer is well alive with the mod and with the mod the game even manages to be better in qulity and feel than its legendary predecessor IL-2 1946 although 1946 still beats the Cliffs of Dover Fusion Mod by having more playables and theaters.The mod adds dynamic campaigns to the game as well so don't worry about your single player experience as this too has been improved.Take the sentimental road down the historical timeline to the Battle of Britain with this game. You won't regret it. Just make sure you have the Fusion Mod installed.In terms of simulation, Cliffs of Dover is still not as complex as say DCS study sim modules. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. Cockpits are clickable (the levers, switches, knobs, etc) but they took shortcuts in terms of the most miniscule details which is fine after all we are to play the game not study them. That being said, again, Cliffs of Dover is far more simulation than most flight games and even than IL-2 1946. They even simulate pitot heater.If you love flight sim or if you love WWII warbirds, do yourself a favor and get this game and install the Fusion mod. You'll be doing yourself a great service. Might even prolong your life with all the fun and relaxation you are going to have with the game.Fusion Mod is a must have. It's not a choice as the vanilla game lacks meaningful content.

edit April 13 2017: the team fusion mods are now included on steam which hasn't changed anything for me, so even after this admirable change don't expect to be able to play/launch this game on your computer. Why do I even bother at this point? Only the steam community guidelines keep me from expressing my feelings in more flowery proseAs an Il-2 Sturmovik fan in need of a new fix I finally caved in, bought Cliffs of Dover on sale and I can't remember the last purchase I regretted this much.The game is simply broken as in perfectly non-functioning. Despite the valiant efforts of the team fusion modding team and several hours of meticulously exhausting every possible way to get this wreck to work I have yet to get Cliffs of Dover to boot once (where the 5 minutes I supposedly played it are coming from is a complete mystery to me - someone get David Duchovny out of the cryogenic freezer for this case). Believe me I've tried every suggestion, every tutorial, every variable, every tweak, every little setting and voodoo practice several times to absolutely no avail. I've been using computers for more than twenty years now, this isn't my first rodeo, but at this point I just give up. Or rather I refuse to waste another second. Even if this were the greatest flight sim ever made I'd still refuse. Nevermind the money I spent, I regret the hours I have basically thrown into the trash can.			",180,69,4,15,18,2,31

												Now that the Team Fusion patch is downloadable right from STEAM this is a must buy sim for anyone interested in WWII flight sims.  It is truly spectacular and makes a so so game experience out of the box into an immersive, gorgeous, challenging experience.  Still some rough edges but those should be worked out as dev continues.  It's a steal at this price!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the definitive Battle of Britain flight simulator, and I do mean simulator. This is a game requiring a joystick at minimum, if not a throttle and head tracking setup. If you want to feel like you're actually over the channel in a 109, no help in the world but your wingman, this is your game.10/10 would bounce spitfires again.Get the Team Fusion patches and play on the ATAG server and TS.

												With the Team Fusion mods, this game is a little gem, especially for the money. But you must Mod this game, the vanilla version is pretty poor. Once modded the graphics are holding up really well for its age and its probably the best all round WW2 flight sim on the market until DCS WW2 gets itself into full swing.Bear in mind though to get the best from some aircraft like the Spitfire you will need to master complex engine managment, if you do not want to spend time learning and perfecting this then this is prob not for you. I class this as a simulation, not to the same level as DCS but its not too far behind. I love it......			",9,0,1,0,5,0,1

												Great game! Must DL the patch from team fusion to play the game. It adds a lot and soon the community will be adding new planes including the F2F. http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=6That's the website to get info on the game including the download.I've played often with 40-70 players and it's a blast. Nothing like feeling the heat when youre trying to dive down on some fighters while you have to manage the prop pitch and radiators. Complex engine management is far more realistic than the previous IL2.			",15,0,0,4,2,0,3

												The large selection of flyable aircraft is one of my favourite parts of this game.. For an older game I expected bad graphics and sound, but with the Team Fusion mods for free online, this game looks and sounds extremely realistic ! Honestly it is nearly on par with the newest IL-2, but has more planes and is moddable (Especially important when it comes to Sound MODs).. I find the  default IL-2 engine and weapon sounds to be tinny and wimpy-wimpy-wimpy, but with the TF Mod and other 3rd party modders the guns sound hefty-hefty-hefty and the engines sound so good you just want to do fly-bys all day long; especially in the BF-109.. I definitely recommend this game - even at full 10$ you won't find a better WWII sim for this little cost.. Happy flying,			",77,5,1,4,9,0,2

												For this game you will need to look past the negative reviews it has recieved. The reviews are based on a while ago when the game was terrible, buggy, didnt work correctly etc etc you get the point. However the guys over at team fusion have worked absolute wonders. Once these mods have been installed the game runs like a dream and it is breathtakingly good. I was steered away by the bad reviews but after reading up on the mods etc i purchased the game and gave it a shot and i was not dissapointed at all. The community is simply fantastic. One of the most welcoming helpful communities i have ever been apart of and ive only been a part of it for a few days! They practically tought me step by step how to play the game and how to fly different aircraft specifaically (as they are all completely different). I would say please give it a shot guys. Once you get past the learning curve the game is amazing and the people you will play it with online are too.			",41,2,1,3,12,1,8

												This game may be flawed, but that is only because it was released prematurely due to pressure from the Sturmovik fanbase. BUT, if you download the TeamFusion patches, then the gameplay improves drastically. Mechanics are improved and models are improved. So many things to name. And the Team Fusion team are working continuously, even though their releases are usually out every 1 or 2 years :DBut honestly. If you enjoy flight simming, and are a big fan of the previous IL-2 Sturmovik games, then by all means, buy this game. $10 is a really good price for it. There are also virtual groups out there like Air Combat Group or ATAG or Storm of War who are constantly recruiting new players, so the community is fairly large.Well, there's my rant. Honestly. Buy the game. It's worth it, and gives you countless hours of fun.Cheerio!			",108,22,4,13,39,0,41

												I played the original IL2 from it's release right up until IL2 1946, some of my best times ever in pc simming/gaming, most of my flying was done online.  I, like everyone else eagerly awaited this game and I, like everyone else was very dissapointed when it came out.  I was also a little played out by all my time in the earlier series so I left the game alone,,  until now.Team Fusion have taken it upon themselves to fix the game and in the main they have achieved this.  For sure there are still  small bugs but not gameplay breaking one's, this game is the real deal for simmers, consol heads and quick fixers need not apply.It's a wonderfull game/sim, with a some effort needed from the player.My own rant here.  I play Falcom 4 BMS as well and that had a very similar history to this game.  When it came out it was a pile of buggy cr%p but you could see the scope.  The developers dropped it very soon after and it was a commercial flop.  Cue the people.  An incredible amount of work (and time the sim came out in 98) and it is now what it should have been at release.  Had it been released in this condition at that time I have no doubt that it would have been a massive hit and I sadly think the same for CLOD.  The developers followed the cash and did other things.  Clod is different inasmuch 1c had already gone the route of excellence with the first IL2,, and as a way to approach how to make/market a game how did that work out ?  How many expansions, how many accolades ?  Massive success by any standards but you wave them greenbacks around and attitudes quickly change.Sorry, do I sound bitter lol,, I am, I have seen this corner of pc gaming get smaller and smaller and games like this are now as rare as rocking horse sh%t.  Buy it and enjoy some real vision and skill in a game and not the mind numbingly and ultimately shallow and boring garbage that most game producers make nowedays (yes including you here FD) ..

												I've logged thousands of hours in flight sims going back to the '90's and this game, combined with the Team Fusion patches and ATAG community support, is the best and most realistic WWII flight sim out there IMHO. It's only a measly $6 on sale and that's it... no unlocking, grinding or pay to progress... just learning how to fly and fight with extremely detailed, challenging and realistic FM's/DM's along side top notch and friendly players. Want to PAY to fly a cartoon with broken planes and horrible matchups then get War Thunder. Want to experience the closest thing to actually being a WWII fighter or bomber pilot then get this. I've only just discovered this hidden gem and immediately saw that it's a labor of love that I wish I would've known about before wasting my time on the latest breed of greed'n'grind driven games.

												Before I want to begin, I want to say that I'm a big fan of the IL2 games, but this incarnation is awful. The controls aren't properly adjustable, so I can't map them onto my joystick, which means I have no rudder and no way of firing my guns except using my keyboard. The number of aircraft is tiny compared to previous games and the interface is unwieldy. The interface also looks like it was designed in someone's bedroom as part of a hobby project. The way they have implemented the previously excellent 'quick mission' mode is also laughably bad.This game is in almost every way worse than 1946 or indeed any of the previous games. I am so upset I wasted money on it and the developer better start doing some serious patching pronto.			",76,19,3,8,24,1,31

												A fairly unoptimized game with really badly scripted A.I. in the campaign. Everything else is great, but I can't actually complete missions correctly due to the A.I. being so sporadic and not realizing when I've done something. Still, it's a great looking game with the best flight models in any WWII game to date. Worth it if you want to play multiplayer and free flight, I personally have had nothing but issues due to scripting in the campaign but if you have a high-end PC and peripherals this is the best WWII simulator out until Battle of Stalingrad is fully completed. If you're a sim enthusiast, get a boxed copy as they come with Steam codes, but do realize that unmodded it is unlikely to be a seamless experience.			",36,3,0,6,6,0,16

												CloD doesn't have the perfect Flight model out there, contrary to some people's beliefs. It is near impossible to get the unmodded game to fly anywhere near the real aircraft performances, and the AI isn't the most challenging.That said, it is a pretty game and is definately a ""jolly good weeze"". (Here is the game on a R9 270x i5 8GBram) To give you an idea of what you can expect;

												Boy, am I glad I picked this up finally.  I am a veteran to the older Ill-2 and pacific fighters series, so perhaps my view is biased.  But I read enough horrible reviews to always keep me from getting it.  Most of the reviews claimed poor preformance, stability issues, and lack of mission/plane variety.  I should have known by the amount of support that i'll-2 had gotten for all those years that they would continue to support this title as well.  Let me just say that this game is up to snuff now.  Although It's sort of more a simmulator than a game.  That is one of the best things of this series.  Is the fact that you can customize the difficulty on such a high level.  One can play it as an ultra realistic flight sim, turn off all the realism setting and play it as casually as you like, or even find a spot in between.The damage and flight physics are spot on as well.  Plus they look great.  If I had any complaints Its the fact the vanilla version limits you to one map, north France/south England area(which is amazingly huge and detailed no question).  But if you want a change in scenery you will have to mod this.  And I am probably spoiled by the number of aircraft available in i'll-2, but I really miss the variety of russian, american and japanese planes.  Still I think there is something like 30 flyable aircraft, each with highly detailed interiors and exteriors.  Both bombers and fighters, and English and German.  Plus many more that the AI can control.I have yet to check out the multiplayer,  but even the single player alone... I felt  was worth the time to write this and well worth the price of download.

												Amazing flight SIM, by far the best game WW2 air combat game out there.  Second only to IL2-1946. This game Makes WarThunder and Battle Of Stalingrad look like fisher price toys in comparison.  The flight models in this game will blow your mind. It takes a 15 minutes to get the Team Fusion MODS installed & set up once you have downloaded everything. It is well woth the extra time to get set up.  Also, the Community surrounding the game in its current form is second to none.Best $10.00 you will ever spend.Stop reading and start downloading !			",1,0,0,0,3,0,0

												As you can see, this game have many negative reviews. Yes, many people were deceived in their expectations. I play CloD rarely, but I think that is very worthy game of the series.Bombers systems deserve great respect. It is very complicated and advanced. You can easily compare it with 777's IL-2 where bombers are very-very simplified. I can't said that is bad, but such gameplay is not really interesting, meh. There (in IL-2 BoS/BoM/BoK/etc.) aren't any difficulties which made succesful drop so satisfying like in CloD.Concerning fighters... You can say that they ""going as the rails"", still flight for me is more attractive then in IL-2 BoS. And here we got amazing theater of operations with interesting machines and not thousands of Yaks. And you must note that this game still looks cool despite its five-year age.In any case, you decide to buy or not.P.S. Don't forget about Team Fusion mod!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game slowly has become one of my favorites.Mind you, your going to need the team fusion patches for the game to be playable. You can find those at the ATAG site.I've been getting into the multiplayer recently, it has a pretty steep learning curve to anyone who hasn't played a MP flight sim. But after about 2-3 days of failure I began to get my first kills. And after that it's purely just time for improvment, I do rather well now generally getting at least one kill per sortie and sometimes two. Good standards for someone as new as me I think.This is one of the best flight sims out right now with the team fusion patches I think.If you're looking to get into flight sims I would reccomend this game, it's probably the best option besides Battle of stalingrad, which is just so expensive right now.And if you have come from war thunder get ready to throw your ego and a good amount of what you know in the trashcan.

												This game is great. Even while it still got many bugs and performance issues on some PC's. You will forget about the bugs when you play this game and see the nice graphics and realism this game got! After many patches this game became playable and is extremely fun to play with a squadron or friends online! I ain't got no performance issues anymore since I've lowered the resolution so take this as a tip if you do have problems.  AI need some tweaks too but I do believe in the future this game will be perfect. Let's not forget that Il-2 1946 had struggles in the beginning. Also an plus point for this game is that the patches are great and no need to pay for it, like games as COD or Battlefield! Must buy if you Like the world war 2 era, airplanes,combat and realism!

This game had some issues on original release with performance optimization but let me tell you a) its much better now b) it had performance issues because it is such a detailed game! Every little detail is modeled and in game. I believe it took three of us to figure out the complex control schemes but once we found out what buttons to toggle and how much throttle to give 'er on take off it has been such an enjoyable expirience.

												I have always been a big fan of WW II combat flight simulators.  I have played many many titles over the years.  Cliffs of Dover is hands down the most complex and realistic one of the lot.  It is absolutely beautiful from an artistic perspective, riveting from a combat perspective, and immersive from technical perspecive.  If you like to control every aspect of the airplane the way a real pilot has to do, then this is the best combat flight sim for you.  I had pre ordered this game, so I had it at launch.  It did have some optimization issues, but that has all been corrected in subsequent patches.  If you love combat flight sims and especially the world war II flavor, then this is the game you have always wished for!  Also check out the Team Fusion Mod.  http://theairtacticalassaultgroup.com/forum/showthread.php?t=3777 This mod gives some engine performance tweaking to make it even MORE realistic.  You will need this mod if you want to fly Multiplayer as all of the best servers are running this.  If you are not sure you up to the challenge of full aircraft management, dont be afraid.  CoD includes many automation options so that you don't have to think about the more complex stuff if you don't want to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are thinking about buying this game MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE TEAM FUSION PATCH to enjoy the simulator at it´s full potential. By doing so you get the best WW2 combat flight simulator experience available nowadays.Everything from the astonishing visuals of  southern England and northern France, the cockpits, the clouds, contrails, day and night cycles, the roaring sounds of the engines, machineguns and explosions, to the brilliantly detailed physics, instruments and damage models.The learning curve is steep, but if you are into flight sims, it is something to expect, and where half of the fun is.Joystick is a must and head tracking is also very helpful.If you´re into multiplayer, make sure you join the ATAG SERVER.

												Now I'm sure there are many reviews that will tell you the history and poor release of IL-2 CloD, but I'm going to keep it brief.IL-2 CloD has possibly the best community of any game I have ever played; helpful, understanding and serious.To access this however you must install Team Fusion. To play this game without Team Fusion is simply not worth it, just go and play IL-2 1946, you'll have a better time. With Team Fusion however, the game improves massively in balance and effects, as well an extremely underrated multiplayer. This game's singleplayer is poor, but the multiplayer is the best in the Sturmovik series. Also, please don't be worried about the realism if you are new to simulators, there are many tutorials and helpful members of the community. IF you can play the Team Fusion multiplayer, and ideally have a mic, this game is easily worth twice its price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a great classic.  Many criticize it for graphics or crashes, but that is a matter of the computer and how old the game is.  People also say it is bad for not having windows 8 compatability (very well at least), But they miss that this game is four years old and is no longer having major patches or updates(IL2 Sturmovik Battle Of Stalingrad is currently being worked on)  This means you should not expect windows eight.  The game still has bug patches and mods to fix it though so don't fret.  I give it a 9/10.  (It is kind of weird changing the controls, but it is still fairly simple.

												I started flight sims when i was 7, with games like combat flight simulator, Crimson skies etc...I took a huge break, of almost 3-4 years, without touching a joystick. Then I heard about this game. I bought it, plugged my joystick...1st impression: The cockpit is amazingly alive! The way the camera reacts to the plane's movements, the vibration, all of this makes the cockpit incredibly real. The clickable cockpit adds to it.Next, the sounds. Never heard a 7.7 MG in real life, so I can't judge this. But the engine sounds are very good. The graphics are not incredible, but they are right, Plus, with the Team Fusion Patch, it gets a lot better.In dogfights, you ""feel"" the plane. You know when it's gonna stall, when you're going to spin, and I don't know why. You just feel it. The damage models are very good, too.And, the big plus to this game: MULTIPLAYER. The ATAG's community is very active, very kind. Their server can host 100 guys, and, usually, 20-80 pilots are there.To finish with, i'll recommend this game. A lot. Plug your joystick, use TrackIR, and here you are!			",103,11,5,2,18,0,4

												I personally love this game and at this price it's a steal. Battle of Britain summer 1940 waas the most significant air campaign of WW11 and this game does it justice, in fact it's probably too detailed which is probably why the developers ran out of cash ! The scenery is stunning and the flight models are faithfully reproduced. I tried the Team Fusion mod for this and ended up reverting to the original vanilla game - I found the English Channel much better represented in vanilla, (the mod makes it look more like the Med), and also I prefer the sound of the .303 browning mg's in vanilla. Also the mod makes multi-engine German bombers too hard to shoot down with .303 ammunition, which kind of defeats the whole point of the game. I think Team Fusion have a German slant on this game ! If the battle had unfolded the way they've prtrayed it then I think we'd all be speaking German right now. The original game is recommended and compliments Battlesof Stalingrad and Moscow very well.			",57,7,0,1,21,0,29

Needs Team Fusion patches from the get go. I heard people complaining about windows 10 compatability, I have no issues whatsover with it.For single player, it is relatively weak, with lots of broken features that will hopefully get fixed in the future (AI don't follow commands, erratic behavior, lack of good and workings campaigns (There are some off course- but not like other titles) . But for online play with friends, or even better, squadrons, it is indeed fantastic.With DCS and Il2: Stalingrad getting better and better, the future for ww2 simming looks good, but Cliffs of Dover is still the best way to experience air war on the western front from your armchair.

												Simply the best combat flight simulator on the market. A trully stunning example of second world war aviation. If you have even the slightest interest in aviation, aviation history, the second world war, or just realistic simulators in general, this is a must purchase. The precision flight models are breath taking. Many flight simulators I have played feel as if you are playing as the aircraft itself. But in Cliffs of Dover, you get a real sense that you are the pilot flying the aircraft. It feels fluid and natural. Also people who do not have a high end system should not be put off by the immense graphical detail. I run it smoothly on high settings (as in screenshots above) with a 2.7ghz processor, 4gb ram (3 usable on 32bit Win 7) and a GTX 650 ti. Anything above that and you're laughing. Highly recommended title.			",2,0,0,0,1,0,5

												First let me say that I LOVE IL-2 Sturmovik and IL-Sturmovik Pacific and 1946.  They are great games and insofar as I can tell, not being a pilot myself very accurate flight sims. Alas, IL-2 Cliffs of Dover is not up to their previous efforts. It feels like they got bored halfway through development and never really finished. There is only one campaign (British) and it is lamentably short. The German side is just a series of missions.  There are no promotions, medals, et hoc genus omne as there were in the earlier games. Also missing (at least I can't find it) is the small HUD display that gave you airspeed, direction and altitude when you were in cockpit view. Accurate though the instrument panel may be, trying to read it in flight without spending two hours memorizing the layout first is . . . inconvenient.  The flight sim enthusiast who is truly dedicated (for which read 'crazed') can be expected to do this. I just want a quick indicator of airspeed and so on while still in cockpit view. Also missing is the time skip control so it's necessary to put the plane on autopilot and advance speed or else fly an actual two hour mission in real time. See comment about flight sim enthusiast above.  The trouble is when you run into the enemy when the speed is at 16x normal things can get a bit hairy . . .The quick mission builder is also nowhere near as good as previous versions where you could select almost any plane and a variety of maps and situations. In this one there are set scenarios and as far as I can tell you can't really adjust them. There is a full mission builder, but I never messed with that in the old games and I'm not touching it now as it was pretty complicated.  When I just wanted to shoot things down, the quick mission builder worked fine, when I wanted complicated, I started a career.Honestly compells me to admit that I actually bought this game two or three years ago, only to find my computer's graphics wasn't up to running it. So I've really only played it for the last week or so.Do I recommend it?  Yes. it's still a good flight sim if you buy it cheap. But it could -and should-have been so much better . . .

												 As has been mentioned many times here, this game was not up to snuff when it was first released but, to Team Fusion, we owe a great debt for salvaging a game many of us thought we had wasted a lot of money on.  The current price tag is an absolute steal for what you're getting.  I cut my teeth on Il-2 1946 which is a great game in its own right, but never at any time whilst playing 1946 did I EVER get the feeling that CloD provides.  From having my heart pound through my chest as I sneak up on somone, hoping they don't spot me, to flying formation with 2 or 3 other guys looking for trouble; the total appreciation for what these lads went through in reality becomes apparent very quickly.  Luckily, you get to come back from the dead, but if you can stay alive long enough to learn the same aerial combat lessons they did, you might just stand a chance yet. The community is also great.  Jump on TeamSpeak or post in the ATAG forums and ask questions.  No matter how simple or basic they may seem, someone is always willing to help.  This is plainly, as immersive as it gets.  Wonderful game. 10/10			",43,2,7,2,14,0,9

With the new flight sims being released its showing more that a game like this is going to be a classic and unlike any other game that has been released.This is a game that is going to get better and better as time goes on. Its exactly what a hardcore simmer is looking for REALISM. Sadly more sims being released in the future are gearing towards War Thunder type markets and diluting our flight sims for profit.Thats why Cliffs of Dover will forever be unique and standalone because of the immersion and realism un matched by any other sim yet in a multiplayer fashion.

												I'm quite happy with this. It's an older game, now, but with the Team Fusion mods its just incredible. I cranked up all of the realism right off the bat, and there is deffinitely a learning curve. I recommend doing some of the campaign missions first, to get a feel for things.I've been a fan of flight sims for a LONG time (I'd rather not show how old I actually am :p) and it's good to see the genre hasn't disappeared. If you don't have a joystick, then don't bother with this game. It really is a SIMULATION, it's not an arcade type game like Battlefield or Arma.			",56,20,1,8,11,0,2

												This is by far one of the best WWII Flight Sim's out there. I would recommend this game to everyone that is into Combat Flight Simulators. I would also say that anyone who get's this sim should also have TrackIR and get the Team Fusion Patches. I don't know what else to say other then this sim is awesome and it has everything one is looking for in a WWII flight sim.			",70,6,10,7,14,1,8

												Takes a hell of a lot to get this game air worthy on windows 8.1. Check the steam discussion about it. There is a patch to allow it to run. Then there are a bunch more patches to make the game into a game worth any time or attention. But after all the struggle, long downloads, and patching, it's a treat to fly something so authentic.

												Been playing fo a month now and I don't think I'll buy BOS until the price drops. I really have no need for another flight-sim at the moment. Very good online multiplayer expirience for my taste, for the last year I was playing WarThunder FRB/SB and haven't touched it since I set up CloD. Very nice and fulfilling game !			",23,2,2,2,8,0,4

												Okay so I got an urge to write about this game due to a number of reasons.  1 the constant stream of new pilots from war thunder's influence and 2, the developement and controversy of the new IL-2 Battle of stalingrad on steam.   I've had a copy of IL-2 Battle of stalingrad not on steam since early this year and  with the most recent update its clear they will not take the the IL-2 series where true fans want it to go.  It has become much less of a simulator than IL-2 Cliffs of dover has become which is is a sign that Il-2 games will never be the same.  That being said its safe to say in the future we probably won't get games offering the same experience that IL-2 cliffs of dover offers, at least not for a long time.   Cliffs of Dover with Team Fusion mod is the best ww2 combat flight sim experience you can get, even still, and like I said, it will be for a long time.  Also now its only 10$....thats a f.ucking steal.....srsly f.uck BoS and get this and grab team fusion mod instead,, BoS is sh.itEDIT edit: okay BoS is okay. what i wasnt clear about is that it just pis.ses me off when people act like team fusion mod doesnt exist when they say ""ohhh finally a worthy successor to il 1946"" cuz that was years ago with CoD and team fusion mods			",235,25,5,27,23,2,17

												Look this game was a really ambitous attemp.  It failed and even with the Team Fusion updates,  It just cannot compete with IL2 Battle of Stalingrad/Mosscow.  If money is an issue get this game as a stop gap.  IL2 BOS is where you need to be and its really not that much more money for a game that is growing and will be supported by devs for at least 5 more years...Team Fusion rocks but it takes years for updates and they still have tons of work to do even after the 5.0 patch is realeased and its not done yet either.  decent game its just dead/old compared to whats out now, that is all.

												I loved the original IL-2 and was hoping for more of the same.  Unfortunately, Cliffs of Dover just doesn't deliver.  Despite beautiful graphics, the game comes with limited options to customize aircraft and battles.  And the AI for single player is horrid.  The AI isnt the only thing thats horrid.  The music soundtrack was lifted right out of a romantic episode of Downtown Abby.  It's enough to make you retch.  To be fair, I have not played the Multiplayer version.  Only the campaign and single player scenarios.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm able to run Cliffs of Dover using the ATAG patches, but was hoping that I'd be able to play using my PS3 controller (Microsoft clone) rather than the keyboard or a joystick (I don't own the latter).  The store page indicates partial controller support which typically means (to me) that I can use one. Is there no way to use a controller with this game? I've successfully played this game on my old PS3 using a controller, why not on the Steam version?I really wish that this information would be easily promoted for each game on the Steam store page rather than needing to scan through the reviews and hope to come across a comment about controller support! I've bought a few games so far that I can't play because of this. I'm not a player who likes to use a keyboard to play.Thanks in advance for any helpful replies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Poor game I played a few of the single missions only, no campaign to talk of really, no immersion outside of the missions, rather slow performance when not over the sea. Can't recommend it really other than for the reasonably faithful plane models. A far better game overal is Battle of Britain II: Wings of Valour which, unlike this game, gives you hundreds of planes in the sky at any one time and it really feels like you are actually taking part in the Battle of Britain.Edit: this game no longer works without at least five mods being added to it. Its been abandoned by its developer/publisher. the Steam vanilla version DOES NOT FUNCTION. You have been warned.			",35,1,2,5,22,0,20

												Game sounds amazing, wish I could play it though, I have launched it multiple times and attempted to get into came, but about a minute into whatever I'm doing the entire game locks up. I've been on forums looking for awnsers and nothing helps. I've heard great things about IL-2 and want to actually be able to play it, but until I can, I can't give a positive review on this. If it finally gets changed in the future then I'll change the review.			",79,4,2,6,13,2,1

												No lie, I love the IL-2 franchise, but I have to say that when I bought this game I expected quite a bit more. Comparing it to IL-2 Sturmovik 1946, this game has far less content, and it is chock full of bugs. Granted, it obviously looks better and the physics engine works a lot better than the previous versions. As a gamer with an average PC, I would not reccomend this game. However, if you have a higher end computer, and are okay with slightly limited content, go for it! if you get to the actual combat, it's still fun ;D			",24,3,0,1,3,0,2

												This game is being sold BROKEN! It needs ~4gb of patches made by the fans (hats off to them) to be downloaded and installed in order to even be played. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!! DON'T Give it to UBISOFT and STEAM they are literally ripping you off! There is 0 excuses for this, UBISOFT should have known better and STEAM is in need of some serious FIXING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FIX IT! Not buying any games in protest until STEAM is fixed! But other than that, the game is great, exactly what I thought it would be, and more, it's even more complex than older IL-2 games. The world is great, detail on the ground didn't blow me away, not when you compare it with other games on the market today, but compared to old Il-2 games much better, more realistic, just great. Lighting and shadows are so much better and so are the models. Simply put, if you like older Il-2 games you are going to like this one.....when you get used to it :) It's just a shame, it didn't deserve what Ubisoft and Steam are doing...So until that is fixed, can't recommend it.

												As a fan of the old IL2 games I felt endlessly frustrated by this game.Things in IL2 1946 that I can't figure out how to do here:- bind camera to my mouse - get a speed gauge indicator on the HUD (As much as super realism is fun, it's really annoying to glance down with the pan stick on my joystick)- select plane loadout when making a quick mission- the reflex sight here doesn't move around like in 1946, it just disappears when you do a hard turn- bind a button to switch FOVOther frustrating things:- My monitors flash to black every time I go into or out of a menu, and on my VG248QE, it takes about 10 seconds to recover from that, this gets irritating really fast- When I hit esc in the menu while flying, my monitors flash to black, and then it doesn't exit me out of the menu- In quick mission, some of the planes only offer me an empty loadout- It has a select plane by year function but the range of years is 1900 to 2012 for some reason and the same plane is shown in both 1900 and 2012 and a couple other years I've clicked on- when I click the loadout button before quick mission, I can't edit my plane's guns. The buttons just don't work; if they're disabled for a reason, it could have at least told meTo add onto all of that, the variety of planes is fairly limited, compared to 1946. It would have been fine to only have a few, if I felt like they had a lot more depth or something than the ones in 1946, but they feel about the same. If anything, they feel a bit easier to handle.I don't see the point of buying this over 1946. 1946 just seems superior in every way. Maybe the flight model here is more realistic or something, but it's just so much less fun to play because of what's stated above.			",92,7,2,5,9,0,8

												Not sure about ""the best"" but one of the best fly sims.  Note that it is mandatory to use TEAM FUSION MOD. I couldn't even start the game without it. They put their time and pasion, and manage to turn mud in to gold. Yest there are way better planes out there, but this game really makes you feel like you are taking part in a WW2 battle, and at that there is no better sim. I do not recommand this game alone. My recommandation include the 3.1GB updates from Team Fusion. Please visit them at teamfusion.theairtacticalassaultgroup.com. Thank you guys.... Later onNow that I have a few hours in this sim, I am forced to chande my recomandation. Unfortunately even TF with all their pasion and hard work could not turn mud in to gold. this game has a huge problem detecting the objects, caculating force and mass. The result... a plane that will start turning on with engine on idle, or even with the engine turned off, planes that will not get to full speed to take of even at full throtle, the joystic sometimes does not work in game even when it is  configured in the settings,  and so on. In the original campaign  you can get a fly out of 6-7 tries but in the TF campaign, you got 100% broken missions, and by that I mean you can never take off,  you will spin around, you will start to move at about 80% throtle, and you will never go more then 40. I just went thru 20 tryes... in a row, and nothing is working, flaps, radiator, boost, nothing works. The rudder is ALWAYS to much left or right, and I don't mean my setup, but in the game, in game pedals moves slightly to the left or right and it is already way to much. This is not my first sim, DCS: P-51, FC3, A10-C, RoF, ♥♥♥♥♥hunde - simulator and in ANY of these I did not had this problems. I was going to get the newer IL-2 game also, but I am waiting for a free weekend or a demo to see how good it is. Maybe these problems are not present to all players, maybe there are mods for this... maybe, but if you buy the game, be aware that you can run in to these problems. TF is working on a new update and I hope they will manage to fix the game, I really do, but I honestly believe the problem is deep inside the game engine, and that is not somethong that you can easily fix. I would really love to play it since is the most immersive WW2 sim, so I will keep an eye on what TF is doing.			",86,14,6,7,17,0,14

SummaryThe original game was abyssmal, but the TF-community patch a couple of years later made it at least playable. However, it is still really flawed and is showing its age. For a few specific things it is okay, but in general I'd recommend against it.Full reviewIL-2 Cliffs of Dover (CloD) was a disaster when it was released with many serious bugs. An independent group (Team Fusion, TF) created a series of patches, the latest of which makes the game quite playable. It is to their credit that they could salvage so much given the flaws. This reviews assumes that the latest TF patch (Version v4.312) has been installed. I should also point out that I am reviewing this from the perspective of a bomber pilot - my aircraft of choice in this sim is the Ju 88 A-1, so my comments are specific to that. I have over 1000 hours flying time, most of which is on the multiplayer servers (the single-player campaigns are hopeless).CloD implements a handful of human-flyable aircraft (Hurricane, Spitfire, Blenheim, Tiger Moth, Bf 109, Bf 110, He 111, G.50, Br20M, Ju 87 and Ju 88). Some of these (especially the fighters) have several variants. For the most part, the graphics are nice and the basic mechanisms work. The flight models seem okay to me (although I'm not a real-life pilot, so my opinion counts little here). However, there are some issues. In the case of the Ju 88, which is the aircraft that I have the most experience, it is riddled with problems. For example: faulty bomb drop sequences, nodding in mode-22, incorrect cockpit lights, no side-slip on Lotfe, only partially implemented radio/navigation systems, non-rotating C-stand turret ring, no ATA-limits on manifolds, unable to look around to see the levers on the left-side of the pilot, limited view from C-stand position, no navigation lights, no landing lights, no MG-reload animation, MG-continual-firing sound bug, indicator lamps incorrectly wired up, fuel-♥♥♥♥♥ not working correctly, no dive-brake indicator, ILS not working in multiplayer... to name but a few. All these seriously detract from the sim and make it deeply frustrating at times. Furthermore, the last patch nerfed the gunners, making bombers even more susceptible to fighters and, thus, even more frustrating to fly.On the other hand, the graphics are good, the map is moderately large and there is a good selection of targets, AI aircraft, ground vehicles, etc. to enhance the environment. The damage models are good and the implementations (particularly of the matched first-rate fighters) is supposedly very good.Unfortunately, the last patch was mid-2014 and there are no further patches planned. TF are supposedly working on new material, but this will be for a completely different theatre, rather than the Battle of Britain. Although the TF patch is very good, it also encrypts the game, thus locking out other modding teams. As a result community effort, excluding TF itself, has been snuffed out, which is a pity. There are few historical servers left these days (ACG being the only one I am aware of, now that SoW has shut down), and the single-player campaigns are effectively non-existent for bombers. Furthermore, there are a lot of broken features in the game, preventing mission-builders from harnessing the full power of the simulator.In conclusion, given the starting point of CloD, through the work of TF, it has become the best Battle of Britain simulator about. I have certainly flown a lot of hours on this sim. However, it shows its age and it has become a developmental dead end. Unless you are specifically interested in the Battle of Britain, it would be best to consider other titles. Thus, on balance I'd recommend against this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can not recommend this game, due to the fact that it is completly broken and not being supported on steam, it seems.Reason listed1. on my windows 7 64 bit game will not start up it starts up then directly crashes to the desktop2. Windows 8 64 bit game starts up then directly crashes to the desktop - I have done hour and half of research it is knowen issue thats been around sense game been out and no patch there is a customer made third party patch that fixes this issue but it be nice if game devloper would fix it.3. on steam you get verison 2 but servers that are all up are running verison 4 so it wont work mutiplayer it is like company put game up on steam and just refuses to support the product on steam..

Not the best marketing tool...  Do not buy this game, or anything else connected with Steam or Ubisoft...  It's a racket to get you to buy everything through Steam so you will never really own anything and then when you change computers, locations or anything else they can resell everything to you again...

												I played a lot of Il2-1946 (before it even became 1946). That game had its faults but was good fun. This however, is not a game.Pros:+ Useful if you have a giant hard disk and want to fill it up a bit more.Cons:- Not compatible with recent versions of Windows.- There is a community patch (not a developer patch!), but I still couldn't get it to work on Windows 10.- When I played it (briefly) on Windows 7, the game actually felt and looked worse than Il2-1946.- This game was abandoned during development and patches stopped shortly after release, so is quite buggy.If you have an urge to play, just grab Il2-1946. It has a lot more planes. And it actually runs.			",75,6,7,3,10,0,12

												I bought a brand new high end machine JUST to play COD... and what a disappointment. Despite promise of stunning graphics and realism the game never really worked and ended up angering and frustrating me. The game simply wasnt ready when it was first published. Team Fusion updates have helped a lot but i never got to love COD as i did il-2 Sturmovik, MS Combat flight simulator and others.  graphics + realism 10/10.... gameplay 3/10... COD can only be recommended to anyone who wants a truely realistic WW2 Battle of Britain experience - and then you must still be prepared to struggle with various unofficial Team Fusion updates.

												Don't get Cliffs of Dover!If you want a top-tier flight sim with boogie-all content, get Battle of Stalingrad. In terms of presentation, user interface, and overall atmosphere & immersion, it's just that much better in every regard. Both have that great, classic Il-2 'feeling of flight', and I'll probably keep CoD kicking around on my hard drive for a while, but for your modern-day Il-2(tm) fix Battle of Stalingrad is where it's at.Both are great flight sims that focus on WW2, but Cliffs of Dover is *severely* annoying to (attempt to) use & enjoy. Stubborn user interface, unfinished everywhere, avoid it in favour of BoS.If you already have CoD, get all of the Team Fusion mods (they're up to 4.312 I believe) and it'll be that much better. Both sims just seem to have an unfinished feel to them, unlike Il-2 1946, but in CoD it's painfully apparent.If you want to start 'fresh', just get Battle of Stalingrad and save yourself the aggravation. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can get to the menu and such when first opening the game, but it problem after problem after problemafter problemafter problemafter problemafter problemafter problemafter problem.in fairness I am using a SLIGHTLY older laptop but even after the latest updates this game is worthless.
