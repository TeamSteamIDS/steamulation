												This game surprised me by how much fun it is. A simple strategy played with toy soldiers that somehow just reels you in. Very easy to pick up, yet it also provides a great challenge. You have three campaigns you can do, each with their own special perks in them. You also have the ability to control airplanes as well as sniper towers and tanks to help yourself out when things get a little overwhelming. It's a fun and quite frankly adorable game with a humorous story and loads of action. Without a doubt one of my favorite strategy games.			",371,58,4,49,2,1,15

												this game got me off guard :D i was placing it into my cart awaiting a simple Tower defence game... it is AWESOME some vehicle controls are clunky but the overal idea of placing turrets and at times manning your favorites is AWESOME and actually the battles are EPIC. the first time your enemy charges your lines makes you forget these are only toy figures. the fight is visceral and the whole has a real good war feeling.

I loved the idea and i played hours and hours of this game on the 360. Now i can play even more on the pc regardless, this game is so crafty and the soundtrack is absolutly BEAUTIFUL! I loved it so much i made a playlist in windows media player for when i feel old-timey. This game is just great and i highly suggest you get it. Its a great casual and strategic game :)			",113,16,0,11,17,0,22

Trench warfare is always legendry and the artilary and weapons you have and are able to control make this a fun game. The game is also very strategic at a harder difficulty and it isn't just mindless shooting. So purchase this game m8s !!!			",151,13,1,18,12,2,10

												I'm going to say it. I Hate Tower Defense. However, I loved this game. It is a new spin on the tower down Tower defense. You have the ability to take control of your turrets leading to hours of fun by hitting groups of infantry with a massive howitzer shell. The match starts you with a few seconds to a minute to prepare then the whistle is blown and both sides infantry charge. You have the ability to take control of the default defense, a Sniper tower, which provides a great overview, and chances to pick off pesky stragglers. On top of that, you have the ability to control authentic tanks, each equipped with a main cannon and Nossles on the side that fire gas or flames, or control Fighter-Bombers to shoot bomb enemy planes, Barrage balloons or bomb enemy formations. You can even control authentic looking Bombers with forward and backward facing machine guns. The bomber is equipped with a massive amounts of bombs that replenish after around 5-10 seconds. Great for taking out columns of infantry...or enemy artillery positions. That's right. On some missions, the enemy will have tower defense just like you, making building yours or destroying there's a lot more difficult.Now let's get to the boss. This game has some interesting bosses, that keep in the time period. Some are failed products, some are only concept some are straight out of the developers minds. With 10 hours plus, and I still haven't beat the other campaigns, this game is always fun, whether replaying old levels on Elite, where turrets you control only fire to playing just for fun, this game will be hours of fun.

												It's a pretty fun game. Kind of a tower defense game, but you can take over some of the units you place. I really like the theme and the fact that there's no blood. That way I can play it around my kids. It might not be better than sliced bread, but it's still a fun game.  I'd give it an 8 out of 10. :D			",379,84,18,86,88,2,85

												Toy Soldiers is a WW1 Based Tower defense game. A Great Strategy game, its entertaining and will always keep you coming back, The Game is challenging at some parts but it's Comedy and great gameplay keep you coming back, It's Plastic Soldiers are Hilarious and Are worthwhile to just watch as you Burn them, Blow them up, Shoot them down, and Even gas them. It's added feature in which you Get to Control your Placements directly adds to the fun, In most levels it gives you either a tank or a plane/bomber. These are a fun addition to Tower Defence gaming. However there are some parts where The Inner Console in this comes out in but not to much. Co-op is also present as you can play both locally and Online.  Keep in mind this game isn't really one of those you will spend alot of time playing, Its more of an every once and a while Game. Like if you want to play it in between as a break from all the serious Games. it pulls off the WW1 aspect amazinglyFor me I give it a 9/10, a great game and and I'd reccomend it to anyone who likes strategy games and Tower defence games, it is also an amazing game for those who like the genre of WW1 Games. Get it now!			",69,4,0,12,11,0,28

												Probobly the 2nd best RTS game with the legendy men of war series just beating it. This is a very challenging but fun game. The first few missions are pretty easy. After that it gets quite challenging. Which is good, it is really tense. The game has a very impressive arsnel ranging from vickers machine guns to 18 pounders etc. The graphics are not the best in what u expect in a stragetic RTS and men of war defeinatly beats it, however it fits the game. Its not an extremly realistic game that will die of bordom after about an hour , its challenges keeks you playing until you win. Probobly the only thing the realy matters in this game is 1 thing, There is no Multiplayer or Co-op missions which really matters at high lvls. Like 2 objectives to defend with swarms and swarms of enemies at both objectives as seen in mission ten, some missions are almost impossible to complete but you keep on going to achieve victory. This is a very fun game with alot of potential. I would highly reccomend buying it. As updates go by multiplayer may be added so over time certain parts may become false and out of date, as for now thats about it. This game is well worth buying for people new to stragery and RTS games. From me 8/10 Sweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												Toy Soliders is a tower defense game with childhood charm by using toy soldier, tanks, and airplanes as the models. At anytime the game allows you to command any tower and also includes playable tanks and airplanes to aid in your defense. Each level has its own unique design and offers a challenge. I was able to obtain General rank (no lives lost) on all the original and DLC levels by playing the level a couple of times to figure out all the spawn points and what the best strategy is. There's also a Survival mode that randomizes each wave for infinite replayability. If you're a tower defense fan or just looking for a game with tons of action, this is your game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Toy Soldiers, is a single-player tower defense game released in 2012. It was developed by Signal Studios and published by Microsoft. The game is set in World War I, which I believe is historically factual, and allows you, the player, to play as the British and Germans in the two main campaigns, and the French in the smaller third campaign. The idea of the game is you defend your Toy Box from enemies of waves. This is an very simple and neat independent game fit for the casual fan. This review will cover the campaign and level design, the gameplay, performance, the issues, and other minor details.The campaign has four campaigns. The first is the main original campaign featuring 12 missions. You play as the British that defend your position against the attack Germans and their units. The second campaign is 12 missions and encompasses the same maps as the first campaign. The only difference is after the completion of the first campaign as the British, you play as the Germans that attempt to retake those positions in a tower defense manner. The third campaign is 3 missions and you play as the French defending against the Germans. The fourth is an additional 3 mission campaign that you defend against the Germans, which have alien-like units. The campaign's basically recount battles in World War I with backstory, meaning there is no original story. This is nothing bad as it is refreshing to have a game set in WW1. I particularly enjoyed the first and third campaign. The first campaign was very good primarily because it was original and enjoyable. For instance, the campaign had a variety of level designs that fit the historical aspect. The third campaign was fun as you were allowed to play as the British with different level designs. As you can tell, I highly liked this game as two campaigns out of three had various levels. Furthermore, the second campaign was sound, however it became very boring as it progressed that I did not finish it because it featured the same maps as the first campaign. While it was refreshing to have night battles and have it be more challenging, I found it highly repetitive. Also, it continued based off the first campaign. For instance, the first campaign required the British to defend against the Germans. The second campaign required the Germans to retake those British-held positions from the first campaign and then defend against a counterattack. I found that to be thoroughly well done. Lastly, I do commend the layout of all the maps, as it added to the game.Toy Soldiers featured beautiful artwork alongside light-hearted animations of characters, which captured the overall bubbly feel of the game despite being set in WW1. Furthermore, the game allows you to control the units you build. For instance, I took screenshots in the battles and I had an artillery unit that I controlled and when it shot, one of the little troopers fell off the platform and had to climb back up, which was funny. The game features playable aircraft and tanks. This is a brilliant and immensely fun feature because one wave will have aircraft, so instead of having Anti-Aircraft units defend against the aircraft, you can launch your airplane and dogfight. It is limited to an extent as these aircrafts are not scripted to attack you, rather always attack your toy box and units. The controlling of units fits with the destruction graphics, as buildings, walls, trees, so forth can be destroyed, adding a layer of realism into the game. There are features in the game that I felt could have been expanded on or features that could have been added in the game. For instance, the first wave of every map has an army of your soldiers running onto the battlefield and attacking the enemy units. While this makes for a very cool visual, I felt this could have been expanded upon, just to add some variety into the gameplay. Furthermore, I assume the playability of tanks and aircraft was to counter the limited number of units in the game, as there were only five units in the game with three upgrades. I do somewhat like this approach as playable aircraft and tanks mix up the gameplay of the game, but maybe one-two more units would have benefitted the game. Lastly, the game would have highly benefitted from a feature that is normal in the tower defense genre, the ability to choose what soldiers our units should attack. For example, I should have the ability to 'tell' my mortar team to attack the last units in its range. I felt this slightly hurt the game.The game has a very nice soundtrack that expresses the nature of WW1 and the music within the years of WW1. Within the game, the soundtrack does frequently glitch when controlling units and through the animations. This is nothing too damaging, though it can get annoying.I had very little performance issues with the game. For the most part, I had a solid 60 FPS. Only one occurrence I dropped to 55+.There are some minor issues with the game other than the ones already documented. Things that made the game much more harder was the bug where I could not build a unit on a very important placement. Moreover, there was no saves while in battle, which is very annoying, as things like crashes and little mistakes in-game would have required you to start from the beginning.Toy Soldiers is a simple and nice game. It features fun gameplay elements and enjoyable campaigns. It correctly executes the little things that spice up the game like the animations of soldiers, the playability of aircrafts, and the soundtrack of the game. This game is good, but it has potential to be even better by fixing the issues, expanding on the core gameplay, and differentiating the second campaign. I played most of this game in 10 hours, though I would say with finishing all campaigns and achieving the extras like achievements, a person can probably get up to 20 hours with the game. At $9.99, I would recommend this game, however, I do not because there is a sequel titled 'Toy Soldiers: Complete'. The Complete edition has Toy Soldiers and the sequel Toy Soldiers: Cold War, and more and is priced at $15. I totally recommend skipping this and buying the Complete edition.Campaign: 7.5/10Gameplay: 7.75/10Sound: 7/10Performance: 10/10Replay ability: 6.5/10Overall: 7.75/10Thanks for reading my review!

												This game is one of those Tower Defense games with a wonderful twist which allows you to actually man the very tower yourself.  When you defend against waves,  the waves looks pretty real like in war.   This game does a good job of immersion in that aspect.   So if you like:  WW1 theme with good immersion,  manning a tower yourself, tower defense genre,  and challenge levels to go for?  Then you will enjoy this game!  +Recommended.

												Just a short and quick review here. Got the game for next to nothing on sale. If you're familiar with old tabletop wargames using miniatures, the title pretty much tells it all: You get a set of toy soldiers and other units from WWI era. The tanks have a little key on the side and look vaguely like old tin toys. I have a great fondness for these things, but that's me. I openly own and admit my admiration for tabletop wargamers with meticulously well-painted miniatures. It's fine for what it's supposed to be, but don't expect actual tabletop warfare of that nature. This is more of a romantic homage without the bits that really appeal to adult fans of the hobby. Still, it's not awful, just not for everyone. You get more of a tower defense game with specific points where you can place specific units. You can climb in and take over a given unit to improve accuracy and excitement, or you can just allow matters to run their course. You probably really need to get in there and fight to win. Strategic aspect of this game is very low, at least on easy. I'm not interested in playing this on a higher difficulty because I really don't see it being anything more than what it is: Arcade action with toy soldiers and various era-specific units. If you have a romantic interest in this type of thing, maybe check it out for a dollar or two. I like it okay, but I won't be playing it a lot. I'd rather play actual tabletop miniature games than this to be honest.			",135,27,5,27,19,0,17

It is simple to get into with the typical tower defense game formula, but changes it up by allowing you to take control of each defense, Ranging From shooting machine guns to flying planes.

You can select the unit you'd like to control the guns, purchase different types at certain strategic locations.  Can even jump into an biplane and bomb the toy train spewing toy tanks onto the play battlefield from one its iron cars.  Tons of silly toy fun and lots strategy!			",158,12,5,25,33,0,47

												It's a simple and somewhat linear tower defense game. I say somewhat linear because your towers are limited to static build platforms. You can't just place a tower anywhere, it has to be on these preplaced platforms so strategically speaking it's not that difficult. The one redeeming factor is there are pilotable vehicles on each battlefield. You can either pilot a medium tank, a heavy tank, a fighter plane or a bomber plane. You may also take control of any tower so these factors make up for the linearity of the tower placements.The one thing I didn't expect is there are boss battles, and these bosses are surprisingly fun to fight with. You got super trains, massive blimps, super tanks, and big♥♥♥♥♥laser-shooting robots. Each boss has a unique attack style and it's a new challenge each time. It's not just a simple HP ganking game, some of these bosses have tricks up their sleave which negates ganking and it's not game breaking at all. It's very fun, in-fact. Keeps it interesting.Towers have 3 tiers of upgades which makes them more useful as you get more money. I've noticed that sometimes upgrading isn't necessary. For example, a level 2 machine gun tower is actually better than a level 3 machine gun tower because the level 3 tower has such a slow fire rate that it misses most of the time. ""Sometimes"" a tier 1 anti-aircraft gun is all you need. I say sometimes because a tier 1 anti-aircraft gun can take down enemy fighters and bombers within a few seconds. The only levels where I needed to upgrade to tier 2 or 3 is when there are enemy blimps, And you really only ever need one anti-air tower with the exception of two maps where they spam air units in the end (dirty tactic that almost got me).The sound design is great but the tower gun sounds seem a little quiet. It's loud when you're beside the tower but sounds like a distant whimper when you're in the overhead view. Sounds also sometimes glitch out. A few times, my tanks made no cannon sounds or engine sounds, the tank was completely devoid of noises. Things like that and noises cutting in and out kind of breaks immersion a little bit.Tip: Use tier 3 toxic towers near the entrance of your base in survival. Place tier 3 artillery towers and turn them towards your toxic towers. It doesn't say this in the tooltip but toxic towers slow all units including tanks. This gives your artillery towers time to reload and completely wipe the floor with them. Then it turns into a turkey shoot.Pros:Fun maps.Challenging enemies and bosses.Pilotable vehicles.Story, Story+, Kaiser, and Invasion campaigns. 4 campaigns with lots of strategic fun.Good art design and humourous animations.Good variety of tower types.Survival mode with endless enemies and bosses.Cons:No replay value (Survival mode isn't enough to save it from this either).Uses GFWL for friend scores (friend scores don't work).No co-op or multiplayer.Tower placements are linear.Sniper tower sometimes blocks artillery fire arcs.Vehicle air controls are somewhat frustrating.Neutral:Great sound design (when it works)I didn't listen to the music so I can't comment on the game's music. I turned it off immediately.UI menus are a little touchy.Alt is a pause button but it doesn't let you move the camera or do anything, for that matter.Levels start immediately giving little time to prepare.Sniper towers are only useful against light infantry. Weak against anything else.That's the gist of it, I guess. 9/10 for a single-player game. Had great fun with this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really fun and challenging game that forces you to replay scenarios and consider tactics before moving onto the next challenge. After having played the campaigns, the tongue-in-cheek alien invasion levels were heaps of fun.I bought this game on sale and it was definitely worth it. A high level of replayability makes this game worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally had this for my Xbox 360 as an arcade game, but that was YEARS ago. Toy Soldiers is a tower defense strategy based game revolving around WW1 based action figures fighting to the death to either destroy your base, or defend it. Your mission is to defend your base, or Toy Box from the enemy. Your Toy Box will take damage if an enemy troop reaches it, and if enough troops make it to your Toy Box, you loose the level. Along with numerous variants of troops (soldiers, tanks, planes, ect) you have a variety of turrets to deploy as well. From artillery to machine guns, to even gas, finding the perfect set is sometimes challenging(I Recommend using a healthy diet of Machine Guns and Mortars with a pinch of Artilery). For every enemy killed you gain money for upgrading turrets and repairing them. Your turrets will attack automatically, but you can control them to kill enemies while earning boosted money drops and damage. There are numerous maps to play through and a total of 3 campaigns to smash though, each having bosses and funny moments. For someone whose never heard about this fun and cool game, I HIGHLY recommend this game. 9/10			",67,5,0,7,8,2,5

												Toy Soldiers is a great tower-defense strategy game that is hindered by technical limitations. First of which is the use of Game of Windows Live which is now patched to become voluntary. The Second is the game's limitation on screen resolutions, although the popular 1920x1080 was patched in. Others who run higher than that are at a loss. Aside from those issues, Toy Soldiers is great fun offering an immersive, but playful atmosphere. One of the game's star features is the ability to control individual units from machine gun nests to mortars, aircraft, tanks, etc. Toy Soldiers is packed for fun and offers a number of campaigns that will leave you satisfied and entertained.

												Bombs whistle overhead, exploding into hot pieces of plastic that rain down upon the young boys and old men hiding in the french soil below. Broken barbed wire, shattered wood and dead lifeless plastic scatter the land, with the distinct sound of airplane engines roaring up in the grey skies. Machine gun fire snuffs out the cries and moans of mutilated plastic. Then megatron crushes the laser ship that the french had, and if you thought that wasen't enough, a giant dog 50 times the size of any man comes crashing down, chewing up soldiers like they were beef jerky. This is the First World War.. kinda.You play with plastic sets of Signal toys to wage war with your imagination. (like so many of us did back when we were young) Allied forces fight against the Germans in famous battlefields, with seriousness and sillyness mixed together to take the edge off while also keeping you interested. It's set up as if you are a child playing with a friend or by yourself, playing out battles with plastic soldiers and tanks. I use to love doing this when I was a child, making the sounds with your mouth and using your hands to simulate explosions. You mostly defend using stationary towers. You sometimes have to attack positions to take new locations. You can only place certain towers in certain areas and money is required to buy, repair and upgrade each enplacement. Money is earned by destroying units, placements and getting combo kills on units. Larger zones allow for flak to take care of those pesky planes and blimps and artillery to destroy vehicles or large groups of infantry. Machine guns, mortars and gas are the 3 smaller enplacements and they are deal with more of the smaller and weaker enemies like infantry, calvary and rifleman. All of these towers can be upgraded 3 times, each time giving them different statistics, good and bad. Each level will give you options on what and how to build to complete the job at hand.On certain missions, you also get to use different vehicles, like two different tanks, one with gas and a cannon and the other with flamethrowers and a cannon. Two different planes are also given to you: a fighter with machine guns and limited bombs and a bomber with smaller machine guns but unlimited bombs that regenerate over time. All these vehicles can be destroyed or left and will respawn after a short delay. A sniper tower is also usually there, allowing you to take our enemies before your towers even have range.There are 12 levels with several different difficulties, each increasing the health, damage and amount of enemies on the battlefield. After completing a level, you will be giving a score and rank according to how well you played during the mission. This is determined with how much money you had at the end of the level, how much time you saved during rounds and the difficulty you played on. There is also a side mission in each level, that gives you a ration item which appears in the showcase. These can be completed by finishing the requirements (like getting a 25x combo with explosives)A survival mode is also present for when your done the campaign or just taking a break between levels. It allows you to see how long you can survive waves of enemies before you are overrun.About 10 hours of gameplay between survival, campaign and achievement hunting. Unless you are okay with replaying the same levels with different play styles, there isn't a ton of replayability, but it really worth the time and money.Personal Rating: 4.5/5			",84,36,2,21,13,0,16

												Got the game on sale for about a dollar. Works fine on an XP computer. Haven't really played a tower defense game before. Has two 12 missions campaigns and two 3 side mission campaigns and a survive mode. On my first play thru on normal level for the first campaign took about 8 hours to finish. Maybe around 30 minutes to finish the latter mission. You can go to 3rd person mode and take over units you deployed. Your tank is rather OP, but it did take me awhile to find out that there was a seconday fire button. There is only 5 unit choices so I have a feeling most player's defense will look the same. The only annoying part of that game was when there was a big boss battle and you couldn't beat him so you had to start the level over again or if that one guy got thru ruining your ""general"" victory status. I think it was a dollar well spent, but there really isn't any replayabilty after you finish the missions and whether or not you go for the achievements or play harder difficulty levels.

												An okay tower defense-ish game set in World War I. I really liked the aesthetic and some of the gameplay (you can take control of guns for a damage bonus and better aim), but there are some serious flaws. For example, the levels could use checkpoints so that when I fail at the very end of the last level of the game, I don't have to go through the entire thing again... Tanks also move excruciatingly slow.			",680,270,14,90,52,8,108

												Toy soldiers is an indy I wish more games would follow. It's not the greatest of games but does provide a little fun and would appeal to a younger generation. I recommend this game precariously. I would only buy it on sale. The game's pretense is a tower defense where when the game starts soldiers begin to charge at the enemy, as well as the enemy begins coming towards you. You are able to build different WW1 ""defense"" towers which are howitzers, machine guns, or artillery. What is cool is you are able to control these units independently. For this reason I bought the game. Towers can be upgraded and a sniper tower is always at the players disposal. The objective is to protect your toy box from invaders. Levels at the end sometimes have giant bosses (like this huge howitzer moving thing) that you have to take down.The one issue though is that you cannot send or control the initial units that charge at the enemy or defend your towers. Rather they charge blindly and die, and cannot be re-used or re-trained or re-built. I find this is the games greatest downfall. Although recommended by me (but not officially on steam), I'd have to give it a max of :RATING : 6.5/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												A static tower defence game that isn't so static. A nice little indie set in WWI, pitting waves of increasingly irate soldiers against your emplacements that stoically defend your base. Oh, and if you want to win, you're going to have to aim some of those machine guns, burn infantry to a crisp in a tank and jump in a plane every so often to bomb the hell out of them.

												If you have ever played with toy soldiers as I did this game will be real fun for you. The rule is simple protect your toy box against atacks of planes, soldiers, tanks, big bosses and others nasty things with MGs, cannons, aa guns etc. which you can buy and upgrade. You can take direct control over your ""turrent"" or if its boring for you on some maps you can control tank, sniper or planes. This all gives a lot of fun, driving over enemy wave of infantry with tank, making kamikaze atack with plane. If you look for a challenge there is ""do it all by yourself"" (literally) mode where turrents wont make a shoot without your direct control.Bonus: When you see 40 toy soldiers killed by 1 upgraded cannon shot, more killed by MG and last of them finished by flames or chemical weapon you realised how World War 1 soldiers lifes was ♥♥♥♥ed.

												Toy Soldiers is a cheap yet very addictive and fun game.In basic sense its a tower defence game with the choise to command towers giving you bonsuses for doing so.The game is easy enough, later levels may have you screaming at stupid AI towers aiming but overall raging is down to a minimum. The graphics are great and the maps rather large. A good balance and Strategy is need but overall it can be repetitive at times. About 7 hours in and i've completed the main game yet there are two more modes playing as the Germans and a Survival mode for extra replay. You get 4 towers all with three upgrades.My only problems are the max supported res is 1680 x 1050 and no graphical options. In others words a pure console port.A great game, very cheap and well worth the price. This type of game is up my street so 9.0/10 - Looses marks for poor graphics options and lack of diverse towers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probobly the 2nd best RTS game with the legendy men of war series just beating it. This is a very challenging but fun game. The first few missions are pretty easy. After that it gets quite challenging. Which is good, it is really tense. The game has a very impressive arsnel ranging from vickers machine guns to 18 pounders etc. The graphics are not the best in what u expect in a stragetic RTS and men of war defeinatly beats it, however it fits the game. Its not an extremly realistic game that will die of bordom after about an hour , its challenges keeks you playing until you win. Probobly the only thing the realy matters in this game is 1 thing, There is no Multiplayer or Co-op missions which really matters at high lvls. Like 2 objectives to defend with swarms and swarms of enemies at both objectives as seen in mission ten, some missions are almost impossible to complete but you keep on going to achieve victory. This is a very fun game with alot of potential. I would highly reccomend buying it. As updates go by multiplayer may be added so over time certain parts may become false and out of date, as for now thats about it. This game is well worth buying for people new to stragery and RTS games. Buy it! Buy it now!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great. The contols felt wonky at first and you can't change them. But it gets better with more game play to catch on to the controls. Not sure what mode I played first but when I went to campaign mode it was easier to catch on.There just aren't many WW1 games and it has toy soldiers on top of it, nice combo.I haven't played it that much but it looks like it just gets better with things unlocked. There was even UFO's on one level.I recomend this game the sale price is right.			",233,32,9,7,19,5,33

												Toy Soldiers is a cheap yet very addictive and fun game.In basic sense its a tower defence game with the choise to command towers giving you bonsuses for doing so.The game is easy enough, later levels may have you screaming at stupid AI towers aiming but overall raging is down to a minimum. The graphics are great and the maps rather large. A good balance and Strategy is need but overall it can be repetitive at times. About 7 hours in and i've completed the main game yet there are two more modes playing as the Germans and a Survival mode for extra replay. You get 4 towers all with three upgrades.My only problems are the max supported res is 1680 x 1050 and no graphical options. In others words a pure console port.A great game, very cheap and well worth the price. This type of game is up my street so 9.0/10 - Looses marks for poor graphics options and lack of diverse towers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game got me off guard :D i was placing it into my cart awaiting a simple Tower defence game... it is AWESOME some vehicle controls are clunky but the overal idea of placing turrets and at times manning your favorites is AWESOME and actually the battles are EPIC. the first time your enemy charges your lines makes you forget these are only toy figures. the fight is visceral and the whole has a real good war feeling. liking it so far :) Any change i will modify this review if not than i still like it a lot			",228,32,12,19,31,2,20

												Both the greatest WW1 game and greatest tower defence game ever made. Not as smooth as the original X-Box 360 version but still brilliant.Fantastic for those who want a different style of tower defence game, or have any interest in the Western Front of the First World War. Does a wonderful job with making the setting enjoyable yet respectful to the horrendous business that the Great War was.The sequel Cold War is amazing (the ported WW1 content not so much) and the third game is garbage.

												Visited Ypres last week, including trenches and mortar craters. Wanted to play a WW1 themed game and came across Toy Soldiers. First level is about the siege of Ypres so very relevant. Feels good now to set up 4 howitzers and use a machine gun and flamethrower to mop up the rest. Great game!			",72,15,0,15,19,2,51

												Not your traditional tower defense game in that you don't design mazes or have many predefined routes.  Instead you have to decide the best weaponary to buy for a designated areas.  You also have the option to control a tower and/or a plane/tank.  This adds a little hands-on action to the game so you don't get bored.  As you get better in the game, you'll often find that you need to think and act quick during some of the more intense moments.  The PC version includes two expansion packs, and a set of new maps are unlocked after you finish the normal campaign.  Add in a survival mode and this is a very good value.  FYI... I currently have world-wide first place PC rankings in all the survivor modes.  See if you can beat my times!			",243,49,1,8,12,0,34

												Toy Soldiers is one of those rare Beer and Pretzels games that has both a real tactical and goofy fun component that really works. If you dont use your money wisely and place your weapons correctly, you are screwed. However it is also tremendously fun and can get a real laugh out of me , like when a heavy shell blasts guys hundreds of feet in the air. The variety of weapons and differeant kinds of destruction they deal out is great. mIt is also fun to get into the weapons and deal out the punishment yourself. I hope they will add new content to it soon. This game is a blast for New or Old Guard Gamers. Buy It and Enjoy !			",14,1,0,13,18,0,35

												There's no better premise for a tower defence game with a bit of driveable vehicles than a game played with actual toys and miniatures. It also gets the period extremely well, and by period I mean Modern, not actual war. There are some levels that do remind you of how horrible it actually was but overall it's just gassing them tin Kaiser soldiers for jolly ol' fun (yes, there is a gas brigade miniature).The gameplay mechanics themselves are pretty standard fare but you can take manual control of any tower or a tank/plane  provided the level has one, plus there is a combo system only working in manual control. The highest, Elite difficulty, has any tech work only if you have it on manual; but that just seems more suitable for the types counting seashells and putting them in straight lines, so I skipped it.In total there are 18 levels (12 original + 3 in DLC1 + 3 in DLC2), NG+ and a survival mode. That seemed enough for me, especially for the chump change I bought it.Grafics do show its age, since it's Xbox 360 game and all, but they still seem rather nice-looking, in my opinion. Music was also OK but nothing too special.Bottom line, if you want a good WW1 tower defence game, this is just for you. HOWEVER, devs seem to be combining previously 360-only sequel and this game in one nice package. It's in Early Access now but you know how Early Access can be so decide for yourself.P.S.: There is NO GFWL forced on you: you can choose between two versions (Steamworks and the one you'll never play) on launch. Don't worry about that.			",215,34,5,15,16,0,50

There are minor nuisances to the game that could have been avoided that give it a little bit of a learning curve and more difficult than it has to be.

												Tired of playing the same old boring Tower Defence? Do you crave for more WW1 themed games instead of all this modern warfare rubbish we get fed every single dang day? Maybe this game might interest you...Toy Soldiers is a game about little army men duking it out on various gameboards, one side having to defend themselves against waves of the enemy using tactical placement of machine guns and artillery, as well as deploying early tanks and aircraft to help weakin the attacking force until they can no longer charge your HQ. At first, it might not sound like much, but once you start playing you fall in love with this well made game.For one, WW1 is the perfect setting for a tower defence game, considering the infamous nature of the war. What also helps set this apart from other TD games is how much more ""open"" it is when it comes to dealing with enemy waves. In most TD games, enemies march in single file, which honestly is a rather underwhelming display of power and tactics.. While in a way, they still march towards you in a line here, it is a much looser, more widened line, making it feel more like an enemy army is charging at you rather than a big cluster of random thugs effortlessly walking towards your base. Also unlike other TDs, in some maps you have to go on the offencive in order to win the day, which caught me off guard when it happened and amused me quite a bit when I was given control of an early tank and sent to take ground for my defending force and expand my influance on the battlefield.There is plenty of content to keep you busy for a fair few hours as well, so your money doesn't go to waste should you invest in this title. I wish I could go on, but I don't want to drone on and on about all the good things about the game. The only problem this game has is that it might not work on all computers, due to it being a port of an Xbox game.. But if you can get it to work, it is a lovely game to play, and if you love the first World War, I do suggest you get this delightful title if you can afford it.			",101,10,3,2,12,2,15

												This game is a great adaptation of the classic tower defense game style. It simulates you playing with a massive set of World War I toy soldiers. Instead of just sitting around watching your towers destroy troops, you can control towers, tanks, and planes, as well as launch assaults against the enemy. Very fun, intense, and engaging.There are 4 playable campaigns where you play as the Germans, British, and French (I haven't done the 4th one yet, think it's Americans?). Each one offers unique challenges with hours of gameplay.			",98,11,0,2,5,0,8

												I did not expect anything after the game interesting. I sometimes play a game of Tower Defence, but only just about, out of boredom. So what could I expect from Toy Soldiers? Apparently nothing, and there .. the game sucked me in many hours of gameplay. An interesting idea for a war with plastic toy soldiers, toys. For this idea except that they can shoot from land, it is really great, and finally you really can not get bored of the game Tower Defense. The game has a really great atmosphere and everyone who likes Tower Defense indeed almost love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's alright. Not near as good as the 90% user score would lead you to believe. I got it in the winter sale for a dollar and that's a much better deal than its normal $10 price tag. Pass on this unless you can get it for $5 or less. It is nothing special and is very simplistic, but is still fun for a once through. Some levels infuriate me because they have to be done a certain way with exact towers in exact spots. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate when tower defense games do that garbage. Mostly though it has been a pretty decent game. The tank controls suck because they get sorta reversed when backing up but the plane controls are surprisingly fine. The sounds also cut in and out sometimes when lots of♥♥♥♥♥♥is going on which really sucks♥♥♥♥♥ But not in every mission. There's also a weird texture flicker that looks like it might have something to do with anti-aliasing or shaders or something.6/10 I would've given it a 7 had it not been for the aforementioned technical issues.

												A damn fine tower defense game. A game where you can actually command your units. It doesn't look all that bad either, but there's way too much bloom in it. The game itself can be finished in roughly 4 or 5 hours and after that you can play the DLC, of course. Also, a fast forward button would've been nice to have because units move at a fairly slow pace.And the game doesn't support really high resolutions (2560x1440), which is a shame. I thought this would be fixed with a patch, but unfortunately that never happened.Still, a good game ![Rating: 77/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												Ok, first off, for you people out there who think I don't have the right to make a review even though I have played for a small time(my hours played will grow), I had this game on Xbox 360, and it was amazing. This is one of the greatestt WW1 Strategy-Turn-Based game. I love the option of you being able to go into your weapon you planted. The AI aren't sometimes the brightest but they get the job done. I usuall just go into the option so I can use the weapon. I had a couple dollars so I though of buying this. I ended up buying it on Steam of course because I knew it was going to be fun. So when I started it up, I just played for hours. I had tons of fun. I must say if your a kid and your parents don't like ""bloody"" games, Well then get this they just blow up into little Toy pieces of there ""toy"" body. To be honest I must say it does look old timey, so it matches perfectly with the WW1 setting, also I might have to add that the toys look very much like toy figures. Well that's all I really have to say about this game. Just buy it. I bought this on sale for $2, but if I had to pay $10 I would, this game is all worth it.			",136,10,1,16,6,0,3

												When one speaks of the first World War, it simply comes to peoples minds of heavy usage of trenches that streatched for miles. For some history buffs and on lookers, they would think the same, but they would also know the more in depth fact that millions of lives were lost from the half a square mile between the trenches, or in other various locations around the globe. And lastly but ultimately, generals on all sides treating their army as if they were toy soldiers. My point being: nearly all generals thought that every citizen in their home country would be so infurated with national pride that thered be an exspendable, almost endless supply of recuirts. Unfortunately, this caused the deaths of nearly 11 million people. Anyway, this isnt a history lesson. That was just a little historical review of the games appropriate setting for that era.Normally when you think of someone making a WW1 game itd be, needless to say, boring since the whole thing was a stalemate and that it was, but engagements went on for nearly weeks upon months. In Toy Soldiers, the battles that are chosen for each level are very accurately selected, and even the historical date and location and even some promises made by some generals who were there. but if you thik youll be waiting for 20 minutes at a time for something interesting to happen, youll find yourself proven wrong. The levels, in the least to say, get very epic at times, not only in scale but to the point where your brain is operating to manage all the incoming enemy waves. And trust me, theres not jsut simpel infantry and occasional tanks, there are several kinds of Infantry, Armored, Airborne, even bosses that are sometimes extrodianarily hard to defeat and each havign a unique look and style.Your mission, is simply to defend your trench *cough cough* Toybox *cough* from these waves. Even at your desposal are several kinds of Machine guns, AA guns, anti infantry guns, and even occasionaly player controled offencive-defencive airborne and armor units of your own. And the really exciting part is that each can be upgraded to better defend yourself, and it quickly becomes somewhat of a mian side priority next to defeating the enemy. Since i want to wrap this up in seperate sections so i dont make you lost, ill say the final conclusion setences:1st: Toy Soldiers is a simple game. its setting, objectives, and graphics are respectable but this game isnt really striding to become the top game of tower defence or what you have since it really dosnt feel liek tower defence all the time.2nd: If you love the feeling you get when you play a game and get this really sensational 'buzz' or 'drive' to get your brain operating fast and your attentions faster, this IS the game for you. 3rd: I have to add this part so you dont feel that the games soundtrack is on a loop; the games themes are randomly picked everytime you go to the menu. And unfortunately, theres only 3. But all quite good to say the least. Not everybody loves vinatge music from the early radio or record player era but i certianly do. So if your into pre, post, WW1 music, or anything between 1914 and 1939, you wouldnt mind this too much at all. 4th: I cant really say anything for the multiplay since it never really felt satisfying. its cool to play Offencive Defencive but it seemed a bit alien. if it was faster paced, id give it a good word but its not really to my liking unfortunately. All in All, im in nuetral stance for its Multiplayer mode, and its more up to you as far as what you feel towards it.So if you wanna pass the time a bit, Toy Soldiers, is definately a game worth the money. PS: i wont be leaving a review for Toy Soldiers: Cold War mostly for the fact that it kinda takes an odd turn down a GI Joeish world. And after playing it during the WW1 struggle, it really dosnt feel cool to jump to the 1950s through 70's. World War One is kinda my only perf for it. Howver, i would LOVE to see a coastal defence expansion, or a more broad spectrum as afar as fronts around the world. it would add so much more to the devine scale of the First World War.

												An extremely fun tower defense game themed around The Great War. The style of the game is set out like a child's toybox/ tabletop game. There are a wide variety of defensive units to choose from such as the machine gun crew, mortars and artillery. You get to take control of these units one at a time and that includes tanks, which are extremely useful for assaults. There is also aircraft in the game which makes for some fun dogfighting and bombing runs. All your units can be upgraded to your personal level of satisfaction and barbed wire can be placed to slow down the advancing enemy. A highly addictive and enjoyable game with a unique aesthetic style that doesn't take itself too seriously.			",152,26,1,5,8,1,6

												I got the game all excited because I like ww1 things and games. I got it, loaded it up and realized that the curser was off so when I went to put the  anti infantry guns in where the curser was I'd have to go down and to the left a bit for it to register which wasn't a big deal but when I beat the level I couldn't hit the continue button so I can't get past level one so I don't want to give this a thumbs up, but I don't want to give it a thumbs down either. I want to give it a eh rating, but for the sake of the problem I have to go with the thumbs down.			",32,2,1,7,9,0,10

A touch of nostalgia 
A Screenshot of Toy Soldiers
By: Deltatech




Toy Soldiers is a game of nostalgia, What we were all thinking of when we played with those cheap little plastic army men that EVERYONE had back in the day. This game does a better than good job of recapturing that feeling of playing soldier.The gameplay is simple and you can get to playing quickly.It is a desktop defense type game.Upgrades are unlocked through completion of levels.I like signal studios as a developer and think they did a good job, they just picked the wrong publisher.Even though I really enjoy playing this game I won't recommend it due to the REQUIREMENT of installing Games for Winblows Live We don't need windows Live we have Steam...ːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamːːLaserBeamː			",324,54,40,38,32,3,68

Now don't get me wrong it has some good qualities but for the most part I don't think you should buy this because you'll do one of to things ~ regret purchasing this game and immediatley get a refund, or attempt to have fun in a game you've played before and realise the game isn't as swimming as you remembered.

												This review ignores the gamebreaking bugs that exist (i.e. crashes).I bought this game when it was on sale ~90% off and I still feel ripped off. If you liked playing those 2D ""shooter"" flash games on Newgrounds in 2007 where everything acted like a point-and-click-adventure and the enemies were stick figures created in microsoft paint, then this could be the game you have been searching for.There are two glaring problems with the game:1. It isn't fun.2. Every redeeming feature present in this game has been done better several times over in different games.PROS:The marketting for the game was great.The graphics are quite nice.The menu controls are great.The cut scenes are nice.The idea behind the game is solid, the execution is somewhat lacking.CONS:The in-game controls are not fantastic. It's a strange day when almost the entire gameplay exists with you sniping things, yet it really has to be used with a gamepad controller.The levels are repetitive.The game seems more confused about what it is supposed to be than I am....-Is it a tower defence? Well... kind of? Except building towers is negligable when all you do is sit in a zoomed in sniper scope shooting infantry. So it's not a tower defence game. If you were into tower defence with high levels of interactivity many better games exist - think dungeon defenders, etc. If you are more interested in building and layout then browser games are far better than this.-Is it a First-person shooter? I guess not... not really? It is true that you spend most of the game zoomed in through a sniper scope picking off enemies walking slowly towards you in straight lines, however it would have to be the worst FPS game of all time if it fell into the category. Controls are sloppy, you are in an immobile turret, enemy hitboxes are off, the game pace is incredibly lethargic, you click the mouse and the person falls over, blah blah. So no, it is not a FPS, not one from this millenium.-Is it a story-telling game concerning the war? No. No sir.-So what is it? Who knows? Apparently popular on xBox live it got ported to PC and now on the eve of 2015 still costs $10.00AUD despite the fact I was probably the only person who ever bought it and will ever review it.If you like tower defence, buy a tower defence game interactive/not.If you like FPS buy one of those, hell, buy a text-based adventure game and it would probably be mnore up your alley.If you find fun to be repulsive and boredom to be zen then look into this game.

												I generally enjoy tower defense games, but this one failed to impress me.  Somehow it just fell flat.  I liked the aesthetic, but the options seemed to limited, gameplay just not deep enough.  I wouldn't say it is horrible, just that there are much better options out there.  If you haven't played Defense Grid, definitely try that first. For some reason it says I played 0 hours, but I played it for 1-2 hours or so.			",92,36,1,32,15,2,22

												The first couple levels in this game was bloody brilliant! Spectacular! Fun! Exciting! ... but everything changed when you started taking control of your units... The tower defense game quickly turned into... something else. You start as a normal tower defense game, placing artillery and machine guns. Then later you are forced to pilot planes, and take hold of a sniper rifle to get the job done yourself. All of which defeats the purpose of a tower defense. You're basically playing call of duty at that point.The worst part about this game is the absolutely intrusive ""Windows Live"" enforced login, which sometimes makes the game impossible to play. What's the point of piracy protection when you prohibit even your own players from playing correctly?			",31,5,0,12,26,0,26

												The best tower defence game I've ever played. This game has the charm and innovativation that the genre desired. The maps are designed from actual WWI battlefields and each are diverse in their own way. The innovative feature within the game is that you can take direct control of your emplacements. This means aiming your machine gun into the charging infantry, deploying an artillery piece to send shells into tanks, and manning AA guns to blow biplanes out of the sky. The game also allows you to pilot tanks and planes that you can use freely without any restrictions. Every other mission also has bosses that challenge you during the final wave. This includes a gigantic tank, the size of a skyscraper,  a zepplin, and a super tank on rails. Even though there is no multiplayer, which hopefully will come later on, this is still a solid title for single player.			",178,12,2,14,19,3,19

												A good all around game with a not to often seen setting in world war 1 Where you can be France, germany, or a Futuristic versios of either. This is a single player game (not mulitplayer like it's Xbox version) but has online competitive scores. The game is one of the closest I've scene to rts in this era.  It also has the added bonus of making itself a third person shooter if you take control of some of the vehicles. There is a good variety of survival strategies and defenses to use. This  game doesn't lack missions and completed missions are entertaining to play again.  For people who don't like steep learning curves, the campaign guides you slowly through all the controls,  this game is also easy for those to grasp who want to learn how to play themselves and not through the campaign because the controls are simple.I'd say this game is a good altogether game and any tower defense fan, possibly action fan, and this World war 1 enthusiast (like myself) should get this game.

												If you're into multiplayer tower defense action, Toy Soldiers on the PC is not for you, as this port of the game which was originally released on the Xbox 360 is single player only. However, if you can live with it being a single player only game, there is a fair amount of content for $10. Due to the fact that multiplayer was not implemented, Signal Studios included both DLC packs free of charge. DLC included, there are 3 playable armies spanning approximately 18 different levels. Presentation wise, the game has a very vintage, authentic, first world war feel, in areas such as the loading screen artwork, and the game soundtrack. If you're like me and aren't too big on multiplayer gaming, or are a military history buff, then Toy Soldiers is a game worth checking out.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												XBLA game ported over to the PC.Its alright. Tower defence. Basically a game you can find on the tubes for free, or that you probably already have because Tower defence is in everything now-a-days.Did you play Assassins creed revelations? Wanna know what the Revelation is? Its that it now has Tower defence. Don't even ask me how that works. And sure, its not bad the first time through, but man it gets old after the second or third time, and don't even get me started on the ""its not really AC3, its more AC2.8""...Remember when you first played Tower Defence back in Warcraft 3 and you hoped it wouldn't catch on? I was promised jetpacks and alien ♥♥♥♥♥es in the future, and this is all I got. An entire genre of mini-games based on Warcraft 3 custom. At least throw a guy a hover board or something. Anything. Did you know Dota is a thing? Because thats what we want, just rehash old mods and everyone'll love you for it. Whatever I paid for it, I paid to much.			",167,21,1,20,29,2,41

												If you are interested in World War 1 (The Great War), this will be a fun game for you to play.  This is a Tower Defence game with the ability to use units directly; fight on the ground or in the air with units modelled after the men and vehicles of the 1914-1918 war.  It has a distinct arcade feel to it.  Most of the vehicles are authentically modeled with a bunch of extras that are quite different but keep in tune with the engineering capabilities of the day.  There is a Space Invaders-esque mission path which is totally different unit-wise, but it is still fun to play.While the graphics aren't the best, this game does hold a decent replayability factor when you crank up the difficulty.  For what it is, it is a very enjoyable game.  Since there are so few games in the WW1 genre, it is a must have.  But wait until it goes on a very good sale.  $10 is far too much to pay for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will offer you about 7 hours of a ""castle defence"" type game. You will slot artillery into positions and try to hold your fort. I had fun with it, not a bad bargain game. For that I would recommend it. Not more than 10 dollars. ",135,74,0,33,37,3,45

												XBLA game ported over to the PC.Its alright. Tower defence. Basically a game you can find on the tubes for free, or that you probably already have because Tower defence is in everything now-a-days.Did you play Assassins creed revelations? Wanna know what the Revelation is? Its that it now has Tower defence. Don't even ask me how that works. And sure, its not bad the first time through, but man it gets old after the second or third time, and don't even get me started on the ""its not really AC3, its more AC2.8""...Remember when you first played Tower Defence back in Warcraft 3 and you hoped it wouldn't catch on? I was promised jetpacks and alien ♥♥♥♥♥es in the future, and this is all I got. An entire genre of mini-games based on Warcraft 3 custom. At least throw a guy a hover board or something. Anything. Did you know Dota is a thing? Because thats what we want, just rehash old mods and everyone'll love you for it. Whatever I paid for it, I paid to much.			",167,21,1,20,29,2,41

												If you are interested in World War 1 (The Great War), this will be a fun game for you to play.  This is a Tower Defence game with the ability to use units directly; fight on the ground or in the air with units modelled after the men and vehicles of the 1914-1918 war.  It has a distinct arcade feel to it.  Most of the vehicles are authentically modeled with a bunch of extras that are quite different but keep in tune with the engineering capabilities of the day.  There is a Space Invaders-esque mission path which is totally different unit-wise, but it is still fun to play.While the graphics aren't the best, this game does hold a decent replayability factor when you crank up the difficulty.  For what it is, it is a very enjoyable game.  Since there are so few games in the WW1 genre, it is a must have.  But wait until it goes on a very good sale.  $10 is far too much to pay for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is most entertaining and realistic looking tower-defense game I have ever played. I played the demo on XboxLive and didn't like it simply because it felt awkward playing this with a controller. It's much smoother with a keyboard and mouse. This is a great little game that you can pick up and put down whenever you want and the DLC included is hilarious and great fun on any difficulty.			",86,7,1,7,8,0,21

Well worth the few bucks paid while on summer sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating: 7/10Great game that blends in a good mix of tower defense, third person shooter and aerial combat and puts it in a charming setting of a toy box. The World War I theme also makes the game seem realistic which is ironic, but effective. Gameplay is addictive though the game has some techinical issues that might not give you the complete experience you would expect (Doesn't support most resolutions for example). But still a very enjoyable game worthy of its price.			",985,272,57,133,106,13,161

												Toy Soldiers is a game set in World War 1, giving you the command of the battlefield.It is a tower defense game with a short campaign, a campaign+(german mode) and some ""minigames"" as one would say.For what this game has to offer it's a solid price (€8,99).But, this game has its pros and cons:Pros:++ It has  a lot of minigames, for every map, for every side.'+ It gives you the option to control the ""turrets"" (or toys) you've build, making this quite an unique tower defense.+ It doesn't take itself seriously, and it shouldn't.+ The graphics fit perfect in this game.+ You never, never, NEVER get angry.Cons:-- Appereantly multiplayer is not in the pc version...- It can get repetitive quite fast.Overall this game is quite fun, and it is quite relaxing. But it gets quite repetitive which creates the question if it's worth the money...I'd say you should wait for some sales and check if this game got reduced in its price, but it's defenitaly fun :)This game is a solid 7.6/10Pro tip: USE MORTARS, ALWAYS, USE, MORTARS.

												Toy soldiers is a very enjoyable tower defence game. Not only are there awesome bosses and a really cool imersive environment to play in, but you can take control over any unit on the battlefield! After you've set up your defences, why not take control of a gun turret? Its good clean fun. I recomend this to anyone who likes strategy or tower defence games. I do however recomend an xbox 360 controller as it is a console port. ~PR0XIDIAN			",913,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Rating: 7/10Great game that blends in a good mix of tower defense, third person shooter and aerial combat and puts it in a charming setting of a toy box. The World War I theme also makes the game seem realistic which is ironic, but effective. Gameplay is addictive though the game has some techinical issues that might not give you the complete experience you would expect (Doesn't support most resolutions for example). But still a very enjoyable game worthy of its price.			",985,272,57,133,106,13,161

												It is by no means perfect and has some ridiculus difficulty spikes. But it is a really fun tower defence where you get to show the idiots shooting how to do it right. And it has the rare setting of being in WW 1 which you must score gods green earth to find a handful of decent games in this setting. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun ""tower defense"" game with the added twist of letting you play and control the soldiers on the field and drive the tanks and planes. Not so accurate in some of the war weaponry itself but it's impressive to see the bosses there that are inspirations of actual things, like the Tsar Tank for example. Not so often there's any WW1 games to play anyway.			",96,17,7,6,7,0,4

												I am not normally a fan of tower defense titles but Toy Soldiers is a welcome exception to that rule.  Although the basic gameplay in Toy Soldiers is identical to other tower defense titles, what really makes Toy Soldiers stand out is both the World War I atmosphere and the ability to individually control any one of your placed structures in a first person manual mode.  This not only gives the gameplay and extra level of depth, but allows you to watch the battle unfold first hand as well as adding in the twitch element that most tower defense games lack entirely.  These two elements are both so well done that Toy Soldiers definitely stands head and shoulders above most of the similarly priced competition.  Although the Steam Overlay is supported, unfortunately the game only supports resolutions up to 1680x1050, which results in a less than sharp picture on a widescreen monitor.  Minor flaws aside however, Toy Soldiers is a must have game for anyone who is a fan of the genre.			",1052,329,48,158,114,10,216

												The best tower defence game I've ever played. This game has the charm and innovativation that the genre desired. The maps are designed from actual WWI battlefields and each are diverse in their own way. The innovative feature within the game is that you can take direct control of your emplacements. This means aiming your machine gun into the charging infantry, deploying an artillery piece to send shells into tanks, and manning AA guns to blow biplanes out of the sky. The game also allows you to pilot tanks and planes that you can use freely without any restrictions. Every other mission also has bosses that challenge you during the final wave. This includes a gigantic tank, the size of a skyscraper,  a zepplin, and a super tank on rails. Even though there is no multiplayer, which hopefully will come later on, this is still a solid title for single player.			",178,12,2,14,19,3,19

												If you like taking on waves of enemies in a tower defense fashion then you will like this game.

For the sale price of 7 bucks with DLC included you don't have much to lose if you don't like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't really play that many tower defence games, but this game was excellent. I started playing this after a years break because my first playthrough I couldn't really get into it, and found it boring.Whether, or not this is your kind of game genre doesn't matter. This game is really fun, and has great detail of thought, and creative structure put into it. It takes a while to grab a hold of your heart, but over time it really becomes addictive.The game has a WW1 set-up, pitching little toy soldiers against each other in a minature 'toy battlefield'. You have to set up a variety of defences to guard your base (A toy box) from incoming enemy ranging from infantry, tank, and air units. With each kill brings a small amount of money you can spend to buy more defences, or upgrade current defences to a higher tier. The goal of each mission is the same - Allow no, or few units pass into your toy box. If a certain number of enemy pass into your toy box, then you lose.The animations on the soldiers, and great detail on each of the levels really what makes this game special. It's a small little gem that helps pass time. It Isn't made for the hardcore gamer, but I believe It's a game anybody can try, and love.A great game with a little price tag gets a lot of respect from me.			",177,29,5,20,20,5,29

												It is an interesting world war II game that has mortars, antiarcrafts, howitzers, and chemical wepons. Basically you have to survive  enemy waves and deploy the wepons above to prevent them from reaching your toybox. You can upgrade them to level 3 for more better performance but beware it costs more money to upgrade, repair, and buy them. It's a nice game for people that like action, world war 2 wepons, and toy soldiers.			",7,5,1,2,1,2,0

												XBLA game ported over to the PC.Its alright. Tower defence. Basically a game you can find on the tubes for free, or that you probably already have because Tower defence is in everything now-a-days.Did you play Assassins creed revelations? Wanna know what the Revelation is? Its that it now has Tower defence. Don't even ask me how that works. And sure, its not bad the first time through, but man it gets old after the second or third time, and don't even get me started on the ""its not really AC3, its more AC2.8""...Remember when you first played Tower Defence back in Warcraft 3 and you hoped it wouldn't catch on? I was promised jetpacks and alien ♥♥♥♥♥es in the future, and this is all I got. An entire genre of mini-games based on Warcraft 3 custom. At least throw a guy a hover board or something. Anything. Did you know Dota is a thing? Because thats what we want, just rehash old mods and everyone'll love you for it. Whatever I paid for it, I paid to much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are interested in World War 1 (The Great War), this will be a fun game for you to play.  This is a Tower Defence game with the ability to use units directly; fight on the ground or in the air with units modelled after the men and vehicles of the 1914-1918 war.  It has a distinct arcade feel to it.  Most of the vehicles are authentically modeled with a bunch of extras that are quite different but keep in tune with the engineering capabilities of the day.  There is a Space Invaders-esque mission path which is totally different unit-wise, but it is still fun to play.While the graphics aren't the best, this game does hold a decent replayability factor when you crank up the difficulty.  For what it is, it is a very enjoyable game.  Since there are so few games in the WW1 genre, it is a must have.  But wait until it goes on a very good sale.  $10 is far too much to pay for this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a nice game to waste a half hour or so. It's pretty much an arcade game and most gamers will easily pick this one up. There's no learning curve and even the flying and steering as well as aiming is quite casual. I bought if for a few bucks and it's fun enough. The A.I. is very accurate with the turrets and it's often more efficient to just let the computer do the defending while the player jumps into the vehicles to mop up or to take over some of the turret platforms. The A.I. however has a specific range for each turret and will only fire when enemies enter that range.  If done in manual control, most of your turrets can fire across the map and mow down the enemy before they can even gather up for a proper assault.There's not too many variation with the turrets though. I found the flame/gas/spray turrets too short range and inefficient compared to the machine gun. I mostly wind up with howitzers, machine guns and the occasional anti air gun depending on the level.Like I said the game doesn't really require you to put too much thought into it.  Enemies are quite fragile and even vehicles can die to machine gun fire after some effort. The only difficulty comes from the bosses/mini bosses being bullet sponges. A cheap game for some casual fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you expect a run of the mill tower defense game your expectations are a bit low. In Toy Soldiers there is a tower defense element, but you get to control your ""Towers"", gun emplacements, and you can drive tanks/fly planes when the resources are there for you. To put you in perspective: ""You are the only machine gun on the British line as groups of German soldiers charge towards you. You must hold the line for King and Country at all costs."" The only problem I ran into with this game is that you cannot play it with out internet connection even though it is a single player game. But all in all a great game. 9/10			",22,1,2,4,4,1,5

My current rig is a dual core intel E8400 with a Geforce GTS450 GDDR5 version. Runs smooth at 2560*1080 with full options.			",14,1,2,0,1,0,0

												This is a good game about toy soldiers and such. Real time strategy with some tower defense elements (you can build only at certain locations, but if you aren't in direct control of many ground-to-ground towers especially, they're less effective - you need to be controlling /something/ at all times to do well), and a consistent aesthetic that keeps in the ""wind-up"" theme: good game!

												I don't normally play tower defense games but this one is an exception. I had played this on the 360 and really liked it, but playing it on the PC is a little easier due to the quick key controls being one. Being that it is a WW1 based game as toys it has a historic charm all it's own. Set up your defenses and try to keep your toy box safe from waves of enemies, take control of guns or artillery to do more damage especially in later more chaotic levels. This game has some really nice atmosphere from hearing your soldiers talk before charging, to the trees, buildings and even train stations. This is no doubt one of my favorite games I am glad to own on Steam.			",136,14,0,13,14,0,6

												This game is awesome, and for a price of less than 2€ it is a must-have for any gamer that enjoys the feeling of taking part in a massive war faught out on a larg number of different maps and settings. The battles are intense and usually not so easy to win on default difficulty. There is quite a large variety of infantry, armored and airunits that will try to destroy your towers and conquer your base. You additionally have the ability to take control of every tower in-game, as well as different types of tanks, bombers and combat-planes. The boss-battles are pretty well-made as well.If you like Tower-defence-games and are looking for something new, you should definitely check this out!			",51,3,5,7,13,0,14

												The best tower defence game I've ever played. This game has the charm and innovativation that the genre desired. The maps are designed from actual WWI battlefields and each are diverse in their own way. The innovative feature within the game is that you can take direct control of your emplacements. This means aiming your machine gun into the charging infantry, deploying an artillery piece to send shells into tanks, and manning AA guns to blow biplanes out of the sky. The game also allows you to pilot tanks and planes that you can use freely without any restrictions. Every other mission also has bosses that challenge you during the final wave. This includes a gigantic tank, the size of a skyscraper,  a zepplin, and a super tank on rails. Even though there is no multiplayer, which hopefully will come later on, this is still a solid title for single player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really interesting and novel idea - WWI 'defend the castle' game with toys (literally defend the toybox!).It's basically a decent game but the implementation falls a little short of what (IMO) could have been done with the idea - it would be great to have more control over camera angle (just like standard RTS games - simple surely?) and freedom to place defences other than at set points would have been more interesting (I'm thinking along the lines of Stronghold but WWI trenches and MG positions, etc.).I paid somewhere between £1 and £2 for this and I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone pays more than £5.  For a few quid it's interesting and a bit different and that alone is worth something!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not only fun but humorous.  And it is one of the few games about the First World War, and the idea of 'toy soldiers' lends itself to men going over the top getting themselves shot.  Finally it is a tower defense game (not so popular) but one can actually zoom in and use there towers in first or third person mode.  Therefore I'd say it is more of a Real Time Strategy Game than a Tower Defense game.It is the perfect mix of the two.It will gobble tons of your hours...well worth your money.			",18,1,0,1,3,0,16

Nothing like watching plastic troops running over the trenches at the sound of a whistle and flares.  If you like tower defence games your going to want this game in your collection!

Im glad to see it finally make its way to the PC.Pros: Its different, fun, and allows you to join in; you can join by either plane or sniper tower and help the AI.Cons: Console port, no multiplayer like the 360 version, limited graphics settings.Conclusion: This is one of those games that will keep you entertained for hours. For the sale price of 7 bucks with DLC included you don't have much to lose if you don't like it.			",101,9,10,8,20,1,10

												 Do you like toy soldiers? Do you love reading about the Great War? Do you like strategy games? Do you like FPSs ? Do you like WWI dogfights?    If you so, then try out 'Toy Soldiers.' This is a gem of a game. It's officially a tower defense game, but it really is a whole lot more. It comes off with a unique and  comfortable feeling to it - I was reminded many times of Battalion Wars on the Gamecube. Loading screens are toy soldier (miniature) boxes and the battles take place on dioramas- like a little kid is playing in his bedroom.  Players fortify certain areas with machine guns, Ack-Acks, howitzers, and other weapons as enemy soldiers, tanks, and planes (in a bonus stage even flying saucers and Feudal knights) assault your lines, attempting to reach your toybox. If so many get in, it's game over (never had it happen personally- but close [down to 1]). To help, players can assume direct control over any of said defenses, turning it into a awesome arcade-style gunning game. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, just plan your defense and watch the battle play out, or maybe personally take control of a tank or aeroplane to counter-attack the enemy lines. The starting campaign follows Great Britain, but a German campaign is unlockable (for den Kaiser!).   The sound of the game is perfect. Period music is played in the background of menus, creating a very nostalgic (yet happy) atmosphere. I really wish they offered the soundtrack. Sound effects are all spot on (from what I can tell).    The game is also very clean. No blood, swearing, etc., so it can be played by all gamers at any age. If soldiers are hit they burst apart into toy pieces (springs, cogs, etc).    This is a great game. If on sale, grab it. If not on sale, still grab it.     The safety of the toybox depends on you.

												Only played a short game but was quite impressed so had to write this short review. If there is one thing missing from todays game titles then its a decent amount of world war 1 games. Enter toy soldiers. This is an interesting tower defense type game set during world war 1 in Europe. Although you are playing on what is supposed to be a toy game, it feels very much like world war 1 during the trench warfare. You have a limited number of bases where you can place various weapons such as machine guns, mortars and cannons. The enemy, as in other tower defense games attacks in ever increasing waves. You have to protect your toy box (the core) from being destroyed. Each of the weapons will act on its own but at anytime you can take over them and target the enemy yourself. The more enemies you destroy the more currency you earn and therefore are able to place / replace more weapons. At the end of each campaign battle you unlock more authentic WW1 weapons to use in the next fight. The enemy attacks you with soldiers, cavalry and armour. The barb wire slows soldiers who die as they crawl through it. The tanks on the other hand just roll over them and if you don't place your weapon bases carefully its curtains.If you like boys toys, WW1 and tower defense games then this is a must.

												Cannot even launch. Start up with black screen then my system crushed. I have to turn my laptop off and on. Tried basically all the possible solution I can find online. No one is working. I believe not just myself experiencing this. THere are plenty of same complaint online and some of them dated back to 2012 when this PC version first launched. I can't believe no single one who is benefit from selling this game actually solve this problem after this long time! No patch at all! Unbelievable irresponsible. I wish i had search this game before I buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best Tower Defense Game I've played! It's fun, it's challenging! I especially like the Aecade-like elements, in which you can not only control your different ""towers"" and expand their rach, but also take over the role of tanks or airplanes and therby gain the upper hand on the battlefield. Music and atmosphere are matching the setting in an exellent way!For under 10€ you should give it a try, if it's on Sale for 5€ or less don't hesitate!			",190,72,6,25,26,4,20

												Rating: 7/10Great game that blends in a good mix of tower defense, third person shooter and aerial combat and puts it in a charming setting of a toy box. The World War I theme also makes the game seem realistic which is ironic, but effective. Gameplay is addictive though the game has some techinical issues that might not give you the complete experience you would expect (Doesn't support most resolutions for example). But still a very enjoyable game worthy of its price.			",985,272,57,133,106,13,161
