Early Access Review
								First Impressions:For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.Your Ship:Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.Your Crew:Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.Gameplay:Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple ""go there and shoot.."" missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command ""Fire at will"" which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).Trade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.Development:Patches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.Current Verdict July 18 2014:Highly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)Current Verdict September 16 2014:Latest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).So still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him. So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane ""Let's Moon'm"" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.You are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.What is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.In my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.TL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.			",476,86,7,57,42,6,41

Early Access Review
								So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!! Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ♥♥♥♥ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome. Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields. You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you. Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight. Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

												====================================== Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)======================================**Don't Forget to Nominate this Game for the Steam Awards!**LGM Games’ successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...====================================== Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!+Combat in big ships with fleets...+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...+Very well done Faction system+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities+Developer support that sets a new standard+Best Community on Steam+Awesome Replay value!+Free content updatesConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)======================================IntroductionStarpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...======================================Game-playI have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don’t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you’ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.============================================================================ConclusionStarpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....======================================			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 SHORT SUMMARY:  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!---------- LONGER REVIEW:  The good: Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it. The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun. The not-so-good: The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay. Side-story missions boil down to ""repair structure there for $$$ and XP"" or ""kill enemies here for $$$ and XP"" or ""ferry person over there for $$$ and XP"" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.  During the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged. Certain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet/station where you can sell them.Character progression is RPG-like, yet character skills/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot. For me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship. ------ Long segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game:  Multiple plotlines in the game.  The ""Escape Velocity"" series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.Examples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates. I didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.I think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of. Being able to hail and talk to other ships and planets. You don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion. The ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text.  Though it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station/planet/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the ""Escape Velocity"" game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts/descriptions to great effect.Why is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat! Planets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click ""info"" and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land/dock on every planet/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.). Overall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive. Also, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.PROS:++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!CONS:++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad♥♥♥♥♥with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is. ++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you. I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an ""easy button"" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.PROS:Nice variety of skills and perks available.Great variety of factions and areas of control.Good selection of ships.Can capture enemy ships.Like the blueprints idea.Like the compare weapons and ships.CONS:Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.Exploding ships nearby do no damage.Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.SUGGESTIONS:Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.Show radiation areas on the map.Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.Fix the pathfinding.Improve AI for wanted bounties.

												My initial reaction to the game was ""Wow, this looks like a massive sandbox space sim! Just look at how big the area map is and how many factions there are. I'll be playing the game for tens of hours!""Well, after a while I started to realize the game had lots of problems with being a LOT more shallow than what it promises at first. Setting aside the optimization issues and how easily the game can be prone to crashing, It boasts and impressive ~50 factions with a reputation system that ended up being nothing more than a glorified Good / Evil alignment system. If you do missions given out by the good factions you get +rep and they will be friendly to you an the evil ones will be hostile. Vice versa you do missions given to you by the bad guys and your rep shifts to their side making them friendly to you. Unfortunately that is as deep as the faction system goes. Factions don't change opinions as they are completely static. The static factions leads me to the next problem. The whole world is static. There is absolutely NO sim element in this game to speak of. The game has NO economy, NO dynamic factions, NO dynamic world events. When we speak of sandbox you think of open worlds with things to do in them, but all it is here is the same map as the campaign, just without the campaign missions. Since the game lacks an economy and dynamic factions it makes trading all but a dull and soulless experience. Also, since the world isn't dynamic, there is no real territory control for the factions either. I mean they have their own territories, but they are completely set in stone. You cannot capture territories for the differenct factions. This leaves you with the same Assassination, Taxi, Cargo ferry and Repair missions to grind over and over and over again.How is the combat then if the other aspects are non-existant and hollow? Well, the combat is rather decent, but what kills it for me is how the game is level scaled. Each time you level up so do your enemies. After certain points their ships get upgraded. If you do like me and other people may have done and only grinded missions for money and XP you'll quickly find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to upgrade your ship but you are starting to be too weak to do missions and half the time you simply have to turn around and go away since the RNG pitted you against enemies that simply outclass you. This can be avoided if you salvage derelict ships for parts or capture them and sell them, but then it means that the level scaling system is balanced if you play in a certain way which is horrible, horrible balance in a game that claims to be a sandbox. Simply put if you aren't maximizing your money gains per level then you'll find yourself running into some issues.It just isn't a good game in the end of the day, and it certainly is no sim either, which is what I was lead to believe. There are no simulations happening behind the scenes, everything is static. The game is hardly an open world sandbox either. It seems to be a loose term that gets thrown around a lot these days. It's a sandbox world if all you had was the big open box without any of the sand in it to be shaped and sculpted by your hands. The game COULD be good, because the flying around, the skill system, the ships, the combat etc. feel good and are fun, but the content within the world is non-existant, unless you want to count repeating Kill X (Assassination and Rescue missions but both work the same. In rescue missions it means that you have to save an NPC ship, but so far they have served as reliable allies that help me take down the enemy ship faster rather than someone who needs help), Fetch Y (there is fetching and delivering cargo and serving as a taxi for VIP, but it works the same mechanically for either mission type so it's only different by name) and Repair Z (there's also Scanning anomalies as missions, but mechanically it works the exact same way as repairing so there is no real difference here either) missions as robustful content.

												This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the InsanityIf you’re on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a ‘space’ game.This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO you’ll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just don’t care about. Interactive Devs.Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. I’d hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems. While this isn’t to say other Devs aren’t around, personal experience has shown they just don’t answer, are too busy, don’t care and on more than one occasion… are downright obnoxious and rude.So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day…Community… holy crap, where to begin…There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more filling in those roles, only that I can’t read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity. Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah… they contribute too.Don’t be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.Graphics…Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesn’t have what it takes and to go get something bigger.All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.So +1 there for that…NPC’s…What do you expect? They are NPC’s. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and don’t whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPC’s, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.Missions…Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.I’ll give a +1 here too.Storyline…For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.But…It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.No points for this one, still needs work.Mods…There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding. So definitely +1 here.Oh, lest I forget...Community input...Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly) Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride… and it’s just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.If you’re on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.And the insanity? Glad you asked...There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.Sincerely,VirikasP.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always. Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.			",51,9,0,10,17,0,9

												Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:1. Unengaging storyThe story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.2. Simple missionsThe free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the ""kill pirates"" mission and blast everything to hell.Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.3. Simple combatUsually you fly somewhere, click F for ""Fire at will"" and maneuver a bit around. There is not much strategy involved. Starfleet Command or Space Empires Starfury had more interesting combat. Manal aiming is cumbersome because you can't really see the ships at longer ranges and there is no help with aiming. Due to the turret placement your shots might not go where your reticle is...so automatic fire it is most of the time.Also medium difficulty is way to easy. I had a destroyer that could easily defeat a dreadnought without breaking a sweat (loosing shields).4. technical stuffAlthough the combat is in 3D the star sector is actually in 2D. The map is in 2D. You can fly ""up"" and ""down"" but it feels like all planets and stations are on the same plane. It is not a globe but rather a ""thick"" square.Flying around especially in the beginning is tedious because jumpdrives or jumpgates are way too expensive and when you have the money to buy jumps you can get a perk that allows you free use of the jump gate system.After about 10 hours the game just felt like a grind to get better ships and more weapons and do all the story missions (usually just killing enemies). It simply got boring.			",72,16,17,15,21,0,14

												This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc. This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Early Access Review
								The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.Pros:- Mod support- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.- Nice interface.- Beautiful graphics.- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.  - Combat is fun.- Controller support.- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.Cons:- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies there’s a lot to like. The music is awesome too.			",84,18,6,26,8,0,29

												I like this game, I do, but 35$ I feel is too steep for what it offers. At first I thought this game was like Mount and Blade in space, with so many factions, different types of outposts, and skills oriented to being a leader. That however is not the case, the game is more or less a dungeon crawler RPG without the dungeons.The story is fairly bland, and frankly the voice acting of the main character is so outright awful I had to turn off dialogue volume, and I just quickly got bored with the story missions.Theres no real ""looting"" and going out of your way to be a merchant king through cargo hauling is a waste of time, the early portion of the game is farming money to get better ships, once you have better ships you just capture enemy ships for quick cash and farm levels. Looting ships for weapons is a waste of time, as all stations are static and theres no random element to their inventories, simply fly to the station selling the best weapon of your chosen class, and buy it, everything quickly becomes a monotony of going from X to Y and repeating.The biggest issue I have with the game is saving, the save system is abysmal. You can only save while anchored at a planet or base, if you arrive at a friendly base and find it swarming with enemies (in some sectors this happens constantly) you can find yourself trapped in a prolonged battle, or killed, when all you wanted to do was save the game and go have dinner.You cant side with factions, or take over stations, or influence anything, so dont expect any depth with the politics of the world, you are either ""good"" or ""bad"" and that determines who is friendly, nuetral, or hostile. Good being the vast majority of the galaxy. So the dozens of factions in the game, may as well be two factions.""Commanding a fleet"" isnt as exciting as I hoped either, its not so much a fleet, as you having two hirelings, hence part of my comparison to the game as a dungeon crawler.There is plenty of good though, the actual gameplay is fun, you are more captain than pilot, you configure power usage, set speed, battles arent about quick manuevering so much as overwhelming firepower and good positioning. In a star wars example, you are piloting a Star Destroyer, rather than a Tie Fighter. (fighter squadrons are in fact a system on later ships) Just be sure to go over the controls, I spent far too long without realizing you could activate automated fire.Bounties are probably my favorite aspect, unlike most games, bounty targets arent static, you start the game with a full list of bounties, and they move around the galaxy on their own, when you choose to hunt them you have to go by ""last spotted"" information and attempt to cut them off. These are also the most challenging fights available, and shouldnt be taken lightly.After a while though I begin questioning my goal, Its not difficult to get better equipment, at least not after a certain point, and the only thing you have to upgrade is your ship. A uninteresting campaign that I cant be bothered to finish? The bounty targets to award money I dont really need? Side missions that are much the same as the main missions?This game could be improved by aspects of strategy (something I think Warlords addresses, though the game is very very early access so I dare not bother with it yet.) and aspects of procedural generation. Non static stores, to put more of a emphasis on looting (Perhaps ships produced by that faction are much, much more expensive, but always available and the randomly generated ships are cheaper, like buying a new car vs. used car.) and procedurally generated weapons Diablo style. A star system you can purchase as a home base, to build your own colonies, defenses, shipyards to give you more to do than just upgrade your ship.The game has so, so, so much potential, and the team that worked on it seem dedicated and helpful to their community, the framework is here for a game unlike any other, and I am excited by where the team goes with warlords once its finished. If you can nab this for $20 or less, do it. But in the end, whats that phrase? A mile wide, a inch deep.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**      [[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion. I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.I liked:* quite a large map* lots of different ships* large amount of weapons and enhancements* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!I disliked:* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucksGet this:* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuffDon't get this:* if you're looking for complex space sim			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but it's a buggy, unfinished mess.  I can't believe the state the developers left this in before abandoning it and moving onto their next project; Starpoint Warlords, which I would highly advise people to stay away from as well.  Aside from the persistent crashing, there are parts of the game the developer just didn't even bother to finish.  For instance, none of the equipment that was introduced with the expansions works.  None of it.  The developers are completely aware of it too, they just never bothered to finish it.  Simple things like being able to skip dialog doesn't work because of ""technical reasons"".  I kid you not, that's their excuse, but it supposedly works on xbox.  Many of the quests are bugged, including the final mission, and require hacking save files or reloading the mission numerous times until it works.  Voice dialog worked for maybe a third of the game, the rest of it you just have to read the dialog and then wait in silence until what should have been voiced over to finish since, again, you can't do something as simple as skip dialog.  Character/story progression is very poorly thought out.  It wasn't until I got about 10 hours in, when I was getting wrecked by even the lowliest of enemies, that I had to go to the forums to find out you shouldn't do any missions because you'll over level yourself but not have enough money to buy a new ship and essentially have to start all over or hack your save file to give yourself credits.  Nope, you're supposed to just go capture ships for money and not do any missions.  I'm not kidding, you aren't supposed to level up or do missions or you'll break your game.  I'm not even going to list out all of the other bugs the devs are aware of that they just never bothered to fix.  Stuff that was brought up back in 2014 during the beta that they said they would fix and just never bothered with.  I could probably go on for another three paragarphs listing all the issues with this game, but suffice it to say, it's a mess.  I'm hard pressed to recall any other game I've played that was left in such a sad state, it's like a beta release.  It's a huge shame too, because there is a really good game hiding underneath all the garbage, but having finished the game, the incredible amount of laziness and carelessness by the devs and the amount of frustration it causes just ruins it.  I have no tolerance for devs that abandon a game like they have here and then move on to their next cash in.  I will never purchase another game from Iceberg Interactive.			",96,4,1,6,1,0,1

												Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine. Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!) In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a master’s degree.Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.

												Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.Pros+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers+Engaging combat+diverse systemsCons-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.-Below average performance.7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves ""space sims"" won't be disappointed with this game, especially with such a good modding support.			",28,26,0,43,3,0,7

												TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!Ok as far as space games go, this is ""easy to get into"" and ""fun"" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to ""just go over to that next unexplored sector"" to see what's there.However, you can't compare this game to another game like X, or Star Citizen, or Elite Dangerous. It's like asking if Diablo 3 is like Skyrim - they simply can't be compared fairly. The only thing in common between this game and the game you want to compare to is just that the action takes place in ""space"". How it makes the gameplay fun is different from the one you want to compare to.If you want to ask ""Does it have <this feature> like <the other game you want to compare to>?"", don't. Go back and read my previous comment.What I can tell you is that this game feels like an RPG more than a Space Combat game. There is a story. You upgrade your weapons and armour. You kill your enemies and loot their corpses (derelict wrecks). You use what is better than yours and you sell what is not. See? Just like an RPG.You can do some trading, but I don't concentrate on it like I would have in X or Elite Dangerous. In the end, the question is - does it make you feel that you want to play this more? Does it make you want to see what happens next?The answer is YES for me.			",281,36,7,45,15,0,12

												I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring ""go there and kill pirate x""-missions that we all have seen way too often now.This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that, you will most likely be as disappointed as I am. This is a sad and empty game and I would be careful to get carried away by the positive albeit misleading reviews here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game because of the followingThe minor bugs are actively being fixedThe devs are responding on the forumsExplorationSpace feels large, but it's only one solar systemPlenty of travel shortcutsThe map has to be uncovered by visiting each sectorThere is, sort of, an autopilot for easy travel to a waypointCombatCombat is funAuto-fire if you don't feel like aimingThe controls work well, controller supportGraphicsThe visuals look good (DirectX 11)All of the screenshots are from the in-game engine, not works of art.The planet-side artwork is niceThe space stations and ships are varied and have styleThe game is well polishedSimple user interfaceEquipment and LootThe ship fitting is pretty simpleThere are multiple types of ships, weapons, and multiple styles to choose fromThere is a collect all button to make looting quickThere is a quick way to sell everything in your cargo holdOtherYou can do more than just shoot other shipsYou can choose free-roam instead of doing a campaignYou can crash into a planetAchievements with in-game bonusesIt's able to be moddedEasy to learnMusic and sound is goodIt's not complicated, but I am also a fan of complicated gamesWhat's bad about it? Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be ProsNo multi-player optionsNo empire to buildFreelance missions do not have much variety.The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games.

												A good game that could have been a great game.After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.- More high end weapons and gear- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.			",342,89,7,35,66,2,69

												(8/10) Pros: -Freelancer 2.0 -Capitol ships. -Ability to capture vessels and own them or sell them. -Ability to lead a small fleet -Simple control scheme, complex battle needs. -Runs perfectly smooth for my mid grade computer-Story line is not overly complex and compels you to keep upgrading your ship/fleet/character in order to surviveCons:  -Some dlc quests may get bugged if you load all DLC at start of a save.  Forums have workarounds to help solve issues though-Capturing ship to sell profit far out scales all other methods of profit (trade, mining, missions, etc) and after a playthrough of a character/ship tuned for this method, all other methods feel like roleplay, comparatively.Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game extremely like Microsoft's Freelancer however instead of a choice of around 10* fighter sized ships (in vanilla freelancer), you will be getting a plethora of capitol sized ships from transports, frigates, cruisers, destroyers, and so on up to carrier and dreadnaught.  Titan class if you get that dlc too.Gameplay wise the game features easy controls to help you manage power towards shields, weapon batteries, and thrust, and you will be required to fluctuate this power as the game progesses and the needs of battle and speed get more intense.I found the ui and gameplay to be very good.  This game has been the best open space trader sim that I've played on steam yet.Late game battles can be intense and even if you power through tens of ships at a time, you will need to be vigilant in your positioning, use of power, and abilites.

												Updated review as of October 1st.First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.Initial review:This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask ""Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?"" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic, almost childish way. Even in my short time in the game, I have already encountered several borderline-gamebreaking bugs. Such as non-functional campaign triggers. And equally game-breaking, though no bug, is the games tendency to assume the player knows more that he does. This game needs a softer introduction, not to mechanics, but to world-building. As it is, it's a mess.I am giving the developer the benefit of doubt, and I will continue playing. I do believe there is a lot of enjoyable content to come. But ""it gets better later"" is not a defence that a genuinely good game would need.Let me put it like this: I am playing the game simply because it is the only game of its kind currently available. If it weren't for the fact that I have played Freelancer into the ground repeatedly, I would be playing that. It is a superior experience in every way.Currently, I still regret spending money on this game. Therefore I am choosing not to recommend this game.Update #1: After a few more hours, I can only confirm my first impressions: I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the game, and my enjoyment of it suffers as a result. Time and time again, I am told I need to go to some place I don't know of, to meet a person I've never heard of, to get a thing which I know nothing about, for reasons that are never made clear. To call it frustrating is an understatement. The game is seemingly an unending series of unanswered questions. Primary among them: ""Why am I doing this?""This is not intentional mystery, this is just really, really bad writing.Which is a damn, crying shame. Because the game itself, mechanics and graphics, are solid. Ish. A little shallow and clumsy, perhaps, but the closest I have come to Freelancer since Freelancer.I wish this game was better. But it isn't. I wish I could love this game. But I can't.I have given this game more than its fair share of chances. I have given it more than the benefit of doubt. I have acted on faith, on the belief and the hope, that this game ""gets better"". So far, this has proven to be wishful thinking.I'll research the Gemini universe, and see if that gives me enough points of reference to piece together just what the hell is going on in the game. Then I'll give the game one last chance to pull itself out of this confusing funk and make some damn sense.Update #2:That helped a lot. A now have a fair grasp of what the game was assuming I knew by heart all along. It made the campaign bearable, though still not good by any measure. But at least I'm no longer tearing my hair out (as much) over the lack of proper world-building, exposition and adherence to storytelling 101.I still can't recommend the game, despite that I am now beginning to enjoy it. Chances are that you won't be as patient as I have been, and I fail to muster any decent arguments as to why you would wish to be.			",165,41,0,58,25,0,44

 Review - Starpoint Gemini 2 === Rating: 7.0 / 10 - To boldly grind as much as nobody grinded before === The Good - Good variety of pilotable vessels for various play styles: mining freighters, battleships, fighter carriers, it's all there- RPG elements and alignments system enable the player to take the path they wish in both terms of abilities, perks and behaivior- Fairly good, but not excellent mind you, number of different sectors to explore- Main quest, a load of secondary missions, contracts, bounties, random encounters, global events... really, there is a lot of stuff to actually do in the Gemini Sector...- Decent assortment of weaponry and modifications- Space anomalies, ion storms, radioactive nebulas, and all sorts of space disasters to endanger your ship- It takes really long to get to high levels, get all the good ships, weaponry, kill bounty targets and such things- Quite complex but rewarding enemy ship capture system, you can really do an awful lot of money if you get good at it...- Overall, more than good longevity, to complete everything the Gemini Sector has to offer, DLCs included, it will take you, say around... 100 hours (i played the beta version before release in the past and did so)=== The Bad - Trading / Mining / Gas collecting / Scrap salvaging are good for making money at low levels, game start and quite a bit after, but from say level 15/20 and above, they become very underwhelming: contracts, bounties and most of all ship boarding surpass the gains by FAR, so players that want to play a Trading type character will be severely penalized in mid/late game and will have to do epic amounts of grinding to get anything- You cannot destroy space structures if they are not part of a specified mission that involves their destruction. Solar arrays, gas collectors, bandit space stations, trading posts, all of them are completely indestructible: their structure will drop to 0 eventually but will still be perfectly fine. This MIGHT be a game design choice to avoid players break main quests and such, BUT doing so with all space structures is really unacceptable- You can board space structures, and plausibly get all the sweet loot inside them right? Wrong my friends. Board a mining station, a resarch center or such, and the troops will say it is captured and the loot is being ejected outside: this will not happen. Never, ever. This feature might be incomplete or never finished by developers.- You can only save your game while docked to a space station or a planet. Not a really big deal, just a poor game design choice- Ship's autopilot can bug and randomly fly you inside space stations, space debris, asteroids, and turn your ship in a fireball.- The ship's targeting computer is not able to target automatically asteroids or salvage piles, if you want to be a miner, be prepared to aim at every single little piece of asteroid manually and then collect its loot. This makes mining even more painful than it already is because of the problem i explained before- The ship's targeting computer (yes, AGAIN) is able to, thankfully, target enemies in automatic fire mode, and is pretty accurate at it, more so than you doing it manually in fact, but the big issue is: the computer will randomly fire at all enemies in its range, and will NOT stay and focus fire on the enemy you locked on. You should understand how this will do in a battle. Yes, really bad.=== The Ugly - When boarding a ship, ANY ally ship, be it random, hired mercenaries or quest companions, will STILL target the enemy ship you are trying to board, and there is NO WAY to tell them to do otherwise. This results in extreme frustration because maybe you are actually succeeding in the believe me really difficult task of capturing a ship (especially at high levels), but then some random ally blows it up making you lose time, your troopers inside it, and maybe also a mission involving the ship capture will fail. The developers said this WOULD be fixed many times on forums and steam hub, well it never was.- Ship capture is the ONLY feasible way of making good amounts of money from mid game and above: contracts will start giving you a pittance, trading will long be worthless and selling those nice ships for money will be your only chance of making money to get better stuff and ships to actually progress in the story or freeroam, because enemies scale with your level and get better everything, and so you must do the same. Yes you guessed it, the thing i said before about boarding, it happens a LOT, so you can choose between getting ulcer from boarding, or grinding 70 contracts in say 6 hours to get 1 tier III weapon for that slot you are missing, and then again and again and again.- There is a bug that can happen randomly, i presume it is uncommon: after completing a Main Story or DLC Main quest (Happened to me just after finishing Aethera DLC), and this is a really severe bug. What it does is simple: it RESETS the entire quest line of the main story to a random mission, so basically instead of progressing to the next quest, it says the actual active quest is one you ALREADY completed, and i found no fix for this, system cache check, restarting, even savegame editing, nothing. This has lead me to be unable to play Titans DLC because the quest is broken, and who knows what sorts of troubles will other players get from this bug.=== Conclusions Honestly, SG2 is a nice space game, nowhere near the depth of some other games like the X series, but positively much more accessible than those, but still being complex enough to not become casualized, and that is all good.Still, many problems as you read cripple the game and prevent it from becoming truly excellent.

												Pros: + Beautiful game; very nice to look at!+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art+ Very decent music and sound effectsCons:- Boring story- Abysmal voice acting- No multiplayer- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender! --> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really good fun, was worried about some of the EVE comparisons but tho it does lack first person/cockpit view its not to its detriment and it seams to make the fights more tactical and less frantic also i havnt done any spread sheet crunching yet. prosBig seamless world with lots to explore, compleat with random space anomalies worm holes and nebulealots of different ships at diffrent lvls to flyAll the different playstyles youd expect, fight, trade, pirate ectspace drugsits funits not X rebirthconsseams like quite a grind to earn cash for ships but kind of expect that and it makes that first ship upgrade seam all the more specialit has crashed on me a couple of times (nothing game breaking ) but meh that will probably get fixed in time and the auto save is pretty good			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word ""adventure"" more than action on this one. There is story here, but I find the game play is slightly lacking. The idea of controlling a modify-able ship is awesome, especially with the ability to turn auto-firing and auto-pilot on and off - but I just find this game lacks a bit in depth. There is a lot to do, a lot of side missions, main missions are intriguing enough, but SG2 just fails to deliver amazing game play. Maybe it's because I'm playing with a controller, but I find from the stuff you can do in game to scanning or teleporting is not quite there. You cannot walk around space ports or your own ship which is really disappointing because what captain doesn't want to see what's going on - on his/her ship. I find myself always chasing new nav points and flying in circles and turning on auto-firing.I like the game, but enough to pass time or keep me busy. I do not think it's worth the stated price and recommended to buy on sale.RATING : 7/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Still in Alpha stage)Pick a style that you like to play, space sim wise, and go do it..lol Be a pirate/bounty hunter/merchant/miner..ect No story line ATM, but as it stands right now, it is still worth the money. You can easily get 20 buck worth of enjoyment out of it, plus some. When the game is done, you will be glad you did get in on early access. Fun ships and plenty to choose from, even now. Good fight and flight modes of flying. Great space eye-candy. No loading screens to get from one side of the map, to the other. Unless you are using the jump gates, then there is a small load. You want that ship the npc is flying? Just board it TAKE IT!!..lol Over all, I cant give much of any complaint. As a reference, its like a graphics smak down, with a upper cut in gameplay, to Freelancer!!..lol (only SP, no co-op multi..-1/2 star..lol)I give it 4&1/2 stars out of five: with it, as it stands, in AlphaEDIT:Now that this little gem is fully released, I can go ahead and say I wasn't wrong in my EA review. There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!			",66,2,0,12,11,0,14

												Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.			",668,204,16,97,60,7,97

												This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care). Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay. Universe feels empty in a bad way. Voice acting in the plot is amateur. You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥(there are some lackluster excuses about this) Combat seems fairly one dimensional RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks) Crew are just stats bonuses Trading economy and mining seem extremely basicOverall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.			",248,58,3,40,25,3,68

												Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...- The game is a real grind…. -Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the “second” mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out. -Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else) -A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat…-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me… -not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission… sigh...-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :( -missions seem to be straightforward but lack information… eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision. -Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

												So here's the kind of stuff that happens in SG2:I'm flying in my cloaked Freya-class stealth carrier towards a small fleet of enemy vessels. I drop to cruising speed (drawing power from engines to weapons + shields) in the middle of the ship cluster and release 1 wing each of fighters + bombers, which wreak havoc in their ranks. I lock a grappling beam on the flagship, drop out of cloak and set weapons free. Turning the ship, I shoot missile salvos from my port, bow and starboard ports, crushing the flaship's shields and bringing hull integrity to critical levels. I then use transporters to launch a boarding party, which subdues the vessel's defenders in less than a minute. All the while my guns, bombers and fighters make short work of the supporting vessels and I leave with a prize ship worth millions of credits.That's the game in a nutshell. It's really, really, really cool and accomplishes what few games like it can... but has giant glaring holes in it. I recommend the game if you get it on sale or if you don't mind taking the good with the bad. I'm not one of those weird people who likes s***ty games and *I* played it for 55 hours and counting.Here are my gripes:* Capturing ships? Yeah, pretty much the only sensible thing to do towards the end game for cash.* The system is kind of arcane. Most of it becomes intuitive after you get a chance to tweak it (for instance, I've set my mouse page Back/Forward buttons to lock on the nearest target and mark it for fighters/fleet vessels). However... it wasn't until like 40-50 hours into the game that I realized that ""Power-To-Engines"" didn't actually put full power to engines and you boosted speed significantly if you used the power allocation tab to set Engines to 100% while in PTE mode.* AI is miserably weak. Boarding actions? They don't do 'em. Hacking your ship? Yeah they don't do that either. Grappling? Hahaha no. They seem to just go towards the nearest enemy and shoot. The most complicated thing they do is use items that drop mines or kill your fighters or knock out your engines. It leads to ridiculous situations like my Freya ship with 110 troopers destroying 6 Equinox-class carriers with 130 troopers each... when just two of them could almost guarantee taking my ship by boarding. Same goes when I'm wrecking a freighter with a small corvette-class fighter/bomber... and it could easily knock me out of commission by grappling me and pounding me to dust.* The dialogue killed my parents. Seriously... this stuff comes across as written by a middle-schooler, translated to Russian-and-back, and voiced in the dumbest, least engaging way possible. Worst of all.. it's unskippable! There's a command for ""skip dialogue"" but it DOESN'T WORK.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.Star Point Gemini 2!DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.70 ships to buy/capture/destroyEquipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancementsCustomizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etcPower ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere ""You dont want to be"")AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)T-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)Ability to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.Travel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)Freelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.Steam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!Did I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula's are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don't run into them they not hurt hehe :)Oh and Mod Tools, Want to add a new ship into game, can do!!Want to add new sectors into game, Can do!!Want to add anything virtually into game, can do!!! Probably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas. The Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.All I can say is, ""If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed""And drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)http://www.starpointgemini.com/forumhttp://www.twitch.tv/webferret - My Stream of SPG2 most nights 8PM AEST (GMT +9:30)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love space sims. I don't even know how much time I sank into freelancer or the x3 games. Yet this one I am dropping after a bit more than 10 hours of playing.Let's start with what I like about this game: The graphics are good, the different ships with their various layouts are cool, you can customize your ship through enhancements and hiring officers, the energy transfer management (engine, weapons, shields) is interesting, and on the surface the game feels like it is trying to marry the best parts of freelancer with those from the x series (which means many things immediately make sense if you have played those games before).However. Somehow the game feels like a chore; something I am willing myself to play in the hope that if I continue a bit further it will finally become exciting and turn into the great game it has the potential to be.The story is inherently boring. Fly from A to B, listen to some terrible voice-overs, destroy a target (ambushes being optional), get an (uninteresting and unusable) item and no real information other than ""fly to XYZ to get more info"". But you need to grind a few side missions first to level up enough for that. Rinse and repeat. I have lost all interest in the main story and there is just nothing that compels me to continue playing it.The other sidequests and missions are okay, but also very repetitive. The difficulty rating of these is useless, as some missions (e.g. science, maintenance, taxi, ferry) are childishly easy, whereas others (e.g. assasination, station defence) become really hard quickly unless you sink all your money into your fighting capabilities. Importantly the missions don't pay enough in my eyes to make them worthwile. I found boarding other small ships much more lucrative. And flying through space feeling like you are a towing service is just not fun for long. These side missions quickly turn into mindless grinding.There are many other things that bug me (not even to mention the numerous bugs I encountered already) that make this game a ""no"" for me:The fighting is super boring; most of the time I just sit there with my turrents firing automatically and I don't do anything other than watch. Ships feel very small and their speed and maneuverability do not seem to decrease with size as far as I can tell (there is no ""speed"" property you could check when buying a ship). There is no good fast travel: gates are too expensive, wormholes regularly throw you out at the wrong location (and what is it with that terrible, terrible animation you are shown after you have flown into a wormhole?) and those ""green highways"" seem a bit pointless; most importantly while all of these move you long distances quickly they don't allow to quickly travel to something that is say halfway of that distance. Factions have no character and no individual story making them pointless really. The energy transfer management can only be used effectively by dragging it around with your mouse; there are no customizable settings to be activated through a button, e.g. a ""hit and run"" (50% engine, 50% weapons). Skills have no real impact: I have put all my skillpoints into one particular tree (beam weapons) and I still can't tell the difference before and after I activated the skill, with the promised increase in range definitely not working. The game cannot be played effectively with a joystick: some button commands cannot be changed (e.g. closing window, using skill, cycle through tabs in the store) while others simply are not recognized or don't work; also you can't use a mouse to quickly navigate say the store and star map.There are many more things that have added to me not liking this game, but those are probably too specific to me to be really useful for other players.Tl;DR: Repetive missions, bad main story, boring fights, lots of mindless grinding, terrible voice acting, the whole universe feels characterless and the joysticks can't be used effectively. While it is trying to combine the best things of previously succesful spacesims (freelance, x3) it does not get it right.			",10,3,0,5,0,0,0

Posted: October 18, 2014
												So I thought I’d wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the “story”. So at the time I’m writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game. My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games I’ve tried haven’t even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested. So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale. It’s a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. It’s not as good,  but it’s definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game. You start of by choosing your “class” which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the “feel” of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that “feeling” it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but don’t worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc. The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if you’re into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isn’t really any suprises or “wtf” moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery. The graphics are awesome, no complaints here it’s a living world and the designs are nice. The sounds and music are awesome. But…I really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning. So that’s a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc. Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pauses…so while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you don’t progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So that’s annoying.The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was just…ugh.The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game. So to end this I’d say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.I’d give this game a 7/10+Many ships to buy+Huge map, a lot to explore+Pretty graphics+Music+Enemy Heroes+RPG elements-Maptravel-Music-Bad voice acting♥♥♥♥♥♥story-Autopilot fails			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have mixed feelings for this game. I wish I could make the review neutral. It's a space sandbox where you roam Gemini system, complete easy single objective quests, get money and buy better ships and guns. The game is quite slow-paced, and you'll probably want an open book at your table, so you can read it while your ship travels to whatever waypoint you've set. The combat system is pretty simple, devs probably wanted this game to be chilling instead of intense. Positive moments:- Beautiful space vistas and ships.- You can destroy enemies, you can mine asteroids, you can buy things in one place to sell in another. It's a sandbox.- A free DLC with alternative campaign from the first game.Negative moments:- The story is mediochre, we've seen all this a thousand times before.- Voice acting in campaign is pretty bad.- My PC fits the requirements, and yet the performance is really bad. I experienced crashes in long sessions too.- Once you get yourself a carrier class vessel, you'll find out that there's like nothing else to do. You can bother yourself with achievements, but it isn't that fun.- Unrealistic game world. Nebulas within a solar system, asteroids gathered in clouds rather than in rings, tiny planets and stars, you only fly forward when your engines are on: your ship stops once you turned them off, like a car would. I understand that it all was done to make the game less boring and more saturated with content, but it fells just toyish.Starpoint Gemini 2 is still fun to play, even with the flaws I listed, but I can't recommend it for the full price. If you're into space, get it when on sale.			",79,20,0,12,2,0,13

												When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game ""Elite"" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic), the plot practically non-existent. There were only 8 ""missions"" I knew of and the grind to get to Elite level was enormous.I looked for such a game a long time after that. Freelancer was a good try. The direct Elite successors were overdone and technically underwhelming. After a while I gave up.Then I stumbled over SPG2. And here it is again. Nearly. The freedom to do what I want, the grind to get to the top and a vast universe. For such a game it is important that the combat is interesting, and it is. If you are level 20+ you will encounter more than one enemy at a time, and then you will have your hands full.Here a pro and con list:+ Graphics are good. Not brillant, but good.+ You are free! You may do what you want. You can safely ignore the main quest if you want.+ You can capture ships. That is not only very profitable but also fun and later on you have to be quite skillful to pull that off (with battleships and the like).+ The map is huge.+ Fighting feels great.+ Your character has levels, perks and skills. And they are surprisingly useful (I play an engineer). And fun.+ You have to learn the UI but after the initial learning process it is very functional.+ You can change all keys. And you should change at least some.+ There is a nice levelling curve. It could be even slower, to be honest...+ There are secrets in the game. A secret station I just discovered (named after an astronomer, won't spoil it too much), sectors with radioactivity, anomalies and so on.+ If you don't know what to do you can do an automatically generated mission. They are endless.+ You can save only on a station. I like that because it means you risk a bit if you venture outside. But only a bit. Just the right amount :)+ The developers are very active and really trying to please their customers.- Trading is not risk free (there are enemies out there) and not profitable. That is not well designed because either you avoid risk and gain or take risks and get profit, but the trading option means that you take the worst from both worlds.- While there is a reputation system it is not individual to each of the factions. You are evil or good (or something in between). If you are ""good"" you are liked by all lawful factions. If you are evil you are liked by all evil factions. That could be more individualized.- The main quest has quite a boring plot and is not written very well. The voiceovers are horrible. These accents!- The map is not endless. That is not a big disadvantage because it is huge as it is. But it would be nice to have an option to generate a new ""universe"" procedurally.- If you land at a station the graphics are disappointing. It is nothing more than a greyed-out picture of you in front of the station. You don't feel you are on the station, you feel you are in a system menu.- The full screen mode does not work every time. On Windows 8.1, NVidia 760, full screen mode is only achieved after I start the game the second time. That is a bit unprofessional...Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Developers: 10/10Main Quest: 3/10Combat: 9/10Feeling of Progress: 9/10Overall: 9/10Good: if you like Elite or Freelancer.Not that good: if you like X, X2, X3.I bought it in a sale but it is worth its normal price and then some.

												Highly recommended! This game is similar to so many other games, yet so different in every aspect. These guys really offered something special.And if you have a question, devs are answering them on Steam forums 24/7. Something that is rarely seen. My boyfriend got me this game cause I liked Evochron Mercenary. I'm as happy as I can be with it. Highly addictive and fun!Thumbs up!Update: After so many hours, I still feel compelled to return to the game from time to time. I left my heart in Gemini, it would seem. :)			",28,14,1,2,3,0,4

												I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.RPG:·	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.·	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.·	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.·	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really? ·	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?SIM:·	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.·	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.·	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.·	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.GAMEPLAY:·	Pretty graphics·	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.·	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,          officers and mercs you can hire·	Lots to explore·	Faction/reputation tracking system·	Very useful star map with overlays and filters·	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic modelOverall:The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun. All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale. 6.5/10.0			",11,11,1,22,8,0,17

												At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as ""rate of fire"" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.Sure I can play this, but all the time doing so there is a thought in my head asking why I am playing this game when I have better games available.Edit: 2015-11-25I just wanted to add that this game isn't necessarily bad, if they fixed the weapon descriptions and the crashes I'd actually consider recommend it.I consider the X-series, especially X-3, to be more enjoyable. I do not want to advertise for other games in a review, which is why this was at first omnitted, but since so many replies have been about it I'll add it.			",129,45,12,16,46,0,32

												This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something. There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.			",132,7,0,17,4,0,15

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, and while it may be a bit repetative, I can't find any 3-D space RPGs that are as easy to control and not just pure spaceflight ""simulator"". The story and voice-overs are what you would expect from a space rpg, however that shouldn't really be the reason you play this game. In my opinion, I have had loads of fun warping all over the galaxy doing manuevers around large carries and owning pirates and rebels with my plasma cannons and missiles. The amount of customizibility with your ship is off the chart for this game, however once you find your playing style and the best gear for that style you are kind of set. You can also download other peoples mods and get fan made ships or docking hangers and other cool weapons not found in-game which is pretty sweet that the devs opened it up for modding.All in all, this is a quality game that I went back and purchased the DLC's for because I thought the price justified the entertainment. If you like space games like the original escape velocity, or games like the app galaxy on fire you will like this game a lot. 8/10			",70,9,0,13,5,0,9

												Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc. Though it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER:  boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.Besides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.There are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.Your ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.Speaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.One issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.Overall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.Score: 7/10			",307,65,5,61,19,1,40

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go. this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.			",124,27,3,29,28,0,15

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button along with thumbs up and thumbs down. Bought it after getting burned out on Elite Dangerous in hopes that it would scratch my space sim itch. One one hand, the scale just isn't there. You tool around a single smallish star system littered with stations, planets, teleportation gates and even a couple black holes and nebulae for some reason. The space is also dirty, dusty and littlered - no, really - there are chunks of rock and clouds of dust constantly whizzing by (fortunately there are mods that get rid of that). There's no hyperspacing to other systems or exploring the galaxy. I guess it's a little bit like the Expanse TV series.On the oher hand, during ship combat the scale is pretty faithful - you blast your cannons in the general direction of someone flying around you in the darkness, and all you see of the opposing ship is the big red target marker. Eventually, one of you blows up. The only way to take a closer look is to approach to boarding distance, which I have to admit is a nice touch. Between that and a rather obtuse camera, the space combat experience is underwhelming.The game isn't bad, it's just kind of lackluster. You can tell that it was made by a tiny studio on a limited budget. I know LGM tried hard, but neither the visuals nor the sound can hold a candle to the current-gen games. After seeing the visuals delivered by Elite and even the unfinished mess that is Star Citizen, you soon notice the janky-looking engine exhaust, low-budget pewpew effects and simplistic ships.It also has some issues outside of the weird camera, the most glaring being a graphics crash (blank screen) in full-screen mode. Since you can only save in stations, this can wipe out a lot of progress.Let me put it this way: this is a chill spaceflight game (not a sim) in the similar vein as Rogue Galaxy, and it was worth the purchase price of $6.50 with all DLCs during the sale. I wouldn't pay more than that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starpoint Gemini feels like a PC game I played when I was younger. It's relatively rough around the edges and there is nothing groundbreaking about the graphics--but it represents a kind of space exploration game in a very cohesive package. The soundtrack is filled with ambient electronica and is a real highlight for me; scanning pulsars and exploring unknown reaches of space feels extremely gratifying and peaceful at the same time.The game itself lets you explore space however you choose: you can become a merchant flying cargo through sectors, a bounty hunter going after pirates, an explorer of the universe and scanning anomalies and space oddities etc, etc. It's a game with great potential that doesn't hold you hand from start to finish. If you have any interest in Sci-fi/space exploration games (Freelancer/Star Trek: Bridge Commander/Eve Online) this game does a great job filling that role.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ♥♥♥♥♥ES ",226,18,8,25,39,2,41

												I would not recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore fans of the genre, and that provided the price comes down. While I do acknowledge some might enjoy the tedium and vaccum, neither I, nor any of my friends did. Core mechanics are grind, fetch&kill 'quests' and exploration. You also pick up things and sell them off at the nearest friendly station, or buy things at one point and sell them to a trader across the map for profit. The game world is huge and fun to explore at first, but given the lack of variety (it is space, after all) it will get boring afer a while. Combat is nothing like a proper space sim - you either get projectile weapons and miss, or directed energy (beam) weapons and hit 100% of the time via automatic turrets. These make the whole combat thing ridiculous - all the fun is outsourced to your onboard computer. The game seems to be balanced with this in mind - you can either turn on the auto tracking and let the computer do the fighting or die. Fun parts:-exploration. the playing environment is huge! Volumetric shadows, nebulas, asteroid and debris fields and planets are stunning. It does get old after a while given the game's shortcomings -visuals as per above. Nothing you haven't seen in X3 already though-ship designs & varietyThe not-so-fun parts:-tedious, fetch&kill tasks that pass for quests here; gets old in about 10 minutes -the game is vacuous. think mmo without quests or other players. -as of now the game is bugged and some options are greyed out. No, despite what the industry standard for indie games seems to have become lately, it is not okay to release an unfinished game with greyed out options and scenarios that 'will be added later on'. That's what early access is for!-repetitive, unaccomplished space combat-the 'RPG' portion of the game comes down to several global stat boosts and 4 active skills, which I've not seen to have any serious impact on the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a SUCKER for space exploration games (I even played Darkstar One, and it was mediocre at best). An yet I did not like this one. This has mainly three reasons:* The story (what little I have played before giving up on the game) is not riveting and seems to follow already trodden paths (trodden by games far superior). The whole ""The system is riven with conflict and there is some hidden threat only YOU can uncover"" is nice and dandy, but again, done better by previous games. The voice acting is .. unethusiastic. I know, I have been spoiled by world-class actin as in Mass Effect, but still...There is a lot of grinding - trading, mining, doing freelance missions, to get a ship that you need to NOT be blasted to smithereens by the next main mission,. There ALWAYS is. It is a core principle of the game, and usually, one that I like. In this game, it feels like a chore. This has again to do with the story, which just does nothing to make me want to reach the next mission.* The steering. This is a MAYOR point. I did not think one could botch follow-the-mouse-steering. Sadly, one can. The point you fly to is somewhere in the upper third of the monitor. Which KINDA makes sense given the perspective and the axis of the ship and all. BUT the neutral zone of the mouse-steering is in the center of the screen. Which means that when you point at an object an try to fly towards it, you will pass OVER it (for given values of ""OVER"" in 3D space).This is annoying, to say the least. It is also unintuitive. I remember when Freelancer made me use the mouse (for me, it was the first time then) to steer the ship. I took to it in seconds, because it was so intuitive. Well, this one is NOT.* The mission system is bugged, if not broken. ""Yes, you can take this mission with level 6"" Great. They WHY is there a friggin' CRUISER waiting for my gunship at the mission point, blasting the living hell out of me? This happens regularly, and it is annoying. ""Nooo, THIS science mission is WAY to dangerous, it requires you to be level 11."" Ah-ha. So floating in space, with NO enemies to pop up (I have yet to meet one on science missions) and waiting for the scanner is something only my higher-level self can handle.. All those points make me kinda regret the purchase. Oh, and one final note: it may be okay with copyright law to use the theme from the mining minigame of Mass Effect 2 and use in the score, for me, it was just an INSULT to the ME franchise, because this game is not even doing the same sport, not not mention playing in the same league.

												A worthy addition to your steam space strategy titles. It starts off a little grindy but once you get over the initial credit problems the fun really begins. Over 70 ships to buy and fly from gunships all the way up to carriers and dreadnoughts. You can trade and fight across a large area with many many different factions.Customize your ship how you like with different officers, weapons and equipment and choose from a large amount of skills and perks to further compliment your ship.There are two modes to play, campaign for a single player story and sandbox. The effort has obviously been put into the sandbox over the campaign.One really annoying problem and probably the only major one for me is the abyssmal camera control. Something that should be bread and butter for a game of this type. you have to use something called turret mode to get anywhere near the type of camera your used to in just about every other game of this type. Unfortunately even turret mode is a floodlight type chase cam.Despite the camera problem I heartily recommend this game for anyone who is missing a fix of space goodness.Here is a taste of cruiser gameplay:

												Very good Freelancer-like spaceships game. Very nice graphics, playability and effects. A lot of ships which are actually different one from one to another. There's not just the boring small-big-bigger-huge mechanics mixed with the Light-Heavy-Trader axis. With different stats (cargo load, soldiers, weapon spots etc) the choice between one model and the other seems to have some meaning. Trading is a bit basic, although the map is very large and there are a lot different goods with different degrees of ""rareness"". Main campaign not so exciting but with some twists and cutplay more than decent. Big plus: the company is still supporting the game with fixes, adds and patches. Without asking you for more money. Much wows, so honest, many pleasant.			",14,4,0,6,7,0,7

												It took nearly 20 hours to finally come to a conclusion on this game.Despite all efforts made to make the combat complex - energy management, 4 different active abilities (with a kinda silly feeling levelups with them),  and up to 4 consumable items (of a selection of around a dozen) useful for combat - it just isn't all that fun. I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.The economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.The storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.The good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall, I think this is a pretty fun game...just not worth the $40 they want for the game + DLC.  Given that it's been released for several years now, and apparently, is still full of bugs/missing mechanics that the dev's were promising would be fixed years ago, I don't think I'll be buying anything else by this company.  The Titan DLC was rather dissapointing, it was more of a God mode than additional content...once you're in a Titan, just hit fire at will, and a few seconds later, even fleets of carriers are goners...and there's only 2 enemy titans as opponents, once you've captured/destroyed them, you're pretty much invincible. Also, voiceovers frequently failed, the game would occasionally crash for no apparent reason, and planets/bases only stocking 1-3 of consumables is frankly annoying and ridiculous, particularly when it comes to those used for salvaging/mining.One thing I found particularly annoying, is that on the context menu, there is a button labled Follow.  None of the in-game tutorials mention this button, and as far I can tell, it remains greyed out no matter what you have selected...and does not work to let you follow any of your escort targets, or enemies, or anything else.  Nor does it work to tell hired mercs to ""follow"" you...apparently, it is one more vestige of over-ambitious devs that gave up on the game to move on to something else.I will mention that I have not tried any of the mods for the game, but as it stands by itself, it is definitely a product that did not live up to its potential....and the reputation system? Really? 1 kind of good vs. evil rep with all those factions? and if you go outlaw...its hilarious...once you can land on an outlaw planet, failing to smuggle on that planet moves your rep more towards outlaw(just like failing to smuggle on ""good"" planets), making outlaw factions(including that planet) more friendly...lol.I mean, how hard would it REALLY have been to include a reputation number for each faction?Don't get me wrong, I did find that game enjoyable overall...but there was so many constant things that made me feel like I was playing a beta instead of a game that had been released more than 3 years ago...

												I love space sim, Freelancer, Freespace, etc. and I hoped for this game to be another like them. But unfortunately no. Graphis is good, ships nice, weapons too. But..Why have only turrets? And camera binded to them?Why such dumb camera controls? Even with joystick it's not like space sim.Why so slow travelling without time acceleration?I've tried it for a few hours, but no, I am dissapointed, I was looking forward to this game. Maybe I will try to play it another year if those issues would be solved.			",32,3,0,2,3,0,23

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a complete turn-around from the quality of the first game. It's prettier, it's satisfyingly complex and most of all, it's a lot of fun. It's blend of RPG elements, freeroaming gameplay and atmosphere is great, and pretty well refined. While the voice acting isn't anything to write home about, the simple joy of adjusting the loadout for your ships, hiring officers, mercs and troopers, and leveling up can be downright intoxicating. A couple small issues nag at me, however. At the time of this review, the ability to adjust shadow quality or post-processing in the video options menu is still locked. There are some balancing issues that make themselves painfully apparent within the first hour or so of gameplay, namely the rate at which you accrue money. Tackling big number bounties might seem like a great idea, but they're prohibitively difficult (as of level 7, all the available bounties were way way out of my level range) and grinding freelance missions can sometimes feel monotonous. Additionally, the lack of communications chatter between ships can make space feel somewhat sterile. When rescuing a ship from pirates, it would be great to hear a panicked captain's voice pleading for assistance, or thanking me for the help. These are minor gripes about what amounts to an overall great experience.Granted, I haven't played through a ton of the story campaign content, and my time with the game might be small compared to others, but having seen such a triumphant turn-around from the first entry, I felt compelled to gush a little bit, and congratulate the developers. Well done, guys! I tend to not be one to jump on the early access titles very often, but it was honestly really cool watching the development of this game, seeing community input being utilized, and watching something grow from nothing. I can say truthfully that I don't regret purchasing this game during early access in the least.4 out of 5 stars.			",149,17,0,71,22,0,60

												With only 3 hours play this is only first thoughts.A worthy title. If you have played any of the X series of games this is it's younger and not so complicated brother. In some ways it is more like Freelancer but either way it has nods to all these games whilst keeping it light on the learning curve. You can jump right in and start blasting asteroids for early bucks and the early missions (freeplay) are doable with the starting ship.I have several mods that give me Star Trek ships and a Star Wars universe to roam in which are both from the Steam Workshop.In short (in earlry play) this is an instantly playable space trading/shooter that looks and feels great but don't expect the depth that the X series has (which for some people will be perfect ;) )7/10 Go give an asteroid a new bumhole.

												This game was a big surprise for me. I was never much into heavy stuff like Star Citizen with their real physics and hardcore gaming. SPG2 is fun, entertaining, tense, interesting, relaxing, I cannot describe it in a few words. I found this by accident and decided to give it a try. It blew me away. Please, give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it. Can't wait to see what will they come up with next! 11 out of 10!Update Jun 2016. Seeing and playing Warlords, you can tell how deeply these devs care about their players. Warlords is so much bigger and with so many stuff people wanted in SPG2, that I can recommend it over SPG2. But if you're relatively new to the genre, this gem is currently on massive 80% off and it's worth every cent.			",25,15,0,2,3,0,5

Early Access Review
								Overall, it's a very, very good game. I've split this review into a few categories, so maybe that'll help you find what matters most.- GameplayLet's be honest here. This game is about space combat, not about mining or scavenging or being a space taxi man. That's where the ""meat and potatoes"" of this game is. So this is the most important thing for this game to get right. If it fails at this, it fails as a game.And to its credit... gameplay is superb. Combat is fun, if a bit monotonous once you get a really powerful ship. It only keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're in real danger of losing your ship, such as when facing a really strong enemy while you're flying a much weaker ship, or a large fleet of enemies on your own.Capturing an enemy ship is very satisfying. Unfortunately, towing ships takes a very long time and can be quite boring, especially if you're being attacked by enemies the whole way there. This game is still in early access, so balancing will still happen, so we'll have to see where it goes. But for now, its an amazing game and I can't wait for more!There are a few immersion-breaking issues, though, such as the large delay, stutters and pauses when starting up the game, when entering a new area, when receiving new missions, or when auto-saving. However, since this is early access and not full release, we'll have to see what will become of these bugs.Score: 9/10- StorylineNone. At least none that I could find. While the game is tremendous fun on its own, with farming resources, capturing enemy ships and destroying enemy outposts, there doesn't seem to be any real purpose to it. At least not until the game is finished.The story is still being developed, as this is still an unfinished product. But if this turns out to be a game where the war between factions can have the tide of the war turned either way depending on the player's success or failure in certain missions, it could be very cool, especially if areas become owned by different factions thereafter.Score: Unknown (Not yet finished)- ControlsThe controls are nice and solid, with ships feeling very responsive (small ones) or sluggish (large ones) depending on size. The way a ship accelerates and breaks is also much more believable and immersive than you might believe from early footage. Trying to get a carrier to stop within 100m of a target feels like a feat of piloting at times.3D space combat has been perfect by this game. I've played many space combat games like Homeworld, Star Trek Online and several others. But this game nails it and then some. At first I didn't understand why all the buttons and controls were needed for. But after enough time playing, I get it. And the position of the keys and what they do really helps give you a great feeling of control in the game.Score: 10/10- Graphics and SoundLet's face it, as time marches forwards nobody wants to see ugly-looking games (unless they like Indie or retro games). And this game has some of the finest looking graphics one could hope for. They look beautiful, and even at 1440p on my GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB it still performs smoothly (except when there are a lot of ships).Considering that this is on the low side of a mid-tier graphics card, I'm impressed. With more graphics settings I should be able to increase framerate, and coding optimizations should also help make the game run smoother in the long term.Sound wasn't much of a focus on this game, but the chatter and computer voice are really nice, and remind me a lot of the voice of the Enterprise-D in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was a heart-warming surprise, and I can't wait until we get a total conversion mod for Starpoint Gemini 2.The lack of a large variety of background music did feel a bit annoying and lackluster, but time will fix that. I'd love to have this game include beautiful symphonic and orchestral music, like Star Wars, Star Trek, and other great SciFi series. Music could really help take this game to the next level.Score: 7/10- ChallengeThe game felt off-balance at several points during my dozens of hours playing so far. Capturing a large ship early on and using it felt almost like cheating on Normal difficulty. I'd like to see more balancing, such as not being able to use more than X amount of turrets on a ship depending on how many ranks below its minimum requirement you are. (So, if you're level 25 and trying to use a level 35 ship, you wouldn't be able to use 2 turrets in each direction.)The long-term replay-ability right now is hindered because the game hasn't really given players much of an end-game challenge or reward system. Once you have earned 50M credits, and have several Dreadnoughts in your garage, the game just doesn't feel challenging anymore.I'd like to see something to give the players the ability to hire commanders and bridge officers to command the ships in their garage, to they can join the player in large scale battles. This way it helps the player build his very own Armada to wipe out large (and challenging) enemy structures.Right now all the fun is at the first 30 levels of the game. Once you reach that, it gets monotonous. But given the early development of this game, I think we can expect great things from it, especially with modding support.Score: 6/10- FunWhat can I say? I had a blast (no pun intended)! It was exciting and challenging for a long while, and it's consumed me for the past few days. I've lost sleep planning what my next ship upgrade should be, or where to lurk around under cloak waiting to capture the ship I wanted (but couldn't afford). Few games drag you in and hold your attention like that. All I can say is that I'm beyond impressed!Score: 9/10- ConclusionI guess here's what I've got to say. For a game on Early Access on Steam, this is as much promise as I could dream of. (Unless you count Star Citizen, but that isn't fair.) It's fun, exciting, supports modding... it just isn't finished.If you're looking to buy a whole package that's neatly wrapped up, ready to go, this game isn't for you. When you play an Early Access game, you're getting a sneak preview, you're beta-testing a game that will (of course) be filled with bugs (and your job is to report them), and your feedback this early on will also help shape where the game goes. You get to be involved in the creation of the game, and if it succeeds you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a little.This is a sneak preview. It's a taste of what's to come. And so far, I like what I see. They've got the game where it counts. Now it's just a matter of the final touches like faction warfare, dynamic economy, trade blockade, storyline, and so on. But given how far this game has progressed, that shouldn't take too much longer. I haven't seen many bugs, and for 25$ right now this game is a steal!I give this game a wholehearted approval, and my recommendation to buy it. I can't wait to see what kind of amazing mods we'll see. Here's hoping the team that did the Star Trek Armada III mod for Sins of a Solar Empire can start working ASAP on Starpoint Gemini 2.

Early Access Review
								I had this game gifted to me by a friend(Thank you, Thune!), and it's easily one of the best space games I've played in awhile.  If you enjoyed the freedom that the X series gave you, but absolutely hated the UI(or lack there-of), this is a game to rectify that.Flying your ship is quite easy and fun, combat is rather fluid and in-line with the class of ship you're currently flying.  Combat is definitely part of the game, but certainly not the only aspect.  You can shoot asteroids for resources, scan anomalies, salvage wrecked vessels(of your own making via combat, or derelicts you find), send troops onto enemy ships in attempts to capture and then tow them to a station(strip them of fittings, sell them, or keep them for yourself), there's also trading between stations and planets.Everything you do awards some experience points(running missions, scanning anomalies, killing things, etc), which is then used to upgrade your character's abilities(weapon skills for railguns, lasers, plasma and heavy weapons; want your railgun shots to have a chance to fire twice with one volley?  A chance to penetrate shields and hit hull?  Longer bursts for your lasers?  Put points into the appropriate skills.)The devs are very active on the forums and always listen to the community, even adding community ideas into the game regularly.  They also really want the modding community to have as much control as possible to expand the game; as evidenced by the Steamworkshop support.I expect great things to be afoot for this game in the future, and even in early access it's fun to tinker around and see what you can get into.  The engine is solid and the dev team is very much hard at work, the community following the game is strong.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space games with no loading screens.

								I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. There are a lot of space games out there (and quite literally more coming by the day) but most focus on either small scale fighter combat (Freelancer / Freespace style), or large scale rts fleet combat (Sins of a Solar Empire / Home World). There isnt much of a selection when it comes to piloting your own larger class of ship from the helm. For those of you who enjoy the likes of Eve and Startrek Online i believe there will be much here you will enjoy. First impressions show a lot of potential and a fun RPG / progression system in place. The graphics are nice and the combat is enjoyable. I look forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer.			",332,25,5,35,21,3,50

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is not your ""typical"" Space Fighter game. When playing this game you need to treat your ships more as a ""crewed"" ship then a standard fighter ship. First mistake I made was trying to use my ship as a fighter, this reduced the amount of fire power and abilities of my ship greatly. Every ship in the game is a manned ship meaning turrets are controled by you or you can assign crew to operate them for you, leaving you the ability to keep them in line with the target. Its an extremely in depth game, and extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it to any one who is tired of the same old ""fighter craft in space"" game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Having just played through Rebel Galaxy, maybe I was expecting too much, but couldn't get into this.  It lacks cohesive vision, just feels like a bunch of different game systems tacked on, and thrown together, with nothing in particular being well done.  It's not terrible, just dull.  Combat is dull, trading is dull, the progression system is dull, weapon and ship variants, factions, characters, various ways of adding percentage bonuses to basic abilities, ship enhancement items, crew members you can hire, but nothing does anything interesting.  The story is barely more than a distraction.  The gameworld is just a bunch of planets and stations clumped together in a cubic space, with a binary star painted in the background, like the scenery behind a fishtank.  It's a space sim which seems to be created by people who have no interest in basic astronomy whatsoever.  Disappointing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who loves space games, including strategy, simulation, sandbox, RPG, and almost any genre in space, I love this game.  Im an avid fan of X3: Terran Conflict and the X series in general.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has so many things right and is fun, simple, and rather elegant.  I highly recommend it.  However, as with all games, it does have drawbacks and a few not so great things. First off, Voice Acting-You will likely notice it straight away when you start the campaign.  The voice acting is certainly better than that in the original, however it is still poor.  Most characters have strange accents or inflections, strange pronunciations which are inconsitent between characters (specifically the word ""stasis"") and no emotional connection.  The main character, Adrian Faulkner, is basically monotone with no depth nor feeling thruout. As a man who just lost his father and is out for revenge, he is VERY boring.   So do not expect the story to be compelling on that count. Story/missions-The story in SPG2 is better that is was in the original, and seems more streamlined, however it still remains quite boring after a short while.  I understand the game is mostly freeroam/sandbox, so take this as you will.  However, the missions are a bit more diverse than the original with some capture stuff added in as well as some scanning and transporting.  But it still remains the standard ""Go Here, Kill/capture/scan/transport, Return, Listen to more dialogue""    So dont expect alot of diversity in missions.  Its pretty much the same with side missions and freelance. Gameplay-The gameplay is terrific. Its nice, simple, and easy to use.  Its easy to jump into the game and not have to learn 1000 controls or things to do.   However I personally miss some of the depth of controls and other minor things for the sake of immersion. (Thinking of X3) Ship models / aesthetic -The overall design, and texture of all ships and stations were fantastic and very intricate.  I might have to say they are some ofmy favorite ship designs in a long time.   Planets are ok, but lack proper scale.  Vigo at the start is almost the same size as planet trinity or at least pretty close.  Go look at planets in X3 and see proper scale.  However I understand such an accurate massive scale wouldnt work in an sandbox single system. Its something that many space games (mostly strategy games) do. In the end I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, simple space sim with a bit of RPG elements thrown in.  You will get a good 40 or so hours out of it, then will lack anything to do. There are freelance missions that will repeat forever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												--UPDATE--  Starpoint Gemini Warlords has entered the beta stage of Early Acces.  If you haven't already bought SG2, I would recommend skipping right over to SGW instead.  It directly addresses the issues found in  SG2  and offers fleet building and management while retaining the things that were great about SG2.  SG2 is still a worthwhile purchase if you have money to spare, but comparing the two, SGW is definitely a step up - including the ability to hotswap between KB/M controls and an XB1 Controller.It's a pretty good game.  I feel that SG2 is deep enough to be interesting, but not so deep that it becomes a chore to play.  It is very RPG-like in that regard.  This isn't what I would consider a ""super-complex"" simulator, but the gameplay elements are more reflective of mainstream game design.  This is not X3: Albion Prelude (a great choice if you're looking for an extremely long-term 4x/space simulator game, btw.  I highly recommend X3AP, too.).  You don't need to spend hours on end just learning the game to enjoy it, but it is still a deep enough system that you can do what you want with it.  ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"", is I guess, as close to the truth as possible.There are a large number of ships to be purchased and each has a number of components that can be swapped out.  The individual components can be upgraded with a variety of stat bonuses.  Crew members can be hired who will also provide different stat bonuses.  You can choose a character class at the beginning of the game that will give different abilities, and that character will gain levels as you play.  NPC wingmen can also be hired.I like it because it is all the things I enjoy from EVE Online, but as a single-player game, with all the single-player elements I would expect.  There is an optional story-line campaign that can be played or ignored at your leisure.  I'd recommend starting the game in Campaign Mode, not Free Roam.  The only difference between the two modes is the lack of story-line missions in Free Roam as far as I can see.  Free Roam in SG2 is like playing Skyrim without the story missions.The game is very flexible in terms of how it can be controlled.  I've seen people say that the controls are bad, but I got used to them quickly.  Once I got used to switching between control styles with the press of a couple of buttons it became a very fuid experience.  You can take manual control of ship-to-ship combat or allow the game to do the bulk of the work depending on your mood with the press of a few buttons.  You can switch between multiple camera perspectives, mouse vs keyboard turning, and/or lock the camera to your turrets or follow your ship with the press of a few buttons.  This dynamically changes the gameplay ranging from playing the game like a 1st person space flight shooter to a 3rd person EVE Online style point-and-click system complete with the wheel-menu auto-pilot system.  There is even the EVE Online style auto-targetting system that allows you to tell your ship's turrets to automatically fire at hostile targets in range with the press of a button.  Manually aiming and shooting will increase your rate of fire and damage potential, but your ability to hit the target is based solely on your aiming skills.  Auto-targetting slows down your rate of fire, but hitting targets is based on your ships numerical statistics.The game also randomly generates side-missions, which are the standard faire (""go here, pick up this, scan that, kill something, deliver this"" etc, etc.).  I can't really complain about that, though.  They're optional and I don't know what I would have done differently.  They're short and sweet and appropriately rewarding.  It's something to do and it keeps the money flowing in!Choosing missions is a simple process.  You open up the Starmap and click on the icon to bring up the mission description and click accept (or the ""OK"" button to close the window if you don't want to do it).  These missions tell you the recommended level, what needs to be done, and the reward for accomplishing it.  The game also allows you to click anywhere on the map and select a ""Go to"" option from the pop-up menu.  This will set your ship on auto-pilot and take you to the location.  Just keep an eye on the screen for long distances.  Unlike EVE Online, objects in space are actually solid and running into an asteroid or space-station isn't going to do your ship any favors.Graphically, it looks really great on max-settings.  It is slightly stylized, so it should age well as time goes on.  And holy crap, the customization for the ships is great.  Other games would charge micro-transaction fees for what you're allowed to do with your ship customization in this game.  You can change the name, the color of the name, the logo, the color of the logo, the paint color, the ""glossiness"" of the paint (to the point of making your ship look like a mirror, if you want).  Flying around in the USS SrFrogg23 with a neon-red logo and Skull & Crossbones Pirate logo with reflective black paint that you can see the surrounding stars on is pretty cool!The game's performance on my computer has been great.  I haven't noticed any frame-rate drops, even when there's a lot going on on the screen.  There is a slight hiccup when travelling from one ""sector"" of the map to another (the hexagonal sections of the Starmap), but I think that's probably textures being loaded.  Not a big deal considering the game doesn't use any load screens or ""instances"" to separate locations.  The whole map is ""open-world"" so everything is connected.If I have any complaints about this game it is the voice-acting and music placement.  The voice-acting is passable, but not great.  I really wish the devs had put the ship's voice through a few filters to give her a more synthetic sound.  I guess she's supposed to be a helmsman or something, but she constantly provides updates using the same sound-bytes and it just doesn't sound natural for a human being to provide the exact same dialog in the exact same tone for the same situations over and over and over again.  That's something I can look passed, but I think it would have been easier to accept as a player coming from an on-board A.I. system.The music is also really nice when I'm out flying about, but docking (Anchoring) at stations has music that seems extremely out of place.  It's epic, and it's ok for a title-screen, but it gets really loud and obnoxious when I'm browsing through a station's selection of ships and component upgrades...  The station music wore out its welcome extremely fast.The game also has controller support.  It's passable, too, but not customizable in any way that I would like.  I recommend playing with a keyboard and mouse to get the most out of the game, at least until you know all the icons and abilities by heart, but that may just be a matter of preference.  Mousing over abilities and ship commands with the mouse will show a tool-tip that tells you what the button does.  Using gamepad controls, on the other hand, doesn't provide a tool-tip.TL;DR:  It's a good Space-based RPG that takes older, more complex space simulator games and gives them a more modern/mainstream feel.  It is easy to get into and provides a lot of gameplay flexibility.  I have only minor gripes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game keeps telling me to use things on the menu that simply don't exist at my level. Lack of ammo for the main weapon, 1990's looking HUD. When you land on a Planet, it's a photo. No attemp to feel like your on a far away civilization. Took 1/2 hour to figure out how to land on the planet w/o blowing up and having to do the ENTIRE mission over. SPOILER ALERT: Space travel is very slow. But for $8 what the heck. Someday I'll have time to get as high as the designers and figure out this frustration fubar.It's just seems to be more frustrating than what it's worth. Wormholes where none are being displayed, supposed upgrades are just terrible downgrades. Losing interest real fast. You're told to ""Follow"" a ship, yet the ""Follow button in the HuD is grey'd out; no way to match speed of ship you're following... It'll take hundreds, if not a thousand missions to afford a ship, worthy of making this game fun. Excuse me while I gladly step out of this air-lock.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game that surpass expectations and delivers countless hours of fun and excitement to any space Sim fan.I came across Starpoint Gemini 2 when the lack of time made me stop playing X3 Terran conflict/AP. I'm a huge fan of X series but the amount of options you have are so vast that consequently increases the complexity of the game and therefore the time you have to invest to progress. Unfortunately with work and all, I just stopped playing those majestic games.SPG2 is not that complex and therefore its perfect if you want most features that a space Sim should offer but in a simple and easy way. You still have it all... Trading, Mining, Piracy, Boarding and countless more things to do, just way more accessible.Recommend 100% ",22,4,0,0,5,0,3

								I see some potential, but it is a bit of a letdown if you're expecting something like Freelancer. The visuals are nice and there are lots of options for cargo and things like that, but the whole place just feels desolate. There is no signs of life anywhere. I mean, you see ships, but they seem like drones. There is zero com chatter or anything resembling conversation. The only one who talks to you is your ship. You never see any people when docked on space stations or planets. That really brought Freelancer to life, where you could talk to people in the station bars and get tips. This place seems dead by comparison.			",13,3,0,5,7,0,5

												Unfortunatly although the game has good reviews i found it mediocre to bad at some points. it has lousy ai (both pathfinding in space the ai keeps on bumping into stations or planets trying to go to the location you have picked) and with the ""fleet"" (2 ships as far as i saw max). You cant actually give them commands so a lot of times they will conflict with what you are trying to do (like board a ship and they will fire destroying it).The story is also mediocre and the VO is down right bad. There are too few side missions at least in the story mode (basically go destroy or capture target, repair or scan anomaly and move cargo/vip from station to station). The game is pretty at times ( i liked the varied ship art) and the music is quite good also at times. Would not recommend it unless really cheap 5 or less or you are bored with nothing else to play.			",143,85,2,40,21,1,25

												When I first got this game, I played for about 10 minutes and was disinterested.  I really don't know why, perhaps I was a bit impatient that day.  About a week later I came back and really got pulled in.  I'm 29 hours in now and loving it.  The graphics are good, I'm enjoying the story, and I'm also free-roaming all over.  There are some quirky mechanics such as ship-boarding that make it a bit easier than it should be, but other than that I truely enjoy this game.  I've already purchased Warlords and I am looking forward to how that game progresses as well.  Alot of enjoyment here, just spend the time to learn the mechanics and have fun!  The developer and the community are great so this has been a good experience for me, well worth the purchase price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just check out the forums they respond to almost every thread.  They are very understanding and listen to ""YOU"" about everything you have to say about this game as it's in alpha status even though it seem like a full release game without a story at the moment.

												A solid effort for those who enjoyed Freelancer.  Early impressions 7/10.  The fact I've been pretty non stop should bump it up more, but there are a few nagging things I'd like to see improved over time.1) When I'm shooting at a target many of the rounds appear to pass through and not impact on the targets shield or ship body.  I'm still doing damage, but that sense of kinetic/energy contact would help the immersion.2) AI tactics are in the early game underwhelming.  I'd like to see enemies do more drastic evasive manouevers to look like they're concerned about you as a threat a bit,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short Version: If you like space tactical combat, exploration, a bit of trading and if you're not just looking for another stupid space dogfighting simulator, this might just be the game for you. At a decent price and with DLC at a very low price, this game is totally worth a shot. It's not without it's flaws though. The devs, apparently, take player input seriously and are constantly looking for ways to further improve the game, which is rare nowadays.The long version:The Good:- You actually feel like you're in command of your ship. You're flying tripulated ships with several guns and missiles to fire on your enemies and sometimes even fighters and bombers to assist you! This is not another stupid ""dogfighting style camera view"". It's more tactical and I love the devs for making that choice.- Combat is very interesting and you can decide how you want your engine/shields/weapons focus in the middle of the fight.- Graphics are very good and the design is ""colorful"".- You actually feel like you're evolving as you advance in the game and have access to new ships. There are many options to suit your playstyle.- You can fly Capital ships (dreadnoughts and carriers) and they're not useless sitting ducks like they're in EVE online. In Starpoint Gemini 2, you can actually destroy smaller ships in the blink of an eye flying one of those, as it's supposed to be when you're flying a freaking Battlestar with fighters and tons of guns at your disposal.- Devs are constantly looking from feedback from the playerbase and they're very active on forums, taking players advices and questions and participating on the debates in a polite and helpful manner.- You can send your troops to board enemy ships and try to steal them in a very interesting and original mechanic. Nothing like trying different strategies and escaping with a nick of health from a battle after taking your former enemy's ship with you in tow back to a station.- Capital ships!- DLC at a very low price that offered some new content.- Did I mention Capital ships?!The Bad:- Several things are not clear on the tooltips and there are no manuals inside the game. There is no ""ship encyclopedia"" as you'd expect on a title like this.- The difference between weapon types, bombers, fighters and interceptors is not clear.- There are not too many weapon types in the game. It seems like it lacks some variety.- There is no clear DPS indication. There's an ""average"" indicator on weapons, but you have to calculate the firing rate manually to figure that out, apparently, so it's hard, at a glance, to know which weapon to use as an upgrade.- The management of your shields could improve and be something more like Star Trek Online, where you have to define what side gets the bonuses.- The way ""Fire at will"" works should be improved on. You could mark targets (as you do with fighters) and your tripulation would shoot them, instead of firing on everything and everyone around randomly as it is right now.The Ugly:- A few bugs still annoy me, such as not being able to launch the game if I have Teamviewer service running on the background or not being able to run the game in window mode simulating full screen. If I alt tab while in fullscreen, the game will switch to a window mode, and I have to close and reopen the game to load the fullscreen again. Another bug happens when you take a mission and you're unable to complete that, such as the missions that tell you to patrol and when you get to the place you're supposed to go, nothing happens.- Voice acting is TERRIBLE.- Missions get repetitive quickly, so you'll be unwilling to play after the grind for the big ships is over.- Strongest ship unlocks at level 40, so nothing to look forward to after that level.- Story is poor.

												I can not believe how much fun I am having with SPG2.   I have played the X games and enjoyed them, however, I always found them obtuse and very difficult to learn.  SPG2 is simple by comparison but this in no way a bad thing.  They have found all the elements I found fun and pulled them out and made an awesome game.   Combat is fun, I feel like I am in control of a mighty star ship, not some egg with guns.   However, if your not careful you can be over run and taken down.  The ballance is great, I have died but never have I said ""but why"" or ""that wasn't fair"" .   There is Traiding in the game but its simple, again not a bad thing.  If I wanted Stock market sim 2015 I'd have gone and bought that.   This is a nice system to make money with that I don't have to spend weeks reserching prices and locations.    Mining and salvage as well, but again, I don't have to spend a week trying to find a station that sells mining or salvage mod for my ship.   Weapons are again Simple.  havinge 300 different items that all do basicly the same thing isn't a plus in my books.  3 weapon types with several items for each class and clear choices which is better.  Ships are again simple with up to 10 systems to worry about.   I find no fun in the need to have 100 different system for a ship.... simple is better.I Now have 35 hours in this game,  one of my top single player game in my libray now.  I find it difficult to find any con's for this game that the DEV's seem to be very involed in.   My only thought is More Ships, but again keep it simple.Awesme game all around.			",81,5,3,4,5,0,6

This is a brilliant 3D space game with tactical combat, fantastic soundtrack and the devs have a beautiful sense of humor. You are transporting Annoying Guy to the next station, pirates attack you while you have your cargo hold full of adult magazines and things like that.

												Considering the game is mostly centered around flying around and combat, the controls are absolute garbage. Some agree with this, some don't. Also, the UI is frustratingly unreadable at time. These are obviously just my opinions, and why I do not recommend the game. You may have a different experience, but for me it's a thumbs down.

												Since all the other recent reviews were so negative I avoided this until it was 80%-off.If you can get it at that price then I certainly recommend it but that doesn't make liars of the other reviewers - at full price it is too buggy, limited and awkward (when you start) to recommend.Bugs (under Win 10) - rare crashes to desktop after 10+ hours continuous play, not-at-all-rare and repeatable loss of accepted (but not completed) missions on loading a game.Limited - like most space games it's deliver this there, do this there, kill that there.  Get money and experience for a bigger ship so you can do the same missions against bigger enemies.Awkward - the context-menu takes a bit of getting used to and there can be a LOT going on at some points so you need to practice to keep up with everything.  This is especially true when boarding ships in the middle of an ongoing battle, but then capturing three or four ships in a single engagement is unusual and earns mega-credits.  Seriously, play it right and you can buy a ship, use it to capture enemies in a battle and immediately afford the next bigger ship.  Practice does pay off though and after a few hours it all feels pretty straightforward.Bigger, longer battles really bring out the awesome in this game.  It might not be Eve level but it has Elite beaten!  I have seen groups of 4 factions fighting each other (with me generally mixing it in the middle ^^) with reinforcements spawing/arriving for battles of 20-30 or so ships at a time, lasting 20 minutes and leaving more 'derelict's than I cared to name.  That's nice, because you can drift around after the battles and loot all those dead ships for all sorts of goodies.  Naturally,  you have to be in a pretty substantial ship yourself if you're going to survive such an event.Broadly, it starts grindy and confusing, quickly gets interesting and gets better the longer you play.  Until 'been there, done that' sets in (in free roam).			",32,27,2,11,24,0,21

												The 35 hours i have spend on it were several play throughs because of content missing from early access, bugs during early access and my last playthrough: This game made such an incredible impression on me that i forgot i finished it. Yep, the game is that short and uninspiring that i actually forgot ever ending it and started to play it again. And during these few minutes of finishing this game for the second time i kept asking myself: When does this get interesting? Why is the voice acting so horrible? Why is every mission the same?So i backed a game that didn't live up to its promise of being worth my memories, it can happen. They dare to sell DLC that only adds a few ships for a game thats been finished 2 times in less than 35 hours? *sigh*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do I recommend it? Of course I do! It's a bloody masterpiece! And the fact that a team so small made a game this big is something I deepply respect. And that they are giving us free content updates regulary. And that they are actively talking to us on forums. And that they implement most of community suggestions. And that they made the game highly moddable and with Workshop support. Yes I deeply respect that and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even if you leave it after the campaign, you will still have more than 20 hours in it which alone makes it worth its price.Their newest game, Warlords is still in alpha but I can see how bigger and better it might become until release. If you want to participate in Early Access, go with Warlords, and if you want a finished game, go with SPG2.			",33,5,0,4,14,0,9

												So here we go. First of all, I found this because of it's Star Wars mod. As a huge SW fan, the option to fly Star Destroyer and wreak havoc across the galaxy was too tempting to resist. That said, I have to say that this game shines everywhere. It's just that good.PROS:+ Ship design+ Mods (Workshop)+ Music+ Combat+ Funny moments+ Developer support+ Community+ Free content updatesCONS:- Size (it's not really a game problem, but m Internet availability in Ethiopia)- Average voice-oversI would buy this over and over again. Do not hesitate. And if you catch it on a discount, it's definately worth your time.			",27,3,0,4,2,0,3

												The boredom, oh the boredom. I am not one who requires a game to be fast paced, I do not require anything to be overly shiney. Heck, I play Football Manager non-stop and to most that game is tear jerkingly boring. But alas! I have found a game that really does not grab me at all.I get it, many say after more hours you will get into it, and then many say after many hours it becomes repetitive. I am not going to wait around to find out. A game should grab you at least a little within the first few hours.Maybe I just don't like space games not based around Star Wars?			",82,23,3,21,70,4,42

Early Access Review
								Finally a game that has the potential to be even better than Freelancer - and that says something.Took me about 2-3 hours to get familiar with everything and to be able to play the game properly, even after playing years with space sims and space, so allow yourself a bit of time when first playing. Still in beta at the time of writing, so if something not works as it supposed to, for example crashes, or missions cannot be completed, strange enemy behaviour, do not get annoyed, the devs are constant fixing bugs and writing the game, developing. It is in a playable state already; you get a fairly powerful ship at the start, you can fly around, explore, get missions like repairing space bases, destroying pirates and playing taxi between distant bases. There is a good(ish) tutorial on the start to which you can go back any time, so you are not left alone to find out what is where. My biggest problem was having the ship not powerful enough, not fast enough and not having strong enough shileds until I found out about the quick and very handy power distribution feat - this is in the tutorial, but the information was so overwhelming that my attention slipped by the end and learned as I went along with the missions. I think (hope) there will be a smoother tutorial in the final version, perhaps like the one we get in Eve.  Everything I have seen in the game so far makes me think it was a good buy and worth every penny. I'm looking forward to see the final version and what other goodies will the devs come up. Recommendation: BUY IT !!!!			",137,22,1,7,13,1,22

												This game takes a bit to get used to. Also theres not too many guides to tell you the smaller information. Like if selling or buying the colors change. (Green good -red bad) between selling and buying.  So if your buying an item that is green its a better deal and if your selling an item  that is green its a profit.  Also they don't address the fact that after you take over a ship through boarding you need to grapple with the ship to take it back to a base to sell.  I left 1 ship out in space on accident that way.  Also there is a huge curve when it comes to getting new ships.  The first zone only carries 3 ships so your forced to go to different spaces and bases to find the one thats right for you. 9/10 gameplay (Its fun to play in space thats open ended)6/10 support (even manual doesn't answer all the questions)7/10 controls (especially in fights its hard to steer unless you stay still by cuttng all engines.)6/10 Missions ( The missions are almost all the same)8/10  Graphics (The graphics are good quality)9/10 Customization (Would be 10 but they really don't explain why certain weapons don't go on ship)Overall I give this game a solid 8/10.

								I must say that i'm very impressed! I had low expectations about this game, but after seeing some video playthroughs and reading some reviews, I gave it a chance. And, I'm glad I did! This game really reminds me of the classic and much-loved space sim, FREELANCER.The only bad thing I notice until now is the lag that happens time to time when I switch from normal game view to the map chart or game options screen. My rig is not very powerfull (I3, 4 GB of RAM, HD 7770), but I can play all my game library without lag, with good performance. But since the game is still an ALPHA version, I'M sure the developers will fine-tune it to be more compatible with older systems.If you like spce sims, trading in space and flying beautifully detailed ships, this game is for you.

												I kind of hoped this game would be an open world sandbox RPG like Mount and Blade but in space, however I was disappointed. It's suprisingly very shallow, overpriced, falls short in many aspects, missions are dull and repetitive, the game feels too grindy and the world is fairly lifeless despite being beautiful. With more depth the game could have been monumental.It is certainly not a terrible game and it has some merits, but it did disappoint me. If I could give it a neutral or maybe rating I would as I don't think it deserves a thumbs down, hence my recommendation.			",229,28,3,44,43,1,54

												I rarely write reviews so for me to post this you know it has to be bad. I got this at 80% off for like 8 bucks and I still think I was ripped off. Lets start:First you may see 15 hours played but that's really less than half that. Between all the random crashes and not being able to save... Oh yeah You can only save at a space dock or planet. Problem is they are so spread out and you travel so slowly(no hyperdrive mode just full impulse) you have to spend 20 minutes getting back to a save spot just so you can save your mission before it maybe crashes again. Forget trying to accomplish multipule objectives or missions in a row before a crash thats not possible. Before you ask its not my rig. They have bugs and issues all around, just do research. For such a new game to have this many issues is jarring. Speaking of bugs my second complaint: Lack of proper controller support. This nearly killed the experience for me. Sure you can theroretically use a controller but dont expect the game UI or even the menus to give a flying #$%. It says you can use a mouse and keybord with the controller but you cant, its locked at one or the other. Then all the games UI and in game menues and tutorials dont reconize the controller so good luck trying to figure out what to do. Also forget trying to use the controller to even land as there inane system wont reconize the contextual presses.  Even in 2014 this is inexcuseable, but they had multipule patches and its still terribleThat brings me to my final points, one leads into the other. This game was released in 2014 and in my opinion it was rushed for early access and beta's and all that nonsense. They made constant updates but largely all the bugs remain. Its like great you added a few things here and there but would you please fix the bugs? Nope. They made their money on this game so now they've stopped updating it compleletly to focus on Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Excuse me you release a buggy game, dont fix it, and then move on to a new one? What are you an EA wannabe? Which leads me to my last point, because of their constant pointless updates, not a single mod works. That was the last straw. I can deal with forced to use a mouse and keyboard, I was going to give the crashes a pass for the moment to see if it got better, but the *Total*  lack of mod support for only a 2,3 yo game is straight up insane and nonsense. If you know your game is moddable, you include a freakin mod manager, why would you release updates that ruin mods? And of course nobody wants to keep trying to make the mods work everytime they update. Sure theyve finally stopped but that still leaves every mod incompatable. I know what your going to say ""Dont buy games for mods"" Well honestly I do, some games I wouldnt play without them and this is one of them. Let me give you an example: The first space station you visit ""Vigo Station"" has most of the ships in the game, but you cant access the shipyard. Instead you can maybe find some research station way out in the void that maybe has a ship for a million credits thats slightly better than your starting ship. The only way to access the station is to increase your repuation but you only get 20 rep per mission. You'll out level your ship before you get enough rep to access the space port with the actual useable ships. Which you dont want to do tat because to more you level the stronger enemies become. So a simple mod that unlocks that station, and gives me access to powerful and yet affordable ships would save so much time you'd think.  Well I bought a ship and then the game crashes when I go to a planet. Then I load up the game and the screen  is blue and wiped out when I exit to space.   The developer even told me that mods no longer work for the game so there you go.  I almost feel bad, as I talked to some of the devs, and they tried to assess my problems and seemed nice. However I cant ignore these glaring issues. I only hope this review will save the moeny and time of those interested in this. I hope to get a refund for this but its my duty to warn others. I wish I never bought this game and instead bought Rebel Galaxy.			",60,1,1,9,2,0,15

												Ever since I played Starpoint Gemini, I have been a big fan. The original game was very easy ot use and not too overly complicated to use. The game was in 3D, but only flew in 2D, so it wasn't hard to get form point ""A"" to point ""B"" with little effort.Starpoint Gemini 2 takes the original game several steps fruther. The concept is sitll the same. You are a space pilot looking to make a name for yourself in the age of space trader. You can either play in campiagn or in freemode.Some of the things that have improved since the first game are as follows...1.) Flight is now in 3D instead of 2D2.) You no longer have to use jump gates to get to your destination3.) A lot more ships to choose from4.) Ships have a lot more upgrades to choose from5.) Some ships offer a ""Flight Deck"" where you can send small fighters out while you battle6.) Not only can you have a flight deck, but you can also choose which kind of fighters you want7.) This time, you can also land on planets as well as star bases8.) Combat is lot more ""tactical"" than before9.) You can now make friends and enemies, this determines if you are able to land on stations or planets10.) There are now factions, each with their own likes and dislikes about you and other factions11.) More items to buy and trade12.) Major improvementts on comba, flight, and trading system13.) There is now a fully viewable starchart you can use to determine where you are versus where you goOverall a much more enjoyable game with added features that allow a lot mroe to do as well as a lot more offer. The added bonus of flight decks is also very helpful for when you need that added help durig combat. If you are into the Space Trader system that has true 3D concept of space flight, this is a good game to get. If you loved Starpoint Gemini, you will love this second part. The added benefit of landing on planets is a major bonus from the original game.			",272,112,11,57,66,0,36

												I first fell in love with spaceship rpg games with Wing Commander Privateer. There was nothing like it at the time and I played hours and hours. Many years later, I found Freelancer and went through the same thing again, but after that nothing I played ever felt so close and so great as Starpoint Gemini 2. It has everything I loved about those games but also so much more, so many details and options and features added so well you can tell how much the developers care and love the game. I finished the storyline and all DLC and of course, I'm playing it again. And for sure won't be the last time.			",44,6,0,7,0,0,2

												With all the recent updates, this game is finally playable. I think their biggest issue was releasing this so half finished originally. If you enjoyed old school games like privateer, you'll find some neat similarities, mixed with freelancer style controls. Its got a lot of good structural things going for it, but still feels light on content, which is understandable given that its a small dev team working on it. Never the less those guys managed to put together a fun space sim that doesnt take itself too seriously. If you are looking for a hardcore space sim, this isnt it, but if you are looking to fly around blowing things up and occasionally have an interesting battle, then you are in the right place. I continue coming back to this game to see new updates, and if the dev guys continue to produce content, I think this will flesh out quite nicely, so that the universe doesnt feel so barren with the same 3 mission types everywhere.

												Since it has drawn so much attention, i have played it recently to see what was new offline ( internet issues). For some reason it didnt show how much i played recently and my total is incorrect because i got the spacebuttplug ( tsar) and restarted a few times, played some of the story. so since you all are reading it, let me elaborate further, What i noticed that has changed, Gravity field of wormholes, wormholes are now working, some balancing stuff, same ship enemies dont go down as fast and use their abilities. Gameplay: The central game mechanic is the combat and trade system which are very tight, trade is simple but at times exploitable thanks to licenses and some close stations that are close by, no big deal though you can only get a few millions at most each run. Camera views, weapon systems etc were good but for the love of all that is space worthy why not include a database for weapons and enhancements like you did with trading? This might seem minor to you but it is infuritating to go to wiki ( which also turns the game to windowed so i have to restart) while same thing exists for trade. Gameplay is very solid which is why it got my hopes up. Those are pros mostly, cons would be mostly with presentation. Story: I must say i mainly played freeroam but when i did try story mode. Something about main character put me off. It might have been choosen one wibe i got from the start (son of an admiral and all that) not to mention his accent was strange. The voice acting was done by professionals this time i see but the ghost from starcraft 2 telling me where to go felt funny, love his accent and voice. Those are fine, what kind of broke it with me was that missions were presented through text that was in a box and UI designers would know, the things in small boxes should be small because for some reason we are not inclined to read all that. Nice flavor text on bouties though. 2 major problems with freeroam story, repetitive missions ( transport X to Y, or go here kill all that moves, very little flavor to it but if the surrounding fluff is good, that is all you need, world of warcraft did it. lots of games had repetitive missions that did not feel repetitive, Why? Answer in presentation )reputation that do not even feel like you are progressing, easier to read reputation bar and actually meaningful reputation would be nice.  I will explain the biggest problem that is connected to this in presentation. By meaningful some contact from faction representatives contacting you for special missions and thanking you for your help, you can go nuts from there. As it stands now. the only faction i know is trinity coz they have a weird space station. Presentation: Here is the place where i loved it and hated at the same time. Graphics are some of the best i have seen, sounds are great ( computer voice being modable is good too), ship designs are hit and miss but even the ones that are bad have something good about them such as tsar the spacebuttplug, it is pretty funny how it looks but is still intimidating. Tutorial is a bit annoying but the game is complex so its fine, takes practice but not as bad as many other games ( elite dangerous comes to mind, which i quit because 4D parallel parking in a flying box is not my fun)  The problem is, the real problem is despite all those great gameplay, the space is made lifeless, it would have been so easy just to add some flavor fluff like in rebel galaxy, visit a bar, with people, get some place specific music and visuals. Officers are nothing but stat sticks. In fact let me explain the crux of the problem by drawing comparison from world of warcraft and harry protter: In harry potter, wands are used for spell casting but are such a big deal and visible in the story that you know what they are and they make the universe feel complete. In WoW: They are stat sticks, something you forget you had and just use for stats exactly like officers here, wasted potential.That is why it is so painful to engage in all that space combat again and again, the space feel lifeless, like you are the only living thing in the galaxy. I understand your main thing was the gameplay and combat, i get it but you need to support it with other things. This could have been mount and blade in space easily. Why did mount and blade succeeded? Because outside of its outstanding combat ( just like this game), it had decent world building, there were lords who acted based on whats going on in the world, lords and ladies who talked, npc's who you would see face to face, so what if they had literally 2 lines of dialogue, it was still an improvement over a text box, It is even more painful when you see these gorgeous graphics but all this dead space. The only reason i considered rebel galaxy superior because it had this world building, world still felt shallow but it felt like a world, not a combat simulator. Remember why No Man's Sky failed? Trillions of planets that all felt same and lifeless? Here it is the same thing but here is is painful because it can be fixed so easily. As a side note: combat is meh compared to other RPG games, in space simulator genre, its pretty good ( but can you make the boarding a bit more interactive? Its a space sim not pokemon) I hope this wall of text explains your worries, again i played before and after writing this review  ( after since the reactions) I think it could be great but you need to work on the world building, it is simply inexcusable with such talent you guys got.

												I don't often write reviews, but when I do, it's for a product I love. Starpoint Gemini is probably one of the most fun space games I've played. It feels reminiscent of the X series in a much-welcomed third person perspective(Though you have the option of using a mounted cam perspective instead if you prefer), with the noticeable lack of any empire-building elements to speak of; likewise controlling a fleet is very limited by comparison, and as far as I'm aware you have to be pretty far into the game to even start a fleet.The game, much like X, has a campaign option(Which I haven't played and therefore cannot comment on) and a sandbox mode. In the sandbox mode, you pick a starting ship and get thrown out into the universe with the usual obnoxious tutorial screens, and then it's pretty much straight into the action. Your prime objective for most of if not the entirety of the game will be to make more money, which you have several options for obtaining, such as mining, hunting criminals, trading goods, or pirating goods. It's all quite fun, but the payouts are generally small in comparison to the price of ships and equipment upgrades, meaning you're definitely going to have to spend several hours chauffeuring sales reps and diplomats through hostile territory and mining asteroids by the hundreds to ever afford that ship upgrade, but this is balanced out by the fact that the starting ships are pretty powerful generally speaking, and should last you as long as you'll use them... Though that doesn't mean that the money grind is any less monotonous.I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's just not as rewarding as it could've been. You grind money for the sake of getting a bigger ship, for the sake of grinding more money more easily, for the sake of getting a bigger ship. Perhaps the campaign provides more variety, but the sandbox is in desperate need of some more money-sinks.Graphically, the game is a joy to look at, though the fact that I rarely dabble into anything this modern could be skewing my opinion here a little. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or an anime, and colours are very vibrant, making literally everything stand out dramatically. The only thing worth complaining about in terms of graphics is the little debris particles that fly past your ship during movement, as they're practically the size of my tiny gunship's cockpit, but thankfully there's already a mod to remove them.All in all... It's definitely not a bad game. There are better games out there for the price, but I'd still recommend picking this up if you have money to blow, especially if you're a fan of space games. And if it's on sale right now, slap yourself for even giving it a second thought and then buy it. Just a forewarning however, it will definitely annihilate your social life.			",90,6,4,23,20,2,8

												If you liked Freelancer, you will love this. Though, so far, the story hasn't been as engaging as Freelancers but there is a freeroam mode that basically cuts that aspect out of it and just throws into this really well designed and nice looking universe, for you to do in as you please.The combat is awesome, the UI is nicely layed out and easy to understand and the game isnt overly complex for the sake of being complex (I'm looking at you X series). The soundtrack is pretty cool too.Its quite fun and addictive for now, but I can see it becoming quite repetitive. I'm sure later on in the game things become a bit more interesting with bigger ships and fleet battles, but the early game requires a lot of grind it seems.I recommend buying this on sale, as it is at the time of writing this review. I can't say, yet anyway, if its worth the full asking price. Though I am having a lot of fun with it at the moment.  ",197,18,1,19,15,0,35

												I'm a fan of space games. The problem with them has been for years that there's no depth to trading or interesting story to delve into. Quests in this one are all either mail carrier types or combat based. The fighting is fairly uninteresting as well.On the plus side, the graphics are very good and I loved the scenery. The game does have a very large area to explore if that is yoru thing, but as I mentioned above, it gets very monotonous quickly due to lack of depth.The other big flaw is that the only real way in this game to make money is by capturing ships. You can trade or just do missions, but it would take an awful grind to get enough money to change ships which seems like a balance flaw to me.Even on sale, I'm going to actually suggest you skip this one. No, there doesn't seem to be much better out there, but I would say you are better off never playing than to waste time on such a shallow game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Purchased on recommendation from a friend and loved it.Didn't have any of the technical issues that others have posted, and the comment about missions outleveling yourself is silly because each mission has a recommended level.  Not at that level? Do some sidequests or freelancing to level up - just like any open world game!The storyline is interesting but not essential, although I would recommend playing through at least a few hours of the story before jumping into a purely-freelance game because the early quests train you quite well.

												I've seen a lot of comparisons for this game to other popular titles and I think that is a disservice to this game, because then you start looking at what this game doesn't have.Here is what the game DOES have.Great graphics at low hardware cost.  The game looks good, it looks clean, the ships are detailed and the environment is gripping, and you don't have to sell your soul to play it.Great music.  It's the type of music you'd expect to hear if there were an intergalactic space composer.Lots of ship options:  There are enough choices to make your personal mark on the universe.Space:  Everything is better in space.Combat:  Everything is better with combat, especially in space.Great development team:  They are VERY involved with the community and the community is VERY involved with development, in the best ways I have ever seen, ever.It is a good game, at a low cost, that will provide many hours of enjoyment.

												This game was exactly what I had hoped; a mix of EVE online (minus the spreadsheets) and more action orientated space games like Freespace.I played through the storyline which served it's purpose of driving things forward but beyond that is rather forgettable. It also featured some of the worst voice acting / writing I have heard in a long time. Thankfully the sandbox of different mission types, trading and exploring more than makes up for it. One of the more enjoyable scenarios is ship capture where you have to whittle the targets shields and hull down to the limit and then board the ship with your troopers with the aim to capture it. This has big pay off's and lets you bank huge sums of money to buy new ships and gear.The ships are the main stay of SG2, they are nicely varied and do not fall into the EVE trap where every ship has to have its trade off's, in SG2, a Dreadnought can kick serious♥♥♥♥♥against all sized ships as you would expect and is a blast to play with.This game is a solid 8/10 and had me hooked all the way up until I had the best Dreadnought and Carrier available and could just mop up. Definitely looking forward to SG3 with hopefully some more budget thrown at it to get some writers / voice actors in to bring the lore to life.			",233,32,7,22,13,1,17

												I am really enjoying Starpoint Gemini 2!  Having never played the original, I was a little nervous about buying the sequel, but that isn't a problem at all!  Free roam mode gives you a blank canvas and you can do pretty much whatever you want.  The option is also available during the campaign, but I always feel compelled to stick with the story rather than go off and do my own thing for a little while.  Due to this, I have not spent much time at all on the campaign.  Doing random missions, trading, capturing enemy ships, and exploring have all distracted me from that.  However, the five minutes or so I have spent on the campaign were not all that impressive (shoddy voice acting, uninteresting writing). So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely, just not for the story.  Get this game if you want to get lost in a space sim for hours, not for some kind of an epic drama.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 3, 2015
												Ok this is my edited review. I'll try and be semi-objective as I have interacted with the dev's, their moderator and the community for some time. But please read on and judge for yourself.Spg2 is a tactical space combat sim. I joined in EA and didn't play it for long due to hardware limitations on my account but liked the idea of a big massive universe where the player doesn't end up being the ""King of the Hill"" but just a small piece of a bigger universe. And Spg2 filled that need for me. This is not the most epic game I've ever played and I didn't expect it to be. But from a small ~10-ish Croation developer team I've been surprised. Not only have these guys made their own engine which shows beatiful graphical capability but they also constantly updated the game for almost a year after release with steady patching and a nice and cheap DLC while being constantly (I can't express how crazy these dev's are when it comes to listen to player feedback and troubleshooting with the community, it's unheard of) active on forums and responding to any bug report they received and fixing it with each new update. This is more than half the reason I'd buy any game they'd ever release.Well about the game; There are more in-depth Space Games out there, more epic stories to be told. But this game doesn't pretend to be any of that. It knows it's limitations as a huge space universe where the player is just a small piece of the puzzle. And it does that extremely well. Imagine being in a single-player MMO ( yeah kind of contradictory) but that's how this game treats you. You're nothing more special than the next dude around. You won't change the Universe all by yourself but you're just a small part in a bigger scheme. I love that sense of relating to your own existence in the world. How many games dares that anymore? In an age where we all feel we're the turning point and center of the Universe this game is a fresh breath teaching us the Universe doesn't resolve around us but we're just here to try to survive and do the best we can. There's no classic story arch to this game. You don't end up feeling like you're the king of the world. You're just a captain in the void trying to fend for him or herself. That's it. And from a philosophical perspective I love that notion. Too many games rub your need for being the ""one and only"". Not this game. This is reality expressed through a game. You're not gonna matter more than others but still need to claim your place in the world. That's beautiful and invigorating and  ... well poetic in some sense. There's a story (campaign) in the game that lends itself to the lore created in Spg1. But former knowledge of that is not required. I am still on the last mission of that storyline but that's not the reason I play Spg2. I don't relate that much to the story as such but enjoy the stories I can make with my own captains more.The game lets you choose between story and freeroam missions at a whim. You can always wander off to do randomly generated missions even when playing the campaign (campaign has a fixed character while freeroam lets you generate your own male/female character) and explore as you see fit. My preference and love for space was to be more of a ""freelancer"" doing randomly generated missions for different factions making friends and enemies along the way depending on my choice of the missions I'd carry out for different factions (help one faction=lose reputation with another faction and vice versa). The game can be a grind for some, other cherish that type of neverending possibilities and in Spg2 the ever-changing possibilities for changing your reputation and the constant randomly generated missions can keep you playing this for hours on end.Some days I just log in, cloak my ship and enjoy the scenery. Other days I just log in to take my temper out on whatever faction I'm currently in bad standing with and make them suffer. For a better description of the game check some videos on Youtube or other reviews. I'm still sold on this thing and the constant updates, a very nice and cheap DLC plus the upcoming FREE DLC makes me wanna recommend this game to everybody. Best and coolest development team I've ever meet and a hell of a positive and friendly community.This game is Steam History for the books. The reason I still get into EA from time to time is because of these guys right here. This is a game made by gamers to gamers. And a hella lot of respect for their interaction, back-and-forth, constant updates and pleasent attitude. If you're in doubt visit the forum. These guys are the future of gaming and a pinnacle of how developers can make gamers trust and cherish them again (yeah plenty of jaded gamers out there seeing bigger companies♥♥♥♥♥♥all over their customers or make highly dubious decisions).Edit: It should be noted that this game twists a few familiar concepts of games and how to progress the best possible way. There's not much ""hand-holding"" here but the forum is pretty active to anyone needing a tip or two on how to get the most of it and learn those ""different"" mechanics/understanding from what other games usually bring. So remember to pitch in with questions if there are any or you don't understand something. The early game in particular can be a bit rough for new players but once they get a hang of it it's really not that hard to understand. over 9000 / 10			",44,4,1,10,1,2,5

Early Access Review
								*WOW*Space sims have almost disappeared as a genre over the last 15 years or so, but this is the most promising one I've play since X-3.  Having been disappointed by the original Starpoint Gemini, this mere Alpha of Starpoint Gemini 2 really blew me away.  The dev comment ""hugely improved sequel"" is very much an understatement.  I barely got my feet wet, but this game is literally a decade ahead of its amateurish predecessor.Forget all the wrongs of the original Starpoint Gemini (or just forget that game entirely), SG2 fixes all the terrible compromises it made:1. No longer locked a 2-D plane, you have full six degrees of freedom.  As the developer blurb says ""everything now is in 3D!""  *shock, horror* 2. No wierd incremental steering. (I guess you have to play the original to understand this one.)  As I said earlier, full six degrees of freedom.  Pitch, yaw, and roll to your heart's delight.  There's even a toggle to steer with you mouse for more precision dogfighting.3. No amateur voice actors reading non-native English scripts.  Not a lot of voice acting in the alpha, but what it did have was professionally polished.4. No hideous 2002-era low poly character renders.  Hand-drawn 2D portraits FTW!In general, the production values are up to what you'd expect from a modern game.  Those screeenshots don't lie, it really does look that good in-game.  The soundtrack and sound design is also very well done.  The UI is beautiful, handles well, and very user friendly.It's still alpha, so there some key content missing (mainly the campaign, and the the trade system is very under-developed), but so far this looks like the first promising successor to the Elite/Privateer/Freelancer legacy in years.

												Trader, Warrior, Pirate, Explorer, Bounty Hunter, Miner, Smuggler - a few of the things you can be in the Gemini Sector.  This game puts you in the boots of a newbie starship captain in one of the most volitile areas of human colonization, and it's your choice as to what you will do with your newfound freedom.  Will you avenge your father and find out why he was killed in the storyline?  Will you go off and discard your past in the free-roam sandbox mode?  The choice is yours.You start out with a very basic gunship, but the game doesn't limit you to one ship like some others (Darkstar One, X-Rebirth), but instead gives you the option to upgrade and upgun in one of several ship classes.  Do you like the thought of zipping around in a fast, maneuverable stealth corvette?  You've got several to choose from.  Maybe you'd prefer to roll into a hostile area in one of the mighty dreadnaughts or carriers and outgun everything in the zone (except perhaps another dreadnaught or carrier)?  You can do that, too.  Or you'd like to be a trader, working your way from your starter ship to a freighter, and then a freightliner, ferrying cargo, buying cheap and selling high.  Again, your choice, but remember to pack guns to keep the pirates off your back, as they have the same choice in ships as you do!  You'll do all of this in a *very* good-looking setting that has NPC ships doing their own thing according to their own agendas.  My personal favorite example of this was the time I was attacked by a group of pirates.  I was in a destroyer, which is fairly middle-of-the-pack in speed-to-guns/armor, and flying with a group of trader ships.  The pirates jumped us, I engaged...and the traders *bolted!*  Left me there and ran, as they weren't going to stick around and slug it out with pirates that outgunned them (being businessmen in freighters rather than naval officers in warships, it seemed their AI told them to GTFO).  Just as I was swearing to hunt them down (if I survived this and didn't have to reload halfway across the map), security forces from the nearby station arrived with battleships and cruisers and what was a brutal last stand became a lopsided pirate turkey shoot.  Brilliant!Starpoint Gemini does a lot of things right, and the devs have shown a lot of interest and support in the community.  There were a few bugs on first release, but continual support has polished this into a real gem most space-sim fans will enjoy greatly.  9/10			",59,5,0,18,8,0,36

												A very good game. Don't expect it to last longer than 2 weeks though. You can do a lot of things like: 1. Upgrading your ship. 2. Commanding a carrier type ship with 4 turret slots and 4 missile slots. 3. You can board another ship. 4. Station defense / Station assault type of missions. 5. Launch fighters/interceptors/bombers from your ships.The thing is that it's a very short game with a ton of good gameplay that'll keep you hooked. Unfortunately, you find yourself doing repetitive things (like boarding, mining, etc.). You'll eventually find yourself with more money than you can count and you've basically done everything there is to do in the game. Compared to other gaming simulators, this one is a junior. Great to get back into space sims, but not your ""goto"" space sim. For your ""goto"" space sim, I would actually recommend the following games: 1. Elite Dangerous (Once it's released. It might already be I don't know). 2. Star Citizen (This game promises a lot and has a lot of potential. Wait for it to be released)3. X: Rebirth 3.0 (I know some of you space sims fans HATE this game, but in reality, this game had a very shaky start with bugs that would render the game useless, but in version 3.0, almost all of these bugs have been fleshed out, there's a ton of new features, and it's a GRAND game). I've been playing X: Rebirth 3.0 for a month now and I have yet to do everything it offers. It's beautiful!			",314,57,4,36,13,3,23

Seems very cookie cutter for stores. Do love the anomalys. Weapon prices are way to high. Can't experiment without hours of grinding. Right off the bat though, the cost system needs to be re-balenced. otherwise fun. As a gameDev myself, ask yourself, ""Am I making the player grind just to extend gameplay hours?

												This game has a lot of good stuff in it, but also some weak spots.Brief description of the game:You are commanding a capital class ship in either a sandbox experience or a campaign with main missions. You will be flying around undertaking side missions and smaller assignments, upgrading your ship size and firepower.First I will start with good things:+ Proper 3D movement, your ship rotates in all directions+ Huge map full of objects in space, except planets and spacestations space is full of ships of various factions and other space objects like solar power plants, gas collectors, prisons, etc. All of those obejcts come with few designs so the feeling is that most of them are unique. In addition there are clouds of radiotion of electric storms.+ In dept ship command. In addition to guns your ship also has tractor beam (you can pull enemy ships), teleport and marines (you can board enemy ships and pull them to nearest station to sell them), launch bays for fighters, slots for various consumable items (bombs, AI turrest, boosters, repair bots etc)+ Power management. You can direct power between 3 main areas of your ship - engines, weapons and shieldsm by default power if directed 1/3 to each, but you can channel it to one of them in order to receive +100% bonuss to speed, reload, recharge etc, at a cost of -% to others. (PRO TIP: always channel power to engines when you fast travel for +100% boost, since you cannot shoot in this state anyway)+ Large selection of ships and weapons as well as system upgrades to treak your ship as you like it, weapon types are really different (plasma are slow firing, slow flying, hight damage, hight power consumption; laser are 100% acurate, quick firing, low damage; projectile are quick firing, medium damage, fast flying) as for missles you can get some with huge area of effect or long distance small area of effect etc.+ Campaign is not so bad, but lack of options, alternative solutions etc makes it a less fun.Now to negatives:- Bad voice acting- Poor mission reward system - if you wanna by new ships and top weapons you better learn to board enemy ships, do it for few hours at start then start campaign fully equipped. (for example: low level assassination task will give you 4-10k credits, while if you board enemy craft, kill the crew and pull it to space station you will get 80-120k plus you will complete the mission), just doing missions for money is mindless grind and gets boring really fast.- Not involving space combat, this will require some longer explanation.Your ship has turrests, shields and missile weapons in 4 sectors (front, aft, port and starport). You can manually aim turrets, but odds of you hitting a tiny little black dot on black space around you are virtually none, the only thing you can hid manually are destroyed ship husks and space station with are not moving. So in order for your turrest to do anything you set them to auto-fire then they will randomly pick a target and shoot few bursts at it, then change target and go on. In the end during combat you can only select target and manually fire guided missles at it and rotate your ship so that more turrets and fresh shields are facing the enemy. After 10h of playing this is damn boring !!!- Not interesting PTE (power to engines, which is a form of quick flying), as to why it doesnt set power distribution to engines for 100% and has to be done manually for a nice speed boost is a wild guess. And you dont get this fancy visuals of super fast travel like we know from movies, it is just that, your ship flies faster.Conclusion:I recommend this game as it is quite fun to play for space exploration for 10-20h of fun, therefor I advice get it on discount because it is not worth 40€.Then I advice you to learn how to board enemy ships quickly so you can make some good credits and try out weapons and ships.

												This game is totally worth every penny.  Not only do I have a passion for space/sci-fi genres (as well as a few others) but the fact that they give you both a campaign and free roam mode only games it better since free roam basically lets you do what you wish.  You command a ship and can do whatever you want. Become a pirate and capture other ships and their cargo, become a trader and buy/sell goods between planets and space stations, become a bountry hunter, and much more... It also helps that the Gemini System (map) is pretty damned big with constant activity.  My favorite moments involve coming upon large battles between factions, or simple skirmishes between myself and a couple other ships turn into a huge battle when other nearby factions decide to intervene to either help or harm me. Best part about the space battles is that it feels so real... ships aren't all on the same plane as if on an ocean/sea, they're everywhere at all angles. Another huge point in favor of the game is how amazing the graphics are without reducing performance (that I have noticed and have a pretty good gaming computer) though there is a lag whenever you move to another sector, but that barely effects me.The games doesn't restrict you to certain areas... you can go anywhere and everywhere they do limit you in other ways... depending on you reputation, different sectors will be hostile to you and some sectors have high level enemies in them. One major problem (in my opinion) is the repetative nature of the side missions and very few secondary missions (those give to you by factions depending on your reputation and level.)  Another problem is how long it takes to level up and to get to the higher level so as to be able to fly around in a dreadnought or carrier.Overall, I'd have to give this game 9/10.EDIT: Spelling Errors			",122,14,2,18,8,0,24

								The game is about to enter Beta.  As it stands, the game is not only playable, it's stable and fun!Everyone compares the game to Freelancer, which makes a lot of sense.  The input for flying is similiar with mouse and keyboard.  But I like the fact that you captain a capital ship instead of flying a starfighter.  Even smaller ships (like the Destroyer you start out with in the Alpha) have a sense of weight and inertia in their movements.It's a fun game, with a slower, more deliberate pacing than a starfighter game.  There's time to decide your own fate while being pounded on by your opponents.  You end up feeling like the captain of a tall ship at sea.  Which means they must have done something right.There's no campaign yet, but sandbox offers a complete game in and of itself.  It's a career mode, so there is persistent progression, kind of like a campaign might have.  There are tons of ships to buy, and plenty of missions to run.  Or you can run around getting into trouble, and you'll progress just as fast.So far, I haven't needed anything that isn't implemented yet.  In fact, the only things I've actually missed up till now are the jumpdrive (T-drive) and cloak.  Other than that, nothing feels like it's missing.It's well polished at this stage, which makes sense since it's one week from Beta.  The graphics and UI look slick.  Anything that's actually implemented at this stage is almost always bug-free.  The game is very stable, too.  I don't think it's crashed once on me.This is March of 2014, and as it stands the game provides a satisfying experience to play repeatedly.  It is on sale till the 17th, but will have a price hike immediately afterwards as it goes into Beta.  Also, buying it before Beta will give you 1 free copy of the original game.  A fun tide-me-over till this game is complete.			",198,69,15,19,40,4,61

								In short I enjoy the game even though it's  in pre-release, it's simply fun to play. It's the game I go to when I'm in between some the more well known or mainstream games. The dev's work hard on the game and it's come a long way since it's beginings. Which makes it a joy  to see all of the new fixes and changes to the game every time I come back to it. There are plenty of well stated reviews  both positive and negative so I won't say much, however as for me was the game and is the game worth the price? If it's worth my time to play it then it's worth money. This game is continuely getting better and improving all he time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game caught my eye a few months ago, but at the time it did not really seem like a good buy since everyone was anticipating that Xrebirth would be a super awesome game. Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.Yesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent. Then I read a few reviews, and found that this could totally be the one game that can fill the X's place.I was not disappointed!!! THIS is how X3 should be done. Everything is done right, even though many features are still missing, like the ability to create fleet, owning stations/player faction, more ways of modifying weapons (custom mods maybe). There is not really much content in the game right now, but the promise of it shines on the horizon like a new day's sun (especially story mode) and i can only hope, that the devs continue to be as awesome as they have been so far in communicating with players and using their feedback to make the game better.

												Possibly one of the best games I have ever played and it isn't even finished! People litterally write to the devs wanting to pay more just to get more content. The devs unlike most care more about their legacy then making money. This is the perfect freelancer 2 which sadly never happened. You can explore, trade, raid ships, and despite forcing your progression, you can't fly ships you level isn't high enough for. The game battles are balanced, and even when you are flying mega ships, you can quickly find your self getting swarmed by many many smaller vessles. There has to be a balance between devs and profits. Unlike Payday 2, this game NEEDS to sell updates to keep it going.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a lot of good stuff in it, but also some weak spots.Brief description of the game:You are commanding a capital class ship in either a sandbox experience or a campaign with main missions. You will be flying around undertaking side missions and smaller assignments, upgrading your ship size and firepower.First I will start with good things:+ Proper 3D movement, your ship rotates in all directions+ Huge map full of objects in space, except planets and spacestations space is full of ships of various factions and other space objects like solar power plants, gas collectors, prisons, etc. All of those obejcts come with few designs so the feeling is that most of them are unique. In addition there are clouds of radiotion of electric storms.+ In dept ship command. In addition to guns your ship also has tractor beam (you can pull enemy ships), teleport and marines (you can board enemy ships and pull them to nearest station to sell them), launch bays for fighters, slots for various consumable items (bombs, AI turrest, boosters, repair bots etc)+ Power management. You can direct power between 3 main areas of your ship - engines, weapons and shieldsm by default power if directed 1/3 to each, but you can channel it to one of them in order to receive +100% bonuss to speed, reload, recharge etc, at a cost of -% to others. (PRO TIP: always channel power to engines when you fast travel for +100% boost, since you cannot shoot in this state anyway)+ Large selection of ships and weapons as well as system upgrades to treak your ship as you like it, weapon types are really different (plasma are slow firing, slow flying, hight damage, hight power consumption; laser are 100% acurate, quick firing, low damage; projectile are quick firing, medium damage, fast flying) as for missles you can get some with huge area of effect or long distance small area of effect etc.+ Campaign is not so bad, but lack of options, alternative solutions etc makes it a less fun.Now to negatives:- Bad voice acting- Poor mission reward system - if you wanna by new ships and top weapons you better learn to board enemy ships, do it for few hours at start then start campaign fully equipped. (for example: low level assassination task will give you 4-10k credits, while if you board enemy craft, kill the crew and pull it to space station you will get 80-120k plus you will complete the mission), just doing missions for money is mindless grind and gets boring really fast.- Not involving space combat, this will require some longer explanation.Your ship has turrests, shields and missile weapons in 4 sectors (front, aft, port and starport). You can manually aim turrets, but odds of you hitting a tiny little black dot on black space around you are virtually none, the only thing you can hid manually are destroyed ship husks and space station with are not moving. So in order for your turrest to do anything you set them to auto-fire then they will randomly pick a target and shoot few bursts at it, then change target and go on. In the end during combat you can only select target and manually fire guided missles at it and rotate your ship so that more turrets and fresh shields are facing the enemy. After 10h of playing this is damn boring !!!- Not interesting PTE (power to engines, which is a form of quick flying), as to why it doesnt set power distribution to engines for 100% and has to be done manually for a nice speed boost is a wild guess. And you dont get this fancy visuals of super fast travel like we know from movies, it is just that, your ship flies faster.Conclusion:I recommend this game as it is quite fun to play for space exploration for 10-20h of fun, therefor I advice get it on discount because it is not worth 40€.Then I advice you to learn how to board enemy ships quickly so you can make some good credits and try out weapons and ships.

								[Review based on Early Access beta, v.0.7015]A fantastic action-oriented space sim (with some RPG-like elements added in), with beautiful visuals (and smooth framerates), a fairly big universe to explore (with hints from the developer that it's going to get bigger), lots of ships to fly and loads of weapons, equipment and upgrades to fit to them to tune them for any task.Currently only ""free play"" is available, but there's still lots to see and plenty to do. The game is already very fun and entertaining, and shows great promise. I look forward to the full release, and recommend this game for any fan of the space sim genre.			",310,56,8,30,61,1,73

								This is going to be short and sweet.I like this game. Its a single player 'EVE' without the ridiculous complexity. Obviously its not without issues, personally i have to keep all of the settings low to get a decent frame rate but that might just be my machine and im sure it wont be a problem once optimisation is introduced.My only major gripe is the lack of fuller content. So far the freelance missions are pretty much the same few objectives in varying difficulty but they are quick enough that its not too much of a trouble to level. I think once the proper campaign is introduced it will make the game a lot more enjoyable.			",40,4,0,5,4,0,4

								If you enjoy open world exploring and the freedom to do anything you want then this is the game for you. I got this game and to have seen it evolve from something basic into a more complex game with amazing graphics and some spectacular battles the potential is endless. There are a number of good things about this game such as the ability to choose what you want to do from being a pirates to trader, or if you like just fly around and find random things to do. you can even captur enemy ships even bigger ones if you chose to do the upgrades for your troops, you can then either sell these ships off for at times big money or keep them for yourself and use them. The graphics in this game are amazing for a space simulator with astroids thatt look like astroids to ships that look really good. the major con for me at this point is that there isn't any real story yet so no actual campaign to do but the story that they have set up really does have the potential to be great.

								This is striking me very much as what X:Rebirth was supposed/hyped to be. The game is rendered in a beautiful 3d environment and, while fiddly to get used to (it's a little more clunky than the X series of games), once you're used to it, you won't encounter much in the way of problem. Right now, there's not a whole lot to do other than explore the universe but then, what did you expect? It's a pre-release game!I decided to support LGM because, quite honestly, I didn't with SPG 1 and, in hindsight, I wish I had because it's a company that hasn't forgotten the golden rule in the gaming industry;                                                      ""Listen to what your fans want, then make it for them.""So many authors make the game THEY want and then wonder why the game bombs. In my own experience, Mass Effect 3 was that game but I'm sure most of the readers have at least one recent title they can apply that to. LGM listens, they adapt and incorporate into the game and they're not shy about it, either.So, if you're after a non-mmo space simulator (Elite springs to mind), this is definately for you. Hell, for less than £20, you're not going to do much better at the moment. Get it while it's hot because it promises to be an amazing experience. Graphically and audiably it's breath taking by anyones standards..Now, where did I put those secret pictures of Dr. Ridley.......			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								even for its beta state, game is very promising. i expect it to become a new modern X3 for space sim/shooter/rts fans.game gets updated very frequently, i only think that s because due to positive outcome product of sale amount. i mean steam playerbase support should be good enough to make the devs work hard like this.i want to point some unique points about this game.-enhancement system for ship parts, not only you can change your offensive,defensive,special outputs but you can also further tweak the bonuses with part enhancement, offers you very high amount of combinations.- high amount of factions, each faction's missions gets randomly generated depending on your current faction standings.thats nice. that means your actions have consquences.-you can actively own a fleet, and make them support you in battles or transport/hauling/smuggling.-crew salaries really a good money sink, something to think about.-game supports modding. enuf said. ^^now a bit of negatives :- currently since game is beta, the main storyline is not out yet and freelance game mode(sandbox) offers  a bit repeatitive missions.- traveling might take some time, there s no time acceleration/deacceleration- using map, pauses your game. you cant watch your ship moves while on starchart. that makes creating waypoints make game stop and cost you time.- current number of pilot classes only 3 and each has 4 different active abilities, these 4 abilities each has 5 sub categories changing characteristics of active skills, this s a bit few, could have been more.-after accepting each mission, you have to find objective area/station etc manually via starchart. you gotta click each marker and see which one lets you create waypoint/jump etc.- accepted and offered quests have same color markers on starchart. again no visual clue for finding your active missions' waypoint.- there s a quest log but not really helpful , doesnt fully work atm. therefore if you serious about completing your missions, you gotta take and complete 1 by 1. unlike other rpgs you cannot hoard multiple missions and do it with a spree.not at the moment. Doesnt apply to people with super memory- you cannot purchase spacestations or other type of stationary npc controlled objects. not yet.TLDR, summary : the game runs smooth and not many bugs for its state, gameplay wise there re many things to add. lack of variety atm might be boring but combat is fun and makes up for it. im pretty sure as it develops, many new features gonna be added and this game has potential to beat X3 in future in open beta. only if devs keep the game updated just like now.

												This game looks beautiful, even on the lowest graphics settings. The music is wonderful and sound effects are great. Voice acting is... well, pretty terrible in all honesty, but I'm really impressed that a pretty small indie developer managed to get as much voice acting in this game in the first place! That tends to be an enormous expense in any game, and it's still better than the voice acting in Just Cause 2 or Strike Suit Zero.However, even with two years of steady work, the game still suffers of performance issues and frequent crashes. I can accept a lot of problems but I really hate having to restart the game so many times in one evening. Last I heard, the devs are still actively working on the game - I hope they'll find these last crash and lag sources and fix them someday soon, because until then I won't be able to play this thing more than maybe half a hour a day. If the crashes are finally fixed, I'll be more than happy to recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish there was a neutral button, or I could give a 10 star review. I would give this game a ""5"". In my continued quest to find a game of equal or greater quality to old WIndows game ""Freelancer"", I was hoping I had found it with this one. I was NOT sorely dissapointed, but it's kinda a rather bland game...It's like getting a coffee but no cream and sugar, or a turkey dinner with no mashed potatoes. The core concept is there....just they didn't cook it long enough.Mechanics are good, the idea is great, beautiful graphics and awesome full 3D flying, and I love the slip-stream ""Surfing"" idea, but I just can't get my attention to be held. For my limited playing, I felt the story dragged, I could not afford to be a trader and spent most of my time jacking pirate ships, looting them, dragging them back to a nearby base to sell. (FYI: Your crews DO NOT take over the ship and fly along with you as an escourt - At least from what I experienced during my limited gameplay. It took me about 3 lost ships before I realized you had to tractor the ship back to a station :P )I am hoping either these guys do a MASSIVE update on this game, or maybe they will get it right in the next game they are making. I'm certainly willing to give their next one a chance. However until then, my ""Freelancer"" parody search continues.			",38,7,0,6,14,0,13

								It is indeed a great game in the making, but the only think I would love to see that great games such as skyrim didn't do is have a multiplayer option. Goto friends or bring friends and have adventures with each other, a game as good as this is better with a friend! I get there is other games like this one like EVE, but I hate playing with people I don't know very well and backstabbers. A multiplayer option like borderlands 2 that lets your game be ether wide open or closed only for many or few of your closest friends to share the experience with. Thats all I will complain about this game, other than that it something to play. Takes a bit to learn but it's worth it!!			",154,11,1,13,6,0,13

								Absolutely fantastic game. There was a big gap in my life when I had finally become bored of Freelancer (possibly completing it as many times as I did was a factor in that) which SG2 has fitted into very comfortably. I'm already hooked on it, although I have only logged just under 2 hours on it. I would recommend this game to anyone who feel comfortable in this type of game.			",197,16,9,34,9,1,45

								 I will say that I played enough to feel the game is immersive. The music is beautiful. The ships are wide ranging and fit each race. It's very stable for an alpha build. I'm sure crashes happen but I have not had a crash to desktop in a long time.  I mostly like exploring and seeing what the game offers and it's fun, landing on planets or fighting hostiles. The artwork for Starpoint Gemini 2 is very good. They have an intro video for the game story that will be added later. Really glad to have bought this game, it's worth the money. Space games have always been on my top 5 when buying. Started out on Wing Commander 3 and never looked back. If you like/love space sims please consider Starpoint Gemini 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The developers for SG2 really set the bar into the stratosphere for early access. There are more renowned titles that aren't this polished at release. While they've been busy building this game, we, the players have been exploring the vast systems of SG2 in it's already space worthy assortment of vessels.The graphics are silky and the models imaginative. The game play is smooth and intuituve. And being fully supported by the Steam Workshop allows the players uninhibited creativity. Many have paid twice as much for a ""finished"" product that promised the galaxy but couldn't deliver the moon. SG2 delivers the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos for half the price.The responsive developer team never let's too much time pass before they're reassuring the community that they're forging ahead to a quality release. Lord Have Mercy! When they add the remaining content and features, this game, if not overlooked should be considered top in it's class for 2014.			",88,2,0,14,2,1,8

								Best spaceship trade/pirate/upgrade/capture ships/have fleets type game I have played in QUITE a long while and doesn't require a lot of learning to play unlike something along the lines of X series games. The graphics look very good and the game play is very satisfying and addictive. You can do everything you'd want to do in this type of game (trade, be a pirate, do missions, mine, capture and board ships, etc). Even in this state, there is a LOT of gameplay here. Highly Highly recommended.			",218,37,3,50,33,1,50

It's just relaxing - flying in your Titan, warping out in hostile a zone and watching as everything around your ship turns into space dust. 9/10 Because destroying asteroids by colliding with them is called creative mining.

												Tried it again after a few months and boy has it changed! Now a fully working Main campaign is in place, the money system makes much better sense, the fleet system is fully operational and many, many other positive changes.I have really enjoyed playing the first few campaign missions, taking some time to earn some experience hunting pirates, patrolling areas or ferrying people around. It is overall a good experience and it has a lot to keep you on your toes, enemies to attack of run from, and interesting mechanics. Specially there are many possibilities to travel around the map, which is big and ould take ""forever"" to get from one corner of the Gemini Sector to another....you have T-Gates, wormholes, ""Space currents"" (which you actually surf, damned fun!), and even your own (expensive) T-Drive to hop around.Thumbs up and best thing is this is not finished yet! They keep adding and polishing things!			",78,23,1,19,10,1,15

												Probably the best next gen space sim availible. I have been looking for a while for a good space sim, and I love this. Esspeacially with the availibilty of Steam Workshop, really makes it have a lot of potential and feeds my space needs. X series is horrible. EVE only will pay itself off in time played during tutorials alone. The fact of the Steam Workshop sells this game itself. Just takes time, time people don't want to put in becuase they are not immersed enough. Trading starts slow and hard.. Realistically... Takes time to make 40,000,000.. relistically.. Killing off the bounty board and Salvaging derelects with swarms pays out great.. Doing trade and side missions in between. Save often. It just crashed on me. :( I only get one frame hangs durning New Sectors, or loading side missions.. I havn't gone under a steady 45fps with maxed out graphics and custom textures.I modded all the textures and the music. Added ships and changed voices. I'm immersed and won't stop till I got a fleet with some mercs and launch fighters out of my carrier, unleashing hell.			",84,5,5,6,6,0,15

												When I picked up the first Starpoint Gemini years ago I wasn't impressed. Ugly visuals, awful voice work, uninspired gameplay, I just couldn't stick with it. Imagine my surprise when it got a sequel. A really, really good one.I've been playing since Early Access and, though a little messy at first even then it had put right all the wrongs of it's predecessor and was blowing away the other Early Access space-sim I had my eye on at the time (yeah I'm looking at you Kinetic Void!)What we have here is:Graphics on par with the X3 series. Actually abit better - there is some fantastic lighting happening here, stormy nebulae to make FSopen jealous. My god it's full of stars! The ship models are wonderfully textured  down to turret details and the little holographic projector on the Ageba frigate.  I was particularly impressed  that you can name your ships and see the name decaled across the hull, little things like that are awesome. Also the tactical overlay was a really nice touch!Full 3D plane movement (and and handy key to reset planar orientation)A much improved interface with hotkeys for all the important stuff and nice RPG-style perk system for your captain. The skills need a little balancing but the devs seem to be on the path.Reliable camera control - stick it in Turret mode and make judisicous use of the Space and K keys and it feels just like EVE Online!A well fleshed-out free-roam setting with enough side-missions, customisation, exploration and combat to keep fans of Freelancer and Edge of Chaos happy.And a much improved campaign with some okay-but not-great voice acting and dialogue that I'm more than happy to overlook because......The combat is fantastic. The UI is a little clunky but when you find the right set up it's truly a joy to play. Wether weaving a speedy corvette through a torpedo run on a convoy of freighters, weapons blazing like a battlescene from DS9 or cruising a small flotilla through a gas cloud to scan a subspace anomoly, this as close you'll get to EVE Online offline. It plays somewhere between EVE and Freelancer  with more than a bit of old Star Fleet Academy.Active devs and built-in mod support. The devs have been really active and communicative all through Early Access and look committed to tweaking and balancing Starpoint Gemini 2. The whole game feels like a true labour of love for them. Steam Workshop already has some mods available and a a Mass Effect ship mod is in the works, as well as Star Trek ships and some small UI and balance tweaks from the community. Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space cadet's dream, in a time when genre is still only tentativly coming back from the grave. It's focus on capital-size craft instead of the more common starfigther cockpit is most welcome and fills oft an over-looked niche in the genre. I would've like to see a subsysem targeting mechanic more in line with Nexus: The Jupiter Incident where I can tactically pick apart my target but that's really small potatoes and the damage model here works just fine with critical hits offlining ship systems.In the end as a sequel SPG2 far surpasses, and on it's own it's a triumph, capturing everything you love about epic space operas in a wonderfully realised package. Trade, fight, mine, command and enjoy!Highlights:Engaging in a battleship dual in the middle of a lightning wracked nebula, desperatley jockeying for fireing arcs as our ships burn. KHAAAAN!!!!!Joining the defense of a besieged battlestation leading a rag-tag squadron of gunned-freighters to back up small armada of warships as beam weapons cut the night.The first time you're pirate away-team boards and captures a faction frigate and you tow it back to the shipyard as prize. Take what you can, give nothing back.Drifting gently through the corona of a blue giant as a gentle acoustic guitar track plays you ponder the best place to peddle small arms and battle mechs and what the odds are you'll get spotted sneaking planet side.

												Has some warts, I won't deny it.  This coming from a WC2/Privateer/Freespace player, I like this game overall but there are some negatives that might steer people away from it.  The voice acting IS pretty meh, and the UI/menu interface leaves something to be desired (buying/selling goods isnt exactly clear at first glance); the complaint about expensive T-gates I get, though I went out and sought the license for this immediately (making it available nearby to the starting area honestly makes more sense rather than halfway across the galaxy).Still, the game is fun and interesting, exploring the different regions of space was especially enjoyable if a bit hazardous if I wandered too far into hostile territory.  If one can see past the negatives the game is extremely fun.			",486,99,6,82,40,1,69

								It takes a bit to get into the controlling your ship, but once you realize you’re not flying a fighter but a large ship it gets easier. Zig-zagging around to evade hostile fire, turning around to get your full weapon batteries within firing range and arc, transferring power between systems, sending out troopers to other ships, capturing them, mining asteroids, salvaging stuff from derelicts… it’s all in here.An awesome buy! I definitely RECOMMEND it to everyone who’s into space games. And with the first game offered in the bundle AND at a discount, this is a steal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just love how this game looks and feels. There's a huge map which always has things to do wether you're playing on campaign or freeroam, throughout which there are friends and enemies to trade and fight with. You can mine asteroids for diamonds, you can hijack enemy ships and either sell it or keep it in your garage! You can also upgrade your ship with various weapons and boosters you can even hire ships to follow and defend you.The devs are still updating and ironing out any issues which is nice to hear, but i haven't had a problem with it yet.I'm gunna smash this game once i'm done with divinity.8/10 ",285,47,5,24,31,5,42

												Very good space game, I'm so pleased this genre is making a comeback!I've not played a huge amount yet, but enough to get the feel for it and I'm really enjoying it so far.In this game you are flyng a large ship with a crew, not a one-man fighter, so it feels more like Freelancer, ST Bridge Commander, or Independence War, but it has it's own feel. The ship handling reflects this and the control scheme works really well. I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.Technically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting. There is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional productMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.Overall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.

												If you like open world games, and you like open world games in space, then Starpoint Gemini is absolutely worth picking up.There's some reviews out there that are comparing this to Freelancer, and I'll say so far I definitely get that same vibe. Is it ""as good"" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.Other reviews say this is Eve ""Offline"" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too ""new"" for lack of a better term.I started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.As far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.It would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.The map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!Combat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a ""turret mode"" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!Speaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.Trading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can ""sneak"" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.Overall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.

												Amusing and pretty game.  I had fun.  Once I got the hang of capturing ships, the difficulty level dropped.  To be fair, I haven't tried tackling any of the veteran bounties, yet.  I understand that those are considerably more difficult since they will actually put up a fight and deploy counter-measures.The reputation system in this game is very simple: you gain +20 reputation for completing tasks for law-abiding factions and -20 reputation for completing missions for pirate factions.  I would expect reputation gain to drop more significantly and gain more slowly as it does in many other space sim games (e.g. Eve, X3, ...).  As it is, if you're low on cash, simply cap a ship and you'll be back in black.Pro:- Pretty- Lots of ships- Large mapCon:- Not a whole lot of variety or depth.- Different ships don't seem different enough (i.e. play style remains largely the same)- Voice acting is terrible; would have been better without.- Overly simplistic reputation system (see above).

												I was looking for a space game and found a great one.  You can free roam or follow the story.  Like most RPGs, there are optional side quests and missions.  I like the fact that there are easy missions and missions so hard, that you can easily die without a strategy, even if your in the mighty TITAN class ships (love mine btw)!  This is a space RPG, if you are looking for a casual space game, you can just fly around, but you will miss out on so much fun.I had an extremely slow start figuring out how to play the game and how to use the controls.  Oddly enough, I only use 3 keys outside of the directional keys.  I had to google how to board ships, how to use my side weapons, ship stats, etc.  That is stuff that I've had to do with other RPGs too.  Does the game have some issues...yes.  There is so much to do in this game, and the only quirk I noticed is the patrol missions don't work.  So, I just skip them, there are plenty others to do.  Almost every issue people have in this game, you can find in others that were herald great games!!! I purchased this game for $8 including both DLC (winter 80% sale).  As much fun as I had and still have, I would have paid more.  I will be purchasing the next Starpoint Gemini Game.			",7,0,2,1,2,2,1

								If you're looking for your EVE Online fix, this is the game for you.  Best of all, it's Single-Player (for now, at least.  Not sure if MP is going to be a thing or not).  No pirate players to come rain on your parade.  No constant worry of whether or not you'll be blown to smithereens when you come out of a gate.  Scan anomalies!  Mine asteroids!  Hunt down the bad guys!  You can do it all.  Had there been a demo for this game for me to try out beforehand, I would have easily paid double its asking price for it.  It's most definitely worth it and more.			",52,12,3,14,9,0,10

												Liking it so far. Some learning curve, but plenty of guides. Feels good to be able to fly around, in sandbox, and just do anything. Great mix of Freelancer and Privateer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You want to adventure trough SPACE!You want to become a famous merchant or a pirat !Maybe join a guild or become a privateer !Frelance and explore the mysteries of the Universe !Become a scientist or mine asterods and other space junk for goods !Build a small army or an armada and wage war torugh he galaxy !Do you wnat that.IF YES, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!With soo much features and more coming by the end of Early Acces one can only imagine what this game is capable of.In addition to that the development team is one of the most fan-dedicated out of all the other's.There's only one thing missing form this game and that is multy player but I'm a solo player so I won't hold it against it, or you could play EVE ONLINE and pay the monthly fee. :)Overall the game looks and feels gorgeous. The music is ambiental and realy sets you in the mood for the game.Combat is a bit slow but it's to be expected... and that's coming form a long Ace Combat fan, still trying to find the perfect interceptor/fighter for my play style but I'll find one sooner or later... nevr give out hope.

Product received for free
Short Version: Grand Space Sim that puts you in command of a space ship to fly, shoot, trade, save the universe, blow up stuff, do the laundry, collect files hidden in floating junk, level up, hire recruits, upgrade your ship, and do pretty much anything else your starfaring heart desires.  The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.Starpoint Gemini 2 reminds me of a giant, sword-wielding turtle.  No, really! Just let me explain...Waaaay-back-when, in those wonderful 8-32 bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video games, you could play as one of four characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses: Raphael, who had tiny, short-range, but superfast attacks; Donatello who was really slow but could whack-a-ninja from half a screen away with his staff; Michelangelo who specialized in... I don't know, making pizza with nunchucks? Or something?  And then there was Leonardo, who didn't attack quite as fast as Raphael, and didn't have quite the reach of Donatello, and didn't (pizza?) quite as well as Michelangelo - but hey, he was a very close second-best at *everything* and pretty dang awesome as a result.Sooo... if space games were mutant turtles, then Starpoint Gemini would definitely be Leonardo.  Sure, some dedicated RPGs have better character development in stats and story (and DEFINITELY voice-acting), and some starfighters have more intuitive controls without the need for a gazillion tuturial screens and HUD informational windows, and some trading/exploration games have a more lifelike economy that can fully support your character as a pacifist (read: cowardly) trader... but Starpoint 2 offers ALL those types of gameplay and more, and all done extremely well - just not quite on par with the best. This enormous range of solid, enjoyable space-sim content is the essence of Starpoint Gemini 2.All-in-all, SG2 is a huge Space-Based-RPG/Combat/Trading/Strategy/ShipBuilding/Sandbox-Simulator mashup that may be slightly flawed and a bit slow-moving compared to games that 'specialize', however the astonishingly vast scope of gameplay content is all well-done, nicely polished, and most importantly... fun!   With a large campaign and moddable freeplay mode spanning half a dozen genres, Starship Gemini 2 is second-to-none in being second-to-all - but hey, so was Leonardo, and he became the leader of the Ninja Turtles for a reason!(*SIDENOTE:  Despite evidence to the contrary in this review, Raphael was actually the best turtle.  Of course, comparing Starpoint Gemini 2 to a giant mutant *sai*-wielding turtle would have been utterly nonsensical, so I went with Leonardo.) Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												Hi GuysUpdated 15th december.After spending sometime into this game heres my review.Pros1) Great graphics and good music.2) Freedom to roam and also a campaign to play. 3) Tons of ships, items to equip your ship.you can hire troopers to board and take over ships! Hire officers and also mercenaries.4)You have missions available at different places where you can accept or reject to earn money and experiences.5) Mods availble for this game.6) You have traits and specials skills as you level.Cons1) Tutorials wordings are too small!!!2) I find it not very user friendly even though the tutorials are there for you. It seems that I struggle for quite some time to get used to it and also the mission chart map seems nto well constructed. To me its not user friendly.3)Something is missing in this game I am not too sure.I will still recommend this game because of the things you can do in the game. Its the freedom to roam. This game is a hit and miss , If you are not sure I will suggest you get it on Sale or bundle. Its much more worth it.			",20,5,0,31,12,0,17

												Graphics are good, action is nice, the gameplay smooth and mostly bug free.  In many ways this game does things exactly right.  So why the thumbs down?Because it does one thing wrong and that one thing is enough to drag the rest down with it: It tries to use MMO logic in a single player game.  Which is to say that the grind is the whole of the content.  Do this mission to get credits to get a bigger ship with bigger guns so that you can do a mission with a bigger enemy to get more credits to get an even bigger ship etc etc ad hoc infinitum.  Once you hit max level and get the best ship there really isn't anything left to do except mindlessly blow things up at random.  It gets old really, really quick.Yes there is a story option but the missions in that story are hardly any different than the randomly generated ones from freeroam.  They just add voiceovers to some rather poorly written dialog.Still, the price is cheap and they game is entirely without it's virtues.  It just doesn't have anything to really hold a person's attention for very long.			",62,5,1,22,28,0,26

Great Space Opera game with amazing graphics-> Smuggling, fighting, mining, trading, bounty hunting, capturing ship, escorting convoy or attacking space base. -> Nice ship design.-> When you gain lots of credit, you can build a full fleet.-> You can create your own challenge = Being a pirate for exemple and try to be friend with the evil faction is an interesting challenge and a different gameplayThis is not a a space flying simulation as the game is optimized for mouse and keyboard, giving the game a nice tactical touch. It take a bit of time to get used of all the control but once you get them, you can get into amazing space battle : Surviving the  assault of an ennemy fleet on an allied Space station is just so rewarding.Cons :. Voice acting is not great but after sometime you get use to it.. A bit repetitif after a while/lots of grinding needed to buy better ship. . The auto aim make the game to easy in the end while you get a op battle ship.Anyway got lots of hours of fun with it.PS : Something extra to make the planet more lively would be great imo			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6 out of 10 Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space exploration and combat game.  In short, I expected somewhat more.   In the end I just could not finish it as it just dragged on and on. The good: 1. Great platform.  Space, ships, weapons etc. 2. Capturing enemy vessels. The bad: 3. I always seemed to die at the most inopportune times.  Then need to reload and re-traverse the same bits over and over. 4. Storyline is not very exciting.  No animation or something else to give it some life. The ugly: 5. Very repetitive.  The game needed more unique locations and content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I know I only have a few hours in on this game, but I already love it.  It reminds me of the old game Freelancer in all the good ways, with a smattering of Darkstar One thrown in for good measure.  It also has many features all its own, but if you liked either of those games, I think you will like this one.  I already know that I will be coming back to play this game for long into the future.

												Gods, Starpoint Gemini 2 Where have you been. If you put a 4 x space mmo, remove the shoddy ai and shoddy players. And add ai that thinks, grows, and attacks! Plus there is good ship quality and animations! It can be slow at times, but this game is almost relaxing in pace. There is a lot to do, and a lot of fun. Highly Recommended			",115,28,0,52,15,2,33

								Very fun space sim, very much in the ""Freelancer"" vein.  You get a ship, fly from port to port, buy and sell commodities, mine asteroids or take on freelance missions for fun and profit.  Your ship is upgradeable with an assortment of weapons and buffs available at any port with a drydock; there seems to be a pretty decent variety in the different planetary sytems.  Hiring officers (up to 3, at least on my frigate class) will give you additional buffs; each officer has different strengths, and no two are exacly alike in my gameplay so far. You can add to your fleet by capturing enemy ships after boarding them with your troopers, or do it the old fashioned way, and save up your credits.   Kind of reminds me of ""Eve:Online"", without all the annoying other people! ;)			",20,14,0,12,3,0,5

												If, in your gaming memory you remember the classics like ""Freespace"" and ""Privateer"", and loved them, this is the game for you.  The interface is slick, operative and easy to use an understand.  There is a campaign, but my limited time with it just made me hungry for the freeroam mode, as I wanted to be a smuggler or pirate.  What's more the team at LGM is going to keep improving this title in the coming months, and it is likely to become not only a stopgap for ELITE: Dangerous and StarCitizen, but a competitor; and a great one.  I can't recommend this game enough.  You are really in for a treat if you take the time to take the tutorials and just be ready to forge your destiny.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Don't let the boring tutorial text scare you off if you're new to the genre. It's not as complex of a game as they would have you think. In fact, it's quite easy to learn once you know the basics. I'm new to the genre myself and read comments saying this game is too simple and dumbed down. So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.Lots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.The negative:Earning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).Sandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).If I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.Cool game!

												To me it's like an arcade X3. Lot earier to get action and jump right into the game, but the trade means nothing in this game and your ""fleet"" is your one ship (and you only can have 1) and a merc you hire. Still fun for a time killer, but I prefer actually doing something that means something to the game like X3 does every second your in.So while there are freighters capable to carrying a good chunk of cargo and yea you do trade, it means nothing. The prices are random so you're selling high and buying low but it doesn't mean anything to the universe around you like X3's chained trade.			",109,18,0,33,44,1,18

												Since my life is so busy I cant play games much, I come from the angle of a almost n00b to the space sim, free open world games. I always wanted to see space but since our kind is more content sitting on this planet beating each other with sticks I suspect I wont achieve this dream.... So I bought most of the X series and I loved the idea but got so frustrated with the controlls and other nuancses that I probably spent about 4 hours in the last one I bought which was X3. I spent some time on X2 but due to lack of time I just never got into it.If only there was decent space sim that is not so complex I need to study a 1000 page manual to get into it and this certainly proved to be the one I was looking for. Easy to get in but I suspect fiendishly hard to master.Considering this is a brand new games studio I must give them a big 4 little thumbs up(I only have 4 thumbs). The interface is simple and clean. Objectives are forward and to the point. Graphics are great and I spend my time on the mindless train trip between Gordon and Blacktown with my laptop keeping me nice and warm as I just muddle around in the universe.It is a bit grindy at the start as you try and figure how to get to bigger things but overall a very enjoyable experience if you want something really deep but not obscure.Great effort and I am looking forward to what LGM studios brings out next.

												27-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :First thing first, this is not arcade space sim combat like Elite Dangerous, this is RPG game with space sim combat. You start with a small ship and you can play it like arcade space sim combat since the RPG elements seems irrelevant at the beginning. But as your rank get higher and you get access to bigger ships, you find yourself constantly outnumbered and outgunned. Tactical combat and RPG elements (properly developed character and ship) becomes essential to win a combat.The game is open world. To be powerful enough to progress through the main quest, you can do faction side quests, freelance quests, mining. trading, bounty hunting, pirating and capturing ships. The graphics and soundtrack is great, the story is mediocre with really bad voice acting. This game is not a high budget A-List game, so there's no fancy 3D cutscenes with motion tracking and real voice actors.  The game also really mod-friendly. You can edit stats and even your savegames using a simple text editor. This mod-friendly approach is more handy that it seems. For example, my favorite Carrier-class ship doesn't come with a cloaking device. Easy, edit the ship stats file using Notepad and add the cloaking device myself. There's also Mod Tools to build your own contents. If you're a Trekkie, make sure you try the Star Trek Ship Mods in the Steam Workshop.The developer also generous enough to give a free DLC titled ""Origins"". This free DLC offers 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned and ported to SPG2 engine. So if you never play the 1st one, you can play it now without extra cost. Basically you get 2 games for the price of one.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only 4 hours into this game and it is wonderfully stable thus far. If you feel a bit burnt by another recently released space game, give Starpoint Gemini 2 a try - I really think you'll like it. If you are a Star Wars fighter jock you'll have to get used to flying a heavier ship. The UI is both intuitive and beautiful. This feels like a sort of dystopian 29th century Star Trek.Edit: Now 15 hours in and this game just keeps getting better all the time. I took down a ""hero"" a.k.a. a large ship with a threat level of ""Impossible."" The fight took 20 minutes and alternating between targeting the enemy's heavy batteries and subsystems. This ship jumped me and was not part of a mission.  My little ship a small Pegasus class gunship wore this bad boy down and the reward was 4 million credits! I decided to step up to a Corsair class rather than an even more powerful Frigate. This is really a game to be savored and frankly, I am so happy with Starpoint Gemini 2 that I really couldn't care less for Elite: Dangerous especially with today's (18 Novemeber) announcement that Elite: Dangerous will require constant online even in single player.You can play this game as you see fit and don't be fooled into thinking that the explorable area is small because there isn't a whole galaxy to explore. I've only seem a tiny part of this game. Somewhere in the Community Hub of this game someone had posted a complete map of the game and suffice to say it is M A S S I V E.Limit Theory is now the only other space game that I think will force me to divide my time if it turns out to be as good as it looks. CNo Man's Sky is still a long way off and Star Citizen is so bloated that I believe it can't possibly live up to the hype nor the budget which I think equals  the budget for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Simply put, Starpoint Gemini recaptures the magic of the great space games of the past like Indepence War I and II, the Freespace series, and the legendary Tie Fighter and X-Wing and all from a small studio. If you love space games,  get this. Ignore it at your peril.Great job devs! Keep up the great work.			",505,76,17,130,65,3,135

												I received a press key during the early stages and have had the pleasure of watching the game take shape into what it is today.  The tutorials could still use a bit more work, though the game is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  It's a bit like Freelancer and other like-games in that you can explore different sections of the galaxy, do missions, mine for resource, buy/trade commodities, and so on.  The middle mouse radial menu, coupled with the starchart, makes interacting  with objects a cakewalk.  I still find combat to be a little tough because I have trouble figuring out and observing the available weapon arcs, though you can set the ship on ""fire at will"" and fly around while the computer does all the shooting.  All in all, worth the asking price.

												The combat is painful.  And tedious.  And just plain painful.Even on a high end machine, it seems like everything lags behind about a quarter second, which means you miss everything and anything.I'm an MMO guy, and even I can't handle the grind necessary to make anything worthwhile in this game.I genuinely regret Steam not having its refund policy in place in time to get my money back here.

												A decent capital ship combat game, but somewhat shallow.Pros:+ A wide variety of ships and equipment+ Combat is a little simplistic but fun nonetheless. Reminds of Rebel Galaxy but offers more control.+ Capturing enemy ships feels satisfying+ Looks good enough. I somehow love the battle hud(blue ring thingie around your ship, appears on some of the screenshots) and miss it in other similar games.Cons:- Probably the worst voice acting in game history. Some voices are really irritiating, especially protagonist's.- Even though all ships are capital ships, you don't feel their scale. For example if you play X3/X:Rebirth, you do feel that your massive capital ship is a massive capital ship. Here all ships are basically the same size and you don't have anything to compare them to.- RPG elements are pretty lame- Story progression is sometimes very confusing. Like you won't have enough crew on your starter ship to capture any other ship (and start earning significant amount of money) or you'll simetimes find that you need 10 more levels to actually pilot a ship you've just earned. Or later in the game I kept getting way more levels than I actually needed.- Limited ship customization options. You can arbitrarily choose any weapons for your ship which's good, but its subsystems are predefined for any given hull and you can just upgrade them slightly via enhancements.- Even though I did rush the game in the end, I have completed it(without DLC stuff) in 32 hours on the hardest difficulty which's a little underwhelming for this kind of games.Grab this game if:You want a little arcadish broadside-style capital ship combat driven by a campaign scenario. Avoid this game if:If you're looking for a very in-depth experience similar to X3/EVE or physically plausible ship controlling similar to Elite. This game has a strong indie feeling to it, don't expect anything of AAA-like scale.My overall rating is 7/10, I did enjoy this game and I'm really looking forward to its successor Starpoing Gemini : Warlords.

												Althought the campaign game was uninteresting, I put 22 hours into the free roam, cruising around to different planets and engaging in space combat. The singleplayer campaign leaves a lot to desired, as the RPG elements are limited, and it is essentially a ""fly here-destroy"" ""fly there"" destory game. I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.Overall, this does not feel complex and finished enough to reccommend for a full price, but I would recommend buying for  a bargain.

												KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK HERE GUYS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THAT I HAVE LOST MOST OF MY ATTENTION WITH SWTOR THIS IS A VERY RICH DEEP GAME HERE The flow is nice & you are not that timed on missions or at least not at the point where I am in the game. I have much experience with games of this nature. However, this right here is just nice. The music, the planets, the gear and ships. You definitely got my attention. I'll be honest that I bought the game & never opened it that much because another game here that will go unmentioned really destroyed it for me with games of this format. I recommend this to all who have been disappointed with sandbox/open-world games lately. You will not be disappointed because looks like they actually listened to the players. Hint: if you like the X3 Trilogy with a little of EVE ONLINE then go with this ONE HERE FOLKS. It's no pay to win or confusing irrevelant aspects such as if you run into a friendly target you get penalized in rank. RIGHT ON! FINALLY! Someone actually thinking!			",9,0,0,0,3,0,7

												It's a very *loose* yes as a recommendation to play this game. If you can get it on a good sale, then it can be a fairly fun experience running around a small system of planets, doing odd jobs, buying new ships, and upgrading weapons. There's some decent stories involved and the devs have made some nice DLC's available for pretty cheap/free.Downside: this game is buggy as hell when it comes to the control scheme, especially if you want to use a controller with the game. I happen to like using a controller; I feel like it's very relaxing and I can kick back in a chair. Using an Xbox One controller with this game, (or any controller) is going to lead to a hell of a lot of mapping issues that don't get resolved easily. Also, loading up the DLC's can be kind of weird, since you're selectively activating them. Unlike games like Skyrim, where you can just roll up and jump into a DLC once you add it to your game with whatever save file you're using, this game like to cordon off the DLC's and have you jump sandbox to sandbox. They can be fun, but it's not always ideal. That all being said... there's a ton of ships in this game and ways to arm them out. Whatever your playstyle, you'll eventually captain a ship that meets your needs, whether that be overwhelming destructive force, a carrier that houses a fleet, or a ship that can drop out of stealth and put the hurt on. It can be pretty addictive. It can ALSO be extrememly repetitive. You mileage may vary!Final Verdict: yes, I'd recommend this game, but it really will appeal only to a specific type of gamer.

								Wow, I was not expecting this. This is a quality single player ship RPG. Much like EVE Online, but less boring and, well, MMO-ish. There are some things that could use some polish and the UI could use a little love, but nothing that's gamebreaking and certainly nothing that makes the game overly difficult. I never played the first one, but this is a series I will forever be excited about now.			",112,33,0,42,32,1,61

												Bad  default controls somthing that makes or breaks a game like this, a  UI that dosn't behave and is tiny and unreadable @ high res's.And 30fps lock with V-sync enabled, so must force it off if you want to play at all in a non stutter 60fps+++ rate, enjoy the screen tearing.Just Can't Get into this game with the bad targeting and ship controls that don't make sense its like the developer never played another space sim.  I've tried, but the default control mappings are bizzare, they don't align with any other sim of this type, combine that with the UI that is nearly unreadble, and trying to figure out what does what is a pain. You would have to remap every control in this game to make it playable, and then you would still need to figure out what the near unreadble UI is trying to tell you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great if you want a single player RPG and to run around in space.  The free roam is cool but gets old, and the story gives you purpose but it is limited.  This GAME WOULD BE EPIC if it had multiplayer support.  If you could build a fleet with real humans and maybe go raid someone that might be able to apply a little bit of strategy.  The biggest drawback is that it is linear, you want to beat someone get some better guns... or a bigger ship, thats it.  Buy a long range weapon and you can literally just tease the AI until they are dead waiting out of there auto combat range, attacking them and backing off when they chase so they start all over.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 makes for a pretty enjoyable space sim experience, but it is very lacking in depth.  It tries so hard to give you the complexity one desires in a space sim with features like capturing ships using marines, scanning anomalies, and coming across derelicts just waiting to be scavenged, but in the end, these activities are very superficial.  They eventually become very routine and the rewards are often limited to money or experience.  Levelling up your character doesn't grant much satisfaction, except for when a perk point is given.Not much is required before you'll be rocking around Gemini in the biggest ship the game has to offer, decked out with the biggest guns, with all the best upgrades.  Luckily, this doesn't make you the ultimate end-all-be-all combat god of the universe.  Combat appears to be balanced in such a way that you will always be vulnerable and dealing with this turns out to require very different strategies depending on the size of your ship.Combat is one of the things this game does very well, and a challenge always awaits you as the game throws squadrons of enemies at you routinely, even the periodic Legendary or Hero ship, which offers an even greater challenge and huge money rewards for the latter.Otherwise, this game seems like a pretty casual space sim.  You will get plenty of enjoyment out of it, but you won't get invested in it like you'd like, which makes the sub-40 dollar price tag perfect for the experience it offers.			",115,17,1,25,12,0,10

												Some intial problems with the game almost made me eat my own scowling face with rage. For serious, it took four tries just to make it launch and once it did launch it took two restarts to make it launch without messing its big boy pants. Finally, I got into the game, started playing, and immidiately strangled myself with my own mouse cable. This will happen, don't panic. Just unwrap yourself or, if you have to, find an adult to help. At first the controls feel as stable as a drunken donkey with the skurvy, at least with a mouse. I flopped around for quite a while, but eventually not only was I flying circles around the bad guys, I was...no, I was just flying circle cause that's how I dodge enemy fire while keeping my guns trained on them. The point is the flopping became on purpose, cause stragedy; now the controls seem alright to me. The map is roughly six times bigger than something really, really big (a house, a small country, yo momma, etc.). It's big, like hugemongous. Think of something really big, and then know that this is much bigger. The game has two modes: Campaign and Freeroam, although a Campaign save can abandon the story to go chase space squirrels once you realize that space rodents are much more interesting. I played the Campaign for about an hour, then made a new character in Freeroam who is a morbidly obese, one-eyed robot smuggler with a ship so fast that no one has thus far been able to catch it and I regret absolutely nothing. Freeroam is why you buy this game. Freeroam will consume you. I have accepted that this game is my new family, and you must too. Don't fight it. Let Space Daddy carry you away in his big, strong hands. Shhhhhh..... 8/10			",13,1,0,4,4,0,5

												A qualified ""Buy.""This game is basically Freelancer. The variety is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is pretty solid.A few caveats: (2 Days after Release) - In it's current form, balance is an issue, some activities are far more profitable than others. - Enemies scale in difficulty based on your level, it's possible to earn too much experience and not enough money to prevent yourself from being anihillated by everything. - Some technical issues remain (Framerate is locked at 30FPS, Some graphics options are disabled. Crashes are rare but occur.)TLDR: If you loved freelancer, and want more of the same, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't expect anything revolutionary, however.			",181,27,2,21,49,0,40

												Bought this game not that long ago and i have had a blast. Simple yet hard and fun combat, the focus of the game is on large capital ships instead of fighters something i like very much, it makes you feel like a proper captain. Awesome ships designs and graphics. The game gives you tons of freedom to to what you want to do, you want to be a pirate go ahead, trader sure, miner or a bounty hunter have at it. The game has one of the best and most active dev team i have seen, they activly talk with their gamerbase and activly put in new features and ideas in the game. This game is going to evolve alot and they are planing many more awesome features. Its a very good game and a must buy for folk that like space games.Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 8/10Music 8/10Graphics 9/10Replayability 8/10Overall 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4/5I´ve been looking for a game that resembles one of my old favorites, Freelancer so when I found this I got very excited.Sat down, launched the campaign and boy did I smile once I had it all set up and flew through space on my way to my first mission. Gonna try to list some of the pros and cons belowPros+ Nice graphics+ Awesome soundtrack (seriously, I leave the game running when I go to bed)+ Lots of ships+ Select between campaign and Freeroam and choosing the first won´t stop you from doing the roaming freely.+ Many different factions+ Huge map+ Really nice controls once you get the hang of them+ Active devs, seen them post in the steam forums many times+ Many different ways to make money in-game+ Rare drop blueprints+ Achievements+ Many difficulties (only tried normal)Cons- The voice acting in the campaign lacks feeling- Sometimes it´s impossible to target things by clicking on them (think it might be a bug cause if you click on something else and then try again, it works). No real problem though since it´s uncommon and you can always use quickbinds for targeting stuff.- I´ve had a few crashes since I bought it but since the game is being actively patched (and I haven´t crashed for a few days) it might have already been fixed or I feel confident they'll fix it.- Might get a little repetitive after a whileHaving played it quite a lot the past weeks I'd say it's one of my best purchases in a long time and it deffinitly deserves a strong 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			",130,34,1,49,12,1,25

Early Access Review
								First off I'd like to say that I can't recommend this game or not, its still in its development without a storyline yet. It has a lot of potential but also a lot of stuff to work on. Much of what the others have said is absolutely right. The money/combat balance system is so wonky at the moment. There have been times I fought 2 'impossible' ships and knocked them out almost immediately, and then 3 'trivial' ships have taken me down a little while later. Using manual aiming is a massive handicap because you can only fire from a few turrets at a time and trying to lead a ship is next to impossible at many ranges. I have yet to come across another gun, light or heavy, that is stronger than the ones I started with.The skills and perks are lackluster at best, you start with all the skills and simply increase the efficiency slightly. Every five levels you get a perk, and again, that just adjusts your efficiency with one thing or another, 8% more money when trading, or 8% more damage with railguns, etc. Very uninspired stuff. And then the money, over the course of a week I got about a million, which isn't enough for any ship. Then when I get to a particular station I kill a bounty without even realizing the ship was one. After selling at the station, I get another bounty, and another. In the course of an hour I get 17 million and can pretty much afford whatever I want, except I can't fly much at the level I'm at.All in all it is a game on the cusp of having something really good going for it. There's a lot of potential here and I'll continue to play and explore because I do find it entertaining.			",59,4,0,8,3,0,15

												This game is a TRUE open world space RPG. I really love this game, despite is few shortcomings.Freedom: Full freedom to do whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want is why this game is great. You can become a full time miner and collect minerals, you can ferry goods from station to station and trade for money, you can capture enemy ships and DRAG them back to your base to sell. Combat: Perhaps the best part of this game is the combat system. It is really like a 3d dogfight in space ships. Do not expect a true space physics, but the combat system is one of the most fun I have played. You actually fly the ship yourself and shoot the weps yourself. Direct full energy to shields to survive, weps to destroy, or engines to run like hell!RPG: You gain levels as you go. You can kill ships for small XP or do missions for more XP. You can level up each of your 4 special skills, get bonuses to your ""profession"", and buy new ships at higher levels, each with their own special traits.Glitches: I have had about 10 full crashes in 24 hours of playtime. I have many out of memory errors when I still have lots in task manager, although the game still runs, for a while... In game glitches are more frequent but less noteworthy.			",133,8,11,22,11,0,14

												One of the most fun games I have ever played...Got a half decent ship by smuggling some weed between 2 planets, actually made a killing of that until the cops caught me and I lost reputation in the area which basically put me on the line between ""friendly"" and ""enemy""  so they almost killed me...I came back though...Upgraded my ship with a cloaking system..now the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can't see this weed smuggler..I skipped the campaign and I am just playing as a Trader Currently and it is quite a bit of fun..only had the game for a little while and its starting to become my go to chillaxing game...the mod support/Workshop support is amazing...hopefully more people catch on and develop some mods =)We have StarTrek and some OP ship mods but thats about it.Picked mine up for $10 on♥♥♥♥♥ I would say this game in its current state is worth $15 maximum....$10-5 when StarCitizen Releases.

												Alright. So...Downsides:1. There's a Commander class that benefits fleet and the best you can do for a ""fleet"" is hire 2 mercenaries later in the game.2. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. And it takes forever to get anywhere even with the PTE speed.3. First 4 campaign missions are travels (you kill like 2 ships) that take 5mins of travel time each if you don't get sidetracked. (Haven't gotten further yet)4. When mining, debris containing your precious loots flys everywhere faster than your ship moves, slowing the process.Upsides:1. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to open 10% of the map up. I've explored basically none of it, but now I know where the faction structures are for a little bit of a corner of a section of the map.2. Auto-aim from Open Fire actually leads the target instead of dicking around with straight shots based on current location. Awesome job.3. The ship types are easy enough to learn and yet there are enough of them to still have a good enough variety.4. Graphics are decent.5. You mine the same way you fight. By blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with your weapon systems.6. The ship you start with is more than enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥around and get work done for a while (so far all I had to replace was the weapon system).7. Enemies spawn/warp in often enough you don't have to explore to find cargo to sell. And they won't persue you fast enough that you can get away fairly quickly without much worry. 8. The radar/scanner/mini-map is easy to understand as long as you're not a brick.9. Middle Mouse Button is your friend.10. Controls take a minute to get used to during combat, but you'll pick it up pretty quick since you just have to worry about positioning/dodging instead of aiming your light weapons.11. There's still a challenge when you're fighting in big fights.10/10 worth my money and time so far. Haven't played far into the campaign but I'll see how that goes, also. Awesome first empression and I definitely suggest dicking around in freeroam instead of starting with the campaing to figure stuff out, then turning off tutorials in campaign for a smoother ride.

								30 mins in and its pretty good so far, reminds me of a old Star Trek game I used to play where you can control the ship tactically and space combat is not all arcade dog fighting-like. Though the world is still layed out like most star trading games, IE- standard trading of goods from A-B, scanning stuff, fighting pirates and griding. Prices for upgrades and ships seem rather steep for the rewards given for quests, hopefully they get that figured out because that seems to be a exessive amount of grinding. Combat, navigation, and controls are really intuitive (played the first one since it was free and its controls are aweful) skiped the pop-ups and just jumped in. One suggestion that would be nice is thet able to attack the ports in space, as of now you can target but nothing connects and you can fly right through them. You would probably lose but its no fun without the option.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								You can pilot anything from a gunship to a carrier (you can NOT pilot fighters, they are launched from carrier class vessels), do freelance missions like assassinations (destroying marked ships), assistance (Fight off attackers and protect a ship). However the ships you have to destroy are not necessarily your enemy, in fact they could be allies!The game might be in alpha (going in to beta very soon), and there are bugs/missing features (Alpha is alpha after all). But in it's current state it is highly playable and very fun for anyone interested in piloting their own spacecraft, and the developers interaction with their playerbase is very commendable. I see them answering questions in almost every quistion topic here on steam, and they are active on their own forumes as well.I have heard the original Starpoint Gemini was not that good (I have not played it myself), and if that is so: do not fear, this game, even in alpha, is very enjoyable. Any spacesim enthusiast will get their moneys worth, and then some!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game I've been following for a long time, hoping for a game that would dethrone Freelancer from its rightfull place. So far things look good and this might even be the case in the future, but as of now there's still plenty of work to be done. That doesn't mean SG2 wouldn't feel good to play. Does it?The game features a rather large open area The Gemini Star System. It's filled with stations, shipyards, bases, asteroid fields, junkyards, enemy ships, friendly ships, planets, anomalities, practically everything you would expect from a sandbox-type space game. It feels like there's a lot to do out there but at least for me that's not the case. This is because the game features very few different types of missions for the moment. There are freelance missions which you'll accept over the map view and then start them by docking with the correct facility, ship or planet. These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.The game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain. You control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target. In combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at. The combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy ""above"" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.The GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a ""minimalist"" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.Overall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After playing EVE Online (Non-Steam) I've been really looking for a space-sim similar to it but an offline version. X3 (Non-Steam) was the best one I've played so far, and Rebirth I've never touched because it looked pretty disappointing.Music: The tracks so far are good and fit the game well but there's only 4 tracks I've heard so far but hopefully more will come.Gameplay: Depending on the class you pick, you'll have a set of skills that you can utilize in combat or other purposes, there's a leveling system as well which you progress by doing missions, mining, exploring new sectors, repairing ships/stations, scanning anomalies and blowing other ships up, with this in mind the game felt like it was a Space Sim/RPG mix to me. Combat is good, I have freedom of movement and aim. It's also cool how you have troopers on your ship and you can get them to board other ships, unfortunately I never succeded.Graphics: Ship/Station models, anomalies look decent, the background looks excellent, planets look ok but overall the game looks great.Single Player: So far there's only a Sandbox mode where you can do whatever you want, there's no story mode at the moment but they have said that they are working on it and we'll probably end up seeing it sooner or later.Summary: Starpoint Gemini 2 has alot of potential and It's pretty good for an early access title, so far I've enjoyed my time with and will continue playing it. One thing I would love to see is the ability to actually fly into the planets and explore the landscapes, not just dock on the planets with a menu and what not. ",183,24,1,33,9,0,24

												This is a great game. Graphics are top notch with a really nice pellet of colours used. Story line is easy to follow. Plenty of ways to play like mine, trade, police, smuggle or fight. Down side is learning the controls.The tutorial is like a wiki, text and image based which I found hard to follow. I tried to play using my controller but found it impossible to shot because the controller buttons for the menu were the same buttons to fire and target, this meant I could not manually fire my guns. If I am missing something maybe a video tutorial on how to play with the controller would help so maybe a member of the community could help here.Once I switched back to the mouse I found flying around quite enjoyable. You do not have to fly far to run into some action which I liked. Over all I like this game very much, and did I mention the great sound effects and epic music.  ",21,5,1,4,19,0,5

												I really love the game, the open world and freedom to do what I want is so simple yet nobody seems to ever give the true freedom of choice that I want in a space game. I'm really happy with it. I only have one complaint and a two suggestions. For the complaint, and it may be something on my end, I'm experiencing a lot of crashes, still worth it to reload every hour or so though. As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice. My second suggestion would be to work in some speaking graphics of an alien or human pirates or whoever is talking when I recieve a message from somebody in the upper left cornet within the exploration game. I just feel like it would be more engaging with that.			",22,0,0,1,2,0,6

												Great game and great customer support!SPG2 is not a Flight-Sim like the X-Games... its more likley a point and click and Flight-Sim Hybrid.Point and Click components are implemented in the following game Mechanics:- Targeting- Special Skills- Shooting (Auto Aim and Auto Fire [Optional you can aim and shoot by yourself but the controls are not really made for this])Flight sim:- Evasive Manuveurs - OutmanuveursAs you can see is the Focus on the Point and Click elements. Personaly  i would like to play this game as an pure Flight-Sim but the controls are right now just to clumsy (Mouse Aim is a little bit hard to master and flying with joystic will lead into big disadvantages because you will have massive problems to rotaet those turrets (Nearly all Weapons are turrets).But the Game is still in Progress and the Devs are very active in the steam forum and try to help there costumers nearly in every single thread that is posted. Suggestions are also taked really serious by the devs.The First company i know which has a suggestion forum that isnt just a placebo.Never has seen such a service before! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been looking for a game like Freelancer for years because I've loved how it was open-ended and how you could do anything you wanted, apart from having huge ships. This game however does everything Freelancer did and more. You can have huge ships if you want, you can have a fleet of ships and you can get gigantic ships with the mods. There's already a titan class ship mod. The game deserves at least 9/10 from any and all aspects. Yes there are bugs and yes some missions aren't completed and yes there is no campaign mode or multiplayer, but the sandbox is more than enough. Keep in mind that this is early access and they are going to add a campaign mode.This was what I was looking for. This game deserves to be played and loved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had Starpoint Gemini 2 since Early Access, but I didn't know how to play it. Only a couple of days before release from beta did I start watching YouTube videos on how to play it and since then I've been having quite a bit of fun with it. I'm hooked. Right now, I'm ten hours into the game playing Freeroam; I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this huge game. I kinda like how I can go in-game if I have some time over and just do a couple of quick missions, while, if I want to play for longer, I can do long trips to the end of the galaxy that will take hours and involve lots of exploration and combat. It's beautiful, it's fun and it's satisfying. I like Freeroam mode, but there's also a storyline mode. The modding is going to be awesome. Watch out for some big total conversions for this one! Also, the community and developers are really friendly.			",51,5,0,24,26,0,51

								This is a great game. Like all space sim/action/whatever, it takes a little to get comfortable with all the controls. There is so far only one real thing I'd change. There is a sense of ""I'm never ever gonna be able to afford that..."". The experience gained from freelancer missions is way too freaking small, and the upgrades to weapons are insanely expensive, not to mention I have no real idea how much of a boost they are giving me, because the data doesn't have % signs or adjustments shown.So really, it's a great game. Period. It seems like it would never end really, which is great. But I still have no sense of how long it will take to get to higher levels, because right now I'm level 3 (so like 6300/9000 points to next level) and each of these freelancer missions gets me like 50 freaking points! So I'm asuming never.I know I am just griping about that over and over, but that's it, that's the only drawback. Other than that, it has everything you want in a space RPG. Exploring, mining, upgrading, fighting (which is pretty hard, but really fun), assassinations, etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Wow! I have played a lot of Freelancer over the years and always looked forward to a second comming if you will. With the recent surge in SciFi games I have tried my chances with a few and been let down (X-Rebirth I am looking at you). However this game keeps the syplicity of Freelancer with ideas from today. Honestly it really takes the best from Star Trek Online and Freelancer in that it allows you to be what you want but gain levels along the way with a pretty good skill tree. I really enjoy the freedom to do what you want combined with an RPG element. That way I actually feel like I am getting somewhere. Ordinarily I would wait to post a review however with these types of games I can usually tell if I will like them based on my love of Freelancer (hence the constant name drop). This game also has a full workshop so there is the possibility of endless content. There are already Star Trek mods and I am sure that more are to follow. All in all, if you need to scratch the Freelancer itch and you are tired of waiting for Robert's new game, please try this one. For the price it really cannot be beat.			",250,24,6,64,17,1,45

								when you play SPG2 you have to remember at the moment its a Beta and has the main story missing so full review not possible . So far i have given it about 30 hrs of play time and have discovered about 50% of the map so very replayable and keeps pulling you in to discover more . Lots of side missions available  but no side line stories or quests as of yet i assume these will come with the main quest . Although there are a abudance of different factions and ship and enhancements available easily enough to keep you going for a long time . There are also a large ammount of mods avaiilable throught the steam workshop which yet another dimension to the game especially if you like blowing things up with very big guns . I would fully recommend this game it has provided me with hours of entertainment and many more to come  during my play i have encountered no gliches or freezes to date  and all seems well . Looking forward to the Main story .			",6,0,0,5,2,0,2

												A very good space game, enjoyable in freeroam and the story mode seem pretty interesting. The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.(And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)

												This game can be summed up as a modern day Freelancer, but with capital ships instead of fighters. It shares many similarities with the aforementioned game, as well as some enjoyable improvements, and will probably be the best single player Freelancer-style space sim available for a good while. With Star Citizen focused on multiplayer, look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2 to fill the gap between the two.Like Freelancer, you can play with keyboard and mouse, with a rather familiar flight control style to Freelancer players. But although SG2 offers support for other gaming controllers, it's far from polished right now - it's near-enough unplayable with the popular Saitek X52 HOTAS, given the rediculous deadzone on all axes. However, if anything, the keyboard and mouse feels more natural to use in this game anyway, given you're playing the role as a ship (and later, fleet) commander.Comparing this game to the failure that was X-Rebirth, SG2 comes out on top. Although more arcady, SG2 is significantly more enjoyable from the getgo.			",78,13,15,18,32,1,48

												Very enjoyable, a bit rough around the edges.Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun.Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc. One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun.Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol			",20,1,1,2,3,0,2

												A fun and accessible space sim, but suffers from lack of depth.The economy system could use an improvement, prices don't seem to vary much and it does not seem to work on a supply and demand system.The faction relation system seems shallow, with a faction being good or evil and depending on your stance factions belonging to one side will either like you or be an enemy. I almost wish it was like ""Mount and Blade"", with you joining a faction and assisting that faction capture enemy territory.Though besides it lack of depth in places, I still enjoyed the game for the time I spent in it.

Early Access Review
								This game is like what others have said, lacking in entertaining content for the moment, story, challenge on demand, and does have you with little to do after a certain amount of time.However, i still recomend this as a purchase for early access and most definitly recomend feature complete status on-ward.The game runs smoothly and brilliantly, and how many early access games can you say has a games workshop up n running at this stage? there are 3 ships available right now in the workshop from star trek, one of the three is one im unfamiliar with, so perhaps an original model idea. new content will steadily flow into this game that has had me checking every other day for new workshop mods or new patches that allows for entertainment in of itself. I recomend early access to people who would actually want to see a game develop into something new and unique, you can help using the workshop, and even if you dont have the skills, they do not kid around when they say they are using OUR idea's. Suggest something in the forums, however simple or elaborate as you like and they WILL consider it.There are compenies we've seen who have had amazing communities launching suggestion barrages at them just ignore every single one and watched as the game died off (i have one in mind specifically for this =p) yet here, just take a look at the forums, at how often you get responses from the dev's in regards to suggestions. I've heard of a wish list that includes a unicorn! This is a game to keep an eye on at the very least, i feel we'll see great things from this gem in future.			",91,2,2,7,7,1,18

												I'm not sure how to review this one. There are some issues that I have with it that are just hallmarks of past space sims. So if you hate typical downsides of space sims, then this game doesn't really break that barrier. If you're not a fan of classic space sims, then this game doesn't deliver much outside of that. But first off, I got this game when it was 80% off 2 years after it released. I got it primarily to scratch that never-ending itch of playing a worthwile space sim while waiting for Star Citizen to be a more complete game. My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting/protecting/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with ""bad"" factions, stay lawful/chaotic neutral, or side with ""good"" factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine/salvage/scan/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.			",65,31,0,13,9,1,8

My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting/protecting/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with ""bad"" factions, stay lawful/chaotic neutral, or side with ""good"" factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine/salvage/scan/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.			",65,31,0,13,9,1,8

												Well for $35 I have enjoyed this game. There are aspects of this game that are in need of improvements. Specifically: the point of view difficulties with turret mode, fixing balancing issues with mission level and mission difficulty, sudden explosion of ship which occurs randomly for no apparent reason either in combat or not, and a revamping of the money making process as capturing ships is the only effective way to progress due to missions and mining not being profitable enough to support ship progression. I have only played the freeroam with a starting zero reputation mod. I have played Rebel Galaxy before purchasing this game and found this game to be different and not necessarily better than Rebel Galaxy. There is more that is different than the same between the two games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's a good space RPG, that has a few bugs, still but only minor ones. the ship customizing is, good idea,  and the ships are a fair size, with combat skills, the turning rate, still needs some work.  combat pretty basic, missle weapons and beam, weapons, just need to upgrade, them.  For the overall of the game, u get more, from hunting down emenies, but still can make  some pretty good, coin, in the trading system, just have to find a trade. route, that will pay more, for ur buying items. at the stations.  Missions are good, since u need them to build ur rep, with the sector's  and regions of the game.  But don't do any missions that take u into a hostile, Base. really bad idea.  As for Rateing this game, would be 8/10.  Not a bad game to have.			",52,7,0,31,11,0,35

												Alreet peeps, so this is my experience shot and review. So first things first id like to recommend this title and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.  This however will just be a general impression not a rating or in depth review.Reasons : I'm coming from the original Starpoint Gemini and really enjoyed it for its single player freelancer style of gameplay. I picked it up in early access which i dont usualy go for but due to my experience with the original i toke a chance, this was not a mistake though as the title has come along way since i originaly purchased this.Graphical: not cutting edge but still a really good looking game. fx to physics all of which are well made and are still being refined even after full release.Sound assets : I have no ear for sound effects but they where up to standard, no odd sounds that ruined the experience.Performance : Runs great. I dont have a uber rig, i run a very avarge system and this game runs great even in larger battles.Content: A good solid campaign backed up with a freeroam mode that allows you to strip away the main story and play the universe in the way you want to. So many ships that you wont get to fly them all in one play through i reckon even with a few play throughs you will find some new ship to fly, some new mission and or enemy to beat up on. Also the ability to play as a peace keeper or as a bandit.faults : no borderless window mode and lack of a multiplayer.Overhall: Solid singleplayer title that if you like freelancer / startrek online / x3 then your gonna be at home with this title. Defo pick this up and i pretty sure you will enjoy whats here and whats coming in the future as the team behind this is great and im sure this game can only get better.Update- the original games campaign reto fitted into this game for free!, why cant all develpers do this. Perfect actualy prefect.Stay Frosty			",209,19,3,44,23,3,68

												Starpoint Gemini is worth buying if you like sandbox space games where you can mine, be a pirate, or just do missions. However, 35 dollars just seems too high for what you get so you may want to wait for a sale of some kind first.Video showing what the gameplay is like(even though old video, gameplay is still 99% the same... campaign just didnt exist yet):

												Da. Best. And that is an exact measurement.  Starpoint Gemini 2 successfully brings the open world 3D single player RPG to space.  Some may say that sprpg is past its prime but SG2 didn't get that memo because this game doesn't feel dated at all and includes all the modern accessories like side quests, an engaging story, lots of skills and ranks and points to customize your character, hireable mercenaries, customizable ships (oh yea), and some awesome new stuff to make you feel like you are not only piloting, but commanding a fleet.  I played this game a lot during early access and I said then that this game had the potential to be awesome if executed correctly and man was it ever!  On top of all that your ship is a whole character of its own with everything from frail gunships to massive carriers that can cloak themselves and launch entire fighter wings from their carrier bays! I would recommend this game to anyone who has suffering in the drought of good space games and anyone who enjoys rpgs.  Oh and [name redacted] this isn't Eve, you get to shoot the guns and do stuff.			",73,5,10,15,11,0,13

								Being a SCI-Fi fan, it brings me much joy to review SPG2. This is an awesome space sim/ fighter game in which you command one of many space worthy vessels against pirates, factions and even natural elements like radiation which will wreak havok on your ship and crew. There are missions, faction missions, mining and salvage operations, and if your more about chaos and destruction then you can go around hijacking other ships to add to your own collection or sell, its all up to you. Currently the game is still in Beta and the game has its bugs and balancing issues but the Devs are always hard at work bringing constant updates and answering questions from the community, which is a major plus these days. The game at is current state is beautiful to look at with many various galaxies, planets and space stations, this game easily surpasses other sims that have already had time to mature. Future updates include strory lines, more complex missions, and ships, also the list as the devs have called it is always growing from ideas of players and the community as a whole. So if you love space, ships, fighting, customization, looting, selling and RPG elements then this is the game for you, trust me when I say you wont regret it.			",192,20,6,22,12,1,7

												Good time killer but there are a lot of little bugs that blow it for me. Like mission triggers that don't always work so you can get stuck on missions and need customer support to tweak them. That and the combat is relatively bland, they put a lot of thought into boarding actions and such but its not easy to learn unless you stumble upon a youtube guide, theres no tutorial really for it. Beyond that the enemy AI always hangs out in your blind spot and the dogfighting is very ""meh"" - point and click stuff, doesn't feel like it's skill based you know? Just tell your turrets to go HAM and wait a few seconds for things to explode. Scan anomalies for EXP that you'd otherwise ignore so their ""side effects"" aren't very underplayed.

												I'm sorry, I've tried getting into this game, but I can't.  I've tried several times throughout the last year or so.Mainly it's two things.1)  There is no tutorial.  Its idea of a tutorial is to give up to 5-6 dialog boxes at a time of what things do.  It's a bit of overload (""MORE? Come ON!"").  It should walk you things slowly, like a proper tutorial.2)  Gamepad mapping.  It has partial support, and it seems to work... but the tutorial doesn't tell you what the buttons do.  It says ""To move up, press JOYSTICKUPXO"", to look down press ""JOYSTICKDOWNXO"".  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Doesn't tell you what the gamepad buttons do or the triggers.  If they have gamepad support, just make it work or say no.  I play from my couch so I'm not about to play using keyboard/mouse.It seemed OK, voice acting is super campy in the typical space game kind of way.  I just coudln't get to the Planet in the first few minutes of the tutorial.  Sorry guys.			",84,16,1,20,7,0,22

												I haven't played this game for too long but it has proven to be very fun and challenging.  I am currently playing through the campaign but I am also conducting side missions.  The side missions include (from what I have seen so far): assassination of trouble makers, repairing installations, bounty hunting, and transporting VIPs. I mine asteriods and trade at stations frequently to balance my finances.  Capturing and selling enemy starships have proven to be the most lucrative transaction.  Combat is somewhat confusing at first but the games excellent tutorial guide and fully customizable control menu is very helpful.  Pros:-Good graphics.-Intense space combat.-Can easily change viewing settings - Rudder control""bridge"" view, Rudder control third person view, and turret third person view.-Ability to purchase and upgrade several starships.-Can hire mercs and form a fleet. -Large open world to explore.-Many unique ways to ""jump""around the map e.g. rifts and wormholes.-Story is ok.-Background music is pretty good and varied.Cons:-No NPCs to interact with at space stations.-No first person perspective.-No ship interior perspective. Mixed:-Fairly steep learning curve to become proficient with all of the games functions.Overall a great indie title!  Give your self lots of time to play this game...it is hard to quit this game for the night!			",22,8,0,4,5,0,2

												I always was fan of space games, but most of them are meh at the best. The only that I TRULY liked A LOT were X3 (all 3 of X3's), EVE Online, FTL, and Space Pirates and Zombies. To be honest, I expected Stairpont Gemini 2 to be just meh, but it came on sale. Quickly calculated the cost in my currency, and decided to give it a shot anyway.It might not be one of those I love the most, but certainly it's not meh either. It's actually pretty good. I am enjoying it.It sure has it's flaws, but it sure is fun to play. I see it as kind of mix of Freelancer/X3 with EVE Online. For sure, I don't regret spending money on it - and it doesn't happen a lot.			",149,15,6,17,19,2,32

												There is a very important tip in this review! If you're going to get this game, you better read on.I tried to return this game after five hours of trying to make enough money to even by the next better laser in order to break the asteroids faster.  And, I can tell you I'm very happy that I passed the hours played deadline for returning it! This really is a quite fun game if you know the right way to make money!  If you think you're going to make money trading or mining, you got another thing coming! Forget about anything except capturing enemy ships.When you go to a space station, on the upper left you can select hiring troops or mercenaries. Hire as many troops as you can, and then go find an enemy ship. Find an enemy ship that has as many or less personnel than the troops you hired.  The number of personnel is listed to the right of the 'lock on' information.Destroy most of the enemies hull, but leave about a quarter. Then from your 'center mouse button' menu select send troops. Over on the right side of your screen a small flag will appear showing your troops are boarding the ship and how many troops are left on both sides. At this point you can click on the green arrow to send extra troops, if you don't send extra troops you will probably lose the battle.  If and when you capture the ship, and you must learn how to capture ships, use the tractor lock on in the 'center mouse button' menu. Then head back to a space station and sell it. In the beginning ships get you about $100 K, maybe a little less. But that beats the $10 K per trip of breaking rocks. Then use that money to buy better lasers, missiles, and systems upgrades. You do not get experience points for capturing ships though.(unless it finishes a mission) Destroying ships gives you experience points. Once you have upgraded your ship as much as you can, then go start doing missions to gain experience points.Make sure you save at least one of every higher level ship to use as you rank up. If you are good enough at combat, you can capture ships larger and better than yours. Then once you rank up you can start using them instead.  I have succeeded capturing ships with one third less personnel on my ship than the enemy ship. I think the worst damage to the enemy ship the less troops you need.Definitely read the instructions in the upper right ? Icon.Pros:It definitely is a well-made galaxy. It's pretty, large, has lots of planets, anomalies, and wormholes. The wormholes can be a little crazy when you're in a battle and one grabs you and sweeps you away!It has lots of great ships to choose from.Plenty of different armaments to choose from.Some armaments work well in some situations and then do not work as well in others.Lots of side missions to choose from.The campaign story is really good.Cons: Even though it has a good campaign story, the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in most of the characters.  It seems like they went around from high school to high school looking for the worst of the drama students they could find to perform the stories.The mission text portions have obviously been poorly translated. I think it was originally in German. A lot of the stories and side missions are just given to you in text form, and because of the poor translation it can be hard to understand what they are trying to say.Considering the size of the galaxy they provide, the main campaign was too short. I did tons of side missions, finished the story, and still had half the galaxy unexplored. Since I find no point in just roaming around the galaxy for no particular reason, the rest will remain unexplored.All in all:It was totally money well spent! I also got the two extra campaigns which I will now go and play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the space sim I've been looking for since I stopped playing Freelancer; big open world, customisable ships, factions, upgrades and a big open world. I get to fly around a large universe, exploring, trading, collecting bounties or mining and still feel like there's more out there to see/do. Maybe these things are available in EVE, but I wouldn't know as I don't get enough gaming time these days to justify a monthly subscription.This game is about captaining a ship; the piloting and gunning controls work best if you select a target/destnation and tell the ship to attack or move.Here's my first impressions after 20 hours:Pros Big open world (might have mentioned this already) Customisable ships Various factions to befriend / hunt down Freedom to choose between merc, trader, explorer, etc No game breaking bugs (so far)Cons Feels like a late beta - the DLC prompt EVERY SINGLE TIME I start the game, despite my saved games already using the DLC. There's also missing voice files for some conversations and custom key configurations aren't saved between sessions. Voice acting, when it's there (some of the voice files are missing) Tutorial - be prepared to click through screens of dull text every time you mouse over a control the first time you play and still have to look things up afterwards. Do yourself a favour and watch some YouTube guides instead.Still I reckon this'll be one of my most played games by the time I finish with it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has lots of flaws, but I like it so much since it's the game i've been looking for a long time.PROS:-Absolutely beautiful, the way the binary stars cast shadows on asteroids, to the way distant nebulae appear giant and intimidating-Most of the locations you see in space are reachable-Great soundtrack-You can be what you want, a pirate, trader, privateer, whatever-Lots of ships-Lots of modules and countless ways to setup your loadout-For a space game, the environment is extremely varied-Boarding and stealing a ship feels damn good-MODDING!!!!!1111111!!11MIXED:-Probably just me, but the trading and interface feel to simple; after playing EVE Online for so long, the UI feels like it needs more-The active ability RPG portion feels tacked on, I find myself almost always autofiring; at least never using my 1-4 keys-Sometimes the autopilot glitches out and it's hilarious; I like to think of it as a feature-Doesn't have SLI support, unless forced through a third party program like NVidia inspector or even just the control panel. However, once you do force it, it runs really nice (minus some annoying microstuttering).CONS:-The downscaling of the universe is really obvious and weird-Things pop in a lot, like anomalies and stations-Bad sound effect design, especially in weapon firing sounds-Inconsistant graphics, some things are really highly detailed while others look like they came out of a 2006 game-Missions get repetitive, and if you strip all the lore and factions away, all the gameplay is literally the same, minus enemies getting tougher over timeCool game, go buy, shoot ships in the face.

Early Access Review
								Yes and no !Yes for its not buggy at all for being a Early access, its fully runable as you can shoot asteroids and collect ore, you can travel and of course fight ships !No because it still need some things like First Person view, nicer ships ( compared to X3 ) nicer stations and such !It is an Early Access game, Devs are frequently visitors in forums and they really suck in all intel they get from people there, so it might be a good game this - My suggestion is to wait till the game is finished, but after all its only 21:49 Euro, so its really up tp you !Enjoy :-)			",138,5,15,11,40,0,11

												As many reviews state, this game starts out amazingly. Once you figure out the 3 things to do though, you are done. There is no taking over rival factions or expanding faction space. In fact, the factions may as well not exist other than to proivde you with dynamic enemies.The appearance and interface in this game is great. I just want more guts. The core is so flacid I simply stopped playing due to boredom. Stories and missions are mostly a joke. Go assassinate this guy. Go do this. Go do that. Fly for hours between. It just ends up being grind for the sake of grind.Get it on sale. Play for a bit. I got 8 hours out of it and will probably spin it up again in the future for another hour or two.

												Basically Freelancer.Similar to Sid Meier's Pirates but in space. Huge space.Ship customization similar to Mechwarrior's mech customization.Mine asteroids, hunt bounties, play with the market, buy better ships, better equipment, etc.Streamlined user interface.Combat is good. There's several weapon types for you to try out. Rockets, laser beams and plasma cannons to name a few, each with their own properties and upgrades. Get on your gunship and chase enemies by their tail or line up your battleship and bombard them mercilessly. Your choice.Exploration is good. The game gives the player a huge world to explore. Planets, space stations and shipyards that offer different products depending on their region. Planets and space stations act as hubs, you can't set foot on them and explore. Not as huge as Elite Dangerous but huge nonetheless. Music is good. Too bad there's not much to go around. If you have a space exploration playlist then add this game's music to that playlist and play that instead.Economy is there. Trade clean goods or contraband. You can take advantage of rising and falling prices of materials but the economy isn't deep enough to make it an engaging enterprise. You can mine asteroids or scavenge space junk while going about your trade route, I guess.CAN'T FORM A FLEET. You can capture enemy ships. You either sell them, keep them or scrap them. Keeping them puts them in your garage. You can switch between ships YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE SHIP AT ANY TIME. The closest to a fleet you'll get is by hiring mercenaries to fly with you for a price. Even then you can't command them. This is probably the worst negative point of the game in my opinion.Light RPG elements.A good space game overall but if you're into trading, playing with the economy or empire building then this game won't satisfy you. I bought this on sale at 80% off so it's more than worth the money.			",40,5,0,11,7,0,5

												I remember getting this game when it was still in its alpha/beta form with only a few things to do besides blowing up ships, blowing up asteroids, taking their goods, and then selling them at a market for a few dollars (which seemed weird back then because ships cost a ♥♥♥♥ TON and still do, but there are ways to get more money now.) So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, ""What is there to do?"" Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.			",68,6,0,7,6,0,5

Posted: April 9, 2016
												I would definately recommend this game... but with some notes of caution.  I consider my self a supporter of 'Little Green Men', because I've always enjoyed their games ( at least the few I have).  However... I feel this one is falling a bit short, and I'm unsure if these are problems they are having issues resolving... or have just given up.  However... the problems that I've seen thus far, are more inconvenient than Game Stopping.There's a serious issue with early game over powering of the enemy.  While I've heard a claim by the developers that this was a Development decision, I personally believe this is a Bug that they haven't been able to resolve.  Basically, when taking a mission which is marked at a specific level, the mission turns out to be impossible to complete even though your level made be higher than the recommended level.  Option:  Run and find another mission and hope this doesn't happen too often... but it will.Another issue deals with Enhancements which can be added to ship's equipment and weapons, but the Enhancements do not actually enhance the item.  Note:  some... not all.Licenses, also, which should provide specific bonus do not work.  Note:  some... not all.Other than the above I have no other negative issues with this game.  It has all of the elements of a Good Space Sim, with many choices on how one wishes to play... Fighter... Merchant... Miner... Salvager... or even pirate.  I usually don't play pirate until I get bored with a game, but don't want to stop and need a new challenge.  however, the problem with being a pirate in many space sims is the limited choices you get; often being more of a headache than anything else.  But with this game I've seen the pirates (or more correctly, the Hostile Factions) have as much territory to operate in as the 'So-Called' Good Guys.  I'm actually looking forward to trying my hand as a pirate.The merchant side of the game is IMHO as well done as it seems to be possible based on the many games I've played, and wanted to be a Merchant.  In short... I don't feel like it's Great... but it does seem Very Good; just haven't got a decent size Cargo Ship for really trying it out.  However... for the little trading I've seen and done... it looks like it has ""Very Good"" Potential.  Mining for both Ores and Gases was done in a very fun and unique way... which I've been enjoying for the most part.  It doesn't really seem to make as much money as Combat... but then again, this is a Combat Game; I just like mining; with a touch of combat to give me a reason to wake up in the morning.  But you'll still need to focus on combat fairly early just to get a decent ship for mining.Combat was a bit disappointing at first because of the mechanics used to control the ship.  I found it was best to turn on Auto-Fire on all turrets... which seemed a bit Impersonal to me.  However... as I got better with all that you can do to Protect and Enhance you ship in battle... Aiming my Laser became the least of my problems, and I was rather happy I didn't have to worry about that anymore.  But that is a matter of Personal Preference.Also... the Skill and Perk system is fun; I like the fact that you can ""Sort Of"" custom build yourself for the type of Player and Character you choose.  I'm not a fan of being forced to play a specific character as is done in the Campaign (I feel disconnected to my Character while following the story line), but that, again... is just Personal Preference.  And the fact that I can build him the way I choose is far more important to me.One of the best aspects of this game ""To Me"" is that Money, thus far, is maintaining it's value.  Too often in Single Player Games you find that Money loses it's value far too soon.  Once you get to your 3rd or 4th ship -or- 20th or 30th level, you find  you start ignoring ways of making money... and just focus on leveling... because there just isn't anything left to buy that you can't afford.  I'm current level 43, and still find myself occasionally trying to scrap together a few Bit Coins to buy that Blaster with the Extra Kick.  I find that once a game's currency loses any real value (or more directly; Need) the game heads down hill from there.  At the time of this writing I have roughly $17mil, and trying to get to $29mil for the next for the next ship I want; but not the last ship I'll fly.All in all; while I got this game on sale, I would not have been disappointed if I had paid full price (assuming full price was under $40).  I definately would recommend this game; with hopes of certain issues being resolved.. but with confidence it's still a Fun and Addictive Game.Enjoy!!!			",42,6,0,18,10,0,3

												I gave this 15 hours as at first it seems like lots of upgrades and stuff that make it seem technical which I like.But this game has no substance and no depth.I'm so bored I am watching a movie at the same time and still bored with it.I could go into detail but whats the point when no one will ever read this.Think of this as a boring point and click mobile phone game that requires grinding the same hand full of missions over and over to level up and get new ships.  But then you realise its all the same.And you will come to a point where you need to fly to a space station to save every single time you pass anyting as instant death is just around the corner.  Do this boring save crap or replay the last 30min before you died.Yawn.....			",96,11,3,4,15,0,14

												A  Very solid buyI would recommend old school fans of Escape Velocity, Freespace and the X series.In its current state the game currently falls well short of being a master works, it lacks a level of immersion, complexity and feels like needs fair bit more spit and polish to be called finished. That being said it’s the best addition the genre in years. i may be speaking too soon as the developers seem to have fair bit of steam left for adding and fixing things up too.The game plays like a more arcade version of the X series it reminds me a lot of X rebirth without all the complete fail. It’s simple and fast paced space action that falls between somewhere between dog fighting and EVE online ship management and thankfully nothing like the orginal starpoint gemini.ProsBest, fight, trade and explore game in years.Solid graphicsDecent universe to exploreReasonably fast and action packedOngoing development ConsSeems 90% FinishedNo empire building Shipload equipment and loadout overly simple.Campaign worth avoiding – just don’t			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First review of a game... I am an older gamer and I am very picky about the games I get obsessive about. This Game is not finished, but the available content is more than enough to keep you busy. This is not a straight up shooter... this has more of a quest rpg style where you can be what you wanna be. The game reminds me of a game I used to play way way back in the day called starflight. You can customize your ship with colors and logos and plenty of weapons to choose from. Very Eve-escent with the loadouts. Nowhere near as complex as EVE though... and nowhere near as boring of a start like EVE... you can start shootin from the onset - and if you do a little research before you begin, you can hijack ships right from the start... Remember boys and girls, strip the captured ship before you sell it! The content that is coming is intriguing in the possibilities... I have been playing it hardcore now and I am still not bored. I paid full price for it and I am not disappointed!!!			",4,1,1,2,1,0,1

While combat only missions are getting slightly repetitive I find the combat itself is very fun if you use manual aim and avoid just getting into a rythym of auto-fire on locked targets. It adds more challenge to the combat and keeps it fresh every encounter trying to dodge incoming fire while positioning yourself correctly to fire your batteries and having to stay on your toes while aiming. I have been seeing a lot of threads calling combat ""lackluster"" or boring, but every one of them have been people using auto-aim and most likely just flying circles around the enemy ships haha. Of course that would become boring quickly, and the manual aiming is what makes me like this game more than a lot of other space sims that do not even have that option.On top of the combat there is trading(though not really worth it right now, but patches will surely improve it), mining, and boarding enemy ships to capture and haul back for good cash or to use it yourself. Mercenaries have been fixed in the latest patch as well which I have yet to try so cannot comment on that(allies that fly with you and help in combat which you can control to an extent). The campaign is pretty basic, but it has a decent story going on and gives you something else to do on the side when you get bored of freelance missions, mining, or trading to get into better ships and better upgrades for each ship. All in all I am enjoying the game and can't wait to see what else is added down the line(devs have already confirmed they want to add more endgame with station ownership and faction warfare). And to top it all off you can already mod the game and there a few complete revamps already even though the game has just released. Highly recommended if you liked any older space-sims like Freelancer or the like.			",87,5,1,15,35,0,20

												I love this game!  If you ever loved the game Freelancer, you'll really love Starpoint Gemini 2.   It has more customization than Freelancer.  You can do whatever you want... freelance for bounty/rewards, mine, salvage, be a pirate, be a merchant trader... whatever.  It looks great to the eye, very nice visual appeal.  I have found that the game experiences a crash now and again, but not until I've played it for a couple of hours straight.  I save very often so it doesn't hurt to badly when it happens.  I would buy this again and I look forward to seeing updates and additional maps/starchart expansions.  :)			",3,0,0,3,0,0,2

												I can't believe how awesome this game is. I just roam around and upgrade my (Weapons, shields, etc). Doing random mission trying to save up enough money to buy a new ship. There are so many ships with different stats, so its nice to find a ship that fits to your game-play. Like one that has great guns and shield for dogfights. Or huge freighters used for trading and mining. Also as you do more missions you began to improve your rank, What that basically means is you can control bigger and badder ships. Eventually you will feel the awesome power of Dreadnoughts or Carriers. These ships have more slots for weapons and diffrent weapons, just to customize it the way you like it. Also be careful there are high level ships out there. Some with bounties of 5mill, it's a gamble but if you can defeat them, you get paid bank! I personally love seeing an amazing ship and attacking it, bring it down to it knees. Weakening their defense and killing some of their troops in the process but before I kill them I latch the tractor beam and order my troops to board. If you have more troops (stats) then them you can capture their ship and tow it to the next star base to put in your garage or to sell for good $. I been having a blast.			",44,10,0,28,7,0,14

												This game is awesome. If you ever played the amaizing FTP Mobil game ""Galaxy on Fire 2"" and wanted more, this game delivers on all fronts.  It is almost a disservice to compare this game to it but it has everything that I love and more. Tons of ships to buy, loads of equipment to compare and upgrade, factions to ally or make enemies with, complex trading system, large variety of side missions, and an engaging story. The combat is engaging, I love capturing ships and selling them, the mining the dozens of different types of asteroids is eye candy, and there are tons of secerets to find and explore. I love this game and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world space games.  ",169,10,1,16,12,0,14

There just aren't enough good space trade/fight/explore games any more so this is a welcome relief from the market that's been saturated with FPS games.  LGM are a credit to the PC gaming world and really do support their followers and they deserve our support back.Highly recommended and I cannot wait to get more game time in but I unfortunately have a job :-<			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are ultra realistic space sims,  there are slow paced datasheet space sims,  and on and on and on you can go down the laundry list of space games.   What Starpoint Gemini 2 seeks to accomplish is finding a healthy balance of it's predecessors without leaning too far in any particular direction.   Make no mistake,  SG2 will take you hours to accomplish anything substantial,  but it won't take you hours to start doing something fun.  Want to be a trader?  You can do that.   Want to mine for rare materials?  You can do that.  Want to be a pirate?  You'll eventually be able to do that.  Want to be the force of good bringing bad guys to justice while getting paid for your bounty kills?  You can do that to.    My 7 hours have been mostly spent divided between the three classes that you can choose from in the freeform game.  There is the Leader,  Gunner and Engineer.   Each class provides a fairly substantial difference on terms of feel however the common objective between most of these skills is all the same...   kill your enemy.   I was a bit disappointed to see that many of these skills are not overly helpful for more mundane tasks like mining,  trading,  or exploration.  Seeing as how the game puts heavy emphasis on providing you options - this particular part said to me ""We're only truly designing this game with combat in mind"".   While the other things to do are definitely not afterthoughts,  they're not quite as fleshed out and as robust as I would have liked.There is a story mode but unfortunately the voice acting is horrible.  Normally I can manage some bad voice acting but found this to be a bit too much.  This turned out to be alright in the end as the sandbox aspects of this game are fun and easy to get into.  The tutorial or lack there of was at least filled with a pop-up tips menu which got me rolling quickly enough.  I had to spend some time rummaging through the keybind menu but after that I was off and racing.  This game still feels very young with a lot of possiblities.  My 7 hours is definitely not enough time to even have a completely firm grasp of what the late game or even middle game will be like but I have a hunch it's going to just be more of the same but with higher stakes involved.  Instead of combat with 3-6 ships,  it'll be more along the lines of 10-20 ships if the trailers and other various videos are telling a truthful tale.   Scaling of this nature is not altogether a bad thing if you're having fun with everything you're doing at the start of the game.  Essentially,  it's not going to mix up the formula a whole lot as you get deeper into the game.  Sure you'll be able to use more skills due to having higher energy and more points to place down extra turrets and systems...  but most of those tools could be used at the start of the game as well,  just within limitations.   If I could pick one thing I wish this game had, it would be co-op support.  Sharing a universe with 2-16 friends could serve for some amazing lan or house hold family fun.  Luckily the mod community seems to be getting behind this game so at the very least the variety of things to do will be getting mixed up a lot.  If you're still on the fence of this game I'd say just keep checking back.  Look at what the devs and the mod community are up to.  There is already a decent amount to do here and it's just done well.   If I had to give it a 1-10 rating I'd say we have ourselves an 8.2 with the clear opportunity to become a 9-9.5 if they continue to add features.   If you're someone who enjoys smelling the flowers and doing assorted tasks with some grinding mechancis involved due to large credit costs to purchase anything substantial,  then this game is the game for you!Give me a thumbs up if you found this review useful.

Has more tackticle elements during combat  ( which I like rather than just a space shooter with a plot ) you can follow the main plot or you can freelance, own multiple ships. capture ships , trade , do , missions ,explore the galaxy, find artifacts, and blueprints of ships and weapon systems.logged about 14 hours so far or More, it's heaps easier to learn and enjoy than the X series of games!Thanks Devs Great Job extra work on making plot dialog and plot trigger animation / cutscenes / triggers  smoother and more seamless, but community and Devs are very responsive with patches comming out frequently to correct and add to game.I highly recommend to anyone who likes a good space sim.

												A  Very solid buyI would recommend old school fans of Escape Velocity, Freespace and the X series.In its current state the game currently falls well short of being a master works, it lacks a level of immersion, complexity and feels like needs fair bit more spit and polish to be called finished. That being said it’s the best addition the genre in years. i may be speaking too soon as the developers seem to have fair bit of steam left for adding and fixing things up too.The game plays like a more arcade version of the X series it reminds me a lot of X rebirth without all the complete fail. It’s simple and fast paced space action that falls between somewhere between dog fighting and EVE online ship management and thankfully nothing like the orginal starpoint gemini.ProsBest, fight, trade and explore game in years.Solid graphicsDecent universe to exploreReasonably fast and action packedOngoing development ConsSeems 90% FinishedNo empire building Shipload equipment and loadout overly simple.Campaign worth avoiding – just don’t			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First review of a game... I am an older gamer and I am very picky about the games I get obsessive about. This Game is not finished, but the available content is more than enough to keep you busy. This is not a straight up shooter... this has more of a quest rpg style where you can be what you wanna be. The game reminds me of a game I used to play way way back in the day called starflight. You can customize your ship with colors and logos and plenty of weapons to choose from. Very Eve-escent with the loadouts. Nowhere near as complex as EVE though... and nowhere near as boring of a start like EVE... you can start shootin from the onset - and if you do a little research before you begin, you can hijack ships right from the start... Remember boys and girls, strip the captured ship before you sell it! The content that is coming is intriguing in the possibilities... I have been playing it hardcore now and I am still not bored. I paid full price for it and I am not disappointed!!!			",4,1,1,2,1,0,1

The controls/UI wont scare you away and are very functional, and the game feels pretty polished for a new release.

For example im only 30 hrs in this game and im already running around the galaxy in a dreadnought feeling like a absolute power house. You rank up very quickly and theres easy money to make out their. Other then that the ships look awesome and the galaxy it self looks stunning.the only thing i found wrong with this game is that it doesnt feel like a simulation it has more of a arcade feel to it but if your some one like me who doesnt have alot of time on your hands because of works and is raising kids then who give's a s@#$			",87,1,2,6,7,1,31

												My first bit of advice is this, ignore the people who reviewed this with 2 hours or less in game, or even 5 hours or less in some cases.I've played EVE, the Wing Commander games, Star Citizen, and many other games in this genre.  Out of every game in my Steam library, this is the one that has most surprised me.  It surprised me because I hadn't heard much of it, and I got it at a very reasonable price.  It also has the polish of a game by a much larger developer, and depth galore.  Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.  That said, I am pretty early in the campaign so I don't know how it ends up, could get better.I rate this as a must buy if it even looks remotely enjoyable to you.  Give it a bit of time for you to figure out the intracies, and for it to impress you.  Things might seem simple on the surface, but the game is actually just the right level of complexity.  I can't reccomend this game enough.			",77,17,11,9,13,1,7

												This game is actually pretty damn sweet. If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It's also surprisingly bug free, for a game that's still in beta, it doesn't crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music's great. I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and that's pretty rare for m			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best space simulation games I've seen to date. EVE Online was too complicated, BS Galactica too dated, ect.., but this game struck a special chord. It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive. If multiplayer's eventually implemented, I can easily see this being the next big thing for online MMORPG space simulators.			",67,6,0,6,2,0,2

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions. Capturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.The pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).The Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.The Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.Exploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions. One downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor. Very fast save/loads. The fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.I suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.			",41,2,0,6,20,0,26

												One of the best space simulation games I've seen to date. EVE Online was too complicated, BS Galactica too dated, ect.., but this game struck a special chord. It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive. If multiplayer's eventually implemented, I can easily see this being the next big thing for online MMORPG space simulators.			",67,6,0,6,2,0,2

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about.

												My first bit of advice is this, ignore the people who reviewed this with 2 hours or less in game, or even 5 hours or less in some cases.I've played EVE, the Wing Commander games, Star Citizen, and many other games in this genre.  Out of every game in my Steam library, this is the one that has most surprised me.  It surprised me because I hadn't heard much of it, and I got it at a very reasonable price.  It also has the polish of a game by a much larger developer, and depth galore.  Campaign is nothing super special, but there are so many side missions or freelance things, I don't see it as a big deal.  That said, I am pretty early in the campaign so I don't know how it ends up, could get better.I rate this as a must buy if it even looks remotely enjoyable to you.  Give it a bit of time for you to figure out the intracies, and for it to impress you.  Things might seem simple on the surface, but the game is actually just the right level of complexity.  I can't reccomend this game enough.			",77,17,11,9,13,1,7

												This game is actually pretty damn sweet. If you enjoyed games like Freelancer or the X series, you will enjoy this without a doubt. It looks amazing, plays smoothly, has a big universe to explore and conquer, has staggering ship customization and upgrades, great trading, easy interface and decent tutorial so you feel comfortable playing it within 10 minutes. It's also surprisingly bug free, for a game that's still in beta, it doesn't crash, nothing. It misses a campaign (I think it will be added in a couple of weeks just in time for release), but even just the free roam mode is great fun. I also loved the idea of having different classes that you can choose with different abilities, some make your ship stronger while others buff your (future) fleet, along with a ton of perks that you can customize as you level up. Gives it a lot of replayability as you try different styles and approaches. Even the music's great. I honestly can't find anything to complain about, and that's pretty rare for m			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								IN THIS GAME You can do missions where you smuggle nudie magazine through pirate filled wastlands full of direlect ships and then defend against said pirates who sent a scout who scanned your ship when you weren't looking and reported back to the pirates further ahead that you had said nudie magazines and siad pirates further ahead launch an ambush from behind a massive freighter wreck from a previous ambush and they take down your shields and breach your hull and send a landing party and thankfully your ship is full of Marines who you hired to protect the nudie magazines at the station where you got the nudie magazines and the pirate landing party is slaughtered and you use a special button to dedicate all available power to your engines and then you leave the pirates in the dust, swerving to avoid asteroids and massive dead ships as you make your way to a remote station where you are greated by friendlys and you dock at the station and sell your nudie magazines and repair your hull and use some extra money to hire an escort ship, so next time, the pirates won't be a problem. 10/10			",49,9,0,5,17,0,15

For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.   I'm installing and trying it (prequel) now, though I've heard most of the issues were address post release, making for a very enjoyable game.			",429,95,23,80,61,7,97

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

								Amazing game. As close to Freelancer 2 as I think we've gotten or will get with next gen sims like Elite and Star Citizen coming out. There's a huge amount of depth here and free play mode is seriously awesome. So far I have...Missions / Trade / Exploration ( the universe is pretty huge and there are no jumpgates, you want to go somewhere be prepared to have a tea and fly it )Boarded and pirate who attacked me while mining. Stole their ship, towed it back to station, 60k profit w/ a hold full of ore as well. Enough to purchase some weapon and power grid upgrades & repair my own hull.Still mining, happily shooting rocks in a deep and immersive asteroid belt miles from any station ( the graphics are fantastic ) again unaffiliated scumbag smuggler drops my shield and attempts to hack my power grid. Fire a grappler, boost shields, send feedback up his signal to shut down his shields instead, steal everything on board, destroy his engines and leave him to die in the darkness.Ships are hugely expensive. Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )Right now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight. If anyone needs me I'll be in my cabin.All is quiet... for now.And this is alpha. Srsly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I thought EVE had a ton of factions and corps but this game I swear theres at least like 40 factions and the idea of having a small fleet is amazing. Its a must buy for eve players.

There are various mods to download from the STEAM workshop, including many ships from the star trek catalogue ....

												Didnt think too much of this when it was mentioned to me.  I was burned on X-Rebirth, played eve online, and mostly disappointed by anything space-wise that has not been eve.  X:3 was a decent game as well.  I picked this up for ~$20 and was instantly impressed with the game.  It has a huge map, really great fights, and things arent handed to you.  It does feel like it needs some touchup with certain aspects, but they are VERY minor and the devs are constantly looking for opinions on how to improve it.  Its an excellent game in its current form and with the addition of Workshop, its going to be huge when the mods start rolling out.  I highly recommend this game.			",118,17,2,6,16,1,14

								UPDATE: After lots and lots of play time, I've lost very little enthusiam and this has become my favorite game.If you find yourself missing Freelancer but wishing it was more robust in just about every measure (barring an in-cockpit view), this game is for you. There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a ""waygate"" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary. The starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.It's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.There's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.That takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative. *this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid			",92,12,0,10,12,0,8

												I'm enjoying my first few sessions of Starpoint Gemini 2. Very nice atmosphere - graphics, music and sound have all had some close attention paid to them. It seems nicely polished and generates a really good backdrop and environment to play in.There are some frustrating elements for me - the battles have me circling round and round trying to get the enemy in view and I'm not sure which of my weapons are firing, there doesn't seem to be a way to select weapons. maybe they're all firing, who knows :-) to be able to interact more with the weapons would be nice, i'm looking forward to uprgading mine but i want to see the difference that makes  - I don't know if the battle system is going to show that nicely? I think these games all struggle with the combat elements - this ons is still probably better than most.  another frustrating is the ships automatic pilot to waypoints seems a bit weird, it heads in the wrong direction sometimes.  thats not a biggie really.All in all, at this early stage I would give this an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of game - a mix of exploring, upgrading, with some combat thrown in - a quieter game to have a session on when needing a break from the fps shooters etc...  its good!

												Enjoy the game very much.  Unfortunately, the update has made it impossible to play, darn near.   All of a sudden i have pirates randomly warping in and instant killing me as i fly.  YOU GET TO START OVER FROM YOUR LAST SAVE.   so yes the game is fun for those who may find EVE a little too much,  $ and Mind,  but the instant kills will probably annoy you to no end.

								So far so good, I was really looking forward to getting X Rebirth but having read the reviews about how bad that game was I decided to give this one a go. So glad that I did!!Not only are the graphics for space very beautiful (due the the expense of fast travel I spend a lot of time with all power to engines on just watching space), the one main problem I have with any RPG games is grind, but this feels hardly like a grind to play.Early access things surely can only get better. I can't wait to see what happens. Smoke me a kipper I'll be back for breakfast!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Starpoint Gemini 2 maybe an early access game right now but the game feels a lot more complete than a number of new releases. The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of. Graphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)Would i recommend this game. Hell yes even at this stage and i look forward to seeing the end product.One other interesting note is the developers are always on the forums answering our questions and listining to our input and shows how dedicated they are to both the project and to their customers.

								I like the game a lot. Reminds me of a game way back in the day called Freelancer. I like this big open map and the combat is fun. There's certainly more they can include in the game but it's a very good start for a beta build. Whether your a space game person or not, I'd say give it a go.			",50,6,0,1,4,1,4

Now I have done some missions and fought some baddies, the game has grown on me much more.I can't recommend it enough, so much fun to play and it's still in beta with no story mode!With the ever-present devs listening to feed back and the potential of the steam workshopthis game is a must buy!

												It brings back that good feeling of having the galaxy at your fingertips, like in Freelancer and Elite, without the insane complexity of X3 etc. I still feel like I'm just starting out and I've put in some hours allready. It is not the new & perfect game. Some mechanics need some tweaking or better explanation (Turrets, all power to engines, etc.) but you can generally customize your ship to do exactly what you want it to. In particular the open world / sandbox play works nicely.In general I'd recommend the game, but be mindful of what the game is and isn't. It is not the hugely ambitious world of X, but then again, it is much easier to pick up and play; it is relatively approachable, but complex enough that you'll spend the first half hour at least going 'Now what? How do I do this?'. It is worth muddling through, though, if you're interested in this type of game.			",277,49,1,90,37,2,106

								Ok, first I want to say that overall, this is a fun game.  Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.The graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.The flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.As it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.  Also, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.There needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.Now for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.If I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.As a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.For most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.			",46,8,1,22,14,0,13

								Hi, love the concept.. ill get right to it.      In the Starchart, when you click on a waypoint option, I think the font on the little options menu that pops up should be bigger by about double.  It would still be a small concise menu but If between the two options of having a small font or a little larger easier to read one then i think it would just plain make for a better StarChart experience :) Keep up the good work!!

								It's early in development, so my view may change as game progresses.Up to now I really like this game.  It has a bit of everything that is loved by space game fans, and although not too complex fills the part nicely.It is 3rd person only, with the option of a turret view which allows rotation of your view around your ship.  This design has a really nice feel to it allowing for some good tactical combat.I would warn you that it is different than most, in the way things are controlled or handled, so a hour or two of getting to grips with these is needed, but then rewarded.The dev's are very active on the forums and do pick up on fans good ideas for the game, which is a bonus.I would say that it IS worth the risk of purchase, even in this early state is is fun to play.

								I love it I love it I love it.I've been playing this for some good hours straight. I have encoutered minimal bugs like when I'm on the starmap, my cursor has to be a little bit off of what I'm actually trying to click on... sure it's annoying but this is only in alpha, and that is my main concern?? Very well done game I'm extremely excited to see this game evolve! Although I am glad I got it on sale, 15$ maybe 20$ would be a better price than what it is. I'm getting tired of seeing alphas and early access games near full price. It's an alpha for a reason. Aside from the high price this game is definitely on my recommendations list.Cheers!

								This is a ""first (actually second) impression""It's shaping up.I bought this game a while back, in my seemingly neverending search for a satisfactory Space game.There is a text-only tutorial that I never bothered with, so I can't comment on that. You can skip ahead without worries since you can reread it later on if you need to. Graphics are pretty decent, the ship designs I've seen so far are varied and cool for the most part.The biggest plus part so far, is that this game seems to focus more on capital ship warfare, rather than on fighters and small corvettes like many of its rivals.The interface is also good, albeit a bit unintuitive and at some times utterly unresponsive. Some keybinds don't seem to work and it still needs some visual or audio queues as to what you just did, there is no indication anywhere on your screen whether your weapons are set to free fire or not (at least none I can spot). It seems sandboxy enough so far, with content appearantly procedurally generated and catered to your ship and level.It's a diamond in the rough and clearly unfinished, but already playable enough for me, I will surely be spending some more time in this game than before.So if you have the money and can live with the flaws listed above, give this game a try.

Early Access Review
								There are a lot of really good space sims out there, this is one of them.  But one thing that sets this game apart from those other games is this:  Noob friendliness.  This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.  Currently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.  I haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.

								This game is fantastic, especially for an Alpha release.  Several things are still in the works, but it is a fine game as is.  Right now it is essentially a space sandbox.  I tend to play the role of pirate, or privateer, rather (I only attack the bad guys, but I'm always trying to board them and steal their ships so I can tow them back to a planet or space station and sell off their guns, then the ships themselves... seems to be pretty lucrative).  You'll love it when you get a big carrier with a bunch of fighter wings or bombers... it's awesome having a swarm of firepower surrounding you.  The game is massive and consists largely of traveling between planets and space stations (press B to boost your engines to full and enjoy the ride and the amazing scenery), doing sidequests, mining asteroids, or being a merchant or pirate or whatever suits your fancy.  There is currently no storyline or any story missions (but plenty of sidequests are available and constantly appearing), and a lot of things are currently non-functional (like the useable items... thankfully they are super valuable so I just sell them for lots of money), but with that being said, this game is amazing... I'm really looking forward to years of fun with this thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Love this! Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Shows a huge amount of promise in terms of gameplay; the visuals of the spaceflight scenery, ships, asteroid belts, stations and nebulae are brilliant and very atmospheric. Even the icons and equipment images are polished and impressive.There are the inevitable comparisons to games like Elite and X, but even in this early incarnation I feel that Starpoint Gemini has the capacity to surpass them; I haven't seen much of the trade mechanic yet, but have enjoyed myself immensely with the freelance missions and grappling enemy ships before boarding, capturing and selling them.Some other memorable moments so far are the sound of the engines powering up when you leave a station, or slicing up asteroids to mine ores.I also really like the dimensions in the game - the stations are big, but the planets are massive and I like that you can land on them. I'm about 20 hours in and have covered maybe a quarter of the map (and most of that was a fleeting visit).The gameplay gets sticky on my machine moving between sectors but  this is only the Alpha build and I imagine there is still a lot of coding spit-and-polish to come.My wishlist for the finished game would be to be able to reduce the number of turrets as well as increase them (have been a bit overly-optimistic with power management for my Myrmydon weaponry) and for alliance ships to stop shooting at my captured enemy vessels while I'm trying to drag them back to port.Highly recommended if you like space exploration/combat/trade games.

								Think StarTrek meets Cowboy Bebop. Yes, that good. At this stage in development only two things can be suitably inferred from this game. Its tone and core mechanics. And I am exceptionally pleased with both. Even as an early alpha it is successfully scratching a difficuly itch to reach.I wanted a game where I could zoom around the solar system getting into fights with phasers and torpedos, having to jockey for position all the while balancing my shields, engines, and weapons. SG2 gave me exactly that. The combat is very nice. In its current state the missions are randomly generated, MMO style, filler quests, but this does not prevent the encounters from being very fulfilling, if for no other reason then the solid underlying mechanics. This game will really cause you to think strategically. Will you perform the risky gambit of dumping all power to the shields and weapons to try and pick off a weakened enemy in one pass or will I shift that power into the engines and hope for a second chance to strike at that exposed hole in their shields. As the game progresses you will be making that decision and others as you have to contend with swarms of fighters and imposing warships. It requires just enough of the player to be extremely fulfilling when a risky maneuver works without being unduely frustrating when it fails. And you will fail alot. But the game is at its best when it is challenging. That is when the flexibile thinking and fast micromanagment that characterizes its combat will bring out your inner Jean-Luc Picard. And when it does you will feel great. The tone is harder to express then the mechanics, but is a perfect compliment to them. If you have ever watched Cowboy Bebop then this game will be like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes. Two things drive this feeling. First, the music distinctly reminds me of some of the tracks from the show. There are no jazzy interludes, but the background music reminds me of some prog songs accompanying the space scenes. The music is seamlessly woven into the background noise of your lasers, phasers, engines, and missles. Most of the time it is barely noticeable above the ruckus but it is a soothing distraction during a long sprint across the map. It simply suits the game, perfectly conveying the mystery and the solitude of space. The more obvious callout to the tone of Bebop is the types of missions available so far. Most are bounty type missions and trading runs. All taking place in fantasitic locals with cool space stations. The game has a very awesome setting. And the scale of which really makes you feel like a plucky captain trying to scrape by in a much larger universe. All in all I was looking for a game that would let me feel like I was flying a spaces ship. This did that and more! Not only did it have the gameplay I desired but it did so in a very cool way. As such SG2 has exceeded my expectations. It is perfectly filling a niche in my gaming library which I have been searching to fill. I would highly recomend the game to anyone who has got the space captain itch. Star Citizen is a far way away. But even in Alpha SG2 rocks! And its future looks so promising. All things considered, 9/10. The only downside is a slightly difficult camera. You will get used to it but I feel like it doesn't need to be something that we should have to get used to. An autolock feature which would keep the camera centered on a target and  making the turret mode more responsive with less 'momentum' would be sufficient. But this is just nitpicking. SG2 looks to be a great niche game. And if you are interested it deserves your money and attention. -rm			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game is what X: Rebirth should have been like from the start. Their support staff/community have been quick to reply to my bug report and problems. Which is great! :)			",117,51,7,19,20,0,17

								A really interesting looking game. I like the controls, highly customisable, flying star-fighter style seems equally as easy turret-based capital ship combat( depends only on the style of ship, which can be better suited to either, which is exactly what it should be). HUD and contextual control panel pack a LOT of options and info into a simple, streamlined system. Graphically it's easy on the eye, won't praise it, but there's nothing I can think of that would need pointing out.The thing that would need tweaking is a detail, but impacts the game heavily, since it does with navigation: The waypoints do not say WHAT they point to on the map. Can't tell whether it's my active mission, accepted but not active or a completely new one. To be fixed ASAP, as going from point to point IS the game.The only other minor thing doesn't impact gameplay, but would make it a bit more interesting:*Refine the weapon mounting system. Grouping them together for ship sides is a good idea, but it would be good to have access to all single individual mounts anyway, also showing where they are on the ship, Star Wolves style (since they avoid fireing THROUGH the ship, which is as unexpected as it is brilliant), for enabling a more tactical loadout.*Connecting to the former, make the whole drydock/store/exchange window bigger and clearer. As it is now is not very intuitive and requires spending at least a few minutes just studying it to finally grasp what half the options actually are, much less taking advantage of them.In general, a good game even at this stage, just needs tweak and a good plot implemented. The latter would make a good game a great game.			",42,6,0,13,13,0,21

								Starpoint Gemini 2 a sequel with lots of improvements, while keeping to the free form of the predecessor.This game feels as motivating as Freelancer with its extensive Universe to explore, dozens of ships, different ship classes and moddable loadouts.I did enjoy this game very much, it plays like a cross-over between freelancer (free to explore universe, dozens o ships) and the Star Trek Fleet Command titles (tactical fights, commanding capships).Whether you want to relax mining and trading, or engage in combat missions and piracy, this game will be worth its money.Did i mention you can capture enemy ships by boarding combat? You can!If it flies, it is there for the taking!As a captain your first and foremost crucial choice will be your class.You can either be a Commander, featuring buffs for your fleet, empowered strike craft, retaliatory attacks and defensive boosts.Or you can try to outgun the enemy by becoming a Gunner, who can specialize his offensive power by adding effects like disabling hits to his beam weapons, firing more shells with railguns, adding a higher refire rate to his high damaging plasma canons or boosting his heavy weaponry (schockwave cannons, missiles and torpedos).Last but not least the Engineer, a very versatile class with a lot of debuffs.Ever got tired of fast moving corvettes and gunboats dodging your railgun shots?Just place a Rift-Anomaly and slow them down, then hit 'em hard!Your second decision might be to specialize in a ship-category, as you can boost the efficiency of your ship by spending perk-points granted every 5 levels.What will be your choice? A fast and mobile light ship(gunboat/corvette)A merchantship, to rule the market with your cunning? (transport/freighter/freight-liner)A medium class mobile Warship?

								I haven't played this game much to start, but I can say that for the time I have spent playing it that it is the space sim game I have been looking for. I've tried a few other space sim and space sim-like games such as ""Galaxy on Fire 2"", ""SpaceForce: Rogue Universe"", and (sadly to say) ""X-Rebirth"" and in my opinion and experience I have found them to be full of frustration and disappointment for me.But Starpoint Gemini 2 feels very intuitive. I'm not lost trying to figure out the controls because the tutorial at the beginning clearly and plainly explains them. I've had few issues with bugs or glitches. Iv'e only had to make screen resolution/graphics adjustments in the game settings to prevent slight lag, which I'm sure that it will either be sorted out soon or my pc just needs an upgrade. I am also thankful for the leveling out command so that when I am upside down or slighlty off level I can let the game level me out without me screaming/freaking out. (Which in space, no one can hear you scream... lol!)Also, if you're looking for a good space sim game don't waste your time on other ones like X-Rebirth (especially not X-Rebirth!) because S♥♥♥♥lso has a reliable dev team. So it's not just because of the graphics, controls, etc. that makes the game great, but also because there is support. I've noticed that the devs for this game actually care about user input/feedback and work on the game updates in a timely manner which makes me want to play more and get invovled in the developing.This one is truly promising and fun to play as it is now. I am eager to see this game finished but not rushed and with lots of new options, features, and plenty of storyline/campaigns to play through.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As a long-standing fan of the sci-fi genre, I can say that this is the kind of game I've been looking for. It has everything that any space-fan would enjoy! Anomalies, planets, asteroids, nebulas, and tons more! You can trade, customize your starship, upgrade, and fight against pirates as well as enemy factions. The gameplay is unlike anything I've played before, in a good way, and makes it feel like it's ship-on-ship combat. Fighting in space is dynamic, involved, and intricate so it can be challenging at times but never too difficult. The variety of weapons you can add to your starship also helps to give the game a unique feel in combat. The game has the look and expanse of Eve while remaining a single-player only game. Finally, it is workshop/mod friendly! Personally, I like to cross-over different franchises into my games so it's really cool to see a Federation Starship flying around space and using weapons from Star Trek as a way to create a personalized and awesome experience. Definitely would recommend to any sci-fi fan. Better than a lot of AAA titles I've bought. Keep up the good work!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If your answer is yes BUY the game :)""Did you like Wingcommander games"" Same as aboveBasically this is a game ive been waiting for since Frontiere (Yea the old game we used to play on amiga 500 thats the one yea) The free roam is excellent aswell as the campaign that is way above a normal indie development if this was a release by a top notch company that never fails it would be a 10/10 but frankly this game is worth no less.Developers have listen during the whole process and the community has backed it up with anything you can think of in the steam workshop, Add campaign mod support and i dont think ul ever get dull.I would love to give this game a 10/10 the voice acting is good not superb as for any indie title this has no effect to the game and to be frank the voices only makes the game more interesting ""Love the british accent btw""  and well can make u laugh out loud at times.Gameplay well best looking space sim ever, thats right be amazed crank that gfx up and say goodbye to anything u seen before :D.Im prolly ghonna come back and type more on this review once ive finished the campaign and have more info in general, but buy this game for the love of god, this genre is a minority and if you dont like this specific game for some wierd reason then buy it for the love of all spacers.One thing... game has no multiplayer but im sure that if we nag the devs hard enough they might implent it or hell make starpoint mmo come out who knows..BUY IT ! 10/10(^^ above statement is for people scrolling to last line ^^)			",165,21,2,30,10,0,12

												If you have fond memories of Privateer or Flreelancer, then Starpoint Gemini 2 is for you. If not, but you like traveling the universe, trading and selling (and smuggling) goods, blasting space pirates trying to steal your booty, or even mining asteroids on your downtime; then SG2 is also for you!Controls can be interesting (a bit wonky) at times, and I read there may be some joystick issues, but mouse and keyboard are my choice anyway so I've had no issues. Presentation and graphics look great, and there are some truly amazing views around the galaxy. Combat is fun and ship styles range from giant transports, to carriers with multiple fighter wings. I've got 20+ hours in at this point and while I started the campagin, I'm having more fun just roaming around, trading and upgrading my ship. If you've been looking for a game to scratch the space sim itch, this is a good game for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Freelance offers a real open sandbox environment, The campaign allows for freelance missions and other opportunties if you need a break from the storyline to build up funds or experience.  Great job the all who have put their time and effort into this game!!!			",50,11,0,7,13,0,7

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

								IN THIS GAME You can do missions where you smuggle nudie magazine through pirate filled wastlands full of direlect ships and then defend against said pirates who sent a scout who scanned your ship when you weren't looking and reported back to the pirates further ahead that you had said nudie magazines and siad pirates further ahead launch an ambush from behind a massive freighter wreck from a previous ambush and they take down your shields and breach your hull and send a landing party and thankfully your ship is full of Marines who you hired to protect the nudie magazines at the station where you got the nudie magazines and the pirate landing party is slaughtered and you use a special button to dedicate all available power to your engines and then you leave the pirates in the dust, swerving to avoid asteroids and massive dead ships as you make your way to a remote station where you are greated by friendlys and you dock at the station and sell your nudie magazines and repair your hull and use some extra money to hire an escort ship, so next time, the pirates won't be a problem. 10/10			",49,9,0,5,17,0,15

								About 4 hours in.  I'm liking it enough to spend 4 hours, that says something.   Still playing around, still exploring, and still enjoying.   Very reminisent of Starfleet Command.   For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.   I'm installing and trying it (prequel) now, though I've heard most of the issues were address post release, making for a very enjoyable game.			",429,95,23,80,61,7,97

												Game managed to get my attention for over 50 hours, however in the end it got a tad monotonous and in the end found it to become rather boring for me. It's not to say this is a bad game. I guess the replayability and scope of what you could do got a tad monotonous in the end.For those who want to fly around shooting up ships, defend stations from attack, upgrade to increasingly better ships which you can customize, it's a good game to have. Graphically it was average to above average for me. At the end of the day, I think there were just many other games out there which drew my interest away from this. 5.5/10			",49,2,0,13,28,0,29

												Campaign done, here's *thoughts*.Good:  To start off with, the music in SG2 is pretty great.  That's the first thing that hits me, and it's always good whenever I've booted the game.  A bit more variety would be nice too, after a while of free-roaming, it might get a little stale, but that goes for most games, really.Bad:  The dialog and cutscenes are terrible.  No, really REALLY terrible.  The dialog is cliche, and *hideously* over-acted.  And those accents?  AND NO SKIP??  And the game doesn't really pause during these tedious, cliche, dragging, unskippable cutscenes.  I've seen better cutscenes in pretty much any other game.Good:  Ships.  Mostly.  They're all quite recognizable, and have a lot of variety.  Once you know the ships, you can see a silhouette of most of them from most angles, and be able to ID the specific ship, or at least class.  Nexus ships a couple others in particular are EASY to spot.  Transports less so, but their class is obvious, so no matter.Bad:  Firing arcs.  These are SPACE ships, they should have minimal blind spots.  They are not floating in an ocean, they need coverage above and below.Bad:  There is a single ""best"" weapon, DPS-wise?  The stats show that, anyway.  Beams tickle, the only NPC weapons that seem to DO anything are rails and plasma.  This balance state made it out of early access?Bad:  Map and space design.  Freelancer got this right, and they had space with ""too much"" stuff in it.  The SG2 single solar system is both incredibly too small and insanely crowded.  It would be fine for say, underwater on an ocean planet, but for ""outer space"" it's just crowded.  And the ""movement"" field for dust floating past makes it feel like a fish tank with a broken filter and a bunch of pooping fish.Space Engineers and EVE and to a lesser extent Freelancer made the game FEEL spacious.  SG2 is a lot of LARGE factions crammed into a small fish tank with a bunch of stuff floating in the water.Bad:  I finally managed to get a ST-drive, yay!  ...Only to find that it doesn't actually work?  *All* the things should be working before the EA tag comes off.  At least implemented in some state.			",402,108,4,50,24,3,54

												Once upon a time I played a 2D game called ""Escape Velocity"", a game about being a space guy with a ship, going around the galaxy doing things for money and getting involved in various shenanigens.  It was very open, and it instantly made you feel like you weren't just an actor in a story, but a person in a universe.  Maybe you were some poor shlub with a cheap ship just taking whatever work you could get to make a buck, often risking your neck in the process or maybe eventually you were the coolguy captain with a beastly ship deciding the fate of whatever chunk of space you ended up in.  Either way you would be involved in cool space battles, or running in a panic from a situation you couldn't handle, or spending time carefully picking upgrades for your ship, or even buying a whole new ship ( or dreaming about buying a giant really expensive ship ).Starpoint Gemini 2 is the 3D version of that experience.

								This game is amazingly developed! I dont think i have another space i'd rather play, it gets alot of praise from me for all that its striving to be and all that it has become. Fans of major space games like the X series, EVE, and Freelancer will really find great potential in this game. If you love space games, rpg's and shooting stuff this game is worth looking into.I give this game a 10/10pros to me for this early access are easy to use controls, randomly generated side missions, gamepad support, amazing backgrounds and visuals, assortment of ships, skills and perks, and lastly a developement team that is truely dedicated to bringing an amazing game to its community.The only con would be that the map is not large enough to contain this much awesome.

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												9/10 This game is a total an amazing space simulator. You start off with a tiny little gunship and move up to commanding Dreadnaughts and Carriers. You can command a mini fleet of 2 other warships. The AI is decent, storyline is phenomenal, gameplay is great! I did not feel like there was any grind at all in this game, making money and moving on to the next level and ship was fast and easy. Game was very intuitive with a very helpful UI, biggest complaint is the blech voiceacting and the horrific accents. Other then that the devs are super responsive and made a great game. I own almost 200 games and rarely give out reviews, when I do I either loved the game or hated the heck out of it. I loved this game and if you enjoyed playing Freelancer, Wing Commander Series including Privateer, this is like those games except on crack.			",79,10,0,39,16,0,42

								pros:great ship designs, backgrounds and tunes. no really, the work put into the lighting etc is excellent and for a graphics junkie like me its was stunning.the variation in weapons and system additions is quite impressive for an alpha game as theres plenty to try out (if you can earn the credits)....the controls were easy to get to grips with and the learning curve isnt all that steep, more like a shallow bowl then the eiffel tower.i liked the ability to select missions from the system map as it saved soooo much time with reagrds to the: fly here > dock > mission select > fly there > kill whatever > done.  a novel and great idea and adds more of a flow to the game.mining is ok if thats your thing, point shoot collect as normal, however i couldnt find any indication of whether the rocks i were shooting were full of good stuff or crap...cons:couldnt work out if the shield was full coverage or sectional as in the previous gemini game as angling different sides of the ship would stop hull depletion, well sometimes not everytime. got quite confused.some enemies get stuck in space and dont move apart from shooting back, for some reason this makes them invulnerable too, so you die.currently no save feature in the game options, limited auto save though.combat, and this is my main gripe as its a space combat sim, theres no strafe or reverse!!  if you get to close to an object you have to bounce off it to turn around. increasing distance from targets means flying away from them all the while theyre pounding your ship. avoiding enemy fire is also very hard to do, spinning in a circle helps but only at range as the AI will fire at your current location almost without fail. however up close it just becomes a brawl between either who has the most energy or shield power...the main thing lacking is the fact theres no strafe (moving on the same access from left to right, up and down) the ability to dodge fire is essential in any fight but sadly gemini 2 does not provide this ability. in essence the fighter fights become nothing more then lancing, flying at each other trying to hit the enemy until you are in close, see above as to why this is bad... i suppose constantly changing the power distribution from shields to weapons to speed could help and some peeps will like that but i prefer flying by the seat of my pants and dodging for that true dogfighter feeling.furthermore, i loved the beam weapons, very powerful with exceptional rangedownsides, very power hungry and can empty your charge in seconds plus theres no zoom feature so no way of knowing if your shots are hitting the target until the enemies hull depletes and as previously stated power to the weapons depletes fast!!the only bug ive encountered so far was when the game freezes mid flight, not annoying yet as reminisent to PS1 games and their ""loading next area"" moments.overall for an alpha its quite enjoyable, very straight forward missions and great visuals.

								I am using the gunner class freeroaming the map which is pretty big , i like to bounty hunt those big marks for the credit pay outs.Combat has a very usefull auto fire or you can choose to manual fire, if you wish you can order fire on the systems of the target or just general hits.Favourite ship class is  the destroyer's but i'm currently using a carrier usefull for exploring when things get heavy launch the fighters.I honestly think this game has some real potential and have really enjoyed what they have done so far i look forward to them making the single player aspects.The market and trading and ultra silly cost of travelling the trade lanes needs a good sorting though but i'm sure they will iron out those minor things.Hint use T-Drives to jump to get to destinations.Found a pass that makes using the trade gates free to use anywhere very handy for trading i must have missed this on my first character it cost 250k credits but you will make it back eventually.Flight consists of mouse controll and keyboard activated specials allthough most of the special can be activated via the middle mouse  button, graphically it reminds me of freelancer space backgrounds. And it has some nice customization you can do to personlise your ship with unique colours and markings and abillity to name your ship.Overall i have to say i would recommend and seriously look forward to the up comming content  and i'm sure this game will give you plenty of hours of solid fun , just like freelancer did !Also there is an active mod community and the Devs seem active, these are promising signs for life beyond the single player mode and game life in the  long run.

It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is hours of constant enjoyment. I've been wanting a great space simulator for years and this fills that gap. Space combat ranges from you being overwhelmingly powerful and slaughtering a weaker enemy convoy, to suddenly being completely outmatched as hordes of enemy fleets warp in. You'll go from shifting your power-flow to fully charge your weapons; unleashing torrents of weapon-fire and watching enemy ships violently explode, to frantically diverting power to your shields and engines, cutting power from your weapon-batteries to overcharge your engines and jettison yourself free from the firestorm. The space combat, environment, and ships are all wonderful and deserve high praise. The only downfall is the narrative in the story mode. My only noted negative is that the plot dialogue is very poorly written: conversations are written with very simplistic wording, adding unnecessary filler dialogue in the middle of a conversation. The characters have no expression and sitting through the dialogue moments are frustrating to even hear the characters speak. All the character interactions are not written as real conversations, monologues occur at inappropriate times. A complete re-writing of the entire game's plot narrative (by someone with writing experience) would make the game perfect. 8.5/10			",81,4,0,8,4,0,25

								Edit: So here we are after full release.In all honesty, the story is not presented in a manner I really find easily accessable, which is too bad but survivable. Besides that, everything I was told would be in this game is here, and all the fun I saw coming back in EA is also here. This is early access done right.In case you haven't read any other reviews, the game is very similar to EVE or X3 in sandbox mode. In story mode it feels quite a bit more linear, but as I said, this is simply because the method of presentation is just not my style, and you may find it's exactly what you like.Still, lots of fun, lots of freedom, and lots of beautiful, beautiful space in which to make your own story. Good use of your money if you like spaceship combat/trader/adventure sims.Original reviews:Even in beta, this is a good game. Not only is the game very playable, but the graphics are good and I personally find even the beta to be more stable and friendly to my recommended-spec rig than many full releases of other games I've played. Great forum community too and the devs are very open to feedback. There is not quite enough to do yet for freeroam to be worth $30,  but if you are reading this after the full release, then you should buy this!EDIT:Worth noting that the devs are so active on this that right now, only a few weeks after writing the initial review, enough stuff has been finalized or added to the current beta to probably make it worth your $30.

								It's been ages since we've had an excellent free roam space roleplaying game.  While in the current early alpha stage gameplay focuses more on ""make stuff asplode"" rather than ""trade for all the things"", the action gameplay that's already there is right at home with such greats as Starfleet Command paired with the frenetic nature of Freelancer.  Even if you aren't a sci-fi geek (EXCELSIOR!), I'm willing to bet that once you get past the learning curve you'll absolutely love this.Where Starpoint Gemini 1 was rough around the edges and everyone talked in broken English that would make even the European Union cringe, this is a finely-polished brilliant-cut gemstone with actual English-as-a-first-language voice actors -- so if you're expecting your ears to bleed, then you're wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.Also, power-to-engines.  Power-to-engines, omigod, power-to-engines.  Exclam, like, wow, hashtag awesome.  Or whatever the kids are saying these days.			",423,100,23,66,47,2,87

It plays very well. I've not discovered anything that resembles a game-breaking bug, although there may be an issue with some ""deliver cargo"" missions - in that the briefing does not really explain where and what to go/do to complete them. However, clicking the mission-markers on the map and reading their info, you can usually work them out.If you like games like Elite, and Wing Commander, this is a game to keep an eye on, if not buy!

												Think of Star Trek Online and X3 had a baby, this is their child...Fun and addicting gameplay, tough economy giving a sense of pride in the ship you can afford, everything scales nicely. Outstanding Graphics, weapon effects and sounds. plenty of mods and Steam workshop mods.If you enjoy X rebirth, X3, EVE, STO and you don't own this game you are missing out big time!Just make sure you get it when you have a few hours to spare, you wont want to leave your seat!

												Game managed to get my attention for over 50 hours, however in the end it got a tad monotonous and in the end found it to become rather boring for me. It's not to say this is a bad game. I guess the replayability and scope of what you could do got a tad monotonous in the end.For those who want to fly around shooting up ships, defend stations from attack, upgrade to increasingly better ships which you can customize, it's a good game to have. Graphically it was average to above average for me. At the end of the day, I think there were just many other games out there which drew my interest away from this. 5.5/10			",49,2,0,13,28,0,29

												Once upon a time I played a 2D game called ""Escape Velocity"", a game about being a space guy with a ship, going around the galaxy doing things for money and getting involved in various shenanigens.  It was very open, and it instantly made you feel like you weren't just an actor in a story, but a person in a universe.  Maybe you were some poor shlub with a cheap ship just taking whatever work you could get to make a buck, often risking your neck in the process or maybe eventually you were the coolguy captain with a beastly ship deciding the fate of whatever chunk of space you ended up in.  Either way you would be involved in cool space battles, or running in a panic from a situation you couldn't handle, or spending time carefully picking upgrades for your ship, or even buying a whole new ship ( or dreaming about buying a giant really expensive ship ).Starpoint Gemini 2 is the 3D version of that experience.

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i love flying around in space with no loads, but why cant we be in a solar system with a star in the middle and planets going around it, as far as we know thats how all solar systems work, this seems like just random rogue planets totally static in space. minor complaint tho its a great game already and its not even got main missions or even side missions but freelancing is what i wanna do anyway so im loving it, flying between planets and space stations, i just wish the map was the size of the actual universe... is that too much to ask? :)   for me its been a hit amongst a series of bad purchases, its really all im playing right now. i got it for 33% off and it was def worth that for me.   Edit: looks like it is more of a solar system than it looked like early on, the suns help. would be great to get the whole thing spinning, newtonian? capurnican? you know what i mean. maybe for starpoint gemini 3.

												A ""Must have"" for any Space Sim fan, SPG2 manage to deliver that ""freelanceresque"" feeling I've been looking for since... well FL itself. The game still have some things to be ironed out, like ship and weapon balance, trade and mining, and some minor bugs, but the devs are very active and truly listening to the community feedback. With some tweaks here and there this game could be a true successor to FL.You'll get sucked in by the wonderful surroundings, the ambient music, and the attention and love the small team of devs is putting into the game.If you loved Freelancer, you'll love Starpoint Gemini 2.

												I bought this game during a Steam sale not expecting too much of it, but it's had me hooked for weeks now. It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!The game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.The only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects. The latter look really poorly done compared to the sleek and smooth ship designs, explosions and absolutely beautiful galaxy you travel through.Oh, and the main menu music alone could have made me buy this game, just thought I'd mention that too.

												Bought this game in Early Access ~3 years ago.  Been playing it off an on.  I doubt I'll ever get over 200 hours but that doesn't mean I don't like the game.  It's amazing seeing how barebones it was back then come to life - as in, freelance missions gave you like 1000 credits and a few dozen XP. Half of the interface was useless and many things were still placeholders.  It's neat to come across a large battle and swoop in to help or to loot.Quick list of pros/cons+Beautiful environment+Living world+SPACESHIPS!+SPACESTATIONS!+Many ways to get money/XP-I have zero interest in the Campaign (don't let that sway you; just a personal preference)-In sandbox mode, it doesn't feel as though you're a big part of the solar system, which makes sense. I guess what I was looking for in this game won't be realized until Starpoint Gemini: Warlords.-Damn PTE disrupting pirates.-A few things are underexplained.-Ship size difference is not noticeable enough and was a complaint since Early Access.

												Finally, a game that scratches my decade-long Freelancer itch.But first, a disclaimer. While no longer an Early Access title, Starpoint Gemini 2 - as of October 2014 - is not quite the finished article. The game still has a number of items turned off in the options menu. Certain gameplay features seem to be half-finished, and the AI does not seem to be taking advantage of all the tools available in combat. In fact, many newcomers are bound to be turned off by the obtuse UI design and the text-heavy, non-interactive tutorials that spit out seemingly unending streams of text on things they have no idea about.Get past the initial frustrations, however, and you will find an absolute gem of a timesink. SG2 nails the three key elements of a good space sim: simple controls, a massive universe full of activities, and a million paths to success on your own terms. Starting off in a tiny gunship and a poorly-voiced campaign mission, you are quickly set loose and given freedom to roam the absolutely gigantic map to mine, trade, explore and fight to your heart's content. Veteran X players may be disappointed by the comparatively static world, limited fleet building options and inability to set up your own industrial empire in the stars, but everyone else should be more than satisfied with the wealth of choices at hand. This is more than worth it at full price, and absolutely unmissable in a sale.			",272,143,16,34,23,3,38

												This game is fun for a little while but there's so little variation it gets very tedious, which is a shame becuase the game mechanics are good.Cons:There are three quests you can do: 1)Go here and kill these guys.2)Go here and scan this anomaly.3)Go here and take stuff over there.In order to make money you can either grind for days ferrying junk around, or buy a few upgrades for your crew and start hijacking enemy ships.  The former will take hours before you can buy your next ship, the latter will take minutes.  Rinse and repeat and winthin one afternoon you have the biggest, baddest ship with all the best hardware.There's no variation across the map: each sector feels identical.  I guess in real life the universe is very homogenous but you probably shouldn't use WMAP as your basis for a space RPG.The voice acting is pretty dull.  You can tell the actors aren't at all enthused by the story and nor was I.Pros:You can adjust the power balance of your shelds, weapons and engines, giving you a more hands on approach to aggresion, defence and running away.Each weapon and shield module has its own power and can be drained if over taxed during a fight, forcing you to keep manouvering to keep your better charged side towards the enemy.  This makes the big lumbering ships more interesting to play.You can take your unstoppable death machine, paint it shiny pink and name it ""Winnie the Pooh"".Summary:The game world is too big and too bland.  If the devs had put the effort into writing a better story and varying the world rather than inflating it, this game could be great.  Otherwise it feels more like work than fun.

												As much as I want to like this game, I cannot.  Plagued with bugs that make it completely unplayable on half of my systems, I regret spending the money on this.  Windowed mode made it so I can't select menu items and had to delete the config file.  Attempting to turn on the gamepad support for my wired 360 controller made it completely impossible for me to actually select a menu item to start a game change settings, or even exit the game, so I had to alt+f4 out of the game.  The games graphics settings are ridiculous.  My systems all far outpace the requirements for this game, but only a couple of them will actually run the game smoothly.  I won't say there are better games out there that have the same feel as the first Starpoint Gemini, a game I love to play, but this game was just a disappointment and buggy mess.  Iceberg should be ashamed of releasing this game in this state.			",1577,664,50,253,219,17,302

												What i liked:- Multiple options for combat (capture, shoot them up, cloaked assisn)- Vast universe with multiple factions- Many interesting travel options (jumpgates, gravity anomalies, wormholes, speed boosters and jumpdrive)What i disliked:- Poor storyline and terrible voiceacting- Horrid combat balance based on owned ship (if you have a tiny gunship and upgrade to a corvette or a frigate, suddenly all the enemies upgrade equally and you get blasted to smitherines in a matter of seconds)- Enemy difficulty based on player level (why on earth would i take a +xp perk - if i want increased difficulty i just do so in the option menu)- Due to scaling enemies almost instantly have many more troops in their ship than you can hope to send, which makes the troop capture option obsolete- Sinle use boost.. make them cost more (-> multiuse with cooldown) and dont make me run around half the universe looking for the ones i use- Class based skills - useless at best, let me at least replace them with usable items (boosts)SummaryI might give this game a thumbs up once balancing issues have been adressed and class skills make a difference.

												As a sequal to Starpoint Gemini it's beginning to look good... In a nutshell, they did a great job on the graphics and the 3rd dimension in the 3D environment can now actually be used. They also took away the seperate sectors and merged them into 1, with sometimes undesirable lag but no more loading screens and the feel of a huge area to play around in. Big plus there.The gameplay has suffered greatly though, as you can no longer buy/sell individual ship systems as would in the previous game, since a somewhat different system has been employed, but worse yet, there no longer is a significant subsystem targeting system, but from what I understand that is yet to be implemented.Bare in mind though that this is still in Beta when this was written, but it should give a general idea about what happened. With Starpoint Gemini in mind, I am a little bit more optimistic compared to my last edit. I did love that interface, but that's gone...			",333,99,6,45,106,2,55

								This game has alot of potential, it's important that it exercises this potential to be something as great as Freelancer or X3 Reuinion. I've really enjoyed my time spent in the game so far, and hope that gets better.			",205,9,2,23,12,1,39

								needs shorter battle times, starting out i took on 7 crusiers at once and won... in the starting ship...that should not happen.to get money you HAVE to steal ships and tow, so there isnt much diversity to go into mining, looting, ect, cuz its petty chump change in comparision and its easy to capture ships.

								Taxi missions are dumb, how do i fly 50,000 miles or whatever it would take like a RL whole day I dont get it! A campaign is seriously needed to teach the game a bit better as I really have no idea what I'm doing. Flying around farming meteorites and blowing up anything that's red is pretty fun though. Should be fun to see what comes with the whole game.			",29,6,0,28,10,0,5

												Pardon the format of my review, I am not formatting it very well.I bought Starpoint Gemini a couple of years back and just could not get into it.  I had put Starpoint Gemini 2 on my wishlist, hoping for a sale.  So I recently bought it on sale and I am find the freeroam mode very satisfying.I started out mining asteroids, then doing missions and all the while figuring out the different mechanisms for the game.  I had googled some ""Getting started"" guides and found out that boarding and selling ships was where most money could be made.  I had changed the game mode to easy, I wanted to check out all the different ships the game has to offer without too much of a struggle.   There is a clear progression with the choice of ships and going from your beginner Gunship and ending up with a Dreadnought is very satisfying.   The controls are a lot like Freelancer. Selling ships and taking out the most wanted from the Bounty board is a sure way to get rich fast.  There are different ""zones"" near friendly space stations that offer baddies from the different factions that are ideal for getting xp and capturing ships and dragging them to the spacestation.   Troopers are the currency that allow you to capture ships, space stations run out of them and then you have to go look for them somewhere else or wait until the space station has a new shipment of them.  I love the map with all the different factions and things to discover, there are structures called artefact vaults where you can collect an artefact, the objective is to collect all 50.  Some special kills (usually baddies from the most wanted board) yield unique weapons with better than average stats and some missions/kills yield   blueprint for unique equipment.  Most subsystems of  your ship can changed with upgrades that give bonuses.  You also can hire different officers that give bonuses. Furthermore once you reach a certain level,  you can hire mercs that join you so you end up with a little fleet.The combination of different ships (70 apparently), different officers, skills, perks, mercs and equipment and the huge map makes this game a great experience for me. I enjoy the grind of doing missions and capturing ships.   Overall a great Elite clone.  The story is a little thin and the game could use some world-lore detailing the history of the various factions beyond the news bulletins, something like the books in the Elder Scroll games would be nice. Also, the capture/trooper mechanic could be reworked a little, I never understand why some of my troopers still have to die when they are capturing an empty enemy ship.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I got this on sale so my review might be skewed a tad but... HOLY SH*T! A vast galaxy filled with anomolies & hazards to navigate & explore anyway you see fit! Join a faction & mine asteroids for resources & make money! Or join the pirates & take over other ships for your own fleet (or sell them off) for more money! Or go freelance & complete missions for EVERYONE ranging from assasinations to station repair, Escorts & station defense to all round station assault! For bonus money! Or play a dashing rogue! Smuggle illegal contraband into neighboring systems-F*ck the establishment! For even MORE money! With enough weapons & variables to keep you armed & equipped well into the eventual heat-death of the universe, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a fantastic game. It's an absolute must-have when it goes on sale.  However,If I have one proper complaint though it's the voice acting for the single player missions. Long story short, it's bad. Not like Resident Evil cheesy jill sandwich master of unlocking good-bad, it's just bad. Like, people reading off a script for the first time bad. No soul. Ginger.But for all the stuff this game offers, this is easily forgiven. Starpoint Gemini 2, people.BUY IT.			",307,26,4,29,11,1,16

												This is my impression of the game after about 39 hours of play. This game is mostly fun, as a game like this can be “fun”. This is a space simulation and as such, there is a lot of “space”. Moving from one place to another is a test of patience. It is very nice to look at and the music background/atmosphere is gorgeous; I can just listen to this game for hours. Unfortunately, the main story is not very interesting (after having done a few missions, I don’t even know what it is about). I am currently at level 17 but haven’t advanced much in the story because I don’t have any incentive to do so, or I don’t care for the story.I am mostly having fun exploring, mining, capturing ships and selling them to make money, because the game doesn’t give you much of that and selling ships is the best and the fastest way to make money. There doesn’t seem to any real purpose in this game; you just go around doing stuff that, ultimately, has no purpose. This is a nice game to play if you know what you are getting into. But I should point out that this is not a fast game to play so you need to have lots of time and patience on your hands. ",24,0,0,4,0,0,1

												Great game, one of the best, I should put as ""not recommend"" because of compatibility issues with some graphics cards that are the economic reality of my country because we can not pay for here more than US $ 70 in a graphics card, because boards $ 300 arrive at the price of a car close to $ 1600.If not for such technical misfortunes would have kept the game but the developer contacted me, which I found surprising, made some changes and even helped me in configuration, but unfortunately the problem persisted.I'd love to stay with the game but unfortunately I can not, maybe in the near future, even with the few minutes I played could delight me with the quality.I'll keep an eye on the game waiting for an update.Thank you all for support.

												Not bad at all, but it's no Freelancer or Eve Online. It's worth playing, but it's got a lot of bugs, a universal reputation system which annoys the crap out of me (you're either a good guy or a bad guy, rather than individual factions liking or disliking you to individual degrees.) It's all one star system - a very full star system, more full than in Freelancer or Eve, but just one rather than a galaxy. Long, poorly voiced, voice overs that can't be skipped. I could go on, but meh.Buy it if it's on sale and try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has it all. Amazing graphics, captivating and addictive gameplay. NPC (Non Pussification Combat) battles are a challenge. I really like the map and enjoy the Main and side quest. Earning credits and acquiring ships is achievable. Plus there are over 100 mods to make the game that much more personalized. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of space sim and the like.			",54,6,1,6,2,0,2

												I played Elite: Dangerous, then X3AP, then X:Rebirth, went back to X3AP and finally I stumbled on Starpoint Gemini 2. How I came to this game? In elite, I was fascinated by the cool-looking fighters, the dog-fighting with HOTAS controller and hype of Horizon. I soon realised the game was time-consuming and i was unable to accomplish as much as I would expected. I loaded up X3 (I bought during a steam sale) and started playing. This game also had dog-fighting, tons of ship classes but the main draw was the scope and depth of the game. At the midpoint, I coud lead a wing of fighters, setup space stations and managed a fleet of trading freighters. It was really cool but I spent way too much time and the graphics were not as cool. I hopped over to X: Rebirth and got a headache navigating in the engine. I hopped back to X3 for a short while and finally got to SPG2.SPG2 is a Space-Theme ARPG. In free-roam, you control a ship and navigate through a gigantic starchart map. You can pick up alot space-thremed missions, mine asteroids, trade between space stations and planets, be a pirate or police. It cover much of everything you can think of in a space sim game but to a limited depth. I won't not say it is a shallow game because you have a pretty good idea of what a space sim would be like after playing this game.+ Tons of playable ships + Beautiful ship designs+ Space combat is flashy and exciting. + Tons of things to do, you won't get bored of things to do - Limited functionality in several aspect of a typical space sim game - Reputation system, licences and bulletin news interface seems like a mere after-thought - Shield system is surprisingly 2 dimensional - No real space dogfighting - It is definitely not SPG1 or starfleet command - I had this feeling it is designed to be played on consoles since it is evidently simplified, not a good thing for PC players.This game shines when you play at it as a ARPG in a space theme setting and not as a typical space sim. Its greatness comes from the sum of all the parts it has to offer. For its vast contents and production value, I disagree it is a poor man's Free Space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I lost interest in the game although it's quite decent. I tried all type of missions, trading, exploring etc., upgrade ship and weapons. IMHO it needs 3 things..1.) balancing: - railgun weapons are far better than all weapon types (beam, plasma)- some red (high-lvl) missions are easy, got killed on some easy ones (low-lvl)2.) more deep mechanics- trading very stupid (although very effective to earn money till ~lvl10)3.) removing first ?LGM? screen when launching game! - it's very loud forcing me to throw my headpones from my ears in instanceI recommend this game for all space-sim-explorer-lovers not for common player looking for something new..

												Had to write a review because I looked and saw that this game was getting really negative reviews. I think that most of these come from skewed expectations. The game, is fantastic, but not for everyone. If you are expecting an Eve style game: turn around and walk away. If you are expecting an Elite: Dangerous style of game: turn around and walk the other way. If you are expecting a Freelancer style game: then come right on in and enjoy the ride. I'm a pretty big space junkie, even bleeding into the mobile area *gag reflex*, I know. But when I'm not playing some space game on my PC, I'm playing Galaxy on Fire on my phone. As far as the game goes don't expect much ""dogfight"" type flying and combat. While there is a small amount of that in the early game, very quickly it turns into a game with battleships and cruisers, where the tactic is to broadside your adversary rather than run at him head on. Being that it is in space, that type of combat is amplified tenfold. Think of a great conflict with you in your dreadnought vs 3 other battleships. You launch fighters and prepare for combat. Being that this is space one of the battleships flys above you, so you rotate your ship so that your port side is now facing the underside of his ship, leaving you with a perfect angle of attack. If that doesn't sound awesome to you than this game is now for you.			",76,9,2,10,5,0,12

												I'm going to try to make this as concise and clear as possible but I have a lot to say. Also note I have not played the main campagn yet although I've put around 30 hours into the sandbox mode.Pros: SG2 has a huge universe with a cool backstory that can be read on the wiki. This game allows you to change alignments based on your actions. For the first 10 hours I was just trying to get to the point where I can strike out on my own as a pirate but ended up feeling that I wouldn't want to betray the people I had been helping the whole time. I'm not RPing as a bounty hunter, hunting down all criminals with a bounty on their head. It's pretty great.The art direction is absolutely amazing. So much so that I got a SG2 background for my desktop. I feel like it really grasps the true beauty of space. The music is deep and emersive and it changes based on the situation in a smooth manner. Cons: The learning curve was pretty tough in the beginning. There was a tutorial but it was kind of a huge wall of text after another.Conclusion: This is a truly amazing game. I wish these devs had an EA budget so they could make even more content. I will definitely be purchasing Starpoint Gemini 3.			",115,17,2,41,32,0,55

												This is my methadone to keep me going until Star Citizen is out.TLDR: It's very relaxing and enjoyable to roam around popping pirate ships, and scooping up their loot while exploring each hex.Theres some nice progression with levels earning you skills and perks to your character.  Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.Exploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.I wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.Combat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle. Currently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.

												""Full PTE ahead! Oh wait, Captain there's something wrong..""Honestly, I like it. It's a decent game, it has a strong core and does have entertaining values inside of it. It's pretty, runs well on my AMD machine, and keeps you at least somewhat busy. However, there are some very odd issues and difficulties I have with the game, I'll list them below.Game is too light; When I say this, I mean that the game is not that deep. The statistics for ships is relegated to a few simple stats (such as hull, cargo and crew). I feel that if I'm going to be driving around a big ship, I'd wanna know more about what's going on with it's internal systems. What makes ship A better than ship B? Well look at hull, cargo and troop capacity. That's it. Where's my statistics? Scaling for ship size; This is actually a big complaint. The ships don't look..big. They don't have imposing statures or good camera angles. They don't refelct how big (or small) they actually are. I have a small gunship and I'll go past ships marked as frigates or destroyer and I can't tell a size difference. That makes no sense to me. Sure, if I get within ""I'll melt you with point blank lasers range"" I'll notice a very small difference, but otherwise it's hard to tell. Reminds me of Star Trek (the show).Lots of loot, nothing to do with it; There's a plethora of loot in the game. Computers, drugs, minerals and ores. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SELL THEM. You can't craft, you can't allocate them for energy on the ship, they are just fluff. They don't have any real impact on the game other than that they can be sold (and what's worse, caputring enemy ships is far more benificial). I wish there was an in depth crafting system, something. Notifications; The game does not notify you when you pick up loot, meaning, that when I loot a ship with the ""auto loot"" function, it does not tell me what I got! I have to go into my menues and see what was put in. A prime example of how this is bad. I looted a big ship once, got an AMAZING missle system. I didn't know I had it, it never notified me. So I spent 250,000 credits on a missle system (worse by the way) and then, while equping it, realized I had the other one. Bye bye money! Camera angles; Not dynamic, not good. No cockpit view. Sadface.No real interaction with the universe; I will have to state, this is one of my biggest issues. Doing freelance quests gives you no satisfaction. When I'm picking up a VIP to transport, no chat initiates. It's a simple grab and go. Even the quest text is shallow. ""Pick up A, drop off at B."" There's no context as to what I'm doing this for. When I have a mission to go kill some pirate, there's nothing to it. It's just ""We of the Such-and-such want Pirate dead"". That's it! There's no interaction with the universe around you, it's all text and empty requests. You can't even interact with the ships system officers!! There's never a point where I feel truly a part of a living organism, I feel like the ONLY living organism in the game.Difficulty; Thus far, it makes no sense. I'll take on a quest to kill a pirate that's my level. Then I'll go to said zone and find that the pirate has two or more friends and he himself is listed as ""Impossible"" for my skill level. WHY? The game never notified me on what gear I should have when. The ships I'm going up against are a cool 2-10 MILLION credits, where as in my entire game play, dedicating time to making credits, I've made roughtly 800,000 at most, at one time. I read a forum post stating that some people ran into a sinkhole of difficulty, they leveled up too fast and the game scaled their enemies up too high, too quick. My point is, leveling should be more fluid and less wreckless. Don't allow me to level up to level 20 when I can't afford/fight level 20 ranked ships. EXP needs to be reworked, slow down leveling. Class ""System""; It's strait forward and dull. No real custiomization other than ""Put point here, see marginal benifits"". It's like old school WoW. Funny enough above I listed the games not deep, but it has a +% based level system. That's okay, I get it. But my skills don't feel impact, even against trivial ranked enemies, they still melt through my shield and kill me.I could go on, there's a lot to complain about with this game. However, give it a shot. If you really like space-sandbox-adventure action, you can't go wrong here. But there's better out there. ""General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it.""			",52,9,0,10,3,0,7

												To be honest, I am impressed. Good graphics, fun battles, large base of ships and weapons. It was money well spent.Game is stable, which, lately is not that common for games of this size. I haven't nodist major bugs.If you liked Freelancer, You will like this title. On the other end of spectrum, this is not X saga. It is not as complicated or deep. It is fun shooter, with options to mine, trade, change ships and thier equipment,  but it is not an empire building game.Campaing is ok, but I wasn't really waiting to find out what will happen next. On the other hand it is only small part of the game. Just flying around and blowing pirates, doing quests, and getting money for upgrades and new ships is fun in it self.There are some minor AI issues: - Your mercenaries will follow you... unless you decide to jump in any way (t-drive, wormhole, gate). They will stay there and wait. This is not really a problem, as for the most part of the game, they are not needed anyway.- Your turrets in auto mode and your fighters will not engage enemy sometimes in campaign missions. Outside missions everything is fine though, and issues was in maybe 3 missions.I haven't nodist anything more serious.All in all, it is a good buy.			",131,15,4,23,28,1,54

												I am really enjoying this game.  To be fair, it has bugs, but overall it is fairly solid.  I used to play EVE Online for several years after it first came out and SG2 does have a *similar* feel.  The controls can be awkward at first, but after you make some fine-tuning on your own it becomes just as intuitive as any other mouse and keyboard based sim.  Note that in the last week+ since it came on steam, the community has been growing rapidly and there is a ton of good information to help new players adjust the game to fit their playstyle in this kind of sim.  If you are having difficulty, please look there and see if someone can help!One of the biggest factors for me is that the devs are continuously fixing the small things *and* the big picture as well.I'm excited to see where the game will go in the future...

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[Disclosure: Game copy purchased with own money]Quick update for my review.The game has continued to be supported with cheep DLC (with a free one on its way soon) and continued bug fixes and updates for controller support etc form the team. If your still on the fence (somehow) When I got this, I didn't buy a game... I just lent 10 new friends some money. Best wishes LGM teamFull launch review:1 Year in E/A It doesn't feel like it at all. Its went so fast and so smoothly I hardly noticed it, though looking back you could be forgiven for thinking the alpha/beta releases are a different monster from the full, and you'd be right. Shortly after typing this I shall be making a brand new ""from the start"" video and stick the link here. Check it out whydontcha?Also if it wasn't obvious already I whole heartedly 100% recommend this game. It oozes polish and shines as bright as Gemini's twin suns thanks to everyone's (with a special thanks to the early access-ors without whom this probably wouldn't have been half as good as a game that it is) hard work and dedication. Excellent Job Team SG2 (LGM, Iceberg Interactive, Steam and of course the Early Access-ors)Early Access Review begins: Despite this game being in alpha, it plays very well and is extremely fun. There is lots of work still to be done to it for sure but with and active community and devs that engage with their customers this is sure to be one of the best space sims around.Defos worth the price, was worth it back when it was in alpha, doubly so nowIf your still not sure feel free to check out my lets play on the game here:

												This space simulation starts off a little slow but is a lot of fun once you get up and running. Think of it as a simplified version of the X series.  There seems to be a lot of things that aren't quite finished or shallow, but the developers have been quite activate in adding new content so far.  At this time, theres enough content to get about 25-35 hours worth out of this title at a minimum. Its very sandbox-y with an average story thrown on top.  The storyline itself was interesting, but the voice acting was pretty awful.  All in all, I'd recommend it only if you are into space sim games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll cover the game, but first I need to talk about the developers.This game is helmed by the best company/team I've ever encountered in a long time. They work & worked very hard on this SG2 which was even a joy to play incomplete in the earlier betas - constantly (like to the point of how do you get any work done?) reading, replying, and participating in forum discussions. They entertain ideas for how to approach planned features & possiblities of integrating new ones. This game is far from done in their eyes, and we are all excited to see how SG2 evolves over the long run.Oh yeah, the game: The graphics are awesome. The difficulty is varied enough to appeal to everyone (I'm in the extreme club, and find it quite challenging at times). You feel the constant itch to explore as available ship components, slot enhancements, crew officers, mercenaries, and new ship models differ between areas - and buying a ship direct from the manufacturer is cheaper than buying 3rd party from a different faction.Don't want to or can't buy a ship (because that faction hates you)? Grind rep and switch sides, or just board and capture the ship for yourself. Want to mine asteroid fields? You can do that. Want to capture ships and sell them for millions? You can do that too. Want to hunt down obsure achievements? They're here.And this game is only going to get better.Positive+ Awesome community+ Gameplay rewarding proper piloting+ Mod support (check out sound, graphics, and UI mods)+ Craftable rare drops (blueprints) that feel as good in use as they are frustrating to get+ Power management+ Huge map+ Wormholes!+ Great music+ Interesting campaign storylineNeutral+/- Slow start - it's very hard to begin classing up in ships, especially for new players. There are guides, but there is a bit of a grind. I like the payoff feeling from earning your way. Others will just go get a mod that gives them 1 billion credits. I suggest learning.Negative- Voice acting (there is a mod that improves a bit).- Illegal goods priced roughly equivalent to expensive legal goods.- Trade market prices could be more varied for better profits.- Few factors past pool numbers for shields and hulls.- Unrealistic aggro (2 gunships will ""think"" they can take on your dreadnought and rip you out of cruise speed).

												When i first tryed this game it didn't have a story mode it just had the sandbox mode, now i have been playing the story mode and i like the game, there isn't a lot of games i will play for hours on end without a story mode. The story in the game isn't the best but it gives you the out line and everything and you can do the story mission on your own time and do other things you want to do like trading of killing or capturing ships and than selling the ships or put them in your port, Mining or gas mining or side missions or a lot of little missions from different companys. The controls are supper easy for me at less i use the mouse 90% of the time. i have taking some pictures of the game. When you start off save your money for your first few ships is hard to do but its fun to do. As it sits at 32.4 hours in the game i have almost 50mil saved. The ranking system in the game it like every 5 or so levels you go up your rank goes up, I'm almost level 35 as of the time i posted this.			",113,12,6,25,39,0,17

												I had fun tooling in this game.  It's got a good sense of progression, and it's not exactly lacking in depth or scope. One complaint is that it's not as polished as it could be.  Released in 2014, you can tell a lot of great art and design work was put into this game but it's already starting to show it's age.  I personally compare it to a game like Elite Dangerous, which has a high amount of finish and looks great, but is ultimately a very boring game which lacks depth and has a very frustratingingly long grinding progression. Starpoint Gemini on the other hand, has better pacing.  While it may not be as technically complex or broad in scale, it's a good break as a single player game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

( yea like in EVE i do pirate alot poor merchants )there are more stuffs, from storyline, choices of a gameplay, etc. i wont bore u guys with that.game is worth the money, it can easy make u to spend 100+ hrs in it. graphic even on low looks awesome, no FPS drops.overall i would give this game a solid 8/10 on freedom of choice/sandbox/visualhope i helped someone :)			",64,8,0,21,16,0,22

								I have been looking for a mission/take your time/no poxy scenario game for a while now and this delivers.  It does, however, take a bit of time to get into the game and used to the control system (I kept shooting at friendlies by clicking the wrong mouse button).  But if you persevere its defintaely worth the wait.  Although still in Beta and without a campaign mode it is worth the money.  This is the first game I've played where you actually feel like other people are aboard your ship helping you - normally its do everything yourself, from steer, to fire to damage control - whereas with SG2 you can do as much or as little as you wish.

												I originally purchased this game during Early Access and have not been disappointed with the released product.  This title is a fine choice for those who enjoy an RPG in which one can be a starship captain.  With a wide variety of ships and missions, as well as Steam Workshop integration, there is a great deal of replayability.Having stated that, I recommend purchasing this game on sale, as the retail price is a bit steep.  I have noticed some minor graphical bugs, but nothing I would consider a ""show stopper"".  If you enjoy space captain RPG's with replayability, I recommend considering this particular title.

								Covers areas that the big boys in space simulations seem to be leaving behind. Quite a nice game and very playable. At the moment includes only one scenario - free roam- but that has a ton of stuff to do in its own right. freelance missions as areas of the gemini sector are opened(though these could pay better), mining, bounty hunting, trading and combat. healthy traffic all round means you dont quite feel alone as in most space sims of this scope. Brilliant ship design, all round good graphics and effects and nice sound which does a greta job of immersing the player.

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥  Ok this game is going to be very good when it's done but at the moment it is completely unplayable.  I have a very good P.C with 12gb of RAM that runs everything else I have at maximum settings with no problem.  When I first downloaded and started the game it was working reasonably well with only the slightest lag when I approached different bases and planets.  As soon as I started getting into battles with other ships the frame rate dropped down to what I swear must have been 2fps!  Frequently it would just freeze for 5 or 10 seconds straight before moving again!  I of course decided to reduce all of my graphic settings down to minimum in the hopes of speeding up the frames.  It made no difference at all!  Maybe not everyone is having this same problem but trust me my P.C should be more than adequate to run this!Besides this though the game is visually very cool and the combat is enjoyable.  They're doing a lot of things right I just wish I was able to actually play it properly right now.(update): After starting the game again today it has been working much better for the time being.  Something strange did happen however.  I suddenly had an extra 5 million credits when I had only had about $9000 when I had quit previously.  Furthermore I didn't even make 5 million credits in my first 2 hours of gameplay.  It was certainly a welcome glitch but I don't think that was intentional.  I have changed my review to a thumbs up as the only problem I previously had with the game at all was the performance issue and hopefully that only occured because it was my first time playing the game after installation.

Enjoy sailing through the stars as a trader, Battle as a bountyhunting captain collecting your bounties or many other play styles.

												First of all i have to say.... i love it .... it is an very nice space simulation...it has a great potential... still needs some more features, but the basic game is very nice...Update: Iam now playing this game for a while now....still love it^^....some small problems with the dlc here, but i think thats normal, of cause if you using mods.......I think Starpoint Gemini 2, stays here as an own concept of gameplay...dont try to compare it to other games like .... the X series....some elements are inside....but its very diffrent...You are exploring an dual star system here, with lots of planets, fractions, stations....A very nice thing is the functionality of the ship....you can upgrade your ships very nice, different weapon systems and mods for the systems.....your ship can be invisible, but not all ships.....Different fractions different ships.... So if you like space simulations....try it ....for me its worth it. ...			",68,6,0,5,5,0,16

								So I have played Starpoint Gemini 2 for about as long as I did SPG1, about two hours.  Did not care for the first game.  Story looked great, but the gameplay was rough and repetitive.  Love this game.  Light years beyond the first one in style, class, looks, gameplay, etc.  Pick a category and SPG2 does great in it.  Can't WAIT for it to totally finish up, but even without that its great.  Now I just need to go find more guys to shoot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well, I have only played a short time so far but I must say that this  is looking like a winner.The graphics are smooth and quick. There are a few varied missions and it is looking like there is a real open play in here. You have freedom to go to quite a few places with missions on stations and planets so far with plenty of asteroids to mine for ore and stuff to sell. I will update this review as I get further into the game and as it changes from beta and so far I think that this will be a winner.			",161,20,2,33,72,1,54

								Not normally I do any sort of reviews, played this one well into the night, grant you its beta, but you should get it whilst its on offer very enjoyable, with freedom to explore and decide which missions to accept.  Just needs a few brush up on the economic system.  Hard to tell whether you are getting a loss or a profit on each trade, a plus or minus on the items in cargo should do it.  Yet to commandeer a ship or salvage any derelicts though but gobbling up the hours here.			",37,3,0,6,3,0,15

								Covers areas that the big boys in space simulations seem to be leaving behind. Quite a nice game and very playable. At the moment includes only one scenario - free roam- but that has a ton of stuff to do in its own right. freelance missions as areas of the gemini sector are opened(though these could pay better), mining, bounty hunting, trading and combat. healthy traffic all round means you dont quite feel alone as in most space sims of this scope. Brilliant ship design, all round good graphics and effects and nice sound which does a greta job of immersing the player. To cut as long story short, i havent been able to put it down since i started playing :)			",450,70,7,91,44,2,87

								Wow.. this has got to be one of the best games I've ever played.As of now (as in Beta Stage), there is only the free roam mode available without any campaigns.From what I can tell there will be more features such as fighter/bomber wings and cloaking devices that have yet to be implemented.But even at this stage the game hosts a repertoire of very very cool features and effects.The game runs smoothly even on my laptop, has amazing graphics, and the spaceships look very beautiful and there are a great variety of them.All this game needs now is a good storyline and it will be legendary! (The developers are working on this right now I believe)Thank you for such an amazing game, and I definitely recommend this game to everyone :)			",5,4,0,7,2,0,3

								Hi all I just bought this game 4/4/14 and I am liking it so far, a fair bit of depth to it and it sounds like you putting more peth into it later, with boarding specialist troopers, etc.I must say i saw a video of SG 1 shields and they looked ok actually, I love the shield shimmer in SG2 but I would have loved it more if they wer more of a oval bubble around the ship, like in Star trek online.Anyway I mafe a youtube video review of the game for my youtube chanel, i hope you aprove and like it.

								Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥  Ok this game is going to be very good when it's done but at the moment it is completely unplayable.  I have a very good P.C with 12gb of RAM that runs everything else I have at maximum settings with no problem.  When I first downloaded and started the game it was working reasonably well with only the slightest lag when I approached different bases and planets.  As soon as I started getting into battles with other ships the frame rate dropped down to what I swear must have been 2fps!  Frequently it would just freeze for 5 or 10 seconds straight before moving again!  I of course decided to reduce all of my graphic settings down to minimum in the hopes of speeding up the frames.  It made no difference at all!  Maybe not everyone is having this same problem but trust me my P.C should be more than adequate to run this!Besides this though the game is visually very cool and the combat is enjoyable.  They're doing a lot of things right I just wish I was able to actually play it properly right now.(update): After starting the game again today it has been working much better for the time being.  Something strange did happen however.  I suddenly had an extra 5 million credits when I had only had about $9000 when I had quit previously.  Furthermore I didn't even make 5 million credits in my first 2 hours of gameplay.  It was certainly a welcome glitch but I don't think that was intentional.  I have changed my review to a thumbs up as the only problem I previously had with the game at all was the performance issue and hopefully that only occured because it was my first time playing the game after installation.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is what all space adventure games should strive to be. Highly replayable adaptive and immersive ,S♥♥♥♥llows the player to take on the universe as the captain of one of a large number of customizeable ships. Enjoy sailing through the stars as a trader, Battle as a bountyhunting captain collecting your bounties or many other play styles. This game allows you to delve deeply into the story and feel like you are your character. I reccomend this game the devs are active and little time goes by without some fix being implimented.

								Let me start by saying that if you have any interest at all in the Space/RPG genre you simply have to grab this game. Anyone who liked Freelancer, Freespace 1/2, Elite, I-War or any of the X games (apart from reunion) will be right at home here.Now for full disclosure I grabbed S♥♥♥♥ couple of months ago while it was still in Alpha stage and initially I wasn't too impressed. While issues are to be expected when you are playing an Alpha version, on my low-mid system, frame rate and stability issues kept me from playing for more than a couple of hours and I left the game alone for a while until some of these things were worked out.Boy! What a difference a couple of months makes. I figured since it finally got it's nice new ""Beta"" tag that I'd fire it up again and I'm really glad that I did, over 12 hours in the last 3 days can attest to how much fun I've been having with it.The basic premise of the game is your a star ship captain dropped into a dynamic living game world and your free to do pretty much whatever you want in a sandbox environment. (As of this writing the more linear campaign option has not been added yet, but is coming down the pipe shortly) : Feel like transporting VIPs or cargo from one sector to another, while enjoying the scenery? Check.Want to make your fortune by mining asteroids and junk yards? Check.Indescriminately want to blow up (Or at least try) any ship that comes near you? Check.Pros:Mind blowing number of ships to choose from (If you have the cash of course!)Plenty of factions to work with or against.3 unique classes with choices on which enhancements and perks to put into different skills when you level up.Galactic news and events that actually happen in the gameworld rather than being just Lore or Fluff.Excellent ship to ship tactical combat.Player driven goals, shall I save my money for a new ship or shall i upgrade my weapons and components?Cons:UI needs to provide more feedback. (Not being able to see the target summary unless your looking right at it, is a bit of a pain)Easy for a new player to be a little lost when first starting out, text tutorials are not ideal, but they do the job.Still a few performance and stability issues at times, which is to be expected with the game still being in BETA stage.Still some balancing issues with certain weapon types that need to be fleshed out, Beams being the prime example.Suggestions:Trading - Someway of knowing where to buy low and sell high would be nice, right now it's a bit of a crapshoot.Mission markers - How about different markers for each mission type? Would also be nice in the case of a point A to point B mission if the point B marker was a different color on the map screen.Event markers - After reading galactic news it would be nice to be able to at least select a few of them and have location specific news appear on the galactic map. (Bob spotted in the smith sector, should be able to mark the smith sector on the map so you don't have to go hunting around)Overall SG2 is shaping up very nicely and I highly recommend it, with a great DEV team who constantly provide feedback to player comments, it's only going to get better and better.

I wish they just gave you a starting balance and let you decide how to start you game.  I haven't tried capping a ship.  but i would figure turning off ""Fire-at-will"" would be a critical portion.  I would recommend this game if you liked the first one and also if you like open ended space games. I Haven't gotten into the storyline if there is oe or if it just hasn't been implemented yet.  so far my storylne i made is getting another ship in my flight or upgrading my curent ship to a larger model.

								I find this game very impressive, even in the pre-beta phase you could get addicted to SG2. It gives you the opportunity to explore the SG2 universe which is quite vast.  What I expect in the next phase are a good storyline, side quests which do not repeat themselves and better ship designs. If the developers could achieve overcoming these drawbacks, this game may even compete with Eve online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I purchaced this game just a few days after it was released as an alpha. While i tried many times to play it, i never really got into it. I found the tutorial annoying. I'm not a fan of pop ups after all. So i shelved it for some time. After it went beta, i gave it a go again, and i must say, im very impressed with it. The graphics are decent, it has endless gameplay, with trading, missions and hunting the space rift raft. One complaint i do have is it seems when you enter a planet or station, time outside is mearly paused until you exit again. I really wish there was still time elapsing while you are docked. Perhaps im missing something, but that is how i understand it. Overall tho, if you are a fan of space games, this is a decent one to give a go. I am pleased with the direction the game is going.

								For a beta this is a stable experience. So far I have 6 hours in and no crashes. Fullscreen and in a window on an Win 7 x64 install; AMD FX4130 Quad core 3.8hgz 8gb, Radeon HD 7700 4gb.  Holding my interest even without a storyline but I wonder if Ill be done with it as soon as the map is explored to return for a well fleshed out full version. There is certainly an enthusiastic and active community with recent relevant posts.Whilst looking for a space or 4x or Freelancer fix this won out over Space Engineers and Mission to Mars by a gnats♥♥♥♥♥ They are still in the oven. This seems playable and solid with a developer that is working on a 4x game as well. That just put me over the top.Gameplay doesnt feel like a time sink so far. The hud layout covers the basics for letting you know whats going on. Navigation and camera took some getting used to. The combination of mouse follow (toggle space bar) and camera view (toggle TAB) threw me at first. The depth of menus (ship, officers, fleet) makes traveling to a remote station worthwhile if not for a trade then perhaps some rare talent or other. Im just scratching the surface and have to note the AI ship voice doesn't annoy the crap outta me and is useful as I tool around with this for the first time.			",55,18,1,4,17,0,25

There is a level balance between RPG and shoot-em-up to keep most people happy. Again even at the early Beta stage there are enough elements to keep anyone occupied for a good few hours and the re-playability is already there.This will fill the gap and run along side Star Citizen (when it is released). It would be even better with MP as well as the normal SP mode, but hey it may be modded in or even added at some stage.Great little buy.			",91,12,3,6,18,0,10

								It took me some time to decide to buy this, after watching recent youtube videos.I have not been dissapointed. The Game mechanics are rock solid. I have not come across gamestopper bugs and the Graphics are running smoth and look very good.Currently there only is freeroam, think privateer/elite, but its already very entertaining to just fly around, get missions, shoot people and do trading. I like it very much already. Also you can customize your ships paintjob.This game gets a thumbs up from me.EDIT 21.07.2014:New stuff was added, raising visual appeal by alot. Also, the modding scene has already started to bring over ships from other franchises, and the game seems to be quite mod friendly.This game will be host to just about any sci fi ship that someone, somewhere, likes.Double thumbs up.

								Right off the bat, this sequel is markedly superior to its predecessor without even being complete. Graphics, interface, play controls, sound, and music are all better. As it stands now, SPG2 is a somewhat plain but serviceable space sim. You can play in a 'sandbox' mode, roaming the system exploring, trading, pirate-hunting or doing freelance missions and work your way up to bigger and better ships. The game's 'RPG class' system has been implemented, allowing you to choose one of three captain 'types', each with four distinct skills, and there is an array of perks that you can choose from to customize your character.  Navigation and combat are straightforward and can be mastered fairly quickly.There are still a number of annoying bugs and alot of memory leaks, so it tends to be up to chance whether you'll have a stable experience or a lot of crashes. Certain aspects of the game design (particularly the economy and enemy AI) still have to be tweaked and balanced. That being said, the game is still heavily in development (just entered beta stage) and many planned features have not yet been implemented. SPG2 is nowhere near complete, and yet I feel it is still good enough to provide an engaging experience. The dev team is clearly enthusiastic, determined, and appreciative of all their beta testers - they are definitely quick to respond to forum threads and e-mails and are quite good about accepting feedback and suggestions. I definitely think that Starpoint Gemini 2 is worth picking up if you are a fan of immersive space combat/starshiip command sim games, even in its early, unpolished state. It is an enjoyable, well-designed product with a lot of potential that will surely be realized in the near-term by a dedicated and passionate team of developers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm quite impressed with this game so far. There is only one playable mode at the moment and that is the free roam sandbox mode. However, there are plenty of missions and other activities to keep you busy. I'm really impressed by some of the mechanics in this game that I have not seen in other space RPGs. The interface is sleek and functional without being too complicated and everything is easily accessible with the push of a button. Also, this is one beautiful game. The environments are detailed and really make you feel like you are a small piece of a very large universe.Summed up, I recommend this game to lovers of space RPGs as this is one of the best that I have seen and it is not even complete yet. It is definitely worth it in this beta stage, which assures me that once this is released, it will be a major player in the space RPG market.			",147,4,3,15,15,0,28

								As an ALPHA BUILD, it is a pretty good game. I recommend it based on what I have seen and the possibilities that can follow. Energy allocation is a pretty nice touch. Weapon dynamics based on direction as well. However, I believe they are still unbalanced. Right now, there's not much to do. Not a lot of quest variety and some of them are very confusing (DAMN YOU TAXI MISSIONS). However, it is a lot of fun dominating multiple ships by yourself. If you like mindless sandbox gameplay, I recommend getting this game now. If you want a storyline, you may buy it later when scenarios are added. Eitherway, this is a pretty good casual game with nice pickups when multiple fleets are against you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So far, I'm impressed enough with the game to keep my eye on it.  It has some nice ""widgets"" implemented (I especially dig the animation of the tactical display starting up), and it is definitely pretty.  I am particularly enjoying having traded my beam weapons for longer-ranged railguns, especially since the beam weapons didn't have the ""oomph"" factor for me.  Now I just need to find some enemies that give me a challenge (but don't just blast me out of the stars with their first volley).One thing I'd love to see is the ability to add/remove various mount types.  For instance:  I would rather have two railgun mounts up front and ditch my heavy weapon (since I tend to go ""no ammo"" on anything where I can build my own loadout).  Having a little more control over ""ship engineering"" would be grand.  For all I know, this is planned; it just doesn't exist at the moment (as of 2014.04.29).The only real downside I've experienced so far is a few seemingly-random CTDs.   While not entirely a ""downside,"" there can be a ""boredom factor"" (which is not unique to S♥♥♥♥t all - I have the same issue with the X-universe games):  not enough mission variety, so it feels like a click-fest instead of a space game at times.  It IS early-access, though, so this could be an instance of ""it's not in yet.""  Regardless, a little more attempted piracy or some events that feel like they have meaning (anomalies that actually affect you rather than just ""drain shields/sap engines/etc,"" or other such challenges might help).All told, I'm glad I got in on early access for SG2, and I'm excited to see where they take it!

Its got the resourceyness and good mission flow you want, with a list of well designed ships you'll always be drooling over. Mechanically some parts are a little clunky just yet (boarding and such) but, seeing as how its still very much a beta, I'm sure they'll iron out the kinks. All in all a VERY fun game!

								This is one of those games that just looks so damn good, you can't help but just stop and look around at where you are sometimes. Add in it's intuitive UI and control setup, epic combat mechanics, and ease of navigation and you have the makings of what could be one of the best games in the genre.Even in it's beta form, there is enough sandbox, 4x, space sim fun to make it worth the price of admission. With the new modes and 'scenarios' promised for the full version (hopefully one of which is a story campaign that's epic enough to keep up with the setting and gameplay), this one could turn in to a true gem (No pun. Shut up. Don't judge me).That said there are a few balancing issues with the missions at the moment. Right now, the randomly generated missions seem to cap their pay at around 5000-10000 credits a piece, and none of them give you more than 100 XP, no matter how far you level up. The only way get enough XP to meet the prequisite for buying a better ship is to kill bad guys. LOTS of them. This makes buying a frieghter and becoming a miner or a trader pointless. Not that you would ever be able to afford that new ship since the pricetag for anything better than the frigate you start with starts at around 3,000,000. Factor in expenses and costly ship upgrades you have to keep up with and after 10 hours of play, I only had about a third of that. 30+ hours of play before you can even buy your first ship seems like a bit much to me. The missions are way too repetitive to justify that much grind.Same story with trading and mining. Mining never makes you more than a couple thousand creds a trip, and the amount of XP you get is effectively useless. It's even worse with trading. I haven't noticed any difference in prices of goods from one place to another, which means you can't make money (or XP for that matter) buying low at one place and selling high at another like you can in games like X3.Add a story mode, balance the missions so the pay and XP increase steadily as your level goes up, make them a bit less repetitive, and make the trading/mining mechanics of the game more lucrative, and this game would be just a tick below perfect.

								I'm quite impressed with this game so far. There is only one playable mode at the moment and that is the free roam sandbox mode. However, there are plenty of missions and other activities to keep you busy. I'm really impressed by some of the mechanics in this game that I have not seen in other space RPGs. The interface is sleek and functional without being too complicated and everything is easily accessible with the push of a button. Also, this is one beautiful game. The environments are detailed and really make you feel like you are a small piece of a very large universe.Summed up, I recommend this game to lovers of space RPGs as this is one of the best that I have seen and it is not even complete yet. It is definitely worth it in this beta stage, which assures me that once this is released, it will be a major player in the space RPG market.			",147,4,3,15,15,0,28

								As an ALPHA BUILD, it is a pretty good game. I recommend it based on what I have seen and the possibilities that can follow. Energy allocation is a pretty nice touch. Weapon dynamics based on direction as well. However, I believe they are still unbalanced. Right now, there's not much to do. Not a lot of quest variety and some of them are very confusing (DAMN YOU TAXI MISSIONS). However, it is a lot of fun dominating multiple ships by yourself. If you like mindless sandbox gameplay, I recommend getting this game now. If you want a storyline, you may buy it later when scenarios are added. Eitherway, this is a pretty good casual game with nice pickups when multiple fleets are against you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So far, I'm impressed enough with the game to keep my eye on it.  It has some nice ""widgets"" implemented (I especially dig the animation of the tactical display starting up), and it is definitely pretty.  I am particularly enjoying having traded my beam weapons for longer-ranged railguns, especially since the beam weapons didn't have the ""oomph"" factor for me.  Now I just need to find some enemies that give me a challenge (but don't just blast me out of the stars with their first volley).One thing I'd love to see is the ability to add/remove various mount types.  For instance:  I would rather have two railgun mounts up front and ditch my heavy weapon (since I tend to go ""no ammo"" on anything where I can build my own loadout).  Having a little more control over ""ship engineering"" would be grand.  For all I know, this is planned; it just doesn't exist at the moment (as of 2014.04.29).The only real downside I've experienced so far is a few seemingly-random CTDs.   While not entirely a ""downside,"" there can be a ""boredom factor"" (which is not unique to S♥♥♥♥t all - I have the same issue with the X-universe games):  not enough mission variety, so it feels like a click-fest instead of a space game at times.  It IS early-access, though, so this could be an instance of ""it's not in yet.""  Regardless, a little more attempted piracy or some events that feel like they have meaning (anomalies that actually affect you rather than just ""drain shields/sap engines/etc,"" or other such challenges might help).All told, I'm glad I got in on early access for SG2, and I'm excited to see where they take it!

								This is one of those games that just looks so damn good, you can't help but just stop and look around at where you are sometimes. Add in it's intuitive UI and control setup, epic combat mechanics, and ease of navigation and you have the makings of what could be one of the best games in the genre.Even in it's beta form, there is enough sandbox, 4x, space sim fun to make it worth the price of admission. With the new modes and 'scenarios' promised for the full version (hopefully one of which is a story campaign that's epic enough to keep up with the setting and gameplay), this one could turn in to a true gem (No pun. Shut up. Don't judge me).That said there are a few balancing issues with the missions at the moment. Right now, the randomly generated missions seem to cap their pay at around 5000-10000 credits a piece, and none of them give you more than 100 XP, no matter how far you level up. The only way get enough XP to meet the prequisite for buying a better ship is to kill bad guys. LOTS of them. This makes buying a frieghter and becoming a miner or a trader pointless. Not that you would ever be able to afford that new ship since the pricetag for anything better than the frigate you start with starts at around 3,000,000. Factor in expenses and costly ship upgrades you have to keep up with and after 10 hours of play, I only had about a third of that. 30+ hours of play before you can even buy your first ship seems like a bit much to me. The missions are way too repetitive to justify that much grind.Same story with trading and mining. Mining never makes you more than a couple thousand creds a trip, and the amount of XP you get is effectively useless. It's even worse with trading. I haven't noticed any difference in prices of goods from one place to another, which means you can't make money (or XP for that matter) buying low at one place and selling high at another like you can in games like X3.Add a story mode, balance the missions so the pay and XP increase steadily as your level goes up, make them a bit less repetitive, and make the trading/mining mechanics of the game more lucrative, and this game would be just a tick below perfect.

								Gotta say, as these sorts of space sims go, this is one of the better ones I've played in a while. Its got the resourceyness and good mission flow you want, with a list of well designed ships you'll always be drooling over. Mechanically some parts are a little clunky just yet (boarding and such) but, seeing as how its still very much a beta, I'm sure they'll iron out the kinks. All in all a VERY fun game!

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm loving Starpoint Gemini 2: probably the best space game in year. It's transitioned out of beta nicely, with minimal bugs, and improved optimization. The game has two modes, story and sandbox, and both are quite enjoyable. The control scheme feels a little like Nexus the Jupiter (but not exactly), in the sense that you're the commander of a large ship with various systems (and not just a fighter). Much better than the X series imo.The game excells at allowing you to create the kind of space captain you want to be, and the kind of ship you want to fly. There are three classes, commander, gunner, and engineer, and each excells at different specializations. Commanders are great pilots, and augment their fleets; while, gunners excell at blowing things up; the engineer can create space anomalies like vortexes that suck enemy ships in, deal radiation damage to crews, or they can hack and shut down ship systems.The ships are fantastic. Nearly a hundred different ships of varying classes that you can customize and taylor to your play style. You can control frigates and battleships - and command squadrons of fighters (but there are no fighters you can fly). Place different systems, weapons, and then tweak those systems and weapons with different modules. So, for example, you can tweak your teleporter to improve its capacity, or give it a defensive characteristic, and use it to block enemy teleports. (your ships have troops which can defend against and invade and take over other ships which you can later keep or sell.) Do you install a module with better accuracy, damage, or, for a little more money, both?Finally, there are a variety of things to do. You can be a trader, a smuggler, a pirate (raid and steal ships), or a fleet commander of some sorts. There are anomalies in space that you can simply go out, explore, scan, and document, and gain experience from this. You can ferry VIP or desparately needed supplies between stations. As much variety to the missions as in any space game.My only real complaints, and by no means are these game breaking, is the lack of documentation (there's very little information available on what different game mechanics do, exactly. Which is frustrating, since they obviously took the time to put different mechanics into the game. For example, some guns do ""emp"" damages, or ""radiation"" damage, and no where does it say exactly what it means by this, one is just left to assume that radiation hurts crews and emp drains batteries or shields. My second complaint is that there's just too much clutter. Don't get me wrong, the game is beautiful, but everywhere you look there's some beautiful nebulae, star, or simply space debry all around you. Your eyes get overwhelmed by the clutter, never are you allowed to enjoy the simplicity of being amongst the stars. You never get the sense that you're exploring unchartered territory, as there are ships and stations everywhere you go.All in all, excellent game. 8/10.			",103,23,1,20,11,1,40

I love being able to fly around a giant galaxy taking little side missions (only missions in the game right now) and blasting enemy ships out of the sky. I ended up moding the save file to give myself some more money to buy a better ship and some weapons but only did so to see how the game progression was. Lots of ships to collect and fly around in and the gameplay is actually kind of addicting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well, it is a beta, but it does not really feel like a beta. Aside from a couple of mistakes/wrong textures applied, I have so far not had a problem.At first, the mix between joystick and mouse + keyboard was a bit hard to get hold of, but you can get the turrets to automatic, which works perfectly fine.Im not sure how the threat is assigned however, as I had no issues bringing down deadly ships, without my shields going down.So far the game is very repetitive, which is the only bad thing about it, however, being in beta still, I'm hoping more missions will be added over time, less repetitive.I like how the bounty system works, and it is very rewarding to get a bounty.I'd recommend the game, as it seems quite polished, and seems to work just fine :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So I used to play EVE online a lot, and when I say alot I mean a social life endagering amount. Dont get me wrong, its an awesome game, but I always felt underpressure from my corperation and the fact it was a pay monthy subscription to play as much as I possibly/physically could. Due to this I eventually stopped playing and have ever since been on the lookout for something that comes even remotley close to EVE visually, mechanically and diversly. Starpoint Gemini 2 is the best I have found yet, and (as at the time of writing this) is still only in BETA!! Really looking forward to where they are going to take this, and no pay monthly fee so I can pick up and put down as I wish without feeling like I'm losing money. Ok so its not as complex as EVE but EVE was (imho) massivley complex and this game does just enough without frying your brain. Diversity is there, the amount of stuff you can do already without the campain is huge, visuals are breathtaking and the playable area is massive, not EVE massive but I ve been playing now for about 20 hours with 1 character and I've only explored about 1/8 of the map. Very well done on this guys and a big thumbs up on how much feedback you take from the forums. Its so nice to see deleopvers actually listening to us gamers and implementing changes directly off the back of feedback/critisims/ideas that come straight from the community. If you used to (or still do) play EVE, love space sims (or not) or are just looking for something to fill the gap between now and Star Citizen, look no further.All in all I give Starpoint Gemini 2 9/10 and watch this space, its only gonna get better			",39,4,3,6,8,0,5

								I have yet to try any other space sims. But At the time, Starpoint Gemini, just seemed to be the exact kind of game to fill the game drought currently occuring in my life. I love RPGS and Space. Seeing that it was on sale I decided to take the plunge and purchase it.... It was at that point I discovered I had already owned this game for quite some time,( which happens more often that I should admit). Anywho, I installed and was immediately overwhelmed with the tutorial making me memorize a million different commands and interactions that seemed to be mostly Jibberish. Being my first step into the Space-sim genre as well as one of the only 4X strategy games  i've ever played, I gave no fault to the game or it's design. This was strictly me being a dummy.3 hours later I'm a bonafide Space pirate. THIS GAME IS GOOD! Like stay up until 3 in the morning on a work night kinds of good.			",138,16,5,15,22,1,20

Compared to other early access games I wasn't as disappointed as normal, in fact at this point this game could pass as an alpha.As far as the gameplay this is more of a you against the galaxy type of deal, you fly a spaceship, you may have multiple garaged spaceships that you own but (somewhat like ace combat in a way) but it is 100% open*galaxy*.  Normal gameplay consists of going on randomized missions such as assassinate, ferry cargo/passengers, capture ships, smuggle counterfiet goods etc, you level up/rank up and have a skill tree/rank tree.  You may earn money through missions, trading, mining (asteroids and other such objects), plundering derelict ships, and the best is to find rare high level bounty ships which earn you considerable profits.  You spend your money on new ships, ship systems (weapons) and system upgrades.Sorry for the long review but I tried to explain what I would have wanted to see before I bought it (well worth the money by the way!)

								I really like the licenses that you can buy but for the price of the licenses maybe the perk you get when you buy the license  should be increased or the prices of the licenses lowered.the auto-pilot is awesome and sometimes theres nothing better than just drifting through space but at times i find it a bit uneventful, other than the stunning scenery and the the enemy factions and pirates that you run into theres not much else that makes the trip exciting. maybe turning the autopilot off when the ship has to travel through asteroid fields or maybe even grouping the asteroids closer together so that the ship has to be manouveredthe map is really easy to read and finding my bearings isnt a problem, i have played similar games and have found them vey complicated, i find this one the easiest to understand and play but its not to say that its not a very challenging game although  a better tutorial could be made. i found the current tutorial a bit too much to remember at once.all in all it is an amazing game and i would recomend it to all my friends. i am curious to see multiplayer or even mass multiplayer capabilities. the graphics are a 10/10 and the ship controll is challenging but fun to master. it would be great to see a few more classes introduced as well.

												At first I thought this game sucked but the more I play it the more fun it is. It reminds me a lot of freespace 2 which is a great thing because that game rocked! However if your looking for a dogfight space sim then this isnt it. You get to fly huge ships which are more like gigantic gun boats. The voice acting is terible but dont let that put you off as the core gameplay is solid. I wish these guys had more money to spend on the game and add better social comms like the old wing commander 4. The game does feel lifeless sometimes as you do't really commincate with anyone, be it friendlies enemies or neutrals. So far this game has sucked up 11 hours of my life and I'm sure many hours to follow.  Hint: Leave your joystick unplugged, you won't need it. This games designed for mouse and keyboard and works well with it.Overall 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you missed the sale recently, wait for it to come around again. Obsessively wait.This game was fun before I got to the modding community, but afterwards this game is awesome. Anyone looking for a good space ""do what you want"" sim will be well rewarded with the purchase.If you're into the Star Trek experience, then look no further. Best game for individual space ship combat in a Star Wars theme since Bridge Commander. Way better than that MMO I tried briefly. Some of the mods that I recommend for Star Trek immersion include: Federation Fleet, TNGAmbience, and TNGComputer.			",61,2,2,9,12,0,10

												I had fun tooling in this game.  It's got a good sense of progression, and it's not exactly lacking in depth or scope. One complaint is that it's not as polished as it could be.  Released in 2014, you can tell a lot of great art and design work was put into this game but it's already starting to show it's age.  I personally compare it to a game like Elite Dangerous, which has a high amount of finish and looks great, but is ultimately a very boring game which lacks depth and has a very frustratingingly long grinding progression. Starpoint Gemini on the other hand, has better pacing.  While it may not be as technically complex or broad in scale, it's a good break as a single player game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great space exploration game, the storyline is enjoyable but not extremely content packed and not very interesting. The best part of the game is really exploring the very large map and choosing your own path, you can be whoever you want to be in a vast variety of ships and missions in different regions on the map.I have also had a lot of fun customizing my ship, whether that be the colors of the ship, or the weaponry on board, to the name of the ship (The SwagginWaggin)... I have also enjoyed aligning myself with the various factions, there seem to be at least 30-40 of them.Pro's --> Great space exploration game, complex enough to make it enjoyable for more experienced gamers but also doesn't have a huge learning curve.Con's --> Storyline is pretty weak and the quests and farming for gold can get a little repetitive if you don't enjoy the exploration aspect too much.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this game is pretty good, but is not that big, and you could be done with the whole thing in 20-30 hours.  I reccomend it if you like space games, but don't want to directly pilot so much as captain larger vessels.  the control scheme is different to say the least and takes some getting used to, but it works.  I reccomend you check it out, although Eve Online is better.			",84,14,0,15,5,0,21

												This is a really good space game.The game offers various control methods to let you fly your ship like a pilot/dogfighter or play more of a commander role using turret view. At first it takes a while to get used to the controls and fight effectively with a style you like but once you play out a few battles out you will find a control style that suits you and probably end up switching between them depending on the situation and the ship you are using.The graphics and interface are really nice and the game runs very well on my medium system which is an AMD APU with integrated graphics.The sound effects are good but some cool warp like sound effect for the t-drive would be nice. The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music. The story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to. So you can play like a pirate or a trader, mine or do missions etc. There's plenty to do and it's all fun.The game has a nice rpg element which means you can upgrade your skills for when you are in battle and upgrade perks for various different effects like trading bonuses or ship capture bonuses etc. You can customise your ships weapons and buy bigger and better guns and ships as you progress through the ranks and acquire more credits. Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you are into space games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am loving this game - it feels like a mashup of X3, Elite and  a couple of other games.Your starter ship is good mix of everything, good size cargo bay, two weapon points (light - railguns, heavy missiles).  upgrading it is expensive so take care of it.You earn money by trading, completing missions, mining.  You can also try pirating, though this doesn't suit my game play.The universe is a series of hex's that you fly across normally.  Alternatively, their are gateways between locations that require jump drives, worm holes that require increased health (haven't managed to get through one yet) and rift lines, which accelerate your speed whilst you are in the rift.  The subtle difference between worm hole and rift - I think - is that you are exposed to enemy fire in the rift, but not in the wormhole.There is a story (and with the DLC, a second one), but often you will find yourself doing ""things"".  I targeted a level 2 pirate and thought it would be easy, but he called for help, deciding to avoid the agro, I pushed the engines to max, turned and flew through a rift and ended up in the middle of an uncharted system, alive, but with a battered ship.It is a slow paced game - so far at least - but you have to learn that your ship is NOT a fighter, but a small frigate with a crew and gimballed turrets which you can either fire, or have the crew fire.  Later you can buy carrier vessels or cloaked vessels.  You can also command some sort of fleet (hiring mercenaries to accompany you).Like I say, I am loving this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								So I have spent almost 30 hours with this game, and I have to say the boys at LGM have out done themselves. Even in Beta this game is shining, bringing back thoughts of games Like Free Lancer and EVE, while not directly copping them or stealing anything from them.For all the negative reviews its still in BETA, I have not seen one complaint or gripe that has not been or is not being addressed, they are putting all the spit and polish on this as we speak and it shows in every aspect.The Community for this game, even before release, is awesome, they care about what happens to it, what happens in it, and I think for the first time, atleast for me, the Devs of this game actually listen and work with the community to better it.I've spent some scratch here at steam, I've been looking a long time for a quality game that I can enjoy, I've spent, I've looked, I've played, and when I say that even in Beta this was one of the best buys I've made here I am not kidding, its a gem pardon the pun.If your looking for a game thats exciting, has RPG elements, space tactics, gun fights, top gun like action, look no further than SPG2!

												The game has come a LONG way since my initital review, so time to update the thing. 1. The developers are awesome. 2. This game, in early days, was a fun amusement. With their improvements as time has gone on, it has lived up to its potential. This game is now king of the hill in its genre, as far as I'm concerned.3. At the time of this writing, developers are still improving and enhancing the game. 4. A number of game files (such as savegames) are in human-readable formats, making fixes (like if you screwed up a mod) or various changes suprrisngly doable if you want to go beyond the game's core gameplay.5. The game is beautifully made, graphically speaking. Voice acting is still getting all the lines filled out as far as I can tell, and some characters have better voices than others, and not all are voiced, but it's good for the most part.6. Why are you still reading this review, BUY THE GAME ALREADY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay...I've been playing for a week or so now, and am overall VERY pleased with the game.  There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.  There isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?For a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!The game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.The visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!Spend the money.  Buy the game.  Enjoy wiping out lots of enemies on the HUGE map. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								IN GAME THE MOUSE WILL NOT MOVE ONTO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE SCREEN. Then I restarted the game, and it looks, like the active-x and direct-x files had to syncronise correctly, which they did, after the second startup. Now it works pretty good, but this is a beta game, and that is why some of the graphics enhancements do not detect as usable, like reflections and shadows, could not be used, but my 2 gig NVIDIA 660 definately has those abilities.Ok that said... Listen up. This game has real potential, because its very open to modding, so it could getvery incredible. There are allready a good number of mods on steam for it, and it's just in BETA...Plus you can use HOTAS joystick to control things. I'm guessing that everything may just end up with beautiful cockpits too for every type of ship.  So get in there and mod and use wordpad !			",154,16,0,49,26,0,40

												This is a great space combat game, with RPG elements.  Cruising through space, capturing ships, looting and upgrading is a lot of fun.  There are not too many games in this genre. They all seeml to be too old, too complex or they require subscriptions.  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a winner. Short comments on the game:- It is more arcade than simualtion. - The story is not bad, but the presentation is very weak. - At times the voice acting is rediculously bad-  Dont worry about the story becuase the gameplay is engaging and addictive- The graphics are great, minus a few hiccups here and there- Would take about 30-40 hours to play through campaign- Lots to do in this game. DLC is also available and the devs love to support this game- Stop and take a screen capture! F11 will hide all the HUDs so your screen capture comes out like a Carl Sagan wet dream. - The trading and mining is weak, but the value and money making is in capturing enemy ships and selling them and their cargo. Its 5x better than running materials from one side of the map to the other to make money.- There are some great video tutorials on youtube that can jumpstart your ship capturing / pirating skils .  Search: ""Tensiaka"" on youtube for valuable ship cap[turing and combat tutorials,. They helped me a lot. Make a few million in your first couple hrs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite a few flaws, the gameplay, ship options and open world win out.

												This game could be so great. A real worthy successor for the likes of Freelancer and Privateer but it has so many flaws that it is very close to not being recommendable...I still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.Let’s start with the good things:I really like the music…ok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)The actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)What is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.The other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell♥♥♥♥♥♥about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble…Talking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances.Second most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.Other weaknesses I like to mention:The presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0.The balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.The menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power).But the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer.Last but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies.So there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created?And then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has come a LONG way since my initital review, so time to update the thing. 1. The developers are awesome. 2. This game, in early days, was a fun amusement. With their improvements as time has gone on, it has lived up to its potential. This game is now king of the hill in its genre, as far as I'm concerned.3. At the time of this writing, developers are still improving and enhancing the game. 4. A number of game files (such as savegames) are in human-readable formats, making fixes (like if you screwed up a mod) or various changes suprrisngly doable if you want to go beyond the game's core gameplay.5. The game is beautifully made, graphically speaking. Voice acting is still getting all the lines filled out as far as I can tell, and some characters have better voices than others, and not all are voiced, but it's good for the most part.6. Why are you still reading this review, BUY THE GAME ALREADY!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Okay...I've been playing for a week or so now, and am overall VERY pleased with the game.  There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.  There isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?For a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!The game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.The visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!Spend the money.  Buy the game.  Enjoy wiping out lots of enemies on the HUGE map. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								IN GAME THE MOUSE WILL NOT MOVE ONTO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE SCREEN. Then I restarted the game, and it looks, like the active-x and direct-x files had to syncronise correctly, which they did, after the second startup. Now it works pretty good, but this is a beta game, and that is why some of the graphics enhancements do not detect as usable, like reflections and shadows, could not be used, but my 2 gig NVIDIA 660 definately has those abilities.Ok that said... Listen up. This game has real potential, because its very open to modding, so it could getvery incredible. There are allready a good number of mods on steam for it, and it's just in BETA...Plus you can use HOTAS joystick to control things. I'm guessing that everything may just end up with beautiful cockpits too for every type of ship.  So get in there and mod and use wordpad !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually really enjoyed this game. I was just starting to get annoyed at the quests. It looked like an impossible cash grind to get the top teir ships.  Then I managed to capture a tiny ship by fluke. I was amazed how much cash it was worth so started building a ship built for capping instead of pure combat. with the right upgrades, perks and officers I was able to capture same level ships to buy my way to top tier upgrades and cap ships higher classes than mine and work my way up the food chain. The going was slow at first but I ended up never having to actually buy anything larger than a frigate. I had some issues with the game crashing trying to do the Titan DLC but managed to get around it by save scumming every step of the quest. An at times flawed but still great space game.

												Amazingly fun early game.Decent middle game.Slow endgame.And I mean slow. Literally. The final ships are next to stationary in combat, and the lack of variety of options in combat makes this quite boring.  As you can only aim a fraction of your turrets at once you're left to turn on auto turrets with large ships which automatically takes care of firing all turrets so you have all your guns firing and just kind of sit there and occasionally use an ability if you need to kill a bit faster.I can still happily recommend this game based on the great early and midgame that's highly reminiscent of Freelancer, but the endgame is poorly balanced and not particularly fun.

												I purchased this game almost immediately during early access because I had been wanting to play a good space sim for quite a long time. It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character. Initially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content. There is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.Combat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters. To sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time. In some ways I enjoy this game more than Elite: Dangerous.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game a is a tough one to decide. It really isn't a game that I can sit and dump 8 hours into daily like some of the other games I've played, but it is fun to come back to it every once in a while and get my ""freelancer"" fix for the week. I personally found this game to be pretty fun when in sandbox/exploration mode. Story mode on the other hand.. was poorly completed, I believe I spent about 20 minutes in, and dumped it due to the appalling voice acting and poorly scripted story.  Now for sandbox I loved flying around blasting and capturing ships to sell at the local stations. I loved upgrading my ship from the inventories of captured  ships. I'm always looking for the shield or weapon improvment. I loved exploring the map and seeing all the cool spacial anomalies. UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same. Overall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.To the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered ""Complete"" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.

												Bad game! Horribly frustrating, has some good points, but overall its a very bad game.The main thing, the fighting - it sucks, 99% of the time you have to turn on auto shooting, because you can't find on the screen enemies, they just keep flying outside of your view all the time, and it doesnt matter if it is a destroyer and you are flying with corvette it still jumps around you like if it was a small fly.   As for different ship types, they all behave the same way, you don't feel any difference between piloting small ship or huge one, it looks almost the same and moves the same way.As for trade, colors of prices are cool, but otherwise trade is tedious and just a waste of time, especially that you start a game with a tiny ship, you could get better cash form mining, but it still is insignificant.You can get huge rewards for capturng ships and doing it is the most fun feature of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game... the storyline is also interesting, it kept me into the game for some time, until finally i had enought of other flaws and deleted it.You shouldn't go into long travels/explorations, save as often as you can because game like to punish you for no reason... you fly, fly, fly, die... just like that, no attack, no hazard, you just suddenly see your ship explode. Or you fly, fly, fly, game crash.... ;DOr if you want to use speed booster to get quickly to new area... the game crashes almost every time you use this item.During fights, you can read target info only when it is on the screen so it makes it quite problematic since as i said they always stay outside of your FOV.I should also mention that it has horrible localization, had to switch to English as in my native language it was horrible.And one last thing, the RPG elements... its a bad joke, not worth mentioning.

												I liked the game so far, but I play a lot. I am an avid player of sci fi games, medieval, simulation battle and strategy. I play games so much I do not have any other form of life except work and games. I do stay in shape as I work out a lot. I can practically tell you exactly how to make a good game and it will be a #1 top seller, I have even made games myself constucting whole citys and governments with plots and story lines along with political agendas on governments and war. This Starpoint Gemini is very promising and is a good game. Couple of pointers to the developers, you should have ships hunt you down as if looking for you and then take off before being destoyed. Somone you can recognize that you have seen before but make some what elusive so he/she can come back again to hunt you from a jurisdiction you are not welcomed of course, but this should be once in great while not an everytime thing. Another thing is that when you get high level in the game all you see is big hard ships all the time, almost no small ones. In the begining you would see them a lot. I am level 80 and it does not seem to be going any highier(no complaints). But sometimes you exit from a station or a star gate and you are jumped by a horde of big ships just out of the blue(c'mon a little ridiculouse at times)it happens often and half the time you dont stand a chance unless you have big hired mercenarys that are expensive to maintain, which does take a big toll on the money you make. Sometimes you fall behind unless you really try to keep up the hustle and bustle of making money, then its more stress instead of pure enjoyment to try and keep good powerfull mercenarys at youre side. You should fan it out more to where at least 50% of the time there are still smaller groups of ships, or one or two important people(hunters) that show up to hunt you like I said previously, Instaed of being mobbed by a lot of big powerfull ships all the time. There still needs to be smaller ships around of all sizes. All I see now are big ships everywhere and almost no small ones traversing through space or hanging out at space stations. Its almost as if everybodys super rich now and got dreadnaughts and carriers becouse I am level 80 now. You need to tone that down to be more normal. If you did that the game would excell in greatness, otherwise that is a major downfall. But I do see it getting bigger more powerfull ships to attack you as you are highier in level that makes sense, but overall it needs to be re-worked to how i mentioned previously, thank you...... Several hours later on re-editing, I am now back to write what I said. There is more randomness, I guess i was just to fast to express at 80th level. I went back in different parts of the galaxy, it does get heavy at times and then again light on battles just depends. Also what i like is there are also missions you can take that can be much lower than youre level and also much highier. There still needs to  be ones that hunt you down and occasionally escape to come back another time but with a name to them you can recognize. May i also add i have not played the story line yet and am looking forward to it, its just in the free roam you can choose other characters instead of bieng stuck with the same story line one. Overall its all good and was very enjoyable playing. Would be nice to have another dozen songs in the game, the music is similar to eve music which I liked a lot when I played eve back in 2009.

It took me several hours before i really understand how to do the basic stuff like bording and easier way to lvl up with good money. This game reminds me of Galaxy on Fire 2 but its much more bigger galaxy and more hours of play time :) only thing i miss its the mining. In this game you only have to shoot the asteroids to collect the Minerals			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved freelancer and this game has that feel to it. You can even capture ships and sale them which quickly becomes the best way to make money. However a few things that I dislike in base game (though since you can mod it heavily some things can be fixed), the way ship levels are done and strength of weapons allowed on ships bothered me as a lot of money spent for so little gained. I felt like (without mods) that upgrading my ship to a much more expensive version often didn't gain any DPS. I wound up using a lot of modding to make this flow better for me.			",20,25,0,27,6,0,4

Combat is fun, ships are beautifully designed, and a massive open world were there is always something to do.Honestly a pretty deep game, in a time where most dev's are dumbing everything down for the mainstream.Highly reccomend!Graphics: 8/10Audio: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Overall: 8.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Probably one of the worst control scheme I tried for a non-beta game. For the love of space I still manage to play it 10+ hour but together with all the repetitive grind and the lacking RPG elements, sad to say I really cannot recommand this.Shame that multiple ships with free loadout in an open world setting is hard to come by.

												Poor mans X Universe game. Here is how you defeat every ship that attacks you: Come to a complete stop, (because the space fighting is a joke and he enemy ships will stop with you) then because the targeting system is non existent, turn on auto fire, then spin 360 degrees spamming your heavy weapons. It may be a space game but everything is on a 2D plane. this may not sound bad, but fighting in space NEEDS three dimenshions. Every single ship in the game plays the same. Bigger ones just have more hitpoints, turrets, and hangars. And they still suck. If you want a true space fighter sim, get any ""X"" game. Except ""Rebirth"" ♥♥♥♥ that game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll go on to say that if you enjoyed Freespace 2 or similar space themed games then you will find yourself immersed in this game. I will also add that the game requires a decent PC for the optimal smooth gameplay experience. In Starpoint Gemini 2 you get to upgrade and purchase ships as well as level up your character. There is a story ark mode available and freeroam option where you can try and emulate a raider, trader, mercenary and more. Combat in this game is extremely satisfying and blowing up combatant ships nearly never gets old. Even though this game is slated as a finished product the developers are still adding in more functions to add to the replayability and longevity of the base game. Plus all those Steam Workshop mods add to the overall experience if you want to mix things up a tad. Overall I rate this game a 7.8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to like this game, but the texts everywhere are too small, hard to read, and so reading through the tutorial was a chore. The campaign was boring, but the Freeroam mode just leaves you out in the open. Quests you get are too straightforward, not even giving you a small background on why you have to put down a ship, it just appears on your starchart and you'd be free to grab it if you want. Ultimately, the voice acting is very bad, which was really off-putting. I was looking for an experience similar to Sid Meier's Pirates! and Mount and Blade: Warband, but I sadly didn't get that here.			",130,25,3,26,11,1,15

												I thought this would be the Mount and Blade of Space. It isn't. I got this for five bucks, its not worth itIf you like dicking around in space doing basically nothing then here ya go. There is no reason to progress and get better weapons, as I was able to take down ships with an ""Impossible"" Rating without taking any damage at all. Combat is useless, as you make more money shooting rocks and selling what you find than being a pirate.I'm sure this game apeals to more methodical players that want to learn all the ins and outs, but if your a guy like me who doesn't have the time or patience to do that, this isn't for you.Note I didnt try the story so keep that in mind when making your decision to buy the game or not.

												It is interesting but fairly basic compared to other spaceship exploration type of games.  The combat is very fast and takes some of the nuance out of the skills.  The UI is clunky and ship movement isn't very intuitive.  Trading is simpliofied but won't really make you much money. Just doing the same 4 types of missions will net you the bulk of your income and experience.  But I would have still have left a positive review if it weren't for the frequent crashes.  These crashes aren't just the game, they often freeze up my system in a way I haven't experienced in years.In researching this problem one comes across many attempted solutions (which I tried many) from others and then dev posts that point to it being a problem with Windows 10, and that they do not and will not support this game under Windows 10.  Also read from the dev posts that ""this game is 2 years old"" so they are not focused on supporting it further.  So, buyer beware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 9, 2014
												There's quite a few things to like in this space trading/shooter game. The developers have managed to infuse a fair bit of live into this one, and it does have some pretty neat game mechanics. The best way of defining it is as a crossover of Freelancer and Starfleet Command, even if I find SPG 2 to be neatly an inferior game to both. Compared with Freelancer, this title hasn't delivered for me the same degree of immersion and engagement with the storyline and the universe that I remember of playing Freelancer. Compared to the second, the tactical combat in this game to be flawed in some departments and shallower, even if there are some cool ideas in here.The stuff I like Even if we're restricted to one single system, there's indeed a lot of places to go and things to see. This is a *big* game. Trading and mining are actually viable professions, not just an side to mercenary or piratical activities. There's lots of ships, and lots of modules to fit your ships with.  Combat is engaging, and fun, at least for some time. I do like very much the ""ammo-based"" modules (scavenger drones, mining torpedoes, etc.). These modules can be swapped in flight - which might detract from a plausibility point of view, but I personally don't mind it much - and you can actually feel like having a purpose (they're quite useful actually). The game is highly moddable.The stuff that leaves me indifferent or I am not very impressed by While there's a great variety of weapons, I find that rather than having 5 varieties of the same thing with slightly tweaks to range, damage, power drain, etc. it would have made sense to have just one type and increase the ""rigging possibilities"". Per-module rigging is in  the game, but you can just add one type of rig to one specific module. You can recruit crew, but this crew is reduced to specific buffs to your ship (weapon accuracy, speed, etc.). They level out, and do provide with an extra layer of ship customization. But sometimes the bonuses are so specific that one wonders why are you paying religiously salaries on a monthly basis. There's no enemy leveling - that is, if you go to certain places you may find yourself vastly overmatched by NPC ships. Knowing when to engage and when to fly is an important skill to develop. The problem comes when these ""hero"" NPCs basically can appear anywhere and the information that allows you to assess whether or not you're outclassed is only visible if you keep it in your sights. Which can be quite difficult. The combat skills system looks good, but very much as with the crew, lacks some depth (and you also wonder why you should bother with those skills).The stuff I plainly don't like The HUD is functional, but I would have really liked that I could have waypoints (that is, locking on locations) and targets (that is, locking on ships and stations) at the same time. Currently, you either have a waypoint or a target. Even worse is that the waypoint/target data is only visible if you have your bow pointed towards the object you locked on. That makes stuff like checking on nearby hostile ships while travelling towards your destination disorienting or just plainly dangerous (since you will close onto these enemies). The world is very much structured like that of Privateer/Freelancer, but crammed into one single star system. What was plausible in those games, here feels a bit uncomfortably contrived. Even if the world is big, I didn't get that ""to boldly go where nobody has before"" kind of vibe that you get in Elite Dangerous or Evochron Mercenary, for instance. I find the main storyline to be completely uninteresting, and delivered in a very unappealing way.It's a cheap game, indeed, but since I haven't enjoyed it much, I can't really recommend it to anyone.

												This game is more fun than I thought it would be... the plot (although kinda shallow on the side quests) is entertaining.The thing I find most enjoyable is that you can play it as a first-person space dogfighting game, or you can use the fire at will feature and just fly the ship while the computer does the shooting. Trading seems to be a waste of time at least early on up to where I'm at same for mining although its a little more lucrative. The gameplay is pretty addictive and you have to really grind pretty hard to earn enough money to build a decent ship - unless you use the cheats, which would probably instantly ruin the game completely.Definitely worth the couple bucks I spent on it, I probably wouldn't pay retail for it. However I'm a cheapskate in general so that statement holds true for me with pretty much anything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Only been playing Early Access Beta a few hours and so far I'm really enjoying it,Bit of a space sim fan in general…This reminds me some of Freelancer and EVE online.Beta access is “freeroam”, I’ve found that it is fairly easy to pick up the basics but takes a while to get proficient, there is some real depth here and I’ve only scratched the surface.First impressions, this game is looking great! Can only imagine how good it could be if it supported a multiplayer PU and had an optional cockpit/bridge view.To early to call yet, but this game shows so much potential I think I can rate it in my top 5 space sims.Anyhow having a blast so far and excited to see how the finished product plays!Edit 8th of October 2014 My first impressions of SPG2 was that it might make my favourite top 5 space sims… it has the potential but it lacks a few vital essentials like a functional overview such as Freelancer. I was probably more than 20 hours into my early access when I realized just how much I missed it.It’s no game breaker but having played Freelancer for well over 1500hrs and EVE online for much more you quickly realize just how much it holds the game back from being so much better. I’ve put some 140 hrs into the game (including beta) and I’m far from finished with it.The good news is that some serious HUD tweaks are coming... the DEV’s have worked  tirelessly to address a few bugs that appeared at launch and they’ve been responding to some imbalance issues relating to levelling, the game having only been released a few weeks ago is already feeling much better!Visually the game scores 9/10    Just beautiful!Soundtrack 9/10      Really great soundtrack.Storyline 6/10     Story was OK, I just didn’t get into it. Just dialogue, no character cut scenes at all. Voice acting 6/10  Some were hilarious they were so bad.Gameplay 8/10  Some solid gameplay mechanics, easy to get into but hard to master.Replay ability 9/10  I got my money’s worth just playing the Beta early access!General Content 9/10  Some real quality ships, gear, missions, bounties, capture ship gameplay etc…LGM Dev’s 10/10 Never come across such a great team working so hard with so little.I just finished the story mode… overall I enjoyed it, I’ve still got a few high bounties to go after and I haven’t explored all of the map. The game as far as the DEV’s are concerned isn’t finished they have a big wish list of features they still hope to implement and honestly I can’t wait.Starpoint Gemini 2 easily makes it into my top 10 space sim games and if you’e looking for something to fill the void while we wait for Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous etc Just get it already.SPG2 will keep on getting better as they go and I’m looking forward to it and new content.

								I do not feel it's fair or accurate to describe this game as ""Eve Offline"", but it does give you a good idea of what you are going to get. Starpoint Gemini 2 looks great! And I really do love not having loading times. I haven't been able to explore the game's entire map yet but I can tell you it is huge and despite you are traveling in space it doesn't get boring. There is plenty of stuff to look around for, side quests, random encounters, etc. I can see myself spending 80+ hours just fooling around on this game before I decide to start/continue the main storyline. The controls are perfect, they do give you the feeling that you are commanding the ship. I'm still new to ship's customization but there seems to be plenty of options, and I really can't wait to buy a better/bigger ship. I'm sure this game will satisfy your scifi adventure needs, wether you desire join a fight between enemy fleets, flee through an asteroid field from a tougher opponent, become a space pirate or just travel through space... this game has it all.

The gfx, sfx and music is majestic and gameplay is easy to learn and fun.I started free roaming after the intros screens just to get a sense of the game. And i was blown away how easy the ship was to controll with the mouse. (you can choose gamepad if you want) Love the ui in the game. Anway i started free roaming and collected stuff from junk out in space and traded them at nearest planet. And i really feelt like being a pilot in space trading to earn my living, its hard to explain but this game just took me by storm instant.I know that alot of thing may change further ingame but i feelt i had to type somthing. I will continue this after 10-30hrs or more of gameplay. But for now i can surely say worth every euro i payed for this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything from transitioning across the galaxy (next sector) to opening the options menu.  Needs to get a bit more stable.  I'd like to see landing (anchor) sequences and maybe some basic docking grapics like Darkstar One, showing that you are IN a station.  Other than the graphics, it reminds me of Elite from 1984-ish.  Keep it up though... I hope the modders really get with it.  I play Skyrim with hundreds of mods and it's pushed that game past 1000 hours and I'm still on my first character.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game's everything you could want in a space themed game and it only gets better!10/10 would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It felt to me more like and expansion to the original than a new game. That's not a bad thing.  I recall having stability issued with the original game, but have had little to none with this one. Fun space exploring and trading with plenty of pew pew pew. Great visuals. Crappy camera in my opinion, and minimalist control scheme, I thought.  Still, a  great game. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An enjoyable but rather limited single player experience. Graphics, music and sound effects are good. Side-missions are a tad repetitive and being a space simulation, I wish there was some more content. In that regard it's a bit too shallow for my taste and not comparable to the superb Freelancer. Don't bother with the lackluster campaign and it's weak story, but go straight for the enjoyable freeroam sandbox game. The mod community offers some nice content, which enriches the game experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid open world space sim in the vein of Elite, X-series, Evochron, Oolite, etc.  Purchased at release, I haven't gotten around to it until recently, and was quite surprised at what I found.  Often games in this genre can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but that's not the case here - very easy to jump into and play.  In fact, straight out of the gate I've been able to do bounty hunter missions...  very cool.I have yet to try out mods, but I suspect they will add quite a bit to this game.  Really looking forward to deliving deeper into this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Regularly updated by the developers and quickly nearing completion. How many EA titles can say that?A great space flier with fairly simple flight mechanics - a nice change after some recent space game fails. This is not a dogfighting game. You spend most of your time flying bigger boats and trying to keep as many turrets on your target as possible. Standard mission running, war participation, trading and mining. The developers are keeping the campaign under wraps until release, so I don't have enough information to say how well it all ties together. I will say that the game is playable, as is, without the campaign. Random missions pop up on your map so it is more than possible to advance without it.The price is great for the gameplay value and the campaign isn't even implimented yet. Very few bugs or flaws, and the ones that do make it in are quickly squished.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												18 hours in and so far this game is exellent. VERY similar to Freelancer for old school gamers out there. For new people think 3rd person space shooter with trading, mission, piracy or whatever. There are tons of different ships, weapons, loadouts and play styles.Graphics are excellent and it runs really well on my rig.It can be hard in places, so don't be afraid to go away, save up and buy a bigger ship. The mission level indicators can be a little bit off.

								I find it hard to say that I recommend this game, or even that I do not.I was a huge fan of Freelancer, and I have spent years looking for something that could fill the hole that Freelancer left behind. While Starpoint Gemini 2 comes close, it's not... quite... there yet. This game is still in development (just recently in beta), so bear that in mind.All of the pieces are there - free roaming, trading, space battles - however, SG2 seems to fall flat a key area - ship movement. The starting vessel, a frigate, I believe, looks like a fish, moves like a fish, but steers like a cow. Most combat is spent circling around trying to get a bead on your enemy for about 1/2 a second before they move out of view once more. By that point, his buddy has been firing lasers up your butt. I'm a space combat noob with this game, but even Freelancer felt like it had more ""zip"" to ship movement. I had to crank the mouse sensitivity just to feel like there was some kind of response to the controls.Graphically, it's quite nice. Ships, planets, stations and space ""stuff"" is lovely to look at.The game requires some optimization. When you are in a serious furball with many other ships, I find that the game really chugs and slows down - even if you are not involved in the combat, and it's just nearby.The game is not multiplayer, and I am not clear on whether or not it is ever going to be multiplayer. That is also a major wall for a lot of people. Freelancer was great. Freelancer with friends was amazing.This is not a Freelancer replacement, though it comes close. If you're not concerned about a multiplayer experience, you're not going to find a game that delivers what this one does at this price point. However, I would wait for later in the beta cycle or even for wide release. It's not quite ready for prime time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My original review (while the game was still in EA) is shown at the bottom. Please note that the sections on performance are not entirely relevant now, since the game runs much better.REVIEW AFTER RELEASE:---------------------------------------------------------The game is a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.The campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.A lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.Jimbo Rating: 6/10REVIEW WHILE IN EA:---------------------------------------------------------It's a mix between Freelancer and X3.

Easy money there when you tow it to station or planet. Then you can use that money to buy better ships and better equipment.It is somewhat grindy i agree, but any game can be grindy just like EVE for example. It's how you play it i suppose.

												This game is more fun than I thought it would be... the plot (although kinda shallow on the side quests) is entertaining.The thing I find most enjoyable is that you can play it as a first-person space dogfighting game, or you can use the fire at will feature and just fly the ship while the computer does the shooting. Trading seems to be a waste of time at least early on up to where I'm at same for mining although its a little more lucrative. The gameplay is pretty addictive and you have to really grind pretty hard to earn enough money to build a decent ship - unless you use the cheats, which would probably instantly ruin the game completely.Definitely worth the couple bucks I spent on it, I probably wouldn't pay retail for it. However I'm a cheapskate in general so that statement holds true for me with pretty much anything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is easily the best space adventure game available!  Little Green Men Games did a superb job in incorporating those features that make a space exploration game enjoyable while avoiding anything that would be dull.There is a main-story quest line to keep you engaged with multiple side quests to mix things up.  Space travel feels exciting and scenic without taking years in between events (with added wormholes to speed things up a little more).  There are space pirates, some dangerous while others are targets of opportunity for some quick cash, especially if you capture their ship to sell to a nearby friendly space station.There seems to be just the right number of ship and weapon variety to not get overwhelmed while still feeling like you have a choice in weapon loadout and ship type.  There are even some that you acquire through quest lines or obtaining blueprints for exceptional weapon types, including torpedoes, plasma cannons, railguns, etc.Lots of Steam achievements, beautiful scenery, fantastic spacestation design.

However at the current stage the game stops being fun once you've leveled up to get your dream ship. There's no more challenge and the game becomes repetitive very quickly. Still the grind is very fun and there are many mods. In short: fun but little replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								So far this has been slow going. The tutorial could use some work and you will want to print the commands out. The game crashes for me on a Brand new Asus G760JZ so that is not good considering its the best laptop out there as of today.			",32,8,0,13,2,0,7

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a pretty fun Space Sim in my opinion. Trading, Capturing Ships, Fleet battles, Exploring, and just flying around and admiring the skyboxes are all a treat in this game. The graphics are good looking in many areas. The Gemini system is pretty damn big, too. On the down side, the game seems to have a hard time keeping a steady frame-rate, no matter how powerful your rig is. It's especially bad in large fleet battles. Other than that, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. At least until Star Citizen comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to like this game however the lower quality voice acting and the eventual repetitiveness of all of the mission are what broke it for me. There are still some missions that completely bug out for me and I am unable to complete them until I fail it and try again. The main story missions can be long and you can only save at the space stations so when it does fail half way through you have to start all over again and push through the voice acting once more.Other than mousing over the faction and reading it's description there is nothing that makes any of the factions feel personal in any way.There is the basis for a great game here and some might enjoy this title. I however cannot recommend it.Update:For a 9 man indie team then this is a very well done game. I must admit I did no research before reviewing. I'm very impressed that the developers care so deeply about their project to comment on my small post and describe their plans and ambitions for the future. I have decided to change my recommendation because in light of this I want this game to succeed. Space games are the future!			",36,4,0,6,4,0,8

												A quick review for this really cool space game.I spent 35 hours on this game, In that time I finished the base game + one DLC, reached maximum Level and bought on the best ship. So even if I am not an expert, I think I can write a fair review.+ Great Value.  You easily can beat the game 2 / 3 times without feeling bored. And the Dev team enhanced the First Starpoint to the new engine, it should give you around 50 hours more of gameplay.+ Cool graphic; not realistic like Elite Dangerous for example, but a very nice representation of space.+ Nice gameplay /  Mix of Rpg and tactic space game ; if you play in high difficulty it can be very challenging.+ A lot of things to do.+ A lot of ships and weapons to suit all tastes.+ A extremely nice and responsive Dev Team. Basically if you post anything ( interesting ) on the steam forum, there is good chances that a Dev will be the first to answer.+ A perfect example of how a Early Access should be done and handled.+ Mod support.- Scenario not great.- A little bit short. I know it is against my + on greate value, but the thing is  I think 35 hours to reach max level is a little bit to quick; of course if you want the best weapons you will have to spend a lot of times, but it lacks the motivation of leveling up.- At the end you are incredibly overpowered. Some may consider that a + , as a kind of reward but not for me.So highly recommend this game made by a very nice and little team of passionate Dev.Will by their next project without hesitation.

												I went into this game as a buffer between waiting on a few other games im looking forward to.  Keeping that in mind I do love all scifi/space games in general.  The beginning was difficult i was having a hard time learning the controls and ended up giving up within the first two hours.  I gave it another try and got the basics down and now am 36 hours into the game.  I found myself loving it and enjoying the mystery of the story.  From what i expect from a 30 usd game it surpasses in all categories.  Yeah tutorials are not great,  the voice overs are off sometimes  and not perfect, finding the help section or explainations in the game about buying selling or how to bounty hunt and null and void.  But with all that it is a 30 buck game reg price and i bought it for under 10 bucks.  I rather enjoy figuring out how to figure out all the aspects of making money in game.  I say 2 thumbs up for what it is and i enjoy it even though i dislike 3rd person or control the ship games where im not in a first person view.  36 hours into it im not even in the dlc yet and havent even explored all the space available in the game aswell.  I say its a win win!!!!			",210,12,5,11,8,2,11

												I Love this game. Its a space RPG but you never you leave your ship. Sure its a bit old but graphics and gameplay are great.Its not too simplistic to be considered an arcade space shooter but not a mad in depth space simulator. Its quite easy to learn how to pilot, fight, nav and trade. Along the way you got many ship upgrades and ships. However be prepared to earn the credits to buy these. The space fighting is alot of fun, however its very level dependent if you engage with an emeny above your level you die. So run away tactics are sometime needed until you own a fleet of ships. There are a few problems sometimes the space fights can just kill you in seconds. You can only save you game at stations which adds to tension but alot of time you just end up replaying the same mission or area of space because of it. The soundtrack I tured off within 4 hours of gameplay its repitive and anoying and the sound effects could be better.So gamrplay is quickly learned but sometimes the fights are too difficult.soundtrack could be better.graphics are up to standard.A fun space adventure.

												Yes get this game, wait do you need to hear the dialog and be given direction? Okay less one sided. But if those are both no then hell yes get this game.Where to start, I got this game on sale, and wanted to refund it. However I gave it one more try and managed to get through the first little bit, and all of a sudden I loved it like crazy...Side notes I guessI really like the ship details and variety, although I wish there were more. (I always want more ships)The story line got kind of lame and or broken near the end.The main dialog is painful. Punishment for warcrimes painful...So if you are going to give it a go -Turn off the dialog! ----Do IT! (the music is nice though, and in freeroam the dialog is much less death)-And get ready to be spammed like crazy by ""helpful"" tutorial pop ups as soon as you start. (some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Up front:  Not deep enough or fun enough to warrant a $35 entry fee.  Definitely worth it for $10.Pros:+Artwork.  Ships and backdrops are pleasant enough to look at and cruising through space in your ride of choice is nice.+Simple, easy to use interface and controls.  Love the interface.+Straightforward missions+Stable and nicely refined.  Have yet to run in to a ""broken quest"" or a significant bug of any kind.+Decent enough sized sandbox system to play in.  It takes 15 minutes to fly across Gemini even with the fastest ship. +Game adjusts difficulty rather well as you progress to bigger ships.+Soundtrack is a definite plus that matches the mood of the task at hand.+Lots of factions.  No, they don't really fight all that differently but...they are labeled differently.+Faction loyalty.  It is simple to see who you are friends with and who you should avoid.  System is easy and intuitive.+Decent variety of ships, loots and weapons keeps things interesting.+Fighters and bombers can be launched from you ship.+Perk system.  As you gain rank you can shape your fighting style and abilities.  Easy and effective without being OP.+Steam workshop enabled.  I find looking at the hind end of an Intrepid Class is nicer than the stock ships.Cons:-Game progression can be very grindy at times.-Uncompelling campaign became unbearable because of horrid voice acting.  I began playing free-roam instead.-Ships all fly and feel the same.  A battleship handles just as well as a frigate, it just has more weapons, shields etc. :(-Unable to target specific enemy ship systems.-Sensor range is pitifully low.  You'll always see things before your sensors do.-Combat feels shallow a good portion of the time.  Tactics rarely decide outcome, usually ship stats are it.-Combat AI is downright stupid at times. As a level 18 I destroyed a level 70 pirate because they kept chasing me.  My one pea-shooter gun could hit them from 800 out, their guns could only reach 550.  As they chased me I eventually wore down their forward shield and nearly destroyed them before they turned and ran.  At that point I ran them down, overtook and finished by shooting through their non-existent forward shield.-Controls are simple, but can be awkward at times.  No target padlock option. (Really?)-3rd person views only.  You will never be ""in your ship""and that hurts immersion.-No sense of running a crew.  Your ""crewmen"" are cards with stats that don't progress.-Game does not track ships destroyed, troops lost, total money accrued etc.  Nice touches that are easy to make.-Small variety in mission types.  Scan something, shoot something, ferry something.  That's pretty much it.-No ability to build up a true fleet, can just hire a couple mercs.-No feel of actually influencing events in the game world.-When you dock at a station or planet, all interactions are handled through a simple splash screen.Summary:Starpoint Gemini 2 is a nice little space romp for casual/arcade crowds.  I would personally prefer options available to transform this basic game experience into something a little more hardcore.  Replayability is hurt by lack of simulation options, inability to shape conflict and shallow combat mechanics.  Less than 20 hours in I have a dreadnought class warship, have maxed out alliances with half the factions and explored roughly 60% of the systems in the game.  I do not feel as though I will make any substantial new discoveries at this point, just find combinations of things already previously seen.  The game has begun to feel like a ""digital fishbowl"" but may come back if I find myself in the mood for mindless point and click with a spaceship involved.  Score: 7.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A slight variation on the standard space-battle game in that you get more firing control and ship manouvrability.  The tutorial is a little sketchy, simply as list of thing to read as you play along, rather than a hands-on episode specially designed for beginners.  Some great movie clips along the way, and graphics in general somewhat superior to the more basic plethora of space games out there.  Looks like it will hold my interest for longer than the ""usual"" disappointing games of this type.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far really enjoying this game. I am a huge fan of open-universe space games with ship and fleet customisations, but I do not like MMO-games (so unfortunately EVE is out of the picture for me). This game, to me, fills an X shaped void. It really offers a lot of what X3 had, and with some new and fresh ideas because it isn't X! And where the original Starpoint Gemini I couldn't get into because it simply wasn't as good as X, SG2 genuinly is. It is also particularly well timed, I loved all of the previous X games, until they released X reunion, which is probably the most sad, dissapointing and pathetic game ever made and totally missed the point of X and why it was good. I am glad to see that the developers of Starpoint Gemini have worked on, enhanced and listened to what space-gamers really want, and developed something that really fits. I am excitedly looking forward to where they take SG games in the future. I know I am basically saying ""it is the new X"", believe me when I say that coming from me, that is huge praise. If I were to nit pick, I would say that SG2s UI could use a little tweaking, the ability to zoom out on the map and a tool for selecting your own ships on the map and I'd like to see some of the fleet controls from X3 (for example telling a ships computer to go somewhere, protect something or trade something). I would also like to see space station ownership, and more skills and mods aimed at ship capture. But these are not huge criticisms, just where I think SG could be improved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is (in my opinion) one of the greater games on Steam. For those who are looking for a TASTE of EVE here you go. This game is almost like a baby stepping stone into the EVE universe. While the game does have its flaws as I will state, I believe that this sandbox game has great potental. Now, I will say that I do not believe it is worth $40 just yet. The modding community has yet to take off and you can cheat the game by simply opening your save in Notepad++ and editing the data. Which I believe somewhat cuts the fun out of comparing achievements to other players globally. The missions of hunting the heros are somewhat wonky as well because it seems they jump systems if you watch the map. Just as well, there is a very large difficulty spike in the game that you must prepare for. As you reach a certain level your enemies gain vet rank and you probably have yet to make enough money to even afford a ship that can stand up to them. (Unless you did what I do and stole a ship from the pirates) Now for the positives. This game has BEAUTIFUL scenery. For an indie game, a lot of time was put into this game and its atmosphere. The story and voice acting are a bit stale, but the fact that they are there is awesome. And the story, while being a bit dry, actually does make some form of sense. So kudos! At the start of the game you may pick to be a captain, engineer or another class that excels in firing. You may hire mercenaries to board ships or even follow you in to battle which is what the captains perks stand for. The shooter class perks somwhat speaks for itself. But I played as an engineer as the perks seemed to outweigh the others. The story is the same regardless of your class, but each class has its own specialties with 4 main ""moves"" But those moves have 5 evolutions within each allowing you to alter them as you go to tailor your playstyle up to the max level of 80. There are a plethora of planets to explore as well as tons of ships to purchase and try out. All in all, if you enjoy sandbox style games and as well as enjoy the beauty of flight or space travel, I recommend this game. I also recommend trying it if your thinking about EVE online. This game is a MUCH simpler thing. But it has many of the same aspects as well as can help you decide if you would even enjoy the simple aspects of what EVE offers before you worry about the more complex matters.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

The combat is engaging as well as the other aspects of the game. It is like a mix of Freelancer and the X series with a very user friendly interface. Fight pirates, trade, explore and everything else you love about a good 4X game. I recommend this to all fans of the genre.			",131,12,1,19,10,0,14

												If you like Freelancer and X-series, than we'll love this game :) This is a mixture of Freelancer and Eve-online. Furthermore the developers behind this game are the kind that still care a lot about their players :)-> A lot of freedom-> Great soundtracks / ambience-> Nice graphics-> Large scale-> Smooth gameplayIf you like a proper successor of X3, this comes a lot closer than X-Rebirth imo.

												This was a great game in beta and even better now that it's fully released. It may take a little while to get into but there's plenty plenty of exploring, missions, ships, weapons and upgrades and also Workshop support.I haven't looked into the campaign much since the freeroam mode interested me more, but it seems to just be freeroam with story missions.The freeroam missions are a little samey after a while but there's enough variety of mission types for you to choose to be a pacifist or a full on fighter.Would recommend this if you like open world space sims, with factions and a good variety of ship classes and ships.

												I love this game!! Though it should come with a warning: ""Warning, this game will make you lose sleep!"" heh. I've played quite a few space games throughout the years, X3 series, Wing Commander, Freespace 2, Starlancer, EVE, Star Wars X-Wing and more and this one ranks right up there imo. If you're into these types of games I highly recommend checking this one out! Pros:-Great graphics-Epic music-Fun sandboxy type of do whatever you want freedom-Devs are very active and responsive (big seller for me)-Ease of modding (probably my favorite aspect of this game)Cons:-Requires a bit of tweaking to optimize and run smoothly on lower end systems. (Though there are mods that help, and the community is always willing to help with this)-No Multiplayer (but this isn't a factor for me, in fact, it's one of the reasons I bought this game...no griefers, no obsessively overpowerful others pwning you within the first ten seconds of you logging in. And it doesn't take 8 months to be able to fly a battleship! :) )I can't think of too many cons because the devs are always working on improving things, and fixing the few bugs that have surfaced here and there. Every time I think of a con, I find out they've already fixed it!Also, I have never actually published a mod before this game. It is insanely easy to mod...you want to change your loading screen? Easy. Want to change the music? Sure, you don't have to go through some maddening process of decrypting game files just to get to them, and then re-encrypt them using 20 different programs just to do that. Want to fly a ship that looks like a banana? Yep. And you don't have to learn eleventy different programming languages to do that. There are fantastic guides that help as well. And the devs are always around somewhere willing to help. Yea, big plus for me.The sandboxy aspect is a big plus too. Want to just roam around for a bit and blow stuff up? Sure. Want to just mine and get rich trading? Yep. Want to be a wanted criminal with a limited life expectancy? No worries.			",41,13,0,6,5,0,2

												Starpint Gemini 2 is the definite successor of Wing Commander: Privateer and Freelancer.  I have been waiting for many years for a team to go back to the simple roots of many upgradeable ships and challenging freelance type missions and this game DELIVERS BOTH!  The learning curve is relatively easy and the incorporation of using the mouse and keypad versus a joystick has been accomplished (IMO) flawlessly.  I am enthralled by the fact that regardless of how much I upgrade my ship (currently running a Cruiser and looking to upgrade to a Dreadnaught) that the missions are still challenging.This is not a game of incredible voice acting or a fantastic storyline but the visuals and extremely sound mechanics make the game a pleasure to play.  My favortie addition is the boarding feature!  Wait until you have a ship with 90 or so troops and you can take Frigates with 30 - 50 tropps with ease and make a big payday when you tow your capture into port.  (NOTE:  Click on the GREEN flag in the troop transport window, after it turns from gray to green, to send more troops.  This is not spelled out in the manual.)Congrats to theis set of independent game creators!  Great job!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, saving's a problem, I'm relying on autosave quite a bit.  It's insanely frustrating, but also speaks to how much I'm enjoying the game that I'm still playing despite such grevious bugs.

												This games is awesome, hands down. You pilot a ship, it starts out a bit small but you can get very large ones. The thing that makes this game awesome is that you can just go anywhere and do anything. There is a story mode but it's not really important or vital to follow, I have mostly ignored it so far. Combat is a lot of fun, there is no ""strategic pausing"" or anything to strategize, and you really have a ton of stuff to micromanage. That said, your mechanical ability to think quickly, pilot your ship, use items/abilities, and position properly have HUGE outcomes on the combat. If you're good, you can do a lot with a little ship, if you're bad you can to little with a big ship. Combat is definitely an extremely fun aspect in this game but there is also so much more than just fighting other ships. The exploration in this game is really amazing. The landmarks (stations, planets, asteroid field locations etc) are static, everything else, the quests, the enemies, etc are completely random. You can pick a direction, put all power to engines, and fly to your hearts content. I actually spent an hour flying completely off the map. There isn't really anything noticeable out there except for a few enemies and such but it  definitely took me an hour to fly back. So yea, the exploration aspect in this game is huge, think skyrim in space but no drauger. So yea, awesome space battles, great exploration in a beautiful backdrop, it's really a lot of fun. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack. It's just ambient electronic but man it sets the mood well. I swear, this is the most relaxing game to play. Just mine asteroids, listen to the music, and be wisked away to a whole other solar system.Anyway, if you like exploring, enjoy space, and like relaxing for hours on end running cargo, hunting pirates, and looking at stars, you'll like this game.

												NOT A FINAL REVIEW, Amazing game even thou i have only played for a few hours i can already see a great game in the making. the detail of the ships as will as the weapons placement make sense. thou the ark of some are questionable. nothing that a few tweaks won't fix. Also supports mods which  i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off.  shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back.  I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again			",27,0,0,11,3,0,9

												I wrote this review in January of 2015 on Metacritic.  I thought I posted it to Steam, but did not.  This game deserves a review.  Here's a copy/paste of my former review.  The game has only gotten better through expansions.I am a Star Citizen backer. Want to know a dirty little secret? I love and crave 3rd person space games. En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game. ""A Steam sale?"" I asked. ""Twenty-four bucks?"" I blinked. ""I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife..."" So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing. Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am. ""Woah..."" The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party. Did you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game? What are you waiting for...? Pick this gem up ASAP. There are few games that are so worth your money that you'll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me. In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it's refreshing to see a game that's not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space. I feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, ""Big Red,"" until the time is truly right. There's dangers around every planet, but I've got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship. There's even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don't; whatever--it's all up to you. I can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it. I give it a 9 (I'd have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished. That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it's sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous's and Star Citizen's of the world. The development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community. It's mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there's already some great mods out there. It's much of anything you want in a fun game. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of this post I have about 2 hours in the game. Just what can I say about this game that 2 hours of game play has shown me?It is fantastic.Simplistic it is not, yet it is at the same time. If you were a Freelancer fan this game gets pretty close. It is not perfect, but being that it comes from a small group of people with a small budget they really rocked this game. The graphics are good, lower end computers should be able to run it without issue. The sound is great and the soundtrack I have not turned off yet and that is saying something.Campaign or free roam. Don’t feel like doing the campaign anymore go wonder off and blow something up. Want to make some money go bounty hunting. Want to get rich trade some goods. Want to pick a fight do it.This game is an 8/10 pretty easy. For those of us that have been missing Freelancer it really fills the gap rather well. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only problem for me (i dont know if others have this problem) is that, the game will suddenly minimize if I let it be for some minute and i cant open it to continue.

												Loved it! I loved that computers aimed my turrets. I loved the progression of ships, upgrades and mission difficulty. I never had to capture ships for money like some people seem to think is necessary, because I only bought a new ship when the old one couldn't survive the fight anymore (even with shield boosters and damage boosters), so I was able to skip corvette and never needed anything more than destroyer.  I also looked up the ship differences online so I bought the best in class for my fighting style.I would have loved more:Ability to buy a system to shunt energy distribution to 100% engine when activating PTE.Ability to buy HUD system to see tactical info on current target, even if it's behind me.Someone to buy 50 artifacts.Ability to buy more equipment slots, for non-combat equipment.I reconfiged Skip Dialog to the period key at the start and it never worked. Had to sit through some dialog while retrying a few tough missions more than I wanted to.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am mostly a multiplayer gamer, love COOP, most multiplayer games, however there are some which are fun offline, of course, and this is one of them. Unique gameplay, easy controls, especially when you're mostly committed to mouse and keyboard style gameplay, Haven't played in a while, though I haven't played much of anything lately; landscraping, as opposed to computer work which I've done for 20+ years, these days, am just tired when I get home from work, though if I didn't have a wonderful woman, cooking amazing food and keeping me enthralled with her ways, I'd probably game more, and before long I'll be back gaming and doing computer work. I love to work out-of-doors, but my skills are strong on the side of the technical realm. Back to the game, It is not too complex, don't get me wrong, I love complexity, but Starpoint Gemini does require quick thinking and reaction; observing it evolve through updates / patches since I bought it in the spring of 2014, the developers seem pretty intent on making this game something to speak of and they are certainly not ditching their creation, unlike other devs I've seen veer away from working on a game, not keeping to their promises.I recommend this game, for sure, especiallyl at this sale price, $10.49 as of September 28, 2015. For this price you absolutely cannot pass it up. To me, it is one of those games, I'll pick back up on, finish a few missions, upgrade my ship and be content, looking forward to playing again to utilize the new hardware and getting a feel for the upgrades and their impact on gameplay.Cheers to the devs and all who enjoy the style of gameplay.

								This looks like its going to be a great game...someday...which is the only reason I give it a thumbs up. I say 'someday' because I sat down and tried to play it today and after selecting gamepad with my xbox360 controller connected, I was forced to watch a series of tutorials that meant absolutely nothing to me because they were referencing joystick buttons rather than the familiar a,b,x,y,etc. They are also not interactive, which is great to help you learn the controllers. Simply saying that A = 'whatever' doesnt have nearly the same benefit as actually seeing what A does first hand. I searched online for an xbox 360 conroller map for this game and also came up empty. I kind of figured out the controller basics on my own. but I soon realized that the mouse has been completely disabled in the game, making impossible(?) to access certain hud elements.  ~scratches head~ Why would they disable the mouse??The other frustrating experience came right after the tutorials finished. I was left to play around on my own, but then I asked myself, now what? There was no nudge in any particular direction after the tutorial and even after landing on the planet (for a hefty fee) and a space station in orbit, I was still no closer to understanding how I should begin my journey. Between the lack of controller mapping info and the non-descipt beginning, I was left feeling somewhat abandoned.Now, I realize this is still in beta, so I think I will just shelve this game for now, until I can figure out how to play it properly. Hopefully with the help of a decent tutorial.			",39,14,1,12,21,0,20

												An addicting game that makes you want that super expensive ship. Capturing ships is most fun, and also the quickest way to earn a lot of money. Though after 18 hours, and having bought the best carrier-class ship, I'm not so eager to get back in and play again. But it was definitely a great 18 hours.Just some thoughts, a story-line, more insanely expensive ships to want, ability to hire captains who go out and do work for you as well, would make add more hours into the game.Also, a cockpit view with people would be nice to see the scale of different ships. All the ships look the same size and the planets just feel teeny ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Also, saving's a problem, I'm relying on autosave quite a bit.  It's insanely frustrating, but also speaks to how much I'm enjoying the game that I'm still playing despite such grevious bugs.

												This games is awesome, hands down. You pilot a ship, it starts out a bit small but you can get very large ones. The thing that makes this game awesome is that you can just go anywhere and do anything. There is a story mode but it's not really important or vital to follow, I have mostly ignored it so far. Combat is a lot of fun, there is no ""strategic pausing"" or anything to strategize, and you really have a ton of stuff to micromanage. That said, your mechanical ability to think quickly, pilot your ship, use items/abilities, and position properly have HUGE outcomes on the combat. If you're good, you can do a lot with a little ship, if you're bad you can to little with a big ship. Combat is definitely an extremely fun aspect in this game but there is also so much more than just fighting other ships. The exploration in this game is really amazing. The landmarks (stations, planets, asteroid field locations etc) are static, everything else, the quests, the enemies, etc are completely random. You can pick a direction, put all power to engines, and fly to your hearts content. I actually spent an hour flying completely off the map. There isn't really anything noticeable out there except for a few enemies and such but it  definitely took me an hour to fly back. So yea, the exploration aspect in this game is huge, think skyrim in space but no drauger. So yea, awesome space battles, great exploration in a beautiful backdrop, it's really a lot of fun. The icing on the cake is the soundtrack. It's just ambient electronic but man it sets the mood well. I swear, this is the most relaxing game to play. Just mine asteroids, listen to the music, and be wisked away to a whole other solar system.Anyway, if you like exploring, enjoy space, and like relaxing for hours on end running cargo, hunting pirates, and looking at stars, you'll like this game.

												NOT A FINAL REVIEW, Amazing game even thou i have only played for a few hours i can already see a great game in the making. the detail of the ships as will as the weapons placement make sense. thou the ark of some are questionable. nothing that a few tweaks won't fix. Also supports mods which  i already install one, and audio mod for the engines. even so the game is looking to be one that i will play for months if not years. the ship sized feel a bit off as they are not that different from smaller ships. maybe the dev will consider resizing some of the ships. some of the weapons sound could use some work as the laser as they are dont sound very flashy. i hope more options open up interms of upgrades you can do too the ships such as larger shield if the ship can handle it. Also ships you capture can be added to your fleet at a cost but not to the level of mercs after all they are your factions (player influence ) i do hope they add medium shields, turrets, the heavy weapons as they are now require rearming. would be nice to have some that are laser base that shot out a massive beam but take a long time to reg at no cost to rearming. that would be a good trade off.  shield don't always work as they should i often taken hits from the left only to take damage from the right shield ? as if the shots went right through my ship. none the less considering your getting a massive open sandbox world and lots of things you can do will keep you coming back.  I'm sure the dev will balance the classes as will as the damage in time. i really hope they continue to expand the RPG side of this game a bit more and add some more side mission (freelancer). Also be able to take bases for a faction. joining a fleet in order to win over a terrorties would be cool. so far i would give this game a 7 out of 10 and when its complete i'll review it again			",27,0,0,11,3,0,9

It's already better than X-Rebirth in its current state.  I can see I will be dumping a lot of hours into this before it is even released.  Now that there is a workshop, there are going to be lots of reasons to keep coming back to this before it is released.  Still lots of work to be done, but I am having fun regardless!

								This game, with or without the coming release of Star Citizen, is more than a welcomed member to the Space Game genre.  Whilst it is in it's BETA stages at the moment, it is already a lot of fun and as long as the creators of the game seek to balance it's world economy as best they can, make the univerese as big as possible and keep the game as flexible as it is, this is the game that will become Freelancer meets X2/3.  I'm reasonably new to the game and I am not sure if you can have ships that are trading for you in an automated fashion like in the 'X' series of games by Egosoft, but that would be nice.  I'll write another review when the game is complete.  Keep up the good work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As for being an early release or beta, many of the features don't feel like they're in beta at all.  In general most of my experience so far has felt very polished and enjoyable.  Combat at times can be a bit odd where an NPC will not exactly fly intelligently, but then again, I'm flying a frigate around a larger ship for a reason--perhaps they just can't roll their ship?I'm looking forward to new features and as of now know I have many hours to explore and experience the features already implemented.  Also, the workshop has made some nice addons for the game which are helpful for those of us with triple-screens/genre specific appreciations.

								Bar none Starpoint Gemini 2 has been the greatest space trading and combat sim experience I've had since I played EV Nova in elementary school, but I can tell it's going to be so much more than that (blasphemy I know). The developers are clearly involved with the community and dedicated to seeing this lore rich galaxy through to the launch without cutting any corners. As is, I already feel as though I've reaped far more than the value of my initial buy into the alpha and though I know there's far more in store I cannot wait to see what they come up with for story/main missions. Showing my bias again here: I hope they stick with the open universe route they've already got going a la EV Nova with various plotlines to follow for near endless replayability. I would also like to see the captains name and profile photo become customizable, but honestly that's the only 'nit' I have to pick. As I've touched on previously there are a few kinks which one would expect of any game in its beta phase that are being tirelessly identified and smoothed out, so don't make the purchase just yet if you'd rather wait for a finished product. However I can't stress enough how cool it's been to be even a small part of an emerging work of art like this. Seriously, these people deserve buckets of money and validation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well. The game itself looks quite attractive though it might at first sight be frightening with all the panels and buttons involved in the gameplay process.  But u need only 1 hour or a bit more to get used to it and comparing to good old X series the controls are VERY simple. The gameplay itself is quite fun but has some issues still. For example while doing ""taxi"" missions and stuff like that which is like 1000-10000 credit reward i managed to encounter a pirate that attacked me near the station. Thanks for the help of allied station system pilots i shot him down(though he was trying to run from me) and got rewarded with 8000000(!!!) credits. Which makes the other missions which i have to do in order to get exp absolutely silly regarding the reward they provide. And also there is still no main campaign task available (at least i couldn't find it in any menu). So the game is just a free roamer. But i hope it will get better. Music in game is decent. Overall i would rather recommend the game than not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Beta Review.First off, this is NOT my genre! I'm mainly fantasy (i.e. Wizardry, WarCraft, etc...) I'm much more turn based (i.e. Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, etc...) And I normally wouldn't even look twice at a flight sim game. But this game is fun!The game loads unexpectedly fast for being so vast and beautiful. The controls are very smooth (maybe even a bit unrealisticly so) and the hubs feel well thought out. For being a newly released into Beta game, it is very well polished (so far.)As of right now there seems to only be one mostly free-roaming map with little actual story or adventure to it, but even still I'm having a blast just discovering all there is to discover. I feel even with this one map there's still so many more hours (days even?) of fresh gameplay.If the Beta release is any indication of what the end product is going to be, it's going to be one great space game! And if someone releases a Firefly/Serenity Mod for Starpoint Gemini 2, I aim to misbehave.			",232,97,1,67,39,6,73

Early Access Review
								I have constantly shunned the games that say ""We are currently building our Beta version... blah blah blah."" As these game companies often move into the vapor ware that we all so hate.  Knowing that; and knowing that I have been seeking a great 4x game, (I just KNEW that one was out there somewhere), I purchased this game in the Beta 0.8 state.Now one might expect a lot of bugs and CTD from a large scale game like this.  With the small additions coming evey couple weeks I would expect the same.That all being said: 8/10 in its current form.I find this game amazing for a number of reasons.  The 4x aspect of this game is in place and you are allowed to pick ""free fly"" mode and just enjoy.  Fully armed pirates will come try to kill you, and you have to defend ships that ask for help if you are in the region.  The speed of some space sim games have put me off, you know, the three minutes slowly flying to the jump gate or what not.  Well SG2 gives you the ability to max out your engines with the push of one button and cruise wherever you want QUICKLY.  The speed of gaining levels is really great, you feel like you are doing something after you start killing pirates.  Getting an immediate advantage, then leveraging that advantage to kill more raiders and bandits.  You level up quickly because the max level seems to be above 70.  With several hours in I have reached level 15 and have an amazing 2.8M credit ship.  So you can play for a short period and feel great about the results.  But please note, this easy mode still allows for the chance that bandits get fed up and come to kill you.  I have been ambushed 3x and killed them only once... died in a burst of flame the other two times.  Love it, cannot wait for the story line.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This a amazing open space sandbox. It seems overwleming at first but its really basic once you get your bearings and controls down. I reccommend this to anyone that loves space combat or SiFi in genral. Plus with Steam Workshop the potantal of this game is massive. Its like EVE but without all the♥♥♥♥♥♥players. 8/10 ",86,9,1,11,13,0,9

												This gem is somewhere between the X series (vertical learning curve) and Galaxy on Fire 2 (my dog plays this game) in terms of difficulty with some of the best combat in any space game I've ever played.  SPG2 may not have any entirely new concepts or features but it has taken a lot from past games and the end product does all the little things right.  Ultimately this game meets the same fate as Skyrim, a giant world that is unfortunately only about 5 feet deep.  While I have absolutely no regrets throwing out $28 for it, I can't help but feel this game will be so much better in a year thanks to workshop support and a dev team that truly cares about their B - level game.  While the voice acting is pretty bad, It isn't House of the Dead 2 bad so it's playable, other than the voices the sound is pretty good, I could wish for a few more effects and songs but that's just nitpicking.  The one thing I truly don't like about this game is the faction system, if you do assignments in the Trinity sector your reputation goes towards lawful...Which means all lawful factions like you more, the unlwaful (pirates) well, they never liked you anyway.  If I do things in the Trinity sectors I want perks in the Trinity sectors, not halfway across the solar system.Unlike most titles I am actively looking forward to DLC for this game, which I'm hoping will greatly increase depth.-Throw in some: player built space stations, automating a freight company that I have built/stolen and funded, faction control, and territory conquering and this could truly be something special.8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												many hrs in....8 out of 10 stars. :) - Huge sandbox universe to explore and interact within. :) - Beautiful graphics and framerates with settings maxed out :) - Many Corporations with their own ship visual styles:) - Solid game - not the typical steam crowd-funded title.:( - All ships are the same graphic scale, regardless of the class size you are playing.  So be prepared to be underwhelmed by the Corvette or Frigate upgrade visually, as well as tactically - especially given the amount of time saving up for them.  You gain only an extra weapons mounting point or two each upgrade.:( - Fleet Commander? No, not really. You to hire mercenaries (max 2) that follow you (bumping into each other) that you have no command or interaction over what so ever.  Most of the time they go off and get themselves destroyed or wirte you off as MIA when the green rifts take you for a ride.Restarted many times to try all the player skill sets, and starting ship types.  I will continue to play it for now as I anxiously await patches and expansions - or as usual, the steam community to mod out the oversights that the devs / testers missed (ship scale, enemy bases don't consider you a threat, complexity doesn't scale with firepower).Perfectly priced for what you get - especially if you catch a STEAM sale.

												Where to start... The game itself requires some minor polish, mainly in the balancing sector, but it's already at a very good/stable state otherwise. There are various tasks to do inside the game, such as exploration, boarding ships, mining, trading(These do still need balancing.) and ofcourse, the campaign mode and pewpew fighting. The game is fairly complex, once you start getting into it, learning to fly and maneuver different ship classes, the firing arcs of various ships, finding fighting tactics that work for you and your ship, the enhancement system... And for those who get bored quickly after having played through the storyline, which did happen to a lot of players in other games such as Freelancer, you do have a nice amount of achievements to hunt, some of which aren't exactly easy to accomplish. Nothing is stopping you from hunting down the ""Heros"" either. ;)The community and the devs are active and communicating a lot, which reflects into the product and the pace patches, fixes and balancing attempts are coming through. There are plans for an expansion and DLC, which will further add to the amount of content in the game and ofcourse, the community made mods, which will be the crowning jewel of this game. The tools might not be fully functional yet, but as soon as the game itself is at a state where the devs and community are happy, the tools will be recieving some much needed love.A lot has been said about the game in many of the reviews, but here's another list of just some of the features already in the game and some which are being worked on:Already in:-Boarding Ships.-Working Campaign.-Lots and lots of ships.-Weapon/ship system enhancement.-Trading.-Dynamic events which effect item prices.-A large amount of space to explore, which can also be further expanded.-Lots of different factions.(Which will also get some more love in the future.)-Freeroam mode for those who don't wish to play the campaign.-Mercenaries to act as your backup.-Blueprints.-Working collision system.-Cloaking!-Heroes to hunt,-Mods.Planned/in the works:-Player owned faction and base(s).-Dynamic struggles for power/regional control between factions. Once this is implemented, every single playthrough will be and feel different!-Expansion/DLC.-Modding Tools.(Currently some work, some don't. Somewhat prone to crashes.)-Improvements to the HUD and other elements of the UI.-An entirely new ship class.(Larger, naturally. Bigger is always better!)... and the list goes on.If you aren't a fan of space sims or dislike games with emphasis on exploration, this might not be for you, as there is no MP in the game to increase its lifespan. However, if you do like what you've seen/read and can get past the fact that there is no MP and that the game relies entirely on mods/expansions/DLC to keep breathing fresh life into it, then this game just might be a perfect fit for you. Atleast I've completely fallen in love with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Started playing this in early access and to be honest I was a little dissapointed, I loved Starpoint Gemini, and this did not match up. I've come back to this since its offical launch and WOW its a completely differnt game; battles are challenging but do able; great range of ships each with thier own tatics; fantastic graphics; huge area to explore; good story line even if the voice acting is a little wooden. Learning curve is not too steep, commerce is not so profitable as to make you a instant millionare, combat is rewared with good bounty. all in all another little gem from the little green men.

												8/10 Free Roam Space Sandbox. Limited to one ship at a time, like Elite or Freelancer, but the options are very wide. Uncloak and Pirate hapless enemies, Haul freight, Mine, Smuggle, command a Battleship with it's own fighters like Galactica, explore space with an independent powerful Cruiser with beams & torpedo loadout- it's all possible.  Collect Troopers at planets & stations to build up a fighting space marine force, and take over enemy ships! Huge spaceship selection, and storage at stations make collecting your own fleet a long term hobby. Limited customizing possible on the visuals, but you can spend time tinkering with engines, cloaks, weapons loadouts, transporters etc till you get her exactly how you like.  Random missions in Freeroam mode give you a foothold on things to do, but they are entirely optional. You can switch sides, and support any faction you like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, where to begin. I bought this game less then a week after official release, so i can imagine that some things will change, and they rightly should, but i do hope they leave it mostly together! It takes a bit to get used to (especially after playing Freelancer like a fan boy for years) and let's get this straight: IT'S NOT FREELANCER! But that's not exactly a terrible thing. i guess i'll just list the negative points first:1 - tracking speed is too slow, especially in turret view (and yes i have turned my sensitivity higher, no help)2 - enemies spawn too close to friendly bases sometimes, and prevent you from docking (especially annoying when trying to complete a taxi mission or bring in a captured ship)3 - friendlies don't care that you are trying to cap that expensive ship, and is REALLY annoying when they destroy it within SECONDS of capturing it!4 - trying to capture a ship too close to certain anomoly's (spelling is crap, but im drinking, so understand) and wormholes can lead to MASSIVE frustration, as your grappling beam will disconnect, but granted, is generally not a problem.5 - auto pilot can be worse then having a drunk, blind, parapalegic man (or women) with 1 arm and 2 fingers try to drive a car with half a steering wheel through a mine field... (seriously, it will take me in multiple 360 degree circles, then crash me into a station and multiple asteroids, just for good measure, i assume)i'll edit more in when i think of them, but only 5 reletivly minor things to complain about! pretty good! Also, the price is NOT ♥♥♥♥ing 60 bucks, for a BRAND NEW GAME where im sure the moderators will edit on a regular basis!TL:DR: buy it. now. all this game really needs is a little smoothing over, and it'll be a 10/10. as it is, i'd give it 8.5/10 which is pretty high praise for a brand new game! (also, some sort of multiplayer would be cool, at least a co-op, although i have no idea how they'd implement this... just a pipe dream for now). Did i mention it's mod friendly!?P.S. buy it. now... why haven't you yet?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A very enjoyable experience so far, only a few hours played but I'm looking forward to logging in and flying my starship around.    As for being an early release or beta, many of the features don't feel like they're in beta at all.  In general most of my experience so far has felt very polished and enjoyable.  Combat at times can be a bit odd where an NPC will not exactly fly intelligently, but then again, I'm flying a frigate around a larger ship for a reason--perhaps they just can't roll their ship?I'm looking forward to new features and as of now know I have many hours to explore and experience the features already implemented.  Also, the workshop has made some nice addons for the game which are helpful for those of us with triple-screens/genre specific appreciations.  Love flying my intrepid class!Hope this review helps and look for me on Twitch at twitch.tv/aedaric for gameplay of this game as well as many others!Also, dev's--hope you add in the ability for cosmetic updates/purchases, would love to help support you in another way as I did purchase the game via the 33% and feel this ""Early Access Game"" would of been worth the full price!

All of the things i loved about Freelancer, and none of its flaws.If you liked Freelancer, you will like this. I promise.POST OFFICIAL RELEASE REVEIEW:I still love it, except now I have discernable goals to achieve, instead of an endless grind that gains you a bigger ship to make grinding easier to buy an even better ship. The story thus far is interesting, and i have played the campaign mode for several hours now. Ive only done two missions, but thats because i wanted to do other stuff first.This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥STELLAR!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Bar none Starpoint Gemini 2 has been the greatest space trading and combat sim experience I've had since I played EV Nova in elementary school, but I can tell it's going to be so much more than that (blasphemy I know). The developers are clearly involved with the community and dedicated to seeing this lore rich galaxy through to the launch without cutting any corners. As is, I already feel as though I've reaped far more than the value of my initial buy into the alpha and though I know there's far more in store I cannot wait to see what they come up with for story/main missions. Showing my bias again here: I hope they stick with the open universe route they've already got going a la EV Nova with various plotlines to follow for near endless replayability. I would also like to see the captains name and profile photo become customizable, but honestly that's the only 'nit' I have to pick. As I've touched on previously there are a few kinks which one would expect of any game in its beta phase that are being tirelessly identified and smoothed out, so don't make the purchase just yet if you'd rather wait for a finished product. However I can't stress enough how cool it's been to be even a small part of an emerging work of art like this. Seriously, these people deserve buckets of money and validation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Well. The game itself looks quite attractive though it might at first sight be frightening with all the panels and buttons involved in the gameplay process.  But u need only 1 hour or a bit more to get used to it and comparing to good old X series the controls are VERY simple. The gameplay itself is quite fun but has some issues still. For example while doing ""taxi"" missions and stuff like that which is like 1000-10000 credit reward i managed to encounter a pirate that attacked me near the station. Thanks for the help of allied station system pilots i shot him down(though he was trying to run from me) and got rewarded with 8000000(!!!) credits. Which makes the other missions which i have to do in order to get exp absolutely silly regarding the reward they provide. And also there is still no main campaign task available (at least i couldn't find it in any menu). So the game is just a free roamer. But i hope it will get better. Music in game is decent. Overall i would rather recommend the game than not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Beta Review.First off, this is NOT my genre! I'm mainly fantasy (i.e. Wizardry, WarCraft, etc...) I'm much more turn based (i.e. Master of Orion, Galactic Civilizations, etc...) And I normally wouldn't even look twice at a flight sim game. But this game is fun!The game loads unexpectedly fast for being so vast and beautiful. The controls are very smooth (maybe even a bit unrealisticly so) and the hubs feel well thought out. For being a newly released into Beta game, it is very well polished (so far.)As of right now there seems to only be one mostly free-roaming map with little actual story or adventure to it, but even still I'm having a blast just discovering all there is to discover. I feel even with this one map there's still so many more hours (days even?) of fresh gameplay.If the Beta release is any indication of what the end product is going to be, it's going to be one great space game! And if someone releases a Firefly/Serenity Mod for Starpoint Gemini 2, I aim to misbehave.			",232,97,1,67,39,6,73

								I have constantly shunned the games that say ""We are currently building our Beta version... blah blah blah."" As these game companies often move into the vapor ware that we all so hate.  Knowing that; and knowing that I have been seeking a great 4x game, (I just KNEW that one was out there somewhere), I purchased this game in the Beta 0.8 state.Now one might expect a lot of bugs and CTD from a large scale game like this.  With the small additions coming evey couple weeks I would expect the same.That all being said: 8/10 in its current form.I find this game amazing for a number of reasons.  The 4x aspect of this game is in place and you are allowed to pick ""free fly"" mode and just enjoy.  Fully armed pirates will come try to kill you, and you have to defend ships that ask for help if you are in the region.  The speed of some space sim games have put me off, you know, the three minutes slowly flying to the jump gate or what not.  Well SG2 gives you the ability to max out your engines with the push of one button and cruise wherever you want QUICKLY.  The speed of gaining levels is really great, you feel like you are doing something after you start killing pirates.  Getting an immediate advantage, then leveraging that advantage to kill more raiders and bandits.  You level up quickly because the max level seems to be above 70.  With several hours in I have reached level 15 and have an amazing 2.8M credit ship.  So you can play for a short period and feel great about the results.  But please note, this easy mode still allows for the chance that bandits get fed up and come to kill you.

								This a amazing open space sandbox. It seems overwleming at first but its really basic once you get your bearings and controls down. I reccommend this to anyone that loves space combat or SiFi in genral. Plus with Steam Workshop the potantal of this game is massive. Its like EVE but without all the♥♥♥♥♥♥players. 8/10 ",86,9,1,11,13,0,9

So long as this game maintains regular patching support as well as updates, addons and expansions. This game will be epic!

												This game is well done by Iceberg interactive.  The story however has cheesy scripts and poor english at times.  But its a story nonetheless I haven't beaten it yet but There are many things to do in the game.  Think of Star Wars Galaxies Space combat but with the ability to toggle manual firing on and off.  And have the ability to transfer power to different subsystems.   The Trading system is however limited.  As most stations and planets have only at most 40 units of anything to be sold.  Your best bet to make lots of cash without a freightliner is doing freelancer missions.  Each space station or planet can have different ships you can buy to use.  The weapon system could use some fine tuning though.  It would be nice if while using manual fire the railguns were easier to tell where they hit.  As well as include a reticule aim assist that give you a circle showing where you should aim to lead the target and hit with non-beam weapons.   Iceberg interactive seem to be getting better and better at making their games.  I hope they make more games like this, with some improvements of course.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever played Privateer or any other Wing Commander game, this is very similar. It looks prettier, has less depth at the moment but the devs seem dedicated enough to keep supporting it. I started playing in Alpha, there wasn't much to do and hardly anything was implemented. I stopped for a while, played again after release and was pleasently surprised at the progress made. Seems like some things I had suggested during Alpha were actually changed. I honestly didn't expect this much progress to be made. If you like flying around, shooting stuff, looting cargo and completing missions for credits to upgrade your ship, crew and NPC ship buddies than this game is for you.			",56,2,0,8,3,1,19

												Very fun. Kind of like a space sim crossed with an RPG but in a good way. Only just beginning but I can tell this is going to be a great game for my tastes. If you like Freelancer at all, this game is a must buy. The graphics are beautiful and it's a genuinely fun game. The systems are a little intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it you'll be lighting up space like some sort of...thing...that does that...that provides light. In space. Through 'splosions. It's not necessarily the fastest-paced game but it's certainly not slow-paced at all. Sometimes you do small mundane things like mining asteroids for ores or scanning anomalies in deep space to farm xp. I can see how that might seem tedious to some. I personally enjoy that kind of stuff to break up the intense space battles. I've only gone after low-level guys in my little ship so far, but I can see how you could command huge fleets or have some massive♥♥♥♥♥kicking frigate at your own command and go headfirst into the toil of battle. Let me give you a TL;DR:Fun game, slower paced farming stuff to do, really fun and exciting space battles, beautiful scenery, decent music. Definitely worth 40 bucks, though I got mine 20% off.

												A very well put-together mix of a bit of Sid Meier's Pirates and Sci-Fi, with a bit of trading put in if you want to do this. Perhaps a bit too much emphasis on the combat, but the combat is good, and there are plenty of weapons to choose from. Moreover, the visuals are great, even if a few features aren't working as of this being posted. Free Roam could use a bit of extra stuff to do, and the I only played a tiny bit of the campaign and got put off by the silly voice-acting. But overall, it's a solid Sci-Fi game, and definately worth buying. Especially with it's workshop support! Hope to see lots of mods soon! (Especially Star Wars ones :) )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Started playing this in early access and to be honest I was a little dissapointed, I loved Starpoint Gemini, and this did not match up. I've come back to this since its offical launch and WOW its a completely differnt game; battles are challenging but do able; great range of ships each with thier own tatics; fantastic graphics; huge area to explore; good story line even if the voice acting is a little wooden. Learning curve is not too steep, commerce is not so profitable as to make you a instant millionare, combat is rewared with good bounty. all in all another little gem from the little green men.

												tl;dr: If you ever wanted a game that plays like Star Trek Online, but is actually good, buy this game.You have all the basics of an open world space game - trading, piracy, bounty hunting, mining, scavening etc, but here you don't fly small fighters, but mostly capital ships. The smallest craft are gunships that already dwarf a fighter, and from there you have the entire scale up to massive freighters, dreadnoughts and carriers.You can outfit your ship with a variety of light weapons (e.g. rail guns, plasma cannons, beam lasers) and heavy weapons (e.g. torpedoes, missiles, ion cannons), plus you can install upgrades to both the weapons and the various components of the ship.Ships handle basically the same as in Star Trek Online, however you can choose between setting your turrets to fire-at-will or manual crosshair aiming. You have the four shield quadrants, weapons have distinct firing arcs, and thus some ships are better suited for frontal assault, others can deliver heavy broadside attacks. The game also features power distribution - at any time you can freely adjust your power between engines, shields and weapons, and I must say the UI for that is very slick, with a handy snap-on center point for a balanced distribution.Speaking of ships, there is not just a variety in stats and turret placement, but a great variety in visual styles. From Battlestar Galactica-style bulky ships (my favourite is the Bishop class battleship) to organic-looking cruisers, there should be something for everyone's taste.Space itself is not realistic. The game takes place within a star system with a binary star, and both the sizes of objects and all distances are massively scaled down. That's the one thing I am missing, that feeling of vast emptiness in space. Though the  Gemini System is large, seamless and sprawling, you come across a space station, mining platform, planet, asteroid field, nebula etc. every few steps. It's a busy place, maybe a bit too busy.The skill system is rather simple, but does its job. There are 3 classes, each with 4 unique special abilities, and every level you get 1 skill point to upgrade one aspect of one ability. All abilities have multiple effects, and therefore can be developed into different directions. Every 5 levels you get a perk point which can be used on passive bonuses like increased turn speed, better trading prices, higher mining yield or more damage with a weapon category.The graphics are very nice. The ships are gorgeously detailed, you can zoom in and see things like individual windows, weapon turrets are fully animated and you can even adjust your ship's color and metal glossiness (from dull to polished), you can even choose from a variety of decal and even give it name which is printed onto the hull.But it's not just the ships. For example, SG2 features some of the most beautifully looking asteroid fields; the asteroids even cast shadows on the surrounding dust!The sounds are well done, too, the UI sounds very Star-Trek-y and the engines, weapons very Star-Wars-y (i.e. the best of both worlds). But the highlight is the music. I've had the game during Early Access but only towards the actual release was most of the music added, and all I can say is that I was mightily surprised by how epic it is.Finally, a few positive words about the community. The atmosphere is generally helpful and friendly, and the devs are very active on the Steam forums and are really listening and interacting with the players. The game is also Steamworks modding enabled, and you can already find stuff like the obligatory Star Trek ship packs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10I really enjoy open ended space sim games. This one is a very happy medium between easy to learn and fun to play.It does not have the vast options and customization as games like EVE or X, but I would trade that for a more fun and easy to play game.Like:-Open world with a variety of play styles.-Good selection of ships and equipment loadouts.-Looks great, cool ship and station designs. fairly immersive-Easy to learn controls and interfaces, even decent camera control.-Combat is fun and sometimes intense.Really enjoyed:-Capturing ships.-Trading (Easy to use ""best buy/sell"" interface!)-Exploring, pirate hunting-Completing full loadouts on a ship feels very accomplishing.Dislike:-Map feels small and underwhelming.-Copy pasted missions (gets old in any game though.)-Story started out pretty lame (avenge my father! collect stuf!) but i didnt get far into it. voice acting was passable..-Random impossible difficulty battleships showing up out of nowhere, or even in a mission.-I feel like some stats are missing, or hard to manage when making a loadout. Such as:Weapon energy consumption vs regen. And how to buff regen / lower consumption?Turret arc max angles. Fix: List this on ship stats, or a visual on the loadout page would be awesome.A better display of your ships stats (the circular display looks very awesome, but is not practical when zoomed out.)Is there a display for your own crew size? I may have missed it, from my reason above.Recommended for any type of space sim fan, but definitely leaning towards casual.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the more solid EA titles. While there isn't much content in the game, its good to know that Starpoint Gemini 2 has a good engine running for it, gameplay is smooth and its pretty easy to get used to, especially for a space combat/sim game. While much of the content is still missing (No storyline, limited skill development, No Wingmen etc), its playable. If you're into some space pewpew, you may want to keep an eye on this gem as it may turn out to be a Freelancer contender.			",83,12,0,13,20,1,24

												Okay, where to begin. I bought this game less then a week after official release, so i can imagine that some things will change, and they rightly should, but i do hope they leave it mostly together! It takes a bit to get used to (especially after playing Freelancer like a fan boy for years) and let's get this straight: IT'S NOT FREELANCER! But that's not exactly a terrible thing. i guess i'll just list the negative points first:1 - tracking speed is too slow, especially in turret view (and yes i have turned my sensitivity higher, no help)2 - enemies spawn too close to friendly bases sometimes, and prevent you from docking (especially annoying when trying to complete a taxi mission or bring in a captured ship)3 - friendlies don't care that you are trying to cap that expensive ship, and is REALLY annoying when they destroy it within SECONDS of capturing it!4 - trying to capture a ship too close to certain anomoly's (spelling is crap, but im drinking, so understand) and wormholes can lead to MASSIVE frustration, as your grappling beam will disconnect, but granted, is generally not a problem.5 - auto pilot can be worse then having a drunk, blind, parapalegic man (or women) with 1 arm and 2 fingers try to drive a car with half a steering wheel through a mine field... (seriously, it will take me in multiple 360 degree circles, then crash me into a station and multiple asteroids, just for good measure, i assume)i'll edit more in when i think of them, but only 5 reletivly minor things to complain about! pretty good! Also, the price is NOT ♥♥♥♥ing 60 bucks, for a BRAND NEW GAME where im sure the moderators will edit on a regular basis!TL:DR: buy it. now. all this game really needs is a little smoothing over, and it'll be a 10/10. as it is, i'd give it 8.5/10 which is pretty high praise for a brand new game! (also, some sort of multiplayer would be cool, at least a co-op, although i have no idea how they'd implement this... just a pipe dream for now). Did i mention it's mod friendly!?P.S. buy it. now... why haven't you yet?			",82,14,0,29,17,0,30

												8/10 Free Roam Space Sandbox. Limited to one ship at a time, like Elite or Freelancer, but the options are very wide. Uncloak and Pirate hapless enemies, Haul freight, Mine, Smuggle, command a Battleship with it's own fighters like Galactica, explore space with an independent powerful Cruiser with beams & torpedo loadout- it's all possible.  Collect Troopers at planets & stations to build up a fighting space marine force, and take over enemy ships! Huge spaceship selection, and storage at stations make collecting your own fleet a long term hobby. Limited customizing possible on the visuals, but you can spend time tinkering with engines, cloaks, weapons loadouts, transporters etc till you get her exactly how you like.  Random missions in Freeroam mode give you a foothold on things to do, but they are entirely optional. You can switch sides, and support any faction you like.			",16,3,0,12,0,0,6

								I just bought the beta of this game.  Its got some brilliant little additions to the first one and seems to be graphically superior to the original.  There is a problem on my desktop in that the playing screen doesn't automatically resize to fit my screen.  Its too large so anything on the right hand side isn't viewable when I try to play the game.  I had to guess with the tab button until it cycl;ed through which is how I was able to play it.  I recommend supporting this game however as its lineage is very good and I can see in what little I could play a really good game.  I shall be here for the long haul.			",112,38,0,49,27,0,57

								Wow. What a fantastic game! While it is in beta, I found there was lots to do in this game. Lots of exploration and complete freedom to do as you wish. In a space sim, for me at least, that's a very necessary feature. I plan on logging many more hours on this game in the future.This game is absolutely beautiful. The universe feels immense; it feels like I could fly in any direction for miles. Just set a course, put full power to engines, and see what I come across. The game rewards exploration.Some of the graphics optimization features are locked as it is in beta, but I found that lowering the graphics settings available and the game's resolution fixed any issues I was having. I anticipate that anyone with a more modern rig would have no issues running this on high settings.Overall, it's worth the price they're asking for it. Good job devs! Looking forward to what comes in the future!			",103,29,0,30,34,0,33

								This games has tons of potential. It has decent graphics, good game controls, easy to learn and best of all, it's pretty addicting. There are three character classes, different type of ship classes, different kinds of ships within the classes, four different weapon types and tons of missions to do in sandbox mode.  I've been playing as the gunner,  especializing on weapons systems,with the ability to adds different bonuses to the weapon system of choice. My weapon of choice being rail-guns.  It's up to you how you want to play. You have the option of playing as a pirate, enforcer, bounty hunter, miner, trader or a freelancer (combination of all). How effective you are doing each type of job depends on the ship, the combination of skills you select as you increase in experience and buying a license. License determine how much money you will receive depending on what the license is for. For example, a mining license will get you more money when selling ore, a police license will reward you with moneyfor everykill, and so on so forth. The point of it all is to make money, so you can get better ships and better gear, you know, the same old formula that keeps us coming back for more.  Overall I really like this game and if you are a fan of freelancer and games likes these I dont think you will be disappointed. The best part? It's only  going to get better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever played Privateer or any other Wing Commander game, this is very similar. It looks prettier, has less depth at the moment but the devs seem dedicated enough to keep supporting it. I started playing in Alpha, there wasn't much to do and hardly anything was implemented. I stopped for a while, played again after release and was pleasently surprised at the progress made. Seems like some things I had suggested during Alpha were actually changed. I honestly didn't expect this much progress to be made. If you like flying around, shooting stuff, looting cargo and completing missions for credits to upgrade your ship, crew and NPC ship buddies than this game is for you.			",56,2,0,8,3,1,19

								Wow, suprised! This game was actually dang good! The reviews werent wrong at all. Its very similar to the X3 / X series of games except without the headaches, no laggy menus, no shoddy UI/maps, basically its everything that you wanted X:rebirth to be.. almostIts not the best game in the world, however the developers are hard at work polishing this title into a true gem. Its esentially flying around in space doing rpg-like stuff and creating your own armada/fleet and waging war.  Theres a few small issues and bugs left to be fixed and some features that will be implemented in the future, so this title has a bright future ahead of it, even though its worth buying As-is.  Theres moddability in the game itself so im sure the modding community will be able to fix/implement what the devs do not. The devs are actually active on the forums and not just to censor creativity and announce p2w and microtransaction garbage. If you like RPGs, buy it, support it, who knows? This platform/title could have a VERY bright future ahead of it.  This is probably the only Early Access title that isnt a rip off out of the lot.... And that's coming from one of the most virilent critics of the early-access system, so you know its for real.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Starpoint Gemini 2(Just Released into Beta) is exactly what you want from this genre.Compared to other space games in its genre, this game has more of an arcade style of gameplay.  If you are expecting the depth and simulation of something such as the X-Universe then you will probably want to avoid this game.   However if you want to just fly around in a beautiful world, and combat enemies with responsive and fuild controls then this game is for you. The ship designs are very beautiful and unique. The enviornments are very good and beautiful to look at as you go through the game.There are many different factions within the game that will end up fighting each other.  As well as many you can gain or lose rep with that will effect your standing with them.   The controls are easy to understand and reponsive.   Combat can be fought in several ways, you can hire a crew to improve stats of your ship such as accuracy, dodge, shields, etc.  However you can also tell the gunner to shoot for you, so either you can fly and have the A.I. shoot for you or you can Shoot and fly yourself.  This provides a nice change of pace for when you are wanting the A.I. to focus on defense or attack while you just maneuver the ship. ",528,142,14,124,67,4,121

								I just bought the beta of this game.  Its got some brilliant little additions to the first one and seems to be graphically superior to the original.  There is a problem on my desktop in that the playing screen doesn't automatically resize to fit my screen.  Its too large so anything on the right hand side isn't viewable when I try to play the game.  I had to guess with the tab button until it cycl;ed through which is how I was able to play it.  I recommend supporting this game however as its lineage is very good and I can see in what little I could play a really good game.  I shall be here for the long haul.			",112,38,0,49,27,0,57

Early Access Review
								This, game. I am enjoying it for all the reasons I bought it. Specifically, the play a game with the full freedom to drift aimlessly in space to look at something and say to myself... ""I should go there"" and be able to go there.  Issues arise in that so far there is no campaign, so there is a no guided leveling structure. Which is nice and freeform, but leaves you with a... ""hrmm, now what"", feeling similar to the sims or minecraft if you don't have a personal goal.  So far, you start off as  a rather beefy frigate off the bat, and from there are told there are other things you can do with your life beyond be a pirate/merc. Don't listen to that voice, stealing ships via boarding parties is the only way of acquiring money relatively quickly beyond the rare, bounty list job.  Which brings up space combat! This is both so much fun, and so much rage. Fun part! Depending on your choice of weapons, you are able to join random battles in space with next to no reprecursions as the two parties fight for life and you zap your enemy (see red guy), due to some laughably long range and guess shooting. Or you are able to watch in horror as you enter an area of space where everyone has some horrifyingly powerful guns that destroy your shields, hull, and happiness before you can make a pass at escape. Major issue is that you don't know what they are packing in weapons, you can't tell untill they open up on you, and the little info blerp provided is vague, very much so. The description varies from ""trivial"" to ""Impossible"", but you are not informed how they are rated to determine threat level to you. I seem to think it is an unspoken amalgamation of your ships type, and load out mixed with your level. But!  Trivial enemies in twos can wreck your life for reasons you are unsure of (maybe they are small glass cannons that are only GUN). Deadly enemies can just float around you in vain trying to bring their weapons to bare before dying to the explosion of their metal death trap.  Also, each ship has a load out of weapons, that are placed on four compass based directions on your ship, and each has a firing arc that is not discussed much, and even some of the fully decked vessels will always have blind spots in their firing patern.  So you are shooting, zapping, and hitting with all due fun then slightly tilt your ship to the left and stop. The weapons also have a range... which is an ignorable text box since it only matters in ""Fire at Will"" mode, unless you are being shot at then your AI ignore it just like you do and open up shooting everything like a Ork Freeboota.Exploration is fun, though potentially deadly since the whole area is teeming with bandits looking for the sweet rolls in your ships captain's quarters. There are about four mains ways of travel. Cruising, which is deadly and fun since for no reason at you can be cruising at a great speed (you think) then are knocked out of your cruise mode by pirates wanting you dead even if they are in no way a threat.  Or there are T-gates! Think stargate and that is exactly it, you anchor at the place and for a modest fee, travel in safety from one end of space to another point in space! T-gates are almost always at a space station/planet you can dock at (if your faction rep says so) and are the safest (relatively) way to go long distances.  Then there are wormholes..... wormholes are kinda like t-gates, if t-gates were a game you pay for up front, wormholes are the f2p that suck you in and slowly rob you with you having no knowledge where you are going. They are free to use, but they will kill your troopers (dudes you have on board to steal ships or keep yours from being stolen) each time and break your ship a little. And when I said sucked in I mean they have a gravity well that pull you into it and spits you out of another one, which is great but that other one has a gravity well too that pulls you into it. If not careful and if there are different pairs of wormholes nearby you can end up alone on your now burning ship on the other side of the map not really wanting to try to return.   Lastly there is an item that lets your teleport your ship in a circular radius of map hexes based on how many you want to use at time. Only to hexes you have already been to, semi safe since you have no clue what is waiting for you, can get expensive (you need a massive amount of the already costly items to even trying moving halfway cross map) but you wont get jumped on route like in cruising so, win?Lastly for now is the level up process... You can get experience from quests (variable from oh, nice to meh), and pirati- I mean defending your local area from them pirates and invaders. What does it do? lets you level certain skills you have chosen based on a life style of play I do not think impacts game too greatly. Really for most of the area I forget to use the things until I am nearly dying and go Save Me Buttons!  And Perks, perks are like skills but they are not tied to the action skills, they are always active.   Skills and Perks I think would be more impacting if they were not so dang situational, the buttons are very much a maybe use. Perks are very tied to certain aspects of the game, but are not acquired quickly enough to even remember to check for them. Or feel like they even do much when used.  It is a nice, balanced feature, but when you are able to reset your skills and perks the choices are less impacting on your decision time. I still am very happy I spent the cash on it, and if you like SPESS PIRATEZ, then you can be one in this one.  I do hope they keep this mode active if they come out with a story mode too.

								Really impressed! It plays like a mix of Freelancer, X3 and Eve. It's super intuitive to pick up and play and the menus are all neatly laid out and self explanatory without sacrificing your ability to do what you need to do. Combat varies depending on the ship but for the most part it's slower than the frantic arcade dogfights seen in Chris Roberts games; with more emphasis on positioning and presenting sides of your ship to enemy.Trading and economy functions as you'd expect, with goods costing more or less dependant on their origins and the political affiliations. There's a fair amount of contraband so it's best not to use the ""Loot All"" button if you're trying to live a virtuous life.In terms of Early Access content; the game feels very polished already with much of the world content seemingly in place and all game systems working as you'd expect. The current starting scenario is possibly a little bit easy, starting you off as it does with a mid level ship and plenty of tools already at your disposal. The missions are all randomly generatied (apparently depending on your actions, though I've yet to make a big enough impact on my galaxy to see this) and most of them follow a fairly standard template. It'd be nice for some more intensive missions with multiple stages but the ones that are there give you enough to do, and when they involve going through hostile areas they can become quite harrowing. The full game will have a story mode, which isn't present in this E.A release, so who knows what that will entail.			",313,50,3,43,36,2,61

								This game does something that no other space themed game will let you do, captian your own ship and do whatever the hell you want in a massive open world. This game could already be realeased with the content in it so far and it is only in beta. It has limitless potential for mods. The only big issue with it is that you can't get mods off of the steam workshop yet because it will crash if you do. A great game already with great potential and well worth the 25 dollar early access price.			",137,7,0,25,33,1,58

I feel like Im just fighting robots, I would love to see some personalities of the factions and to find out more about them and who I want to help or destroy.

												Great game while I'm waiting for Elite: Dangerous. Seems to push all the right buttons - it's one of those games where you keep telling yourself ""I'll just to this one last mission"" and before you know it you've spend the whole day on it. For me, it is what I wanted from X: Rebirth - note I never bought X:Rebirth due to the abysmal reviews at release.The developers of Starpoint Gemini 2are active on Steam and seem to take comments & reports serious. At version 1.0001 it's not perfect yet and the GFX could need some performance optimization but that's to be expected two days after release. Overall a good start. If you're into space freeroaming, get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game's excellent. It's like what you'd get if you mixed Eve-Online with the original Privateer game from the 90s. There's a huge world to explore, lots of backstory and content, and you can decid to freeplay it or follow the plot at any point. The developers are very responsive about fixing bugs or improving the game. I emailed in a couple of bug reports with log files, and they responded that they were working on it, and released a patch the next day. They have released two minor patches in the day since they have released.			",54,7,0,11,44,0,19

This makes me believe that SG2 will be superGREEN (yes, this is a quote from a movie, go watch it) at launch!!So, in my opinion, if you don't grab SG2 when its on SALE (and you like/love space games) your NUTS!!!! lolgood hunting			",36,6,0,18,9,0,17

Early Access Review
								This, game. I am enjoying it for all the reasons I bought it. Specifically, the play a game with the full freedom to drift aimlessly in space to look at something and say to myself... ""I should go there"" and be able to go there.  Issues arise in that so far there is no campaign, so there is a no guided leveling structure. Which is nice and freeform, but leaves you with a... ""hrmm, now what"", feeling similar to the sims or minecraft if you don't have a personal goal.  So far, you start off as  a rather beefy frigate off the bat, and from there are told there are other things you can do with your life beyond be a pirate/merc. Don't listen to that voice, stealing ships via boarding parties is the only way of acquiring money relatively quickly beyond the rare, bounty list job.  Which brings up space combat! This is both so much fun, and so much rage. Fun part! Depending on your choice of weapons, you are able to join random battles in space with next to no reprecursions as the two parties fight for life and you zap your enemy (see red guy), due to some laughably long range and guess shooting. Or you are able to watch in horror as you enter an area of space where everyone has some horrifyingly powerful guns that destroy your shields, hull, and happiness before you can make a pass at escape. Major issue is that you don't know what they are packing in weapons, you can't tell untill they open up on you, and the little info blerp provided is vague, very much so. The description varies from ""trivial"" to ""Impossible"", but you are not informed how they are rated to determine threat level to you. I seem to think it is an unspoken amalgamation of your ships type, and load out mixed with your level. But!  Trivial enemies in twos can wreck your life for reasons you are unsure of (maybe they are small glass cannons that are only GUN). Deadly enemies can just float around you in vain trying to bring their weapons to bare before dying to the explosion of their metal death trap.  Also, each ship has a load out of weapons, that are placed on four compass based directions on your ship, and each has a firing arc that is not discussed much, and even some of the fully decked vessels will always have blind spots in their firing patern.  So you are shooting, zapping, and hitting with all due fun then slightly tilt your ship to the left and stop. The weapons also have a range... which is an ignorable text box since it only matters in ""Fire at Will"" mode, unless you are being shot at then your AI ignore it just like you do and open up shooting everything like a Ork Freeboota.Exploration is fun, though potentially deadly since the whole area is teeming with bandits looking for the sweet rolls in your ships captain's quarters. There are about four mains ways of travel. Cruising, which is deadly and fun since for no reason at you can be cruising at a great speed (you think) then are knocked out of your cruise mode by pirates wanting you dead even if they are in no way a threat.  Or there are T-gates! Think stargate and that is exactly it, you anchor at the place and for a modest fee, travel in safety from one end of space to another point in space! T-gates are almost always at a space station/planet you can dock at (if your faction rep says so) and are the safest (relatively) way to go long distances.  Then there are wormholes..... wormholes are kinda like t-gates, if t-gates were a game you pay for up front, wormholes are the f2p that suck you in and slowly rob you with you having no knowledge where you are going. They are free to use, but they will kill your troopers (dudes you have on board to steal ships or keep yours from being stolen) each time and break your ship a little. And when I said sucked in I mean they have a gravity well that pull you into it and spits you out of another one, which is great but that other one has a gravity well too that pulls you into it. If not careful and if there are different pairs of wormholes nearby you can end up alone on your now burning ship on the other side of the map not really wanting to try to return.   Lastly there is an item that lets your teleport your ship in a circular radius of map hexes based on how many you want to use at time. Only to hexes you have already been to, semi safe since you have no clue what is waiting for you, can get expensive (you need a massive amount of the already costly items to even trying moving halfway cross map) but you wont get jumped on route like in cruising so, win?Lastly for now is the level up process... You can get experience from quests (variable from oh, nice to meh), and pirati- I mean defending your local area from them pirates and invaders. What does it do? lets you level certain skills you have chosen based on a life style of play I do not think impacts game too greatly. Really for most of the area I forget to use the things until I am nearly dying and go Save Me Buttons!  And Perks, perks are like skills but they are not tied to the action skills, they are always active.   Skills and Perks I think would be more impacting if they were not so dang situational, the buttons are very much a maybe use. Perks are very tied to certain aspects of the game, but are not acquired quickly enough to even remember to check for them. Or feel like they even do much when used.  It is a nice, balanced feature, but when you are able to reset your skills and perks the choices are less impacting on your decision time. I still am very happy I spent the cash on it, and if you like SPESS PIRATEZ, then you can be one in this one.  I do hope they keep this mode active if they come out with a story mode too.

								Really impressed! It plays like a mix of Freelancer, X3 and Eve. It's super intuitive to pick up and play and the menus are all neatly laid out and self explanatory without sacrificing your ability to do what you need to do. Combat varies depending on the ship but for the most part it's slower than the frantic arcade dogfights seen in Chris Roberts games; with more emphasis on positioning and presenting sides of your ship to enemy.Trading and economy functions as you'd expect, with goods costing more or less dependant on their origins and the political affiliations. There's a fair amount of contraband so it's best not to use the ""Loot All"" button if you're trying to live a virtuous life.In terms of Early Access content; the game feels very polished already with much of the world content seemingly in place and all game systems working as you'd expect. The current starting scenario is possibly a little bit easy, starting you off as it does with a mid level ship and plenty of tools already at your disposal. The missions are all randomly generatied (apparently depending on your actions, though I've yet to make a big enough impact on my galaxy to see this) and most of them follow a fairly standard template. It'd be nice for some more intensive missions with multiple stages but the ones that are there give you enough to do, and when they involve going through hostile areas they can become quite harrowing. The full game will have a story mode, which isn't present in this E.A release, so who knows what that will entail.			",313,50,3,43,36,2,61

This game could already be realeased with the content in it so far and it is only in beta. It has limitless potential for mods. The only big issue with it is that you can't get mods off of the steam workshop yet because it will crash if you do. A great game already with great potential and well worth the 25 dollar early access price.			",137,7,0,25,33,1,58

I think the community has embraced the game well with there modding as well. I tip my proverbial hat to you all. Good job. Best game I have played in awhile.			",45,19,0,40,8,0,40

								Very fun game. It has filled that void for a good space sim that I have been craving for a year now. One thing I would love to see improved is the lore behind the factions. I feel like Im just fighting robots, I would love to see some personalities of the factions and to find out more about them and who I want to help or destroy. All and all though, it's a gem of a game for $25.			",28,0,0,8,4,0,8

								AWSOME GAME!!!! I have no idea whats going on in this game universe but this game is amazing, It gives you a background if you did not play the first game(This Guy) and throws you into a waring universe. you start out with a decent ship and can go around doing missions, mining ore, killing lots and lots of people. Most of those screen shots they are using to sell the game are real gameplay with the hud gone(all but that planet shot of the city are real ingame places). I love the game play. not too complex but you will need to get used to space flight. One thing I never realized that will help is when boarding another ship the Green and Red arrows that appear can be clicked to send or retreat your troops! Buy the game and go find out what i mean!

												I wrote this review in January of 2015 on Metacritic.  I thought I posted it to Steam, but did not.  This game deserves a review.  Here's a copy/paste of my former review.  The game has only gotten better through expansions.I am a Star Citizen backer. Want to know a dirty little secret? I love and crave 3rd person space games. En route to searching for something to fill this desire, I came across this game. ""A Steam sale?"" I asked. ""Twenty-four bucks?"" I blinked. ""I spend that on 2-3 drinks at a restaurant with the wife..."" So, I plucked this one out of the Steam shelf, downloaded and started playing. Eight hours later I looked up and saw it was 4am. ""Woah..."" The next (read: later that) day I dove into the Starpoint Gemini 2 Community and learned I was late to a really cool party. Did you love Freelancer? Are you craving a 3rd person Space game? What are you waiting for...? Pick this gem up ASAP. There are few games that are so worth your money that you'll want to encourage others to purchase, but this is certainly one for me. In a day when space sims are seeing a great resurgence, it's refreshing to see a game that's not afraid to be 3rd person and give the player a bit of a relaxed take on space. I feel like a Malcom Reynolds, flying around in my ship, always with my eye on a new shiny, but lovingly holding onto, in my case, ""Big Red,"" until the time is truly right. There's dangers around every planet, but I've got a crew, a purpose, seemingly endless space to explore (certainly more than my limited time allows), and a ship. There's even a fun plot-line to follow along as you make your way in the galaxy--or don't; whatever--it's all up to you. I can assure you that if you want a rewarding, relaxing, and immersive (but not taking itself too seriously) space game, this is it. I give it a 9 (I'd have done 9.5 if it let me) because of the somewhat outdated UI, and the graphics are not the most polished. That said, the graphics do not detract from the game too much and again, it's sort of a breath of fresh air of late with the Elite: Dangerous's and Star Citizen's of the world. The development team has their ear to the forums and though I am new to the scene, they appear to be largely shaping the game around their community. It's mod friendly, and seemingly more so as time goes on, and there's already some great mods out there. It's much of anything you want in a fun game. Cheers.			",9,2,0,2,1,0,1

												At the time of this post I have about 2 hours in the game. Just what can I say about this game that 2 hours of game play has shown me?It is fantastic.Simplistic it is not, yet it is at the same time. If you were a Freelancer fan this game gets pretty close. It is not perfect, but being that it comes from a small group of people with a small budget they really rocked this game. The graphics are good, lower end computers should be able to run it without issue. The sound is great and the soundtrack I have not turned off yet and that is saying something.Campaign or free roam. Don’t feel like doing the campaign anymore go wonder off and blow something up. Want to make some money go bounty hunting. Want to get rich trade some goods. Want to pick a fight do it.This game is an 8/10 pretty easy. For those of us that have been missing Freelancer it really fills the gap rather well. ",30,8,1,13,27,0,12

The only problem for me (i dont know if others have this problem) is that, the game will suddenly minimize if I let it be for some minute and i cant open it to continue. I will need to close it and open it back, quite stressful if i were in the middle of nowhere with no planet to save my journey and suddenly i have the urge to use the toilet			",13,4,2,7,8,0,1

												many hrs in....8 out of 10 stars. :) - Huge sandbox universe to explore and interact within. :) - Beautiful graphics and framerates with settings maxed out :) - Many Corporations with their own ship visual styles:) - Solid game - not the typical steam crowd-funded title.:( - All ships are the same graphic scale, regardless of the class size you are playing.  So be prepared to be underwhelmed by the Corvette or Frigate upgrade visually, as well as tactically - especially given the amount of time saving up for them.  You gain only an extra weapons mounting point or two each upgrade.:( - Fleet Commander? No, not really. You to hire mercenaries (max 2) that follow you (bumping into each other) that you have no command or interaction over what so ever.  Most of the time they go off and get themselves destroyed or wirte you off as MIA when the green rifts take you for a ride.Restarted many times to try all the player skill sets, and starting ship types.  I will continue to play it for now as I anxiously await patches and expansions - or as usual, the steam community to mod out the oversights that the devs / testers missed (ship scale, enemy bases don't consider you a threat, complexity doesn't scale with firepower).Perfectly priced for what you get - especially if you catch a STEAM sale.

												gotta say this was exactly what i hoped it would be. an awesome galaxy surfing vehicle combat game with excellent mods and dev support. endless replay value and more ships to choose from than you will ever even see in one playthrough. seriously ive played about 100 hours so far and still half my map is unexplored. as all good games are you start out weak and end up becoming a juggernaut of near infinite power. and yet you can still get ganged up on to the point where your only choice is flee or die. tactical decisions go a long way and you definitely want to gather the best weapons, enhancments, officers and skills. but the best part is the freedom to choose what you do. do you mine asteroid and gas with a freightliner, or become wealthy thru the destruction of your enemies in a carrier, or do you become the master trader soaring around the galaxy at incredible speeds trading resources and transporting vip's in a cruiser. its totally up to you how you play this game. if i had complaints about this game it would be these. 1) more mods, 2) more weapon levels and choices, 3) more levels, and 4) better explained stats. so 3 out of 4 complaints are that i just want more. thats always a good thing. to play a game you can never get enough of. and if boredom ever does set in i can always start anew with a different approach, class or end goal. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to start... The game itself requires some minor polish, mainly in the balancing sector, but it's already at a very good/stable state otherwise. There are various tasks to do inside the game, such as exploration, boarding ships, mining, trading(These do still need balancing.) and ofcourse, the campaign mode and pewpew fighting. The game is fairly complex, once you start getting into it, learning to fly and maneuver different ship classes, the firing arcs of various ships, finding fighting tactics that work for you and your ship, the enhancement system... And for those who get bored quickly after having played through the storyline, which did happen to a lot of players in other games such as Freelancer, you do have a nice amount of achievements to hunt, some of which aren't exactly easy to accomplish. Nothing is stopping you from hunting down the ""Heros"" either. ;)The community and the devs are active and communicating a lot, which reflects into the product and the pace patches, fixes and balancing attempts are coming through. There are plans for an expansion and DLC, which will further add to the amount of content in the game and ofcourse, the community made mods, which will be the crowning jewel of this game. The tools might not be fully functional yet, but as soon as the game itself is at a state where the devs and community are happy, the tools will be recieving some much needed love.A lot has been said about the game in many of the reviews, but here's another list of just some of the features already in the game and some which are being worked on:Already in:-Boarding Ships.-Working Campaign.-Lots and lots of ships.-Weapon/ship system enhancement.-Trading.-Dynamic events which effect item prices.-A large amount of space to explore, which can also be further expanded.-Lots of different factions.(Which will also get some more love in the future.)-Freeroam mode for those who don't wish to play the campaign.-Mercenaries to act as your backup.-Blueprints.-Working collision system.-Cloaking!-Heroes to hunt,-Mods.Planned/in the works:-Player owned faction and base(s).-Dynamic struggles for power/regional control between factions. Once this is implemented, every single playthrough will be and feel different!-Expansion/DLC.-Modding Tools.(Currently some work, some don't. Somewhat prone to crashes.)-Improvements to the HUD and other elements of the UI.-An entirely new ship class.(Larger, naturally. Bigger is always better!)... and the list goes on.If you aren't a fan of space sims or dislike games with emphasis on exploration, this might not be for you, as there is no MP in the game to increase its lifespan. However, if you do like what you've seen/read and can get past the fact that there is no MP and that the game relies entirely on mods/expansions/DLC to keep breathing fresh life into it, then this game just might be a perfect fit for you. Atleast I've completely fallen in love with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Star Point Gemin 2 is a fantasic starship space genre game that will have you playing for hours on end. I’ve spent more than 60 hours with the game at this point and I’ve only just scratched the surface. I’ve primarily been playing in the games “free roam” mode as that was the real draw of the game for me. I knew from the outset that I wanted a game that gave me the ability to explore, fight, mine and trade at my own leisure and do so in my own ship like a “real” space captain. After researching SP♥♥♥♥ bit I realized that this would be the game that would allow me to do all of that.I’m not a diehard space sim player so games like EVE Online and Star Trek Online have always kind of intimidated me. I’ve never really had an interest in the X3 series (my loss probably) but I have played Sins of a Solar Empire and the Homeworld series. It's been a while since I've played anything space related but lately I’ve become re-interested in the genre with games like Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous on the horizon. I knew I wanted to play a game that felt huge and expansive but I didn’t want to play a game that made me feel like a small fish in a huge pond. I’m a casual player so the size and scope of this game feels just right to me. The game's setting is huge and there is a lot to do in it. Also, it seems like the devs are really committed to making the game better all the time which made the choice to buy it all the more easy to make. The fact that I’ve continued to play it so much is a testament to how good it actually is.SPG2 reminds me specifically of two games I’ve played before, Nexus: The Jupiter Incident and Star Trek: Starfleet Command. Although I’ve played many other space genre games since, I really wanted to play something that felt similar to those two games. SPG2 has a surprising amount in common with Starfleet Command which also allowed you to “tractor beam” aka grapple ships, scan anomalies and commandeer other spacecraft with “marines” aka troopers. I haven’t played that game in over 15 years but I remember how much fun it was to do those things in the game.These are some of the things I like about SPG2:-	the music is great especially the main theme-	the ship designs are cool and I know there are still tons more to discover-	the space station designs are great and varied which is a plus-	the variety of weapons and their FX in game look great-       the descriptions for items and npcs in the game are numerous and often amusing-       there are many mods availiable which help to enhance gamplayThe randomness of missions and enemies is great but whether or not you like this aspect of the game will depend on how much you like doing things in this universe. After awhile the missions can seem repetitive but luckily the fact that the level required to do each mission changes all the time, forces you to decide which missions to do or not to do. This in turn helps mix things up a bit and keep things interesting.The only issues I have with the game so far are the way the menus in stations and on planets were a bit confusing at first and still seem a bit cumbersome to navigate. Also I wish there was a bit more 'humanity' in the game. By that I just mean it would be cool if officers had portraits in addition to their names and when ships attacked you they too had portraits instead of just insignias. I know that's a huge 'ask' as there are already a huge amount of randomized officer names in the game. Perhaps a feature that allowed you upload your own portraits to the game (specifically for officers) could be cool. Also, I’m not entirely sure, but I think officers gain experience the longer they are on your ship. I hope so but it would also be cool if they could steadily gain loyalty for additional bonuses.Other than that I’ve really enjoyed this game and am glad I bought it.			",23,2,0,3,0,0,5

												I'm going to give this a 5/10 at the moment.  The content that is present is well done and relatively stable/bug free.  Ship combat is fun for a while, and space is visually interesting with a few suprises.  But get a few hours in and the game starts to feel kind of pointless.  There is a faction system, but it doesn't do much of anything.  There is trading and mining, but neither give money at anywhere near the rate fighting does.  There are generated ""missions"", but they are extremely easy and give very little in the way of rewards (you'll probably do them just to have something to do).  There are enemy bases and structures, but you can't destroy them (you can get them to one health and they just hang there, and frankly it isn't hard at all to do that).  You end up collecting money to buy a bigger ship to collect more money to buy an even bigger ship (which isn't very rewarding, as the ship models are so small in relation to one another you dont get the sense that you have a bigger ship)...The game isn't garbage, and the devs are very nice and responsive.  At $5-$10 give it a shot, but not at $40.  The caveat here is there is a very soid framework to make a much better game (really this game is in the bin with so many others that are really in early-mid beta, but release early to make money).  If there is a content update that adds player bases and the ability to capture territory, balances out mining and trading, and puts in other end-game content and empire building mechanics, this game will be a 9/10 easy.  It feels like these things were intended, but just haven't made it in.  So, if you see a big update after this review, maybe give it a try.  Otherwise, skip it until there is a big steam sale (or skip entirely, if a space grind isn't your thing).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Starpint Gemini 2 is the definite successor of Wing Commander: Privateer and Freelancer.  I have been waiting for many years for a team to go back to the simple roots of many upgradeable ships and challenging freelance type missions and this game DELIVERS BOTH!  The learning curve is relatively easy and the incorporation of using the mouse and keypad versus a joystick has been accomplished (IMO) flawlessly.  I am enthralled by the fact that regardless of how much I upgrade my ship (currently running a Cruiser and looking to upgrade to a Dreadnaught) that the missions are still challenging.This is not a game of incredible voice acting or a fantastic storyline but the visuals and extremely sound mechanics make the game a pleasure to play.  My favortie addition is the boarding feature!  Wait until you have a ship with 90 or so troops and you can take Frigates with 30 - 50 tropps with ease and make a big payday when you tow your capture into port.  (NOTE:  Click on the GREEN flag in the troop transport window, after it turns from gray to green, to send more troops.  This is not spelled out in the manual.)Congrats to theis set of independent game creators!  Great job!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. I got it in Humble bundle for about 11 pounds, its worth more. I have played for about 30 hours and havent completed the story line yet. Lots of different things to do. My issue with the game is the simplicity of it, its not always a bad thing but I would have preferred a bit more difficulty in scanning and docking etc. Its like freelancer pretty much. Pretty straighforward. good graphics, nothing mindblowing and I would have preffered nicer and more varied skyboxes and a better drawdistance. That said its still pretty and will run on most computers I would imagine even very old one but I could be wrong.The amount of weapon syustems and ships is also very good.oh, I would have preferred a bit more depth in the trading aspect, larger storage etc but again what it does is enough to entertain.I would definately recommend this game to people, and even though I paid only a fraction for the gold edition I would say the game with its dlc would be worth a whole lot more in terms of gameplay value, dare I say 30 pounds or so.7/10			",28,0,0,2,8,0,13

												Starpoint Gemini is worth buying if you like sandbox space games where you can mine, be a pirate, or just do missions. However, 35 dollars just seems too high for what you get so you may want to wait for a sale of some kind first.Video showing what the gameplay is like(even though old video, gameplay is still 99% the same... campaign just didnt exist yet):

												It's a space sim.If you expect soul-mouving roleplay or vast army battles or deep scale business management, you'll be disapopointed cause... it's a space sim.It's a pretty darn good space sim at that. It's pretty, atmospheric and quite fun to play.  There are a few bugs still out there but nothing major, nothing to break the game.  The map is huge.  You have good control over your ship and character. There are more factions than you need and there's always stuff happening.  Nothing heavilly scripted, it's all pretty much standard space sim missions.  Destroy that guy, smuggle this, escort that, repair this, explore that. You know.  Space sim.The voice acting is abysmal.  So abysmal, it's awesome.  Honestly, it feels like a game made by people who have a lot of love for the genre.  I expect to spend many, many more hours exploring space. I just throw a few Malcolm Reynolds one liners here and there and suddenly, I'm in space, doing space stuff. I'm cool like that. (I may or may not be taking meds regarding this)Oh and the music... I would have bought the game for the music alone.			",39,13,1,12,0,0,3

												Game sometimes crashes on Windows 10 for no apparent reason. All requirements are met or exceeded, with the exception of using Windows 7 or 8.Aside from the occasional random crash, game has a nice EVE Online feel, which is something I have been looking for. Once you've gone through the tutorial, the game becomes easier to understand and play. Something I have not been able to figure out how to do and that doesn't seem to be explained, is capturing a ship. There doesn't seem to be a tutorial that covers the basics on how to go about doing it.The downside to this game as mentioned above is the lack of ""capturing"" tutorial and the occasional crash on Windows 10.If you're into space-themed games and want to pilot a spaceship or you're looking for a good EVE Online alternative with a focus on singel player, give this game a try.

												After a bit of time with this game; there are a few things to say about it.  First of all the controls get a bit to get used to.  The game play can be a bit daunting at first, but after a fashon it ends up adding to the total game experience.  The Steam workshop mod support is quite extensive and can create a completely unique and individulized experience.  Is it a true AAA title, no, is it a bit different and fun to play yes.

												Pretty good Freelancer type Spacegame. Updating your ship is addictive and it is full of missions (though random) and interesting stuff. Balance is kind of an issue as trading earns you much less then fighting and auto-aiming is much better then manual fighting but the game works very well and offers a lot of content.

Early Access Review
								If you enjoyed Freelancer or the X series, you will probably like this game too.It took me about 30 minutes or so to figure out what the hell I was doing. The tutorial was decent, if intrusive (you can turn it off and access it later), and gives you a basic run down of how to control your ship, and some information on the various HUD icons and such. After that, its up to you to explore and play around with things. The (arguably) nice thing about this game is that, unlike the X series, it seems difficult, if not impossible, to fatally screw up in the early stages of your game.Give that this is early access, there are, of course, some issues:  Choppy performance - I bold this because it made the game very difficult to play. I am not sure if its simply my machine, or if others are experiencing it too, but it is a tad annoying.  Enemies are too easy - I am not sure whether they get more difficult as you play and level up. At the moment, if feels somewhat final fantasy-ish in that early enemies are deliberately easier to give the player time to power up and such before throwing them to the wolves. If that is the case, then cool I suppose, but right now, given how easily I seem to be able to wipe the asteroid belt with these pirate's ships, I'm not sure why anyone would pick a fight with me at this point.  Weird random graphical bugs - Whilst switching from auto to manual targetting, suddenly thousands of beam weapon streams fired out from my ship, followed my curser wherever it went. Looked cool though.  Lack of clear explanations - It took me a little bit to figure out what the different colours on various commodity prices actually meant. Yes, I did assume that red meant something bad (probably a bad selling price) and green was good, but it would be nice to have a tooltip, or something, to confirm my gamer's hypothesis. I'm still not certain what yellow means.  Probably some other issues I've either forogtten, or those I""ll encounter as I play...Despite the issues mentioned, I think this will turn out to be a really awesome game. I'm quite impressed with what the developers have done so far, and look forward to more updates. ",23,1,0,9,8,0,18

												I'm only an hour or so in, but already I have that feeling as with many games I've loved over the years. Love the size of the system, love the campaign mode, love the visuals... combat is great fun and the addition of expendable modules is really clever. The Fleet isn't that well expanded on, I don't quite understand how best to use them or how to upgrade them.The way you access menus is fantastically intuitive, I didn't need a tutorial (which come thick and fast without any real sense of being anchored to what you're doing in-game) to reload weapons or move cargo, the buttons were just... where they should be.EDIT: Three hours in and still loving it. Worked out a few more of the game mechanics (loving the tactical overlay which you have to manually map, I have it on left-shift) and realised that I don't have a fleet yet! The RPG-lite elements are great, incremental improvements on all sorts of things means you have to really put some thought into what gameplay you want to get involved in. At this stage, unsure if it was wise to go with campaign mode, I think this could be even better in pure sandbox.			",404,63,33,47,57,6,39

												This is a fantastic game that truly expands on an experience given to us by games like Freelancer. If you've played Freelancer or any other game like it, then you should have a great idea of what to expect.That being said though, there are problems that should be mentioned. Right now, in it's current state, the economy is ridiculous, or at least feels that way. Everything is ridiculously expensive (and by everything, I mean everything, including fast travel). And the only way to deal with an economy like this and still be able to buy stuff every once in a while is to hijack ships.So yes, you are allowed the freedom to do whatever you want when you want to which is nice, but if you ever want to advance your ship, you're going to eventually have to hijack other ships to be able to earn enough money. Or be prepared for a really long drawn out game of mining, trading, or being a freelancer.			",49,33,0,43,13,0,22

												**UPDATE**(9/30/14)The game is now at full release. I will break the game into categories below and comment my opinion on them.(+ means positive, * means neutral, - means negative)Gameplay:+Fast, exciting and action packed combat+Plenty of ship customization+Controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use+Plenty to explore and collect+Moddability*RPG style progression (skilltree and leveling)*Unrealistic physics makes things easier to play but undesirable to some*No multiplayer-Limited to 3 class choice on start of new game, cannot change later-Unrealistic scale of universe (mainly planets and stars are WAY too small)-No docking animation for stations-Occasional crashesStory:*Typical story, nothing special-Bad voice acting/racial steriotypes detract from story-Some missions ""vanish"" from map meaning you must load old save to continue storyGraphics/Sound:+Good quality graphics and visuals+Good sound effects and music overall-FPS takes a large hit during a few mission scenes or large battles-Aforementioned poor voice acting-Visual bugs with space background images (visible ""skyboxes"") are occasionally seenOverall Impression:This game has been quite a fun experience coming from a fan of RPG style games. The level progression system and skilltree coupled with a highly moddable ship means you have a reason to keep playing and improving. You are able to pilot anything from a tiny gunship to a powerful carrier but do not expect to be a fleet commander. Emphasis on is your ship. The story gives you a reason to play but it is not where the game shines. The most fun to be had is exploring, lucrative bounties and close encounters with tough enemies. Its a shame the game crashes on occassion and the story has some bugs. These things will hopefully be ironed out soon.			",23,3,0,8,5,0,1

And the only way to deal with an economy like this and still be able to buy stuff every once in a while is to hijack ships.So yes, you are allowed the freedom to do whatever you want when you want to which is nice, but if you ever want to advance your ship, you're going to eventually have to hijack other ships to be able to earn enough money. Or be prepared for a really long drawn out game of mining, trading, or being a freelancer.			",49,33,0,43,13,0,22

								Hey, I happen to like Starpoint Gemini 2 quite a bit.The game reminds me of Freelancer with the relatively simplistic, but still very satisfying combat.  You have your typical guns of various types, potentially including turrets with a 360° field of fire...  and a selection of quite useful torpedos/missiles.  I haven't gotten very far into the game yet, though...  so I can't say much about how the faction system plays out, or anything on purchasing new hardware.  I still STRONGLY RECCOMEND THIS GAME for anyone who enjoyed Freelancer or anyone who finds the thought of an open-world space sim with an emphasis on combat.			",377,75,3,94,81,6,115

								[Please note: I'm reviewing the Beta, played a few hours so far]You liked Freelancer, you like the (working) parts of the X-universe? You like to cloak your ship, sneak upon enemies, beam your crew abord and capture their vessels just to sell them at the next starbase? Then you should consider to buy Starpoint Gemini 2. It's just the far better game in comparision to the newest X-Game (and it's a little cheaper I guess).It's kind of different as well: you can slide your energy to different systems on the fly (i.e. shields and weapons), you can upgrade your ships systems one by one, you have a decent skilltree as far as I took a look and the performance is good so far -at least for a beta, what you really should have in mind. If you are willing to take a second for the game to load in new sectors the game runs just fine (on my system at least: nvidia 760,8gig,phenomII).Can't really say anything about trading though. I'm not much of a trader, but there are plenty of ships, stations and so on in which you can buy and sell stuff. What hits me is the option to smuggle: you got illegal stuff from the pirate you just blew up? Smuggle it on a planet and make some profit! :DWell, let's talk about the downs as well: Sure, there are some missions. Kill that, transport that, press a button to repair a station, look for a vessel in distress and so on. But there is quite a lack of background to me. Sure, nice music does a lot, but I didn't run into any NPCs/dialogues so far.______I strongly recommend the game at this point, I really did not regret to back up the developers here like I did with the newest X (yeah, you see, can't even remember it's name....aww god, I hate it so much xD).

Early Access Review
								This is my early access review - I will change my review for the final product.If you love the Sci-fi and the adventure of exploring space - particularly Star Trek, Babylon 5, or Star Wars - you will absolutely love this game! It's truly a unique space sim/rpg experience, and this is the first game that has done justice to this genre I believe. The universe is your sandbox, and you're free to do whatever you want - trade, mine asteroids, hunt down criminals, or take part in space battles - take command and boldly go into the beautiful, yet dangerous, reaches of space. - So far the graphics are excellent; the art style is beatiful; ship designs are unique, yet they will remind you of your favorite Sci'fi. At the moment, I'm flying a ship that reminds me of a Tau Empire or a Homeworld Kadeshi ship - love it. Being able to customize and design your weapon systems, costmetic look of your ship, and having access to a wide range of various kinds of ships, is the best feature of the game for me. Working to get that special ship you always wanted - whether it be a large Carrier class that can launch swarming fighters/bombers; a massive heavily armed Dreadnought armed to the teeth with Missile Launcers and Rail Guns; a swift Gunship or Corevette, decked out in Plasma Cannons; or a stealthy fighter class with cloaking - is all possible for you here.  - Music is atmospheric, and fits the setting perfectly - although, I would like to hear an extended soundtrack in the finished product, or post-launch. - Combat Missions are fun, and Space combat is the by far the best part of the game. Scientific explorations; Repairing Space stations, Science Vessels/outposts, or even Space prisons, is a nice touch to fill in the world, and make it feel like you're in a living universe. Although, there is need for more variations in these missions; though this is early access, and there is still more content in the works to make the universe feel more alive, and give you more to do as you explore. The game may be early access, but it's very well made in every way so far - I can only imagine how good the finished product will be. The Developers are the most friendly, and helpful ones I ever came across; they're transparent in their work on the game, and very open in sharing ideas with fans and are open to suggestions and feedback. This is a top notch game in it's genre; and both this game, and it's fantastic devs, deserve your support. Starpoint Gemini 2 has an exciting future, and I'm glad I've taken part in it's journey.

												Game sometimes crashes on Windows 10 for no apparent reason. All requirements are met or exceeded, with the exception of using Windows 7 or 8.Aside from the occasional random crash, game has a nice EVE Online feel, which is something I have been looking for. Once you've gone through the tutorial, the game becomes easier to understand and play. Something I have not been able to figure out how to do and that doesn't seem to be explained, is capturing a ship. There doesn't seem to be a tutorial that covers the basics on how to go about doing it.The downside to this game as mentioned above is the lack of ""capturing"" tutorial and the occasional crash on Windows 10.If you're into space-themed games and want to pilot a spaceship or you're looking for a good EVE Online alternative with a focus on singel player, give this game a try.

												It's a space sim.If you expect soul-mouving roleplay or vast army battles or deep scale business management, you'll be disapopointed cause... it's a space sim.It's a pretty darn good space sim at that. It's pretty, atmospheric and quite fun to play.  There are a few bugs still out there but nothing major, nothing to break the game.  The map is huge.  You have good control over your ship and character. There are more factions than you need and there's always stuff happening.  Nothing heavilly scripted, it's all pretty much standard space sim missions.  Destroy that guy, smuggle this, escort that, repair this, explore that. You know.  Space sim.The voice acting is abysmal.  So abysmal, it's awesome.  Honestly, it feels like a game made by people who have a lot of love for the genre.  I expect to spend many, many more hours exploring space. I just throw a few Malcolm Reynolds one liners here and there and suddenly, I'm in space, doing space stuff. I'm cool like that. (I may or may not be taking meds regarding this)Oh and the music... I would have bought the game for the music alone.			",39,13,1,12,0,0,3

												Pretty good Freelancer type Spacegame. Updating your ship is addictive and it is full of missions (though random) and interesting stuff. Balance is kind of an issue as trading earns you much less then fighting and auto-aiming is much better then manual fighting but the game works very well and offers a lot of content.

Still love it, just a bit bare bones towards a little was in.			",81,11,0,19,6,0,6

												The game was enjoyable, but don't expect anything amazing from it. I come from playing EVE Online for over 9 years. I thought this would be a nice offline version, it wasn't. If you do find yourself playing this game, abandon the story line. Just play freelance and the DLC is a waste of time.Pros:Open worldFlexible marketMultiple ways to slow make moneysLots and lots of quest (every time you load the game new quests are generated)Lots of ships fit different command/combat stylesCons:Voice overs, they're comically badStory line, it sucks and is hard to follow. It made since in the end, but it must have been written by a 3rd grader.Bugs ruin the emersion (Random effect get stuck, ships explode but keep flying around)Some cut scenes have voice overs, then the voice overs just go away, then come back.....wut?Oddly enough, every character you ""speak"" to in game has a different accident. This bugged me more than it should.			",51,23,0,12,10,0,6

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is to space exploration games what Skyrim is to fantasy adventure games. Vast, full of lore and play styles and activities for everyone, and just so beautiful to stroll through and appreciate the scenery. The long list of buttons and actions appear daunting at first, but are easy to learn and facilitate a rich level of interactivity that makes an enjoyable experience for both the casual gamer and the hardcore strategist. Stats, activities and tricks offer a healthy challenge for micromanagement fiends, and movement and combat are simple yet satisfying enough for someone who has an actual job and no time to micromanage in a virtual world. Also like in Skyrim, the voice acting is endearing and the accents are so thick you could cut through them with a knife. It's not often I play a game with just the right balance of exploration, story, environment, gameplay and general polish that I don't mind playing all day on a day off. Also like with Skyrim, STEAM WORKSHOP! Can't wait to find some funny mods in the future. Little Green Men Games nailed it. 10/10, would buy for the wife and kids.			",221,49,5,26,12,5,16

												Just not feeling itAt just under an hour, it didnt do enough in that time to create an hunger to keep playing the gamePurchased thinking i could relive my freelancer days, but in a more advanced game. Sadly, it wasnt to beThere's far too much story text, with very bad voice oversControls and actions seem lacking, basic.Missions all seem very similar format, go here, pick that, shoot this, returnIn the short time i played, and from what i saw, it felt like the game would be a grind. Trying to upgrade ships, weapons etc. Fair enough, i expect on most games to have to work for advancement, but for me to do that it would have to grip me from the start and make me want to keep playing, and sadly this didnt.

												The best I can say for this game is: Meh.The combat is kinda fun at first, and there is potential there, but after playing space games in the past, this one makes a lot of the mistakes with not many of the successes. Pros: -It's an open world, and from what I have played so far, it's a pretty large space.-visual effects look pretty nice.Cons: -The writting/voicing are really vanilla. I spent more time wishing they would shut up than getting into the story or caring about backstory. as an example, once you complete a main quest, it just initiates another main quest. No cut scenes, no story development at all aside from 15 seconds of text being read by a character that you won't see again.-RPG is an exageration. you can spend points on different perks, yes, but thats it. instead of a new ability, you get a 5% increase in ""fleet soak"", whatever that is... speaking of:-The game doesn't really explain things like folks are used to now-a-days. Is it too much to ask for a tool tip to tell me what some of the features are?Overall, I bought the game on sale at 80% off, and still think I overpaid a bit.. Maybe the game will get a lot more exciting and in depth once I spend more than 10 hours on it, but I'm not going to slog through to find out.			",29,6,0,13,9,0,36

												As a long time lover of freelancer and the X series i figured i pretty much had to give this a try, I can't say I'm not dissapointed. The whole feel of controlling your ship feels terrible the heavy/light weapon system fels arbitrary and stupid. Tasks as simple as docking are somehow more complicated than even in the X series and every ""feature"" in Starpoint feels like anemic versions of its competitors.			",111,10,1,24,23,0,34

												This is a relaxing space opera.  It has a lot of elements from several different genres.  It has space combat, mining, trading, and a whole spectrum of possibities to play it.  It is mostly relaxing, but can be fun and intense.  Is that an oxymoron?  Maybe.So, why do I not reccomend it?  It is broken.  It crashes about every 20 minutes.  The screen just goes blank white. The game is still runing, but the screen blanks out and you cannot do anything but kill the program and start from your last save point.			",89,15,0,11,3,0,4

												Did you like Privateer and Freelancer?  Did you read the reviews comparing this game to those, as well as Outlaw Star and other anime classics?  Don't believe them!  I did and I regret it.  If you like tutorials that are either outdated and no longer have any bearing on the game, or ""tutorials"" that are nothing more that a summary of key bindings, this game is for you.  (By the way, anyone who points out the shortcomings and is desperate to learn how to play the game they just bought are often derided as 5 year old simpletons in their tutorial forums.)Combat system is a joke:  The manual controls are wonky and attempting to manually control flight will send your ship into endless oscillations and fishtails.  If you let the computer take over this function by using the fire at will command, the ship stands still and shoots randomly at enemys off the edge of the screen, occasionally getting a hit but never resolving combat.  (I tried this, walked away for 1/2 hour, came back and it was still randomly firing at the same enemy with no real damage to my ship or theirs.)Don't care about combat and want to be a trader?  Good luck!  When you try to go somewhere, you are ambushed and drawn into combat, resulting in the frustration loop that I described above.Feels like an Alpha.  Despite what the developers say, this game is unplayable.  It has too many rough edges and still needs alot of work.Don't buy it.  I did and I regret it.Spend your money on X3, or some other legitimate franchise. ",16,16,0,11,3,2,5

												After a few hours in freeroam I feel like I've experience enough of Starpoint Gemini 2 to review it. First of all, this is mostly a classic space sim when playing in freeroam. It's mining/trading/mercenary grind to get better equipment and ships but it has some differences - there's skill points and experience levels, which is nice if you enjoy playing RPG's (I do)You don't start in fighter class ships. In fact - you can't fly the fighter class ships. You start in a Gunship class ship (or above if you have the DLC's). Your crew can man the turret hardpoints for you, and you will want them to. They are perfect shots every time. The turret AI is *very* good. You don't need to concentrate on weapons except to line up for heavy weapon shots, which are ammo limited but deal more damage per shot than your turrets. But....you probably won't even have to use them. Starpoint Gemini 2 has a problem if you're a pilot who knows basic concepts of space sim combat. If you can assess firing arcs, manage shield energy and experience in MMO type skill buffs, normal difficulty is a relaxing grind even if you take assassination missions 6 to 10 levels above your level. Most enemy ships don't have cloak scanners, so you can drop out and unleash hell with an undetected approach and take down ""Deadly"" and even with a little luck ""Impossible"" targets. This is a bit of a shame as this game wants to force you to fly combat role ships. I haven't seen ore freighters or transports. You can seemingly only buy Gunships and above with military kitting. Mining/Trading is viable but the cargo holds are disgustingly small and the mods that increase them in the workshop do not work with the DLC. You can not upgrade cargo capacity. If you're a frieghter captain your best bet is to get something with the biggest hold in the class which is marginally bigger than the rest and prepare to make MANY trips to and from asteroids and debris fields. Which is also a bit strange - asteroid and debris fields are EVERYWHERE, and you can't take advantage of it. Unfortunately most of the modders seem intent on putting in ridiculous godships instead of addressing the lack of civilian vessels. I usually like to play as a frieghter captain, in my game now I'm just a mercenary taking contracts well above my level for the massive increase in EXP and Credits. Overall I'm very pleased with this game. It's very underrated. I can expect I'll be putting many many more hours into it, as I have with X. This isn't Starpoint Gemini 1 for sure, and it's not the mess that is Star Wolves. It's not X either, but it's a better game than say Tachyon or Darkstar One and a nice alternative. Haven't played story yet. Not sure I will. Also this game and the Rebel Galaxy soundtrack works very nicely together. 10/10 Exploded a frigate as a gunship by exploiting cloak and firing arcs.

												The game itself if phenomenal, and can be played for as many hours as you have to give it. Unfortunately you have to restart completely now and again, as every single save game past a certain level becomes corrupt with 100% accuraccy. You can't collect all the ships, can't amass a fortune, can't get deep enough to experience all that it might otherwise have to offer.Buy it on sale, worth $5 for the game play, maybe.

												Another space ship game which I love but this particular game is very shallow. It has a boring storyline and a bunch of missions, all very similar, which you need to run over and over again to get better ships so you can run the same, but tougher, missons over and over.Gets boring fast and I would not recommend this game unless you just want a few hours of space ship shooting. And dont be fooled by the variety of ships in the game. They all handle similary to each other and the size difference between the smallest and the largest playable ships is barely noticeable. So a gunship can fly side by side to a dreadnought and they are pretty much the same size. The dreadnought is maybe 20% bigger, that's it. So dont expect epic capital ships battles, you wont find it here.			",12,0,0,6,2,0,9

												A Freelancer-Style Space shooter with little rpg and the illusion of a sandbox.The main problem is... there is nothing to do. While the universe is huge, and filled with stations, orbital bodies and spaceships... everything is very generic and becomes boring quite quickly. Player interaction with the universe is rather pointless, things like trading and ""mining"" are not profitable enough to even bother with and almost all actions have no consequences for anyone. So, after a while you end up capturing random ships and towing them to station for sale, over and over again, because its the only way to actually make enough money to buy the higher tiers of ships.The gameplay is messed up so horribly, that a couple of patches will not turn this into a great game.Basically... just stay away from this game. Unless you can pick it up for less than 5 bucks. It'll do for an afternoon, but nothing else. ",42,8,1,28,15,0,9

												Fun at first, but a little more shallow than you'd think at first blush.  The combat is good, the graphics are good - but it will start to feel very repetitive and boring long before you discover/uncover the whole map.  At least it did for me.   For the asking price, I was expecting more gameplay depth.  It's a $35 game for the combat and graphics with a $15 game's depth of core gameplay mechanics?  That's my take, anyway.

												Firstly, understand that although my review will say I've only logged 9 hours on this game, it's more like 20 because I played a lot in offline mode.This game is beautiful, both visually and with the music. But other than some eye candy and a few atmospheric soundtracks it doesn't feel like it has anything else going for it. Saving up for better ships is a slow grind, and combat becomes repetitive quickly. Once you get the better ships all you really accomplish is the ability to throw some more bullets/lasers at people at some different angles, but gameplay never fundamentally changes. Stronger enemies are just like the easier ones only they have more health and higher damage output, but you fight them all fundamentally the same way. The enemy AI is terrible; they have a self-preservation instinct akin to plastic ducks in a carnival shooting gallery. Killing enemies ranges from extremely easy to just downright tedious, but never feels challenging. The universe is clutterred with interesting stuff (real space doesn't have objects this close to each other) so there's no shortage of places to explore, but there's no real incentive to explore anything. One region might just be another solar system but with a blue nebula instead of a red one and the asteroids are made of some different resource. I'll give this game an alright/10. It's fun when you first pick it up, but playing for long periods will make the game stale quickly. I'm at a point where I want to play this game, but I just can't stomach flying around in space shooting at the same pirate ships to travel to some samey looking region- not for more than maybe 5 minutes at a time. I feel like there's nothing to do in this big universe the game presents. Hopefully the mod community will be able to salvage the game so I can feel like I got my money's worth.			",69,6,0,5,8,0,14

I personally enjoy capturing enemy ships after hacking and invading them, but it is not the only way available.This game gives you the opportunity to visit a vast universe, searching for gold and fame. Acquiring bigger ships, switching to stronger weapons, developing powerful skills: it's all on the agenda.Be careful though, this game is highly addictive. DO NOT start a new game before finals.

Before I got Tokio-ship and that was easy play too.It's pitty, that in SG2 the ships have so few options regarding armament, so few combinationst etc. I would welcome, if you could choose mounting position, firing angle, firing sequenc etc for every weapon. I find, that the ""protection against hacking"" and ""system hitpoints"" ENHANCEMENTS are totatlly useless. I don't need FLEET at all too. The game is fairly simple without having fleet.This and other things are useless in the game.I would welcome, if there would be greater battles, with your own fleet, more tactics in the game. For example, you could start playing with one ship and and with 3-4 fleets and different tactics for different opponents.			",31,1,0,5,11,0,17

Also, I've went on assasination missions that were supposed to be around level 17 and there were multiple cruisers.  So, a level 17 captain is supposed to face multiple capital ships (worth millions each), for 20,000?  Also, why can't the cargo holds of hired mercs be used to help store goods?  I'd want to hire a freighter just for that purpose.			",22,11,0,8,4,0,4

												I really like it overall but there are some serious scaling problems in roaming mode.  I was level 50 before I could afford to buy a corvette.  Also, I've went on assasination missions that were supposed to be around level 17 and there were multiple cruisers.  So, a level 17 captain is supposed to face multiple capital ships (worth millions each), for 20,000?  Also, why can't the cargo holds of hired mercs be used to help store goods?  I'd want to hire a freighter just for that purpose.			",22,11,0,8,4,0,4

												This game should come with a label warning that it is highly addictive.  For the price - around $17 US - it provides hours of fun exploring a huge universe, considering and accepting contracts to perform various missions, engaging in battles that can become nail-biters, gradually enhancing your ship and personal capabilities, getting a sense of satisfaction when your new fusion missile blasts a higher rated ship into space debris, and always wanting to take on just one more mission before going to bed.  So far, I've only played freelance and am enjoying it immensely.  There's also a story line option that I'll try later.  My only ding is that the manual is inadequate causing some minor frustration.  This is offset by ample online help in the forums.  The developers are highly responsive to forum topics and continue to improve on the game.  I view it as a solid long-term investment in fun!

												Once I got around the confusing controls and figured out how to configure the ship and upgrades the game started to be playable right up until it crashed. So I reloaded it, Crashed again. Then I turned off all the graphics goodies. Crashed. The game has serious issues and until they are patched the game is unplayable. I am using version 1.302 (latest Steam version). I don't recommend this until the crashing issue is resolved. P.S. I am running a 3.6 GHZ Intel  with Nvidia 650 Ti Boost , 8 GB ram. No other Steam games I bought have this issue. Update on the crashing: It seems to happen when I use a non-Trinity ship. I can play ok if I am using a Trinity bought ship. This ponits to database errors. I have to change my recomendation since the game is quite playable now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												. I got bored exactly after 34 houur of gameplay, I got Tzar-ship and then it's no fun at all. Before I got Tokio-ship and that was easy play too.It's pitty, that in SG2 the ships have so few options regarding armament, so few combinationst etc. I would welcome, if you could choose mounting position, firing angle, firing sequenc etc for every weapon. I find, that the ""protection against hacking"" and ""system hitpoints"" ENHANCEMENTS are totatlly useless. I don't need FLEET at all too. The game is fairly simple without having fleet.This and other things are useless in the game.I would welcome, if there would be greater battles, with your own fleet, more tactics in the game. For example, you could start playing with one ship and and with 3-4 fleets and different tactics for different opponents.			",31,1,0,5,11,0,17

												Here is my story.I played relaxed with a laid back approach, carefully picking freelance jobs on my road of exploration. I needed a bigger ship, which I did a few times over, from your first gunship, to a corvette into a frigate. Fights were hard, sometimes impossible, so my quest for more power continued. At 30 hours I got my first Battleship class spaceship. The immense power I unleashed on the Starpoint Galaxy was crazy, I kept capturing ships, making more money and destroyed my foes.I guess I keep laughing till I have wiped all enemy generals from my star chart.

												I've been seeking out the right meditational space game for a very long time and I finally found it in SPG2. It's not too hard to pull you into it, it's not too easy to have depth. I can play it for hours, get bored, have my life back and then return to it later, with joy, to put in a some more hours and that just works perfect for me.			",25,5,0,1,14,1,7

												First off ignore my play time. I do most of my gaming at work and dont have an internet connection. Unfortunately Steam doesnt keep track of play time while in offline mode. As of writing this I have around 24 hours of gameplay in. In short this game is excellent and well worth the money.The universe is huge. And it would take a long while to fly from one side to the other. The ships are awesome. There is a lot to do.. You can be a trader, a pirate, a bounty hunter... The list goes on. It takes a lot of work to acquire new ships and level up. Not in a bad way.  I actually love it.. In my 24 hours of playtime I've only recently just captured a ship worth keeping and transferring to. Its not really grindy in my opinion as there is so much to do it seems you're all the time doing something different or new. I see that as a really good value for my money. I have only done 3 main/campaign quests at this point as you have to take time to level up and gear up for them. So its not a game you're going to beat within a few hours. Capturing ships better than yours is a real challenge and its very rewarding when you finally get one. So far Ive found capturing ships to be the funnest and most profitable thing to do. And when you finally get out of the starting gunship into something better it gets a little easier and much more profitable. The learning curve is easy. Not like learning X3 or anything. You can pick it up fairly quick.The game doesnt baby you.. You can run into a battleship that will destroy within minutes of starting the game so you always have to be careful and keep an eye out. There's always a challenge..It's not a game that will allow you to feel like a god that just steam rolls everything that comes along. I like that as it gives you something to strive for. However I will say now that I've gotten a better ship (Its a corvette btw) i come across a lot more ships that are weak or trivial. Its extremely cool when you come into an area with a bunch of them.. I just turn on Auto fire and watch my ship just destroy 5 or 6 ships within minutes.. It's awesome.So far the only things that Ive found to be less than great are the voice acting and traveling..The voice acting is far from good. Its not so bad that it destroys the campaign for you.. But its not good either lol. Your ships computer voice is great though and thats the one you'll hear 90% of the time. The traveling.. When you first start you dont really have a choice but to fly all the way to each location. As warp gates are expensive and not really an option at first. Worm holes do damage and really dont have enough of them to justify them as a good way to travel. Rifts help but they are kind of hard to stay in. So at first the traveling gets kind of old as the map is just so hufmge it can really take a long while to get from one point to another. But after you get a decent income going and you can afford the warp gates its not bad. All in all the game has been an excellent experience. And I feel the user rating should be quite a bit better than it is now. It's a game that I've quickly became addicted to and I already know I'll have hundreds of hours into before I get tired of it.If your looking for a good space rpg, sandbox, freelancer type game this one will not dissappoint.

												Pros:-It's pretty straightforward and fun. You don't need a month to learn all the controls.-lots of ships to collect and fill your garage-upgrades and things to spend money on-pretty good atmospheric space with things in itCons:-the ships feel a little same-y. After progressing from gunship through cruiser so far, there's little real difference-the missions feel a little same-y, side quests are just the same as the randomly generated quests. Main quests are only slightly different so far.-no dynamic economy, at least as far as I can tell. Gods are such small money compared to capturing ships and doing missions that you'll find yourself just hitting'sell all' instead of telling around for best pricesThis closest game to compare I've played is x2. This stacks up as a much simplified relative. It's more fun much faster, but there's also less depth. In x2 I would leave my computer running all day with time compression on and come back to see how much money I'd made reading. A game that can pay itself, and you build in the means to speed it up, should probably put a little more focus on fun. But it also was a much more engaging dog fighter. Here ask guns are on turrets, so the most effective combat is to just set them on automatic. Not the most engaging. The capture mechanic is decent, better than the x2 random bail out thing. But you can't command your own fleet and start and trade empire or manufacturing empire. There just seen to be fee ways to interact with the world. You can shoot things, scan them, grapple them, shoot them... I like the grapple mechanic by the way. But the ships don't feel different and lack a grand sense of scale. So yeah it's fun to capture and collect a bunch of ships, but the upgrades are a little wonky and there's not a ton to do outside of that. The weapons can be upgraded and swapped out, but all the other systems on the ship are fixed and can only have upgrades added. Why can't I customize whether I wasn't cloaking or a hanger? Style of pay is dictated by ship choice, not Games are cool and the most fun when you feel like you're discovering something special. An abandoned derelict that you can salvage for special items? Or one that's functional and maybe had a special feature. Hidden upgrades, officers, unique items that you can find as you explore would all help the depth of the game world. Overall 7.5/10Fun, but comes across a little flat. Could use some flair to make it feel more special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My friend had it in his steam library and I was looking for something to scratch that Eve online/Elite Dangerous/space sim itch. After putting in 50+ hours and beating the story line (all for free, mind you) I decided I needed to buy the gold pack. With the added story and gear in DLC and available mods in the workshop, I think I'll be spending another 50+ on this. Awesome game!			",103,6,2,15,6,0,18

												I bought the game in early alpha but didn't touch it until the Titans DLC came out. Why ? Dunno, really. Every time I booted it and flew around for a bit it seemed slow and dull, with small dinky ships and a dirty-looking skybox. Recently, I bought and played Rebel Galaxy and, while it was a lot of fun for a while, I quickly grew bored by the simplistic structure and extremely straightforward combat. But I was in a ""space"" mood and decided to give S♥♥♥♥ solid try.Boy, am I ever glad I did. After a short but steep learning curve, the game opens up like a pinata, pouring out quests, ships, modules, weapons, skills, perks, etc. I fired up the campaign mode because (just a personal preference) I like to have a meta-story to hover around. I found the campaign to be serviceable. Not great but perfectly adequate as a background for your adventures. The game really shines in its many, many choices of ships and one look at some discussions in the forums will convince you that there's no single ""I win"" build. Many ships and many configurations are viable. Gameplay is varied enough to keep me entertained and can give rise to some situations worthy of an action movie. One time I was returning to a station with a captured ship worth about 2.5 million credits in tow. I was out of boosters and had taken serious hull damage, with no way to repair it. As I approached the station, I saw to my horror that it was surrounded by a cloud of enemy ships. My first instinct was let go of my prize and beeline it to another station. But then I thought ""♥♥♥♥ them. I've earned this ship. I'm not abandoning it to a bunch of jackals"". I let go of the grapple some distance from the station and fired up the superdrive in order to evade enemy fire. By flying close to the group, I was able to detach individual ships from their group one by one, slowly reducing their numbers. On occasion, my shields went down to almost nothing, and I had to hightail it out of Dodge to let them recharge. Eventually, I killed them all and went back to reclaim my captured ship. That was the sweetest money I ever made in the game and I was replaying the fight all day in my mind while my wife was wondering why I was grinning like an idiot.  ",75,12,4,20,22,0,37

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is extensive and packs in an incredible amount and variety of content, especially with the two current DLCs. The map itself is evident to this. I myself enjoy the  freeplay mode, as it allows for more customization of my character and allows for a more unique exploration of the world. Not to mention the unique dynamics the game allows, including the combat mechanics, political affiliations, etc.The main achievement of this game- its size- is also part of an issue that it has. This issue is the immersion level.Apart from the storylines and cutscenes, the only way to interact with other ships is to either repair them or (more often) fight them. Such a big world with only limited interaction can begin to feel... empty. In a universe potrayed by Starpoint Gemini, such an expansive space, the aspect of trade would be very important. I suggest a new dynamic with other ships that would allow the player to trade with them. In essence, using the same model as that when docked in a space station but with friendly freighters, carriers, etc. Another suggestion is to add randomized large scale battles between rivaling territories. It seems odd to me that a system in such turmoil has so little actual conflict after the storyline. Not to mention being part of large scale battles is a thrilling experience.Finally (I am unsure if your system allows for this), a very nice addition would be visible upgrades or customizations to the player's ship. For instance, one could buy a new engine/thruster for a ship and visibly replace the one their ship has or armor upgrades that visibly cover the ship's hull. These additions would add some much needed immersion and keep the gameplay fresh without the need for another DLC.			",37,5,0,6,5,0,1

												I've been playing this game about a week, and got up to level 10. It's not a bad little game, but don't expect too much, and don't pay more than $10 for it. The learning curve isn't too bad, but the controls aren't intuitive, so expect to stare at the screen dumbfounded a few times at the start. The tutorial is not much. It's all reading with no in-game walkthrough. On the other hand, after only a few tries you should have the contols down pat. The storyline is so Byzantine that you could never keep up with it, and their are no cut scenes, just cardboard cutouts in the top left of your screen trying to keep you abreast of the storyline. It's almost as if they made the game first, and then inserted a story. Also the voice acting is subpar, but to tell you the truth, there are very few games where I cared about the story (Homeworld, Starcraft, and that's about it). The visuals are actually superb. Just flying through space and looking at the colorful planets and nebula is fun in itself. The combat is good, though there really is no dogfighting. If you are in combat and you have any kind of acceleration, you'll be miles away after only a few shots, and then you have to turn around and go back. Basically it's like the British and French during the Napolianic wars. You just stand there and hammer away at each other until one of you is dead. Upgrading ships is practically unkown in the beginning of the game. When the next ship costs 10 million and you only have 250,000 and the missions give you a paltry 10,000, you aren't upgrading fast.  That too goes for the ship modules. Upgrading weapons, shields, propulsion, and the like is the same as upgrading ships; expensive. The thing that I don't understand is that Freelancer was put out in 2003, and yet this game isn't a quantum leap in game play. In fact it's actually a step backward. It's like we didn't have 13 years of game development. But, like I said, it's not a bad game, just don't expect too much and don't spend too much money on it.			",25,0,0,3,1,0,12

												A few hours in, and it holds up so far.Is it the game of the year? No.Is it good? Yes, yes I would most definitely say so, but I would recommend that you are somewhat familiar with other games of this type, because the freeroam mode requires that you give yourself a purpose.Also; It is singleplayer only. Not neccesarily a bad thing, but just keep that in mind when contemplating a purchase.Good job, Little Green Men Games. Good job. :)			",85,14,1,16,24,0,28

Twelve hrs in with no DLC turned on (free DLC is to be had {some say it reduces the grind}) I'm having a good time!The fact that I want a better fleet is the heart of the game, if you want voice acting and velvet ropes go somewhere else.

												Amazing devs, very nice comunity... Oh this is not a review of the game?OK here it is:The game is very good, sort of a light version of the various X games (it's missing the deep economy and the station building/handling aspects), but has almost everything else (ship capturing included), on the other hand is way easier to get into.There are 2 main modes, ""storyline"" and ""sandbox"", but also on story mode you can go your own way ingoring the main missions.

								Interesting.  The beta is quite polished, so high marks there.  This game has huge potential.  Someone else called it ""EVE Offline"" and I'd agree with that, but naturally the economy is not as robust and combat is pretty easy.  I'm impressed with the modding community so far and I think this game can be something great if the community sticks around.  Well worth the price, great value.			",34,2,0,9,1,0,9

								I'll update my review as the game continues development.7/19/2014, First ImpressionsI bought Startpoint Gemini 2, in spite of not really caring too much for the first one, but since it was on sale, and since it seemed to be so popular, I thought I would give this development studio another shot.  So far, I am glad I did.  Being an early access game, I expected some features needing polishing, and other features not yet to be fully implemented, which indeed is the case at the time of this initial post.  Having said that, I must say I find the gameplay mechanics very interesting, and the combat compelling.  If you are a fan of the old ""X"" games (except for X: Rebirth), you'll find some familiar concepts such as trading and boarding.  I also enjoyed how functional the developers made their starmap, making it easy to find missions, side jobs, or other distractions, whilst providing a wealth of information such as reputation and factions of each sector.  My only complaint here, is the lack of a legend.  I hope, in the near future, that will be provided as an on/off toggle.The combat is fun and flexible.  With the ability to upgrade, enhance, or otherwise customise your ship, each ship type you are capable of flying provides a wealth of possible combat configurations to fit your playstyle, or to try out different tactics.  I found the tactical overlay in combat especially helpful, though I had to manually assign a hotkey for it.  Of course, being an early access game, there are several areas upon which they can improve, such as providing a text-based battle log, or some other method of communicating more detail on what exactly is happening.  For example, when targeting an enemy, you have no consistent view of their shields.  There is some kind of HUD element that pops up when you first target them, but it does not stay up, and there is no clue on how to consistently get the information available.  It would be nice to be able to see, at least, the target's shield status on a consistent basis.  Likewise, critical hits are communicated, but no details are provided, such as what systems were critically hit.The Skills & Perk system of your officer is pretty cool.  It adds a lot of depth by allowing skills to provide several affects at once, while at the same time keeping the amount of button mashing (or mouse clicking) to a minimum.I will say one thing in this ""first impressions"" entry, and that is I was disappointed at not being able to command a fleet whilst directly controlling a ship of my own.  It is my hope that the developers have plans to allow this, as some of the game menus and screens suggest (such as ""fleet management""...implying the ability to manage more than one ship in your fleet).

												What can I say...The voice acting is bad.The story is mediocre.The economy is not alive.Ways to make money are not balanced.Cargo space is far too limited even in freighter type ships.Ships are not really balanced in their own classes, much less beyond them.Every ship turns like an oil tanker with its anchor down including the light gunships and corvettes.Ships in general feel a little small. It's hard to tell a battleship from a corvette at even a relatively close distance. You need to be in molester range to see the difference.Most of the systems aren't explained even though there's about a billion tutorials in the first hour.Tethering a captured ship is painfully boring what with not being able to use PTE else the grapple breaks so I hope you captured one next to a friendly station and not one deep in hostile territory.Overall...I give Freelancer 2 a 6/10. It could have been much worse.			",131,12,1,32,15,1,23

There's always a ship which excels in it's category, which means most of the ships you fly - if you do choose one other than the obvious (or one of the obvious) best choice, for it's aethetics alone. The planets become much the same - the stations, same same, but it's still very satisfying to be king swinging♥♥♥♥♥♥for a little while.			",386,72,12,60,59,4,94

												Don't be fooled by the 30 factions, there are essentially 2 - good or bad, and even then being ""bad"" is difficult due to how reputation is managed.The gameplay is alright, but the most effective way of making money is SLOWLY towing in captured ships to salvage them. Cargo is incredibly limited on anything but freighters, but why would you ever fly a freighter? There is no sandbox or dynamic economy to speak of, so there's not point in being a pacifist. Regions are locked to one faction, the map is entirely static and the campaign is laughable. Large ships are only marginally slower than tiny ships, and no ship ever reaches the size of even the smallest EVE Online capital ship, so piloting a ""fighter"" is essentially the same as a carrier.Still, I love this game.The music is fantastic, the fetch quests are in an atmospheric enough universe that I don't mind the skinner box, the modding tools seem to be very powerful so a few of these issues could (or are already fixed). The ships don't look all that great (I don't think any game is going to reach the same level of lore and style as EVE Online), but I still love piloting them.I love it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have a specific itch.

												Yea the presentation of certain elements in the game kinda sucked. Especially when it comes to trading. However, this is probably the only space game that does a good job of the whole space captain thing by giving total freedom in the star system and with the cell loading stutters aside, it is actually quite enjoyable to fly around. The ship customization is also done very well, allowing cosmetic modifications and system modifications to fit your preferred playstyle. This is not a AAA game, but I feel confident in saying that it is worth the buy.			",104,9,0,10,11,1,23

												Not going to lie, this game is very rough around the edges.  (Especially in the form of camera control!)

I enjoy space games far too much to pass up on this game going on sale, and for $15 for the game and all DLC, I certainly don't regret making my purchase. That being said, I'm looking forward to their next title, as they should be able to apply all of the things they've learned from this title to that.   ",79,11,1,12,8,0,11

								This is definitely worth the money.I'm having a lot of fun just flying through space and the random encounters, doing bounties etc.The graphics are really good, and the universe doesn't seem like you're playing on a 2D map. Planets are beautifully rendered. The ships are well designed. You can tell that someone has put a lot of love into crafting this game once you start roaming around in open space or by visiting a station, browsing through the trader, etc.Brings back so many memories from Freelancer. This game has it all, and then some. Well, maybe not all. It still lacks multiplayer, but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying this brilliant game, which is trying to put the space-sim genre back onto the map (And it does it quite well too!) for old space-sim fans such as myself.The control system is just like in Freelancer and that's what automatically drew me in. It was the one thing that kept me playing Freelancer for all those years. I still hope they will let us set up our controls a bit more as we see fit, but the game is not finished yet, and i am certain there'll be a lot of updates still to come that may cater more to those of us who loved Freelancer.Some of the ships you can buy, right now, are a bit overpriced but they'll no doubt change the prices prior to release.I won't go through any pros or cons whilst the game is still not yet finished, but as it stands right now, even before they've implemented the campaign mode, i'm going to give this game a 10/10, hands down. Amazing work LGMG.			",76,7,2,33,2,2,15

								I HIGHLY recommend that if you are thinking aout buying this game, you definataty should. Despite being in beta, it plays like it is a fully developed retail title. There are a few minor bugs, but small enough that they do not affect the overall gameplay. The game has a complex combat system so it will keep you entertained, but it is also so easy to learn so it doesnt leave you with the feeling that a over complicated simulation game does. But it is just not they gameplay, the developers are amazing. They willingly AND eagerly communicate with the community for tech issues, bug reports, and tips and suggestions on how to enhance gameplay. I STRONGLY suggest that you at least check the game out because it is my favorite space sim/rpg, hell, maybe even one of my favorite games of all time, and i can guaranty you will enjoy just as much as I do.

Where the developers have chosen what they like the most about both games and thrown them together in a singleplayer epic space sim.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 – ReviewHi everyone,This is my first ever review that I am writing.  I just bought the game last night and started playing this morning.  Before buying I read some other reviews just to get an idea if I should take the leap into the void.  Well, I took the leap (based on some good reports) and what I found was far from a void.  Here are some bulleted remarks:•	I was immediately impressed by the structure and layout of the game as soon as I entered. No nonsense.  Get in and get on with it.  I loved that.•	There is a lot of depth to the game with a creative insight to usability.  •	Personally I like the way the tutorial is incorporated into the start and the way that it is presented (simplicity and effectiveness).  Here are some thoughts:o	The font on the display was a little difficult for me to read (15`` screen, max settings), but that could be due to the screen size, not sure).o	At the start where you select from the three types of careers, it also might need a better font and colour scheme (just my personal opinion) to read a bit better. Everything still very good, don’t get me wrong.o	Would also advise to have a smart lady voice to read out tutorials as you go along, whilst displaying text (always keep the text).  Do not overcook and cause annoyance.o	Just mention within the tutorial that a “Collect all” indicator will pop up (after you destroyed an asteroid) once your close to the collectable. Was a bit unsure at first how I would collect, but became obvious when the pop up appeared to collect when I destroyed an asteroid up close.•	In- game graphics, display hub and layout is amazing. Great job.•	I absolutely love the small tutorial button, accessible at any time, especially when getting use to the game (keep it).•	Like that I can scroll up and down with mouse wheel in tutorial and other hud displays.•	Like that there is a info bubble over icons and other aspects.•	Love the idea of boarding and capturing ships and that you can do different things with those ships, brilliant.•	Great idea to be able to launch the whole or individually selected fighter wings and that there is criteria added to the fighter wings as well.•	Personally I like that there are asteroids all around to get some loot from and that it’s not just in pockets.I am a teacher by occupation and therefore I like clear and structured instructions.  I think the developers got this done well and that the ""polishing"" is going to make the tutorials and overall game experience even better and better.I love this game already and I have only been playing for a couple of hours.  I am super excited about what it is yet to deliver and the hours and hopefully years of joy I will get from venturing through this vast space full of life and challenges.If you love space sims you will not regret buying this game.  It is definitely worth the money for me below $17.I will try and write more reviews on the game as I continue to play.  Man, this is a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Haven't played long, but it is turning out to be a fun game. The combat is a little difficult at first, but if you get a pirate that is much higher than you, just use the go to and get out. I am looking forward to them adding stuff to this. It really needs a lot done. I wish it would tell me in a onscreen scolling text or something what I just picked up. I also wish there was some indication how close I need to do to do certain things. Like how close to do a Repair or scan. You apparently need to be within like 100.			",28,3,0,16,2,0,9

								Having had this game for quite some time but only having checked it out for a couple of minutes, today I decided to check it out how it has come along in the months since I originally bought it. Needless to say I was instantly hooked and immensely enjoying myself.I am a Freelancer fan and although this game is not the same, it bears some resemblance with it.For anyone looking for a very good looking space action/strategy/trade game with lots of depth and very nice graphics (and music - I just love the soundtrack !) I can heartily recommend Starpoint Gemini 2.One last thing I would like to mention : the developers of this game are very active in their community and reply almost instantly to questions / remarks / suggestions. Thumbs up !Also : Steam Workshop support !			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For an early access, I do love the game ! The graphic options are limited for now but still looks great ! I'd like to see the joystick support ASAP because the control on the keyboard and mouse is good enough but you can feel that the gameplay would be better with a joystick.Even for an early access , i'd recommend the game as it is , in his current state, immersive enough to have fun while testing the game ! Usually testing comes with horrible bugs , unplayable moments, unstable graphics or random crashing which as for now starpoint gemini 2 havent produced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've logged about 6 hours so far. It's absolutely cut of the same cloth as the freelancer style games. I'm enjoying it, esp. since it scratches an itch I haven't been able to in ages.It runs fine on my aged machine, without ratcheting down the video options. Haven't had any glitches or crashes. It looks pretty, similar to EVE.The UI is taking some getting used to, but I'm pretty competent in a fight now. Only down side there is bounty targets are hard to locate (I've only done so by accident so far.) It's nice that each ""role"" has some special abilities you can use in combat. Combat flows smoothly. It's neat how you can switch back and forth between direct control and letting your crew fire your guns for you if you need to focus on flying.Oh, yeah: crew. This game isn't single-man fighters like those older games. You CAN stay small, but even then it's a corvette or gunship. But you can also go big, with battleships and carriers. You can hire crew (which grant buffs), and eventually add wingmen to fly a small fleet. I'm looking forward to that.The trading is what you'd expect, and I'm grateful the game tracks high & low prices for you. Currently [in beta] earnings from hunting outstrip trading, so I hope they tweak the economy by launch. You can also mine asteroids and salvage defeated ships.The map starts concealed, and reveals as you explore. This often uncovers missions (bounties, supply or taxi runs, science scans, and rescues so far).Levelling up serves two functions. First you get points to make your special abilities better. Second, for unlocking the better ships. Because it doesn't just give you bigger numbers like a traditional RPG, there isn't a power creep.Over all I'm pretty happy. This is MUCH more playable than the X games.			",83,21,0,29,6,0,5

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

												Its a great space sim type game, with a more arcadey feel to it, and a bit of RPG.  Can't wait till they come out with the campaign!So its been released for awhile and I've played a good amount since then, definately the funnest space game out right now(I have all the recent major ones), lots of stuff to do, some really great looking areas too such as nebula's and asteroid fields,  Campaign is decent, not exactly all I was hoping for but it still gives you direction.

Early Access Review
								This game is excellent.  I'm only a few hours into it and don't even know the full extent of what it has to offer, but even what I've seen so far is extremely well done.  The system is open.  The ships pilot well from the keyboard or the mouse (haven't tried using a flight stick, yet).  The customization is extensive.  Overall, I'd say it's extremely good as beta releases go.  That's not to say there isn't some room for improvement.  There is.  But, the overall state of the game is very good and shows great promise.As far as negatives go, I'd have to say the biggest one for me is that there is not enough feedback when your shots impact an enemy vessel, especially on beam weapons.  The beams fire out and follow your targeting cursor, so the actual firing is good and responsive.  But, even at near point blank ranges, there isn't much to let you know that your beams are impacting a solid object.  Even a sound effect would be nice, a sort of deep rumble or a sort of cutting sound as you hit the enemy hull.  Close up, it's not a big deal.  But, at long distances, you aren't sure if you're connecting and wind up squinting at the screen to watch the enemy shield indicator.As I said, overall, this game is excellent, and it's still in beta.  I suspect there will be a lot more in the way of improvements.  I got this for $16.74 when it went on sale, and I'd say it's well worth that price.  Knowing what I know about it now, I'd likely buy it at full price.  As Early Access or beta games go, this is among the best.  Give it a shot.			",122,17,4,20,13,1,9

								I'll update my review as the game continues development.7/19/2014, First ImpressionsI bought Startpoint Gemini 2, in spite of not really caring too much for the first one, but since it was on sale, and since it seemed to be so popular, I thought I would give this development studio another shot.  So far, I am glad I did.  Being an early access game, I expected some features needing polishing, and other features not yet to be fully implemented, which indeed is the case at the time of this initial post.  Having said that, I must say I find the gameplay mechanics very interesting, and the combat compelling.  If you are a fan of the old ""X"" games (except for X: Rebirth), you'll find some familiar concepts such as trading and boarding.  I also enjoyed how functional the developers made their starmap, making it easy to find missions, side jobs, or other distractions, whilst providing a wealth of information such as reputation and factions of each sector.  My only complaint here, is the lack of a legend.  I hope, in the near future, that will be provided as an on/off toggle.The combat is fun and flexible.  With the ability to upgrade, enhance, or otherwise customise your ship, each ship type you are capable of flying provides a wealth of possible combat configurations to fit your playstyle, or to try out different tactics.  I found the tactical overlay in combat especially helpful, though I had to manually assign a hotkey for it.  Of course, being an early access game, there are several areas upon which they can improve, such as providing a text-based battle log, or some other method of communicating more detail on what exactly is happening.  For example, when targeting an enemy, you have no consistent view of their shields.  There is some kind of HUD element that pops up when you first target them, but it does not stay up, and there is no clue on how to consistently get the information available.  It would be nice to be able to see, at least, the target's shield status on a consistent basis.  Likewise, critical hits are communicated, but no details are provided, such as what systems were critically hit.The Skills & Perk system of your officer is pretty cool.  It adds a lot of depth by allowing skills to provide several affects at once, while at the same time keeping the amount of button mashing (or mouse clicking) to a minimum.I will say one thing in this ""first impressions"" entry, and that is I was disappointed at not being able to command a fleet whilst directly controlling a ship of my own.  It is my hope that the developers have plans to allow this, as some of the game menus and screens suggest (such as ""fleet management""...implying the ability to manage more than one ship in your fleet).

								This game is really fun, mostly a good time killer. What it lacks in combat is the availibilty of guns and enemy ships in numbers and types. The sound is decent, a better sound track is needed as well as ship sounds. When it comes to money the only way to get it is by destroying wanted ships and that is not hard but just very long, but it adds to the game than taking something away.			",63,7,5,12,2,0,3

								The first 10 minutes in this game I was confused, perhaps even almost ready to give up because there was no goal, no mission and I was just flying around not knowing what to do eventhough I read every tutorial properly... I though this is just another sandbox game to keep the player busy with repeatance... I am glad I gave it some more time.I opened up the star chart and realized you can fly just about anywhere, missions are scattered all around the star map, pirates come and hunt you and you can scavenge astroids and such for trading. Ahhhh I finally figured it out. M is the key to all purpose.I clicked my first mission which was a hunt, then set auto course there... my ship put all energy to my trusters and navigated me to the action zone. My first hunt was awesome and easy enough for a beginner like myself. I felt great... opened up the star map again and randomly clicked a point in a neighboring unexplored sector. My ship arrived and 3 new missions became available.The next misison was a repair mission, I came close enough to the to be repaired ship and selected it, using the context menu I repaired it and mission success :)Ah... finally I get it... This game is so much fun! Exploring the great beyond, trading at different planets.In other words... buy this if you like any of these...1. exploring2. missions3. trading4. huntingI have barely scratched the surface of this game so my review really is only based on that... but my first hour of gameplay was really memorable. I am sure there is more coming because only free roam is available now. I can't wait to see other scenarios.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After 15 hour game play I can say the following :All the things that other reviewers said about Elite, Privateer etc are correct.   I have played and loved these and have been an Eve player for a long time.  This is a a game in the same genre, but being offline means it has less stress that Eve.  Sometimes you want to reload and redo a big fight, not suffer the massive financial loss of losing a battleship.......It plays well, draws you into wanting that next ship, and there is a considerable kick from taking down a hero.  Even better was the feeling of success, the first time I managed to reduce a high threat enemy by shooting out their power, grappling the ship, sending in the marines and watching the progress as they swept the decks and captured the ship.  I then had to tow it (slowly so as not to lose the grapple) to a base, fighting of bad guys along the way, before realising the spoils.  This is a really neat bit about the game. the hangers and fighters onboard larger ships is another good idea.This is a beta, but well down the development line.   The iin game marketing needs a bit if tweeking, and I get occassional flashing screen section, but this goes after docking and relaunching and does not impair the game - this can be sorted.I thought that this was well worth the money.  I have really enjoyed the game and I keep wanting to come back.If you like Space  sandbox games, with the ability to kit out ships, run up to five ships, mine, shoot, trade and run missions, against a faction background, then this fits well into the genre with some modern and unique bits which are all it's own.

								This is definitely worth the money.I'm having a lot of fun just flying through space and the random encounters, doing bounties etc.The graphics are really good, and the universe doesn't seem like you're playing on a 2D map. Planets are beautifully rendered. The ships are well designed. You can tell that someone has put a lot of love into crafting this game once you start roaming around in open space or by visiting a station, browsing through the trader, etc.Brings back so many memories from Freelancer. This game has it all, and then some. Well, maybe not all. It still lacks multiplayer, but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying this brilliant game, which is trying to put the space-sim genre back onto the map (And it does it quite well too!) for old space-sim fans such as myself.The control system is just like in Freelancer and that's what automatically drew me in. It was the one thing that kept me playing Freelancer for all those years. I still hope they will let us set up our controls a bit more as we see fit, but the game is not finished yet, and i am certain there'll be a lot of updates still to come that may cater more to those of us who loved Freelancer.Some of the ships you can buy, right now, are a bit overpriced but they'll no doubt change the prices prior to release.I won't go through any pros or cons whilst the game is still not yet finished, but as it stands right now, even before they've implemented the campaign mode, i'm going to give this game a 10/10, hands down. Amazing work LGMG.			",76,7,2,33,2,2,15

								I HIGHLY recommend that if you are thinking aout buying this game, you definataty should. Despite being in beta, it plays like it is a fully developed retail title. There are a few minor bugs, but small enough that they do not affect the overall gameplay. The game has a complex combat system so it will keep you entertained, but it is also so easy to learn so it doesnt leave you with the feeling that a over complicated simulation game does. But it is just not they gameplay, the developers are amazing. They willingly AND eagerly communicate with the community for tech issues, bug reports, and tips and suggestions on how to enhance gameplay. I STRONGLY suggest that you at least check the game out because it is my favorite space sim/rpg, hell, maybe even one of my favorite games of all time, and i can guaranty you will enjoy just as much as I do.

								I've been watching this one from a distance for a few months. I'm in the Star Citizen alpha and the Elite beta, and while I enjoy the present state of both of those games, this little gem is just fun in a way those are not yet. I fly about, accepting missions and killing to my hearts content in an easy and intuitive UI. The game is rewarding and fun, and in its present state enjoyable.

												Very nice game, it really caught me right from the start. As with all space sims it takes a while to get used to the controls and UI, but if you've played space sims before it should not be a problem. Feels a bit like a combination of X3 and EVE online. Where the developers have chosen what they like the most about both games and thrown them together in a singleplayer epic space sim. I have not tried the campaign but the freeplay mode is great fun with very varied missions.Highly recommend to space nerds!			",200,27,0,26,20,0,31

								Starpoint Gemini 2 – ReviewHi everyone,This is my first ever review that I am writing.  I just bought the game last night and started playing this morning.  Before buying I read some other reviews just to get an idea if I should take the leap into the void.  Well, I took the leap (based on some good reports) and what I found was far from a void.  Here are some bulleted remarks:•	I was immediately impressed by the structure and layout of the game as soon as I entered. No nonsense.  Get in and get on with it.  I loved that.•	There is a lot of depth to the game with a creative insight to usability.  •	Personally I like the way the tutorial is incorporated into the start and the way that it is presented (simplicity and effectiveness).  Here are some thoughts:o	The font on the display was a little difficult for me to read (15`` screen, max settings), but that could be due to the screen size, not sure).o	At the start where you select from the three types of careers, it also might need a better font and colour scheme (just my personal opinion) to read a bit better. Everything still very good, don’t get me wrong.o	Would also advise to have a smart lady voice to read out tutorials as you go along, whilst displaying text (always keep the text).  Do not overcook and cause annoyance.o	Just mention within the tutorial that a “Collect all” indicator will pop up (after you destroyed an asteroid) once your close to the collectable. Was a bit unsure at first how I would collect, but became obvious when the pop up appeared to collect when I destroyed an asteroid up close.•	In- game graphics, display hub and layout is amazing. Great job.•	I absolutely love the small tutorial button, accessible at any time, especially when getting use to the game (keep it).•	Like that I can scroll up and down with mouse wheel in tutorial and other hud displays.•	Like that there is a info bubble over icons and other aspects.•	Love the idea of boarding and capturing ships and that you can do different things with those ships, brilliant.•	Great idea to be able to launch the whole or individually selected fighter wings and that there is criteria added to the fighter wings as well.•	Personally I like that there are asteroids all around to get some loot from and that it’s not just in pockets.I am a teacher by occupation and therefore I like clear and structured instructions.  I think the developers got this done well and that the ""polishing"" is going to make the tutorials and overall game experience even better and better.I love this game already and I have only been playing for a couple of hours.  I am super excited about what it is yet to deliver and the hours and hopefully years of joy I will get from venturing through this vast space full of life and challenges.If you love space sims you will not regret buying this game.  It is definitely worth the money for me below $17.I will try and write more reviews on the game as I continue to play.  Man, this is a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Haven't played long, but it is turning out to be a fun game. The combat is a little difficult at first, but if you get a pirate that is much higher than you, just use the go to and get out. I am looking forward to them adding stuff to this. It really needs a lot done. I wish it would tell me in a onscreen scolling text or something what I just picked up. I also wish there was some indication how close I need to do to do certain things. Like how close to do a Repair or scan. You apparently need to be within like 100.			",28,3,0,16,2,0,9

								Great Potential.I have not touched the first Gemini, this is my first time into Gemini world. But I have been a huge fan for Freelancer, X3 series and EVE. Right now it feels like this game is pretty close to Freelancer in the sense of combat and universe design. It provides a huge universe for you to explore, combat whatever or whoever you see as enemy and different ways to gather credit.So far I think there are several problems with this game.1. The universe feels detached from the player. Of course this has something to do with the absense of campaign and a main plot, but the universe still feels lonely, even worse than X3.2. Some of the UIs need more work. Sometimes it is difficult to find out more information about an item. I hope the game can impliment something like the info page in EVE, which gives a full list of all the details about an item and you do not have to go around the place to find out or get confused.3. The combat. The combat is very similar to X3, you have several batteries on diffent side of your ship and they can be controlled independent of the ship. This is OK but when you are engaged in a multi ship combat, you will most likely lose the sense of situation. I hope a third person view can be implimented. Also the weapon/damage/energy balance feels a little strange. Most weapon will suck your energy dry while taking less than 25% of your enemy's shield. It looks like it is encouraging hit and run tactics which is perfectly fine for small agile ships. What bothers me is the big boys like battleships do not get a substantial upgrade on the battery energy. Other than those, I think this is an exciting game and it has a lot of potential.PS, it looks like the game has some hints of a fleet feature. I hope they can do it right because fleet in X3 is a nightmare. Eithre do it right, or don't do it at all.			",58,6,0,6,5,0,36

								I've logged about 6 hours so far. It's absolutely cut of the same cloth as the freelancer style games. I'm enjoying it, esp. since it scratches an itch I haven't been able to in ages.It runs fine on my aged machine, without ratcheting down the video options. Haven't had any glitches or crashes. It looks pretty, similar to EVE.The UI is taking some getting used to, but I'm pretty competent in a fight now. Only down side there is bounty targets are hard to locate (I've only done so by accident so far.) It's nice that each ""role"" has some special abilities you can use in combat. Combat flows smoothly. It's neat how you can switch back and forth between direct control and letting your crew fire your guns for you if you need to focus on flying.Oh, yeah: crew. This game isn't single-man fighters like those older games. You CAN stay small, but even then it's a corvette or gunship. But you can also go big, with battleships and carriers. You can hire crew (which grant buffs), and eventually add wingmen to fly a small fleet. I'm looking forward to that.The trading is what you'd expect, and I'm grateful the game tracks high & low prices for you. Currently [in beta] earnings from hunting outstrip trading, so I hope they tweak the economy by launch. You can also mine asteroids and salvage defeated ships.The map starts concealed, and reveals as you explore. This often uncovers missions (bounties, supply or taxi runs, science scans, and rescues so far).Levelling up serves two functions. First you get points to make your special abilities better. Second, for unlocking the better ships. Because it doesn't just give you bigger numbers like a traditional RPG, there isn't a power creep.Over all I'm pretty happy. This is MUCH more playable than the X games.			",83,21,0,29,6,0,5

								As it stands now, even in Beta, it's a gorgeus game, and you can have great fun with it if you are a fan of the X4 genre or the more arcadish space sims out there. Well worth the money asked for.But I feel it needs a little push in some directions. It can become much more than it is now, if given enough deep and polish. For instance, weapon stats are confusing, and they have no description. Uniqueness and a little story for each weapon/ship/commodity in the world would make it deeper. The huge starmap needs more deepness too, the different factions are not different enough, more involvement in each of them would make it more fun. You need to love some factions and hate others, to be really immersed in the world. Currently, there are only good guys, and bad guys. You shoot the bad guys, that's it :-). Voiceovers and images of the different factions are a must to achieve this.Balance is still a little off, but it's to be expected in beta after all. You can destroy large enemy ships (destroyers or battleships) with your starter ship, without much sweating, but overall it's very fun and asks you for fairly involved gameplay, you need to use special powers and equipment to see it through the large battles unscathed.I know for a fact that the team is constantly updating and expanding the game daily, so I have high hopes for it all to be fullfilled in the end.Must buy for every space combat, space trader lover out there!

								Not a fanboy of this game, I just found it 2 days ago. It's still in beta and I'm pretty impressed. It obviously has a few little issues, but is really really stable for me and has great graphics and mostly good gameplay.I think it has potential and the best way fo describe the game - for me - is that it's somewhat like skyrim in space. The game obviously has huge influences from freelancer and elite from back in the day.Unfortunately along those lines I think getting mission after mission that appears randomly and is just spawned from a list of standard missions - the time for this kind of gameplay is over. This is no different than grabbing a dungeon RPG and only getting random encounters in the dungeons which spawn from a known list.I think the missions could be far more interesting but there needs to be more hand crafted missions for this to get the replayability that something like skyrim has.There are a few UI issues but they are minor nuisances more than anything.The AI is also needing some serious fixing, I got into the game and killed a ""hero"" in the first few minutes netting me 5 million credits which is a gigantic amount.I am totally looking forward to this release, the space flight and combat are fluid and fun.Definitely a thumbs up on this game, with the proviso that current beta issues are dealt with.*Hopefully* it's a must have game.

								I seldom review games. With that being said, this game has exceeded my expectations. Kudos to the developers!I have had zero issues with stability, crashes, etc and this game is gorgious! The tutorial was done very well, which let me jump right into the game, with a very minimal learning curve required. I look forward to seeing great things from this title and the developers who are responsible for such a great space sim/rpg .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								For an early access, I do love the game ! The graphic options are limited for now but still looks great ! I'd like to see the joystick support ASAP because the control on the keyboard and mouse is good enough but you can feel that the gameplay would be better with a joystick.Even for an early access , i'd recommend the game as it is , in his current state, immersive enough to have fun while testing the game ! Usually testing comes with horrible bugs , unplayable moments, unstable graphics or random crashing which as for now starpoint gemini 2 havent produced.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Starpoint Gemini 2 has the potential to be a serious contender in the space simulation and RPG categories.  The game is enjoyable.  It doesn't have a significant learning curve, and it's easy to get started right away without too much fumbling around trying to figure out which key does what.It doesn't appear to have any mechanism for owning/operating stations or multi-ship fleets that I've seen so far, but I'm only up to level 15 and haven't played very long.Despite this, I think it will be far more enjoyable than the recent disappointment in a long-running franchise (x).  I have zero problems recommending this game.			",82,9,1,18,10,0,24

								I buy a ton of early access games, they are the best in my opinion, this game is by far the best I have purchased. Yes it has bugs in it, you will have those at this current stage. This game though allows for a great deal of fun, right out of the gate you feel like you are a part of the world but your path is not yet defined. You get the fun of an RPG with the twitch of a TPS and all the enjoyment of space! I love EvE online but I can't afford to dedicate the time or money to the game at this time and this game is like having a small version of EvE in my opinion.Keep up the great work devs!

Early Access Review
								Great Potential.I have not touched the first Gemini, this is my first time into Gemini world. But I have been a huge fan for Freelancer, X3 series and EVE. Right now it feels like this game is pretty close to Freelancer in the sense of combat and universe design. It provides a huge universe for you to explore, combat whatever or whoever you see as enemy and different ways to gather credit.So far I think there are several problems with this game.1. The universe feels detached from the player. Of course this has something to do with the absense of campaign and a main plot, but the universe still feels lonely, even worse than X3.2. Some of the UIs need more work. Sometimes it is difficult to find out more information about an item. I hope the game can impliment something like the info page in EVE, which gives a full list of all the details about an item and you do not have to go around the place to find out or get confused.3. The combat. The combat is very similar to X3, you have several batteries on diffent side of your ship and they can be controlled independent of the ship. This is OK but when you are engaged in a multi ship combat, you will most likely lose the sense of situation. I hope a third person view can be implimented. Also the weapon/damage/energy balance feels a little strange. Most weapon will suck your energy dry while taking less than 25% of your enemy's shield. It looks like it is encouraging hit and run tactics which is perfectly fine for small agile ships. What bothers me is the big boys like battleships do not get a substantial upgrade on the battery energy. Other than those, I think this is an exciting game and it has a lot of potential.PS, it looks like the game has some hints of a fleet feature. I hope they can do it right because fleet in X3 is a nightmare. Eithre do it right, or don't do it at all.			",58,6,0,6,5,0,36

												I've had the game crash a couple of times. Not sure if it's my computer not being up to snuff, or if the game just doesn't like me exploring from sector to sector too quickly...In any case, SG2 is really fun. The controls make sense, the combat is simple to grasp - but easy to toy with, the ability to simply mine for ore, or loot derelicts and debris for cash combined with the ability to attack any ship you come into contact with for their goods makes for a good choice. Annoying that one destroyed ship means the whole faction turns against you, though. You'd think it should be like a heat meter, or something along those lines.I haven't gone too much into it (work gets in the way - don't grow up, kids), but it's fun from what I've played. I do agree with what Zaayl says - that there could and should be more to the game - but it's definitely a game I recommend.			",37,10,0,25,6,0,7

												What can I say...The voice acting is bad.The story is mediocre.The economy is not alive.Ways to make money are not balanced.Cargo space is far too limited even in freighter type ships.Ships are not really balanced in their own classes, much less beyond them.Every ship turns like an oil tanker with its anchor down including the light gunships and corvettes.Ships in general feel a little small. It's hard to tell a battleship from a corvette at even a relatively close distance. You need to be in molester range to see the difference.Most of the systems aren't explained even though there's about a billion tutorials in the first hour.Tethering a captured ship is painfully boring what with not being able to use PTE else the grapple breaks so I hope you captured one next to a friendly station and not one deep in hostile territory.Overall...I give Freelancer 2 a 6/10. It could have been much worse.			",131,12,1,32,15,1,23

												It's good, but not $35 USD good.You'll cringe as Adrian ""My Father"" Faulkner awkwards his way through space, and the characters you meet have as much depth as a proverbial puddle, but I did still enjoy it - and finished it!The early game can be somewhat grindy, but capturing ships (the best way to get those doller bills (y'all)) is kind of fun.Essentially Freelancer 2.0, some plot about aliens and an old earth empire.Could use a lot of improvements - there's so many factions but so little incentive to meet them (or destroy them). There's always a ship which excels in it's category, which means most of the ships you fly - if you do choose one other than the obvious (or one of the obvious) best choice, for it's aethetics alone. The planets become much the same - the stations, same same, but it's still very satisfying to be king swinging♥♥♥♥♥♥for a little while.			",386,72,12,60,59,4,94

												Yea the presentation of certain elements in the game kinda sucked. Especially when it comes to trading. However, this is probably the only space game that does a good job of the whole space captain thing by giving total freedom in the star system and with the cell loading stutters aside, it is actually quite enjoyable to fly around. The ship customization is also done very well, allowing cosmetic modifications and system modifications to fit your preferred playstyle. This is not a AAA game, but I feel confident in saying that it is worth the buy.			",104,9,0,10,11,1,23

												Not going to lie, this game is very rough around the edges.  (Especially in the form of camera control!)

I enjoy space games far too much to pass up on this game going on sale, and for $15 for the game and all DLC, I certainly don't regret making my purchase. That being said, I'm looking forward to their next title, as they should be able to apply all of the things they've learned from this title to that.   ",79,11,1,12,8,0,11

								If you happen to be a fan of science fiction and flying around in space, Then this game happens to be for you. There is no out of flight sections of this game or any gun fights that don't end in space. This game is purely a fly around and shoot things kind of game. The world is open to you from the start but you will find yourself overwhelmed in any other sections of space past the first planets, You can mine for ore's for money to buy over priced weapons and ships or you can destroy enemy ships (or allied) for higher grade loot and income, That said..Mining is safe and unrewarding, Unless you find yourself in the deepest part of space mining in the most dangerous of places you will not find anything worth the time spent. Meaning most of you're money will come from hunting down bandits right? Well, even this can become unrewarding quickly. Depending on you're situation you may find yourself battered from all sides or simply obliterating you're opposition, Movement quickly becomes clumsy in combat and you will find you're ship is rather slow compaired to everything else. That said, Combat can easily be just as rewarding as it is dissipointing, The game in the beginning will feel slow but more options will rise up to meet you as you advance to better ships. The game is also in Beta and many of these issues will probably be fixed, I'd buy it again, So maybe you will enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I haven't written a review in a while.  I have to tell you about this game.  For those of you looking for freelancer 2, well look no further.  What can I say about this game.  I am playing Beta version 0.8004, the release date is right around the corner.  The combat is fun and not too terribly difficult.  The number of ships is high, I think there are 70 purchasable ships available right now.  All ships are upgradeable and can be customized with paint, ship name, custom logos as well.  I've been playing for about 7 hours and have only explored maybe 1% of the universe.  Right now its only a sandbox game, but they will have a story mode on release.  There is no limit to what you can do in just the sandbox mode.  You can mine asteroids for money, you can trade commodities, you can hunt pirates, you can destroy and/or capture ships and tow them to the nearest starbase and either add it to your garage or sell it.  The game also has RPG elements.  You can take freelance missions that are everything from simple taxi runs to assassination missions, sector patrols, capture missions, science missions where you scan anomolies, and I've even done a smuggle mission for big bucks.  Most of all, there is a huge universe to explore.  Its awesome.  Get it.  Do it now!			",33,2,1,14,11,0,10

												I have had a lot of fun with this game. This game has a high learning curve but its well worth it end. I have played this game for awhile before I got it on steam. This game has a deep story and plenty exploration. If your into open world space exploration with your choice of pirating or whatever else you can come up with then this game is worth a try. The game looks good and runs well from what I have seen.			",83,3,0,6,2,0,1

												I'm enjoying the game quite a bit because the graphics and core gameplay are enjoyable.  There's also a relaxed atmosphere to the game - I don't feel pressured into ""grinding in order to get to the good part"".  The story is decent and there's plenty of ""flavor text"",  galactic ""news"", and loads of other ships flying around that altogether make the game world feel alive.  The GUI is well-designed and easily accessable with the mouse - I don't even bother using the hotkeys 90% of the time.  This also means that learning to play the game does not require memorizing a bunch of hotkeys!The random mission system is better than average compared to other games in this genre.  Also, progression happens at whatever pace you choose - you can sit near a station and shoot asteroids in relative safety for small rewards, or you can do the level-adjusted missions for a modest reward at minimal risk, or you can rush straight to the hostile sectors and do missions 30 levels higher than your own.  Or you can skip the missions entirely and capture ships, selling them for massive profits if you have the skill to pull it off.On the negative side, the game's ambient music lacks variety, so it gets annoying quickly.  Also, the ship's computer sometimes repeats warnings more frequently than necessary, which is especially annoying if the shields repeatedly drop due to EMP effects.  These problems are simply fixed by adjusting the volume settings.  I recommend listening to some space ambient music on youtube/spotify/whatever.I bought the game and DLC (""gold pack""), and I feel like I got my money's worth.			",35,14,0,9,12,0,4

												Damn good space comabt sim with skills and perks like in an RPG, even in beta with no story line there are hours of fun to be had bounty hunting trading and doing freelance missions.The Dev team and community for this game are second to none and have helped shape this game from alpha to the stage it is at now and this will continue until the game in finished.Visually this game is very nice and will only get better and the MOD support makes this a real stand out game for me I can see years of good MODs coming. If you like me are waiting for Elite dangerous and need something to fill the void left after X rebirth was released in a poor state pick this game up. For me i'd say this game is 8/10 right now and when finished may even be a rare 10/10 gem of a game.Post release update:Now the game's story line has been added and there have been many good updates the past few months the game has moved into post release development. The Devs are far from done adding content this title infact there is at least one planned expanshion that will be free of charge and further implementation on community ideas to improve on what is a fantastic base game.With that in mind the game has improved no end and i logged 215+ hours in early access and i'll be looking to easly double that amount of play time. The game is now sitting at 9/10 for me and with a little more polish and the the planned updates will be a clear 10/10, the games is an instant classic in that it has all the elements of some of the classic space sims and the graphicial polish of modern space sims.Update 12 June 2015 Origin DLC for Free. The Free Origin DLC came out on the 11th and is a port of the first game into this games engine and offers a new campgain that is around 30 hours long and then you can free roam like the in the first paid DLC or the base game. There have been a steady stream of patches and improvements made to this title and for any spce combat sim lover this is a must have it's not a first person fly from the cocpit game which there are many but a capital ship sim which I enjoy mostly in 3rd person view.

												Is this game finished? Because right now it looks like a big, good looking box, waiting to be filled with equally good stuff.In short, it lacks engagement. Everything is very very static, with no real economy, events, or actuall stuff to do. There are 3 types of quests, and that's it. There's some semblance of main story, but that won't keep your attention for long. So, where's the rest of the game? Looks like a missed opportunity.			",24,10,0,35,25,0,51

												OK so if your a grumpy old git gamer like me who played feelancer on its release day you will know that this game is a blatent attempt to COPY FREELANCER without the massive budget and holiwood actors used to make the oridginal. The game uses places ship names faction names directly from freelancer without even trying in any way to hide that fact. Frankly im amazed Microsoft havent sued them into bancruptsy by now lol. But heres the mindblowing TRUTH this game is infinately better than eve better than star citizen which so far is a catastrophe and X rebirth a game for which egosoft should be stripped naked in public and pelted with rotten eggs. If you want a goode game similar to no sorry directly plageriseing Freelancer this is the game you want its a lot more fun than Elite dangerous too so BUY IT NOW before it gets banned. 8 out of 10			",33,7,0,35,11,0,28

												Dread. Really hate to give this review but here goes.Even the much aligned (by me) Dark Star One is better. It held my attention for 45 hours.7.5 hours into S♥♥♥♥nd I need to give it a thumbs down. I hate to do that given it's an acceptance of money down the drain. You can't win them all.I played Elite on the BBC B computer and all its subsequent upgrades. Long-time player of Eve Online, Freelancer, I War, X Wing and blah blah. Lots of them.Happy to give credit to the developers for trying and improving. I will definitely keep an eye on the new game and hope that is more my cup of tea.The game has a story driven content and a free roaming side. In fact even in the story mode you are quite free to roam around too which is a huge plus. It looks like to me the developers must have tacked the story line late in development as some of the beta testers much have shouted very loud ""Ho, hum, what do we do exactly?""Freelancer was the last great Space game and this is not a bad recreation of that. Just that in every aspect it is worse. It has me trying and failing to fit a DVD drive back into my PC so I could install it again.The in-flight movement and combat of your ship is pretty good. There are a few modes and modules to use. There is innovation where you can mostly destroy an opponent and then send some ruffians over to board it. If successful you can tow the ship back to a dock for huge income. Combat is pretty satisfying with options to fire yourself or computer controlled auto-fire. All thumbs up. I am told that as you upgrade your ship the movement in flight will also change. So big cargo ships move slower than smaller fast ships.Your pilot can improve his skills as you level up. This is also innovation for this type of game. To my rookie eye though these skills seem to be mostly +5% this and that. Your on-board computer scans the local area and identifies bounty opportunities and exploration is positively encouraged. The computer even remembers prices of commodities in every place you have docked which makes it very easy to trade away at the beginning. Whether you can do that as a main way of attaining riches I can't say. The prices of ships are very high.The universe itself feels slightly alive as you can pass fellow ships in your travels and scan and attack them for piracy fun. Planets and space stations have some small radio chatter that comes across.So why the thumbs down? Freelancer remains better and that was released years ago. It had better story line, graphics, ships, reputation system. Well, almost everything. I have hope though and if I ever play this one more will update this review. You might like it.

As it is now it seems that you are the only miner or trader in the universe. Also, it'd be nice to have more interaction between you and the other pilots you encounter in the universe. With that said, since the devs are really active in the forums and are working to add more features to the game and the game as it is now is already pretty good I still recommend it.

												So I got this game for gifted to me for 80% off. And I still feel a little bad about it, because it took 7 hours for it to dawn on me that it was probably something to refund. Which I now can't.Graphics: They aren't bad, but they seem bland, and even the skyboxes are a bit flat. It doesn't look like you're looking into deep space.Gameplay: Very little, mostly decision making. Which of these 3-4 Missions do I want to do? Enemy ships very rapidly become tanky and spawn in more than you can handle fairly quickly. Buying new gear or a new ship isn't really an option because gear is about 150-300k for the lower end stuff. And a new ship would be upwards of 500k-2m. Did I mention missions dole out currency in shots of 5k? 400 missions for a new ship.Trading is functionally nonexistant.Mining is there but is about as profitable as searching around a new york street for coins.Using manual firing is just an unpleasant experience, using automatic turret firing is derp and doesn't shoot at the targetted enemy, it just picks a random enemy.Scale: Everything feels very small, the planets feel small, the stations feel small, the ships feel small (even the ""dreadnought"" ships which honestly, between firepower, hp and size, do not deserve such a title).

												Great game, apart from the physics.It's the game Freelancer could have become if Microsoft hadn't killed it. The artwork is impressive, the variety is good, and in general I liked it.The only issue I have with the game, and this is a major issue for me, is the flight physics. It's a SPACE sim. That means that when I turn off my engine, I expect to keep going until I say otherwise. Not here. In this game, they've decided that space is really just air-based fighters where you can't fall down. Turn off the engine? Immediate stop. Try to coast so you can move in one direction but face another? Not possible - you only move forward. Freelancer had this right. These guys? Not at all. I initially recommended the game, but find that I can't honestly do that. If you want a jet fighter game set in space then yes, I'd strongly recommend this game.  If you're expecting a SPACE game look somewhere else, as I'm doing.I'm still searching for a game that was as elegant as Freelancer, with newtonian* physics, simplified flight systems (so Evochron Mercenary, with its ridiculously overcomplicated flight systems and 90's inspired console graphics doesn't really do it for me either), and a decent single-player campaign but sufficiently creative random campaigns to keep things interesting afterwords. Drop me a note if you have any suggestions.======* After reading several reviews, I see that ""newtonian"" needs to be defined. ""Newtonian"" physics is simple. It means that if I put my ship in motion on a specific vector, I will remain on that vector unless I do something to change it. Turning off the engines should NOT stop me cold in ""space"". I should just keep going until I do something to change my vector. That ""something"" includes turning on docking assist, braking thrusters, or what-have-you. I'll accept ""slowing down slowly"" (space dust, donchaknow) but not ""stops as if stuck in mud"". If I wanted to play ""cars in thick mud"" I'd play a land-based game.			",119,13,0,29,5,0,6

												This is a re-review implementing suggestions in comments:It's needlessly complicated, the z-axis doesn't add to the game compared to the original, and it generally isn't fun.Let me elaborate:-Although the single continuous world is an improvement, getting around said world is tedius and time consuming unless you happen to be near one of the shortcuts and that shortcut happens to end up where you need to be.-The combat is underwhelming. Basically, you tell the ship it can fire, it fires, you get shot at which is absorbed by shields, who wins is basically which of the parties has better shields and guns. Really the only thing you change is your facing so different shields absorb their attacks. Doesn't sound exciting, does it?-The user interface is complicated and it really has no reason to be. I came back to play Titans and I was constantly pushing the wrong buttons. The controls are not intuitive.-The story (including the DLCs) is uninspired, boring, completely forgettable, short, and ends before it feels like it should.There's only two things I enjoyed in this game:1) Exploring the galaxy.2) The SG1 campaign imported into SG2. This fixed a lot of the gripes I had about the original (especially having to grind to proceed) which is why I liked it.These things don't offset all of the other problems with the game though so still not recommended.As for why there are so many hours registered, it's most likely a product of running in the taskbar.  I repeatedly got bored of the game, alt+tabbed out, browsed the internet, and resumed later.  It does not reflect what it actuallly took to finish the game (as is the case with a lot of games).

												I really wanted to like this game.  I came back to it again and again HOPING there was just something I was missing.  But in the end, I had to uninstall it to make way for much better titles. If you plan to get SG2, I would advise you to just wait for the price where you can view it as an acceptable loss.

												Veri gud gaem. I paly al teh tiem!!!!!111oneoneSo... Cheap, good looking, betterthanCoDGhosts or omgit'sthatawfulXfranchiseagain, with constant updates and 5 dollar dlc (wtf? is it christmass or some other fairy tale♥♥♥♥♥♥again?)....It must be... some... Ubisoft...masterpiece... Ha-Ha, very funny mofo. It's Stargate Atlantis 2 people! No it's not. I can't remember the name and I'm pretty much err, happy, to scroll up. So, this is  a very cool game from my homeland of North Kor...err, I mean Croatia. Not much difference anyway. I'll try something coherent here but can't promise anything:Gameplay:  - Not like Freespace/X/Elite: Dangerous Gliches Attack- If some game I haven't played before...ever, and Elite: Something something had a baby, that would be...well, something I still haven't had a chance to play.- Actually it's a slower paced game than those shooters first, trader last. Move on.Gfx:- Indie game with better gfx than...wait for it...wait for it... GHOSTS man! Bloody CoD Ghosts. And looks better than every ""HEI I WANNA MAEK TEH INDEH MINECROFT STILEZ SURVIVAL BECOZ I HAEV NO SKILZ LOL"" (Terraria and so on)- This game hates me. Seriously, nVidia driver reminds me every day that I'm a stupid redneck. Why? Well, because I bought nVidia card...Even better... BLOODY SLI nVidia. Don't do that folks, you could die.Sound:- Nice soundtrack but honestly dear sound engineer/musician or whatever you like to repeat to yourself in front of the mirror. LEARN TO USE THE BLOODY COMPRESSOR!!!!!!!!11111ONEONE. Move on.Replayability:Dunno. I'll tell you when I find enough time to finish my first playtrough. I suppose it's one of those games you try the sequel or periodically reinstall the game and play for 2-3 hours before you try to find cheats.Would I recommend this game to anyone? Yes. Why? Because it's better than Elite. Around 120 times better than that crap. Meep.P.S. Sori for meh englis, i veri (3x) hapy atm.			",954,401,50,126,123,12,158

												Aside from the occasional freeze or ctd this game is great. Especially since you get the original game included and the expansions also. Huge, giant incredible amounts of content. As most reviewers will mention, the cash flow needs tweaking badly but mods, hacks or tedious grinding can fix all of that. Overall a great piece of work.			",77,20,0,9,2,0,21

												I picked this game up during a bundle but I wouldn't recommend it at any price point. Aweful voice acting, boring gameplay, and a seemingly nonsensical map structure are among the valid criticisms left by other negative reviews of this game.  I don't typically take time out of my day to publicly trash on a game but there are quite simply much better options out there for your time and money.			",193,40,4,17,20,0,34

												For the ""tl;dr"" crowd:  7/10Almost 80 hours in, I found the game to be enjoyable for a space sim.  Many similarities to the ""X"" franchise (I have over 200 hours in ""X2: The Threat""), but somewhat ""lighter"" in comparison.Game mechanics are adequate (stations, planets, commodities, equipment, etc,), and do not get in the way of game play.  Conversely, they are not ""deep"" (no stock exchange, no station building/owning, no empire building), so there comes a point where it becomes routine and a bit boring.  I only played a ""Gunner"", and did not engage in all of the the game's offerings (mining, bounty hunting, etc.).I found leveling to be almost too easy.  I would expect higher levels to become asymptotically harder to achieve, but the experience points required to level seemed to be rather linear.  After 78 hours of simultaneous freelance and story line, I was at level 79 (""Fleet Admiral""), where the story campaign was only requiring level 40.  If you want the story line to remain challenging, you should probably stick to it until it is complete, and then freelance.Graphics are above average.  I always play with everything on high, so the space junk, asteroids, nebulea, visual effects, etc. really added to the immersion.  One of the bright points of the game engine is that nothing in space is instanced.  You fly through space, going from one grid tile to another, without having to transition in any way.  The only transitions in the game happen with the Jump Gates, T-Drive or Wormholes, which one would expect.Combat is enjoyable, with enough going on to keep it interesting.  It doesn't take long, however, to know when enemies will ambush you, what specific loadout will let you take down a Hero, etc.  I rarely died in the game, and when I did, it was typically when there were just too many enemies concentrating their fire on me (and no allies in the vicinity to pull aggro for me), or when I accidently left my ""Fire At Will"" mode engaged and approached a station with enemies docked.It is a 1.2 release as of this writing, and I have still experienced a few bugs.  The most ubiquitous is a ""Maintenence"" mission not completing following combat enroute (either by ambush or just encountering enemies along the way).  One that just hit me, that caused me to stop playing, was my entire equipment inventory suddenly disappeared after a T-Drive jump and an ambush when I materialized.  I went to change my equipement loadout (swap the T-Drive with Energy Shield for the fight), and my rather robust equipment inventory was just gone!  I tried several things, but I couldn't get it back, and decided that was enough.I recommend the game to anybody who enjoys this genre (my favorite), and who is looking for a less-stressful diversion from the higher-order space simulations.

												I got this game as an alternative to Naev ( a 2D space sim game) and so far the game has a pretty good mechanism:- play the campaign, much easier since you have allies, but also the ability to make missions on free roam.- play on free roam, no allies, no reputation, just you and the universe, a higher challenge for players new to this.From me switching from 2D to 3D is a challenge (a hard one) but the tutorial helps, just read and try to understand how its done.

								Likes: +++ Skill System - there appears to be no limit to how high the skills can go... excellent!+++ Tactical display++ Auto Targeting - could be improved to prefer shooting at the current target and only when it's not possilble to shoot at something else. Prehaps instruct the gunner on which target to choose? (stronger, closer, the one attacking you... etc)++ Map and factionsDislikes: --- Travelling is slow, and the T-Drive is extremely expensive, you may not want your players to get bored while seeing a countdown from dist: 20.000 on the screen and doing nothing.--- Missions: I am level 25 and I still get only missions for 1.000 Cr... with 1.000 Cr I cannot cover the crew's salary-- Character customization (Name... etc) is missing at the beginning-- Weapons, so far not much to choose. I killed a wanted guy, gor 4.5Mil, got a better ship but same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons for sale-- Ship modules (power gen, shield... etc) There are enhancements, nice but I would like to have more types, better an better for each ship. Things that could be a WOW for me: *** The weapons could evolve with the game pace, the more time it passes, improved versions of the same weapons appear*** Weapon customization, modifications... ? *** Ability to build your own installations (small ones) which collect resources but need to be defended*** Ship Customization & Modification (add in slots and turrets for a cost)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The proper successor for the Honourable Freelancer series, made by Croatian indy studio.Game is superb, devs dedication is unparalled in so far (record of a  moment is 2 patches in a day).Game has fantastic GFX on better GFX cards, has a beautifully sculped universe and setting (check manual about intro), has a sandbox mode for leisure and a story mode for those interested in movies, stories, mysteries, politics, aliens etc...Game offers a player to fly many types (and lot of models) of ships from minute ones, to dreadnoughts and carriers.One can fly alone, or with wings of AI pilots (who receive orders, and yes, there is unavoidable chitchat occasionaly).One is a pilot with roleplaying options/skills...and other pilots...Unfortunately, at the moment, game has no MP support or option.Strategic layer in game is also planned as expansion/free addition ...Modding is about to be fully supported, and community has a major say in direction of that and further content that is being planned to be added into he game.There is a famous ""wishlist"" on the devs forums which puts everyone and their SF dreams to shame. A promise to incorporate most of it will be a small wonder in itself if it succeedes in 50%, let alone all.I wish there were more publishers and devs like those guys and those at witcher2 camp. PS There is one extremely dangerous and moraly questionable forum (search for M.e.e.P, no dots should be included) under SG2 steam forums, which defies bans, modding and steam overediting for ages now. It is however not for the fainthearted since it is said one can get nightmares involving the running bird, spaceships and space operas, folks of low moral values, and those of high. It is however said that people searching for enlightment have been heard of saying that they found what they were looking for.......därför, inte vänta! Springa!)			",49,20,1,30,13,0,41

The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.

Only a few random mission types and some of them outright are disqualified because it's not worth doing them... If you are looking for 5 or 6 hours of fun and are into this type of game, it's a nice buy.. Perhaps the price is a bit steep for a game lasting that long.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fairly good space sim.  Ship classes, customization, and combat are very good but not what I feel is fitting for a game @ this one's full price.  Ship capture is certainly the most fun and rewarding part of the game, but it gets old.  Especially the slow crawl to a space station to tow your prize.  After about 30 hours I'm about ready to shelve this game even though I haven't finished it.  I do like the game, its just not priceworthy.  Grab it @ -75% or better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Resuming my first Experience:Wow! Its amazing. 5 mins after. Land, go out, open star map. Accept mission, go to, (smoke a cigarret), select target, kill someone or repair something, (everything one click), REPEAT.NO Lading animations, just a  Ugly background on land.The Space background is over saturated, so many nebulas like a rainbow.Seriously, great potential game, but missions is so, so, so simple. Ridiculous.I will give another chance to game tomorrow. If I change my mind I will remake this review, if not, I want my money back.			",26,6,0,12,4,0,5

Fans of space games will find a solid offering here, in 3D!+ Takes the Starpoint Gemini universe into current gen, and in ful 3D space instead of the flat 2d playing field!+ Unique ship designs, beautiful space locales, and effects-filled combat makes this a good looker.+ A solid campaign that will take you from the lowly privateer with barely a junk heap to their name to a captain of the space lanes with a massive dreadnought under their command. Don't want that? Sure, play the open universe instead and do it your way.- UI is an acquired taste, admittedly.- Camera control feels a touch too floaty and detached from the player, which can be annoying to aggravating depending upon circumstance.- Combat between ships can seem to be arbitrary, and limited to small number engagements.- Ship designs and ship mechanics, whilst unique, dont give hints as to which does what, and where.- Some gameplay mechanics can be rather obfuscated, or missing entirely.- Game was released somewhat buggy and missing some features.

												If you are going to play this game, don't bother opening it until you see a video that teaches you how to board ships. This game's economy is useless/broken without this feature, and it isn't taught ingame. First time I played I got bored to death in two hours and left it. Months later, I saw a gameplay, found out how to board ships, and tadaaa, new game!It's not going to be the best game of your life, but you can spend a few hours having fun.And for those that say that it's like a solo EVE, it has absolutely nothing to do, EVE is much better, but it's a great PvP gank feast built exclusively for gankers.

												Bought this (and the expansions) for just under $7 at the recent steam sale.  I have to admit, I feel like I'm ""Cheating"" the devs.  This is a quality game well beyond what they ask for it.  I'm the type who loves space sims.  X series, Elite series, and various other space games (KSP!).  This stands up to them (and much better than X Rebirth!).  Large sandbox and mission style play.  On the downside (compared to the other games): No ""Base building"" and it's economy is rudimentary.   But space combat , movement, travel, and general sandbox is very good.  Last 40 hours I've played just the base game, will soon turn on the expansion.  Capturing ships is fun, and on par with the X series.Good job, will buy the devs new game: Starpoint Gemini Warlards.

												Great sound track, cool space graphics. Make sure you get the version that comes with the game soundtrack. Get this game on Steam sale. $4.99 = worth it.			",95,14,1,24,6,0,5

												I don't know why this has so many negative reviews. Although slightly repetitive, the game is deep and fun.			",467,249,13,72,66,5,70

												Star Point Genimini 2 is an open world space sim with tons of ships to choose from and plenty of space to blow them up in. The combat is fairly basic but in a good fight can become tactical in some manners, such as shield/armor/speed tanking. The weapons are not too exciting, small variety and needs some randomization to help with the very few good weapons in the game (Rail guns are basically the best i have noted, accuracy and dmg).The graphics are pretty and the ships are fun to look at.  Though even on low settings my computer has a lot of lag when traveling from sector to sector (specs below*).  It runs alright on a laptop but still laggy.The map is fairly big with random events that are basically all you do, which in turn makes the story line very bland.  The story line itself is lethargic and not very engaging and the voice acting does not help.  The missions get fairly repetitve, go here blow this up or repair that thing, however, there is a fair variety of ways to make cash.  I thought its cool you can capture enemy ships and sell them. Trading and mining are pretty mediocre, but in a big ship you can haul more. You need a constant income to keep up your fleet, this can be challenging sometimes because you just bought a bunch of shiny stuff, which will just bottom out later in the game because you have the best crap. All in all i recommend this game, its pretty dope and simple to play, it definately needs some balancing and factions dont really matter.  It can be a little CPU heavy at times on a laptop.  Be prepared for a lot of down times, there can be a lot of flying around to do.7.5/10Pros: Fun and Easy GameplayGood Looking Ships And Tons Of ThemChallengingAddictiveGood Diversity Of Money MakingCons:Lame Story Line HUD Needs Some Help (Mostly Needs A Target Disply On The HUD)Controls Can Be A Little WonkyNeeds Balancing (Ships and Weapons / Not Enough Actual Variety)Faction Relations Only Matter If You Are Trying To DockIntel Core i3-6100U 2.3 GHzIntel HD 5204 GB RAM			",62,6,0,7,5,0,3

												A highly fun game. It was one my surprise hits of 2014.  The campaign is not its strongest point as well as the level to money ratio for upgrading you ship. But I managed to have plenty of enjoyment of this cracking Indie (Early Access) title.			",150,120,4,26,15,3,21
