												Loved this game, got all the ships and most of the achievements, but after beating it on highest difficulty in Advanced mode, can't bring myself to replay it for one reason alone: I will never get a win against the boss like that again. All but one crew member had died, my ship was boarded by the enemy, my last crew member was mind controlled, every room had a breach, oxygen was gone, and all remaining power was diverted to the single weapon firing on auomatic that was being destroyed by my last, dying crewmember, which would also be enough to finish my ship off. Just before it broke, my crew member came back under my control, long enough to allow the weapon to fire one last time. My missle hit half a second before the rebel flagship salvo slammed into my ship. It was enough. My ship and the rebel flag both exploded simultaneously as the credits of victory started up. I can't top that. Ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dark Souls came home drunk again. It was the third time this week. By now The Oregon Trail had grown used to such tumultuous behavior, even on a nightly basis. He stumbled through the doorway hollering about some curse of the undead. The Oregon Trail, keen on diffusing such situations, offered Dark Souls a place on the bed and a glass of estus. ""Would you like something to eat?"" she asked. ""We took down a bison today."" He shook his head and took her hand. ""You are so beautiful. Did you know that?"" The Oregon Trail blushed. After all these years he still had his charms about him. ""The first flame may be dying, but I want you to know that your flame is always lit in my heart."" She caressed his face. There was no denying that he was a one-of-a-kind gaming experience. His atmosphere, striking; his storytelling, excellent; not to mention his combat, addictive and unique. The Oregon Trail blew out the candle and pressed SPACE BAR to continue. Nine months later FTL was born.			",30,10,0,3,7,0,6

												There's nothing like the feeling when a game which wasn't even on your radar comes along, completely blows you away and reminds you why you love this hobby very dearly. And that's paramount. Even the best of us lose our faith sometimes. Faster Than Light is one of those games that comes out of nowhere and makes you a believer again. It is a testament to the brilliance of design over budget and as such is a shining beacon of this medium.In Faster Than Light, the player takes on the role of a starship captain whose singular goal is to defend the Federation from a rebel threat. The concept is simple, you have to make it through seven grueling sectors to face the mammoth rebel flagship which will mercilessly put your nerves and skill to the test. It employs tough but fair school of design in which you will dearly pay for every single mistake you make, no matter how small. You may not even realize your mistake until it is too late.You start with a barebones crew and equipment which you'll want to heavily upgrade by the time you reach the end. You'll achieve that by travelling through the galaxy, doing quests, fighting or aiding other ships or just buying whatever you can afford. This is a roguelike so every playthrough is completely different with randomized quests and loot drops. Sometimes you may feel slighted by the item drops or the difficult situations you find yourself in, but almost every piece of equipment is useful in some way and there's almost always a way out of a sticky situation. Being a roguelike also means that if you die, you have to start all over again. The sense of urgency is further heightened by the oncoming rebel fleet which won't allow you to roam the galaxy however you wish. Absolutely everything in Faster Than Light is subject to careful forethought and planning, otherwise you might just back yourself into a corner.As the ship's captain, it is your duty to take care of absolutely everything that goes on your ship, the design is meticulously detailed. You have absolute control over a variety of systems including engines, shields, weapons, medbay, oxygen supply, helm, sensors, even doors. You also control every single crewmember. There are different races in the game and each specializes in a certain trait (except for humans). For example, Engis repair damaged systems faster, the Rock are immune to fire whereas the Mantis are great for ship intruders.This all might sound overwhelming and there's actually a lot more various nuances to talk about here, but the tutorial is fantastic and you'll get the hang of the game quickly. This is a classic case of easy to learn, difficult to master.The universe in Faster Than Light is pretty basic, it borrows liberally from various other sci-fi sources. Nevertheless, it is expertly put together. It is a very believable universe in which you'll learn about what's going on mostly through direct gameplay when interacting with other races and factions.The Advanced Edition adds more content to the game most notably a new race with a new ship, fantastic new weapons and new upgrades such as mind control, cloning bay and hacking. The completely free expansion fleshes out the universe even further, but much more importantly it adds a myriad of new combinations of tactics that are at your disposal.Faster Than Light is an exceptional work of game design. Its biggest accomplishment, which so few games manage to pull off, is that it draws you in, hooks you and never lets go. It is extremely addictive, even when you lose horribly and quit the game, all it takes is a few seconds and you're thinking about what you could've done differently and what tactics you will use next time you fire it up. And then you click play. Again.10 OUT OF 10 (MASTERPIECE)			",117,87,1,22,18,0,33

												An amazing spectacle for the avid strategy gamer. FTL: Faster Than Light is a beautifully crafted, well-written space strategy game that consistently builds on it's gameplay, and writing. It constantly gives you a feel of tension and suspense as you fight off rebel reinforcements with your last missile while opening your airlock to extinguish fires, then sending your alien mantis-like crew members to attack oncoming pirate boarders. It gets you thinking and on your toes all the time and I would definitely recommend this awesome space strategy to anyone. 9.5/10			",220,18,5,16,12,1,20

												One of the most fun little games I have played in a long time. Frustrating in places, and yet always an entertaining journey.The game has a massive random element to it, and even on normal difficulty can be frustratingly hard. You will need to play well AND get lucky, but the feeling you get when you finally beat the game with each cruiser is hard to describe ... relief and epic joy would be the best way to sum it up.Worth every penny, but be warned: This game can be addictive and you may lose a few nights sleep as you lose track of time and say 'Just one more sector' ....

												Being an avid Civilization fan, a friend of mine recommended this...game.I started off on a week night about 8pm. I had to work the next day, but found myself playing this....game....until 4am.After spending >100 hours (it’s sad, I admit) on this game, you start realising little things:If you destroy a system, its ‘hit points’ is at zero. But if you cause a hull breach, you can effectively make a system’s hit points go below zero (since you have to repair breaches before you can repair a system). Therefore, destroying a system and then nuking it with heavy lasers (killing the crew trying to repair it, and causing hull breaches) is still effective!You become a lot better the more you play. Now, I win about 1/4 games on normal. In the beginning, I played about 30 times before winning a game. Long story short – FTL is a work of art. It deserves a spot in the Louvre. It is an amazing rogue like game with some excellent programming. I haven’t found one bug, nor has the game ever crashed.These programmers deserve an Nobel prize for this game. Well done.

												FTL plays like a top down game - You control the ship through a map by jumping from point to point. Each point triggers an event, combat events involve managing the crew to man the battlestations - do spot repairs - quell fires - and whatnot. Many tactics are available, and with the release of the additional content of the advanced edition there is plenty of playstyles to explore, add to that the unlockable ships and you got quite a nice experience. The game is stable, the music is effective and it really has a memorable gameplay. Permadeath will make each decision much more critical. There is a bit of a learning curve at first but once you grasp the basics - which is not too hard at all - its very very fun. Worth the full asking price any day.Tags : Tactical - Space Crew Sim*HALL OF FAME*EDIT : 09/26/2016 Adding my Tags to review in case I lose my categories... again...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 FTL: Faster Than Light  was my summer in Paris, if Paris was actually Somalia and summer was hot enough to melt my face off. And you want to know something about my trip? I loved every second of it.FTL is a sci-fi lover's (like myself) dream. Filled with references here and homages there, it never slows down, the action is always frantic yet methodical, and it's an absolute delight.FTL is a Real-Time Strategy game (with a turn-based element). You control a ship and its crew from an over-head, side on perspective. There is no movement of ship to control beyond jumping from beacon to beacon.When it comes time to fight your first ship (probably in the tutorial, seriously, do the tutorial), you can pause time by pressing the space-bar, to assess your options and your tactics, in a similar way to that of games like  Dragon Age: Origins  or  The Bureau: XCOM Declassified.  You must make sure at all times that your crew are alive and your hull (your health meter) isn't about to reach zero, or it's game-over. This is easier said than done, because the amount of micro-management is ENDLESS, to the point where it is all micro-management and there isn't any priority management, per say. You need to make sure you have enough power to all systems, no intruders are going to come on board, that you are doing damage to their ship, and if not, charging your FTL jump (your ""I NEED TO GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!"" button), among countless other things.This game is  BRUTAL.  There are 3 difficulties (if you use the Advanced Edition, a major free DLC added to the game in 2014, you can still use the Vanilla version that was the original release): Easy, Normal, and Hard. The only real difference between them is how long you can hold out before being smashed. You need to get through 8 sectors and 1 final boss to complete a run (and subsequently, the game). The final boss is so hard, that even nearly 70 hours into the game (at the time of this review), I STILL haven't beaten it... even on easy.And yet, despite this massive, massively overwhelming difficulty, I wouldn't have this game any other way. Because without it, this game would have FAR less replay ability. But with it, each new run feels completely different. New tactics you might need to try, new ship purchases in hope of finding that Magnum Opus that is your favourite weapon, new dialogues, everything. Without this difficulty, all that wouldn't matter, because after beating it, you would feel less compelled to try differently, and get bored a lot quicker, something I am only realizing after so many hours.Everything this game does should be a set example for games in future years. It gets everything right, the customization, the balance of every factor, excitement. Even it's techno music (I just hurt the souls of many electronic music fans), something I don't particularly enjoy, is absolutely fantastic in this game. To put all this into perspective, I got my Dad to play this game, and even he has since clocked 30+ hours of his own time in the game.So with my melted face from my time in the Somalian weather, I must insist everyone who considers themselves an open (to all games) gamer, to play this game. It helps new players find their feet, then punches them down when they have the hang of it. It screams in the face of master strategists and sends them cowering. It is one of the most soul-destroying, exciting, charming, addictive, challenging, fun games out there. It's the best Strategy game I have ever played.PROS: +Good tutorial+Fun, Challenging+Good Interface, Music.+TONS of replay abilityCONS:-Your face may melt offI'm giving  FTL: Faster Than Light  9 out of 10.

												Everyone burned to death. Then everyone suffocated to death. Then, a few runs later, everyone was burned, suffocated, and blasted to death. Giant spiders ate my crew, strange monoliths evaporated them, and asteroids turned them into fine, dehydrated powders drifting through the void.Then I started getting better. I stayed away from the spiders, I vented the oxygen out of burning rooms, rather than sending a single hapless insectoid to fight the flames. And then, one glorious day, after so much blood, sweat, and tears, I destroyed the rebel flagship and won the game.That was 40 hours in. There was still much to be done. This was before Advanced Edition came out, of course, so the unlock quests were the only ways to unlock all of the ships. And how long did it take me to obtain the Crystal Cruiser? 100 more hours.That brings us to the present day, when I'm 450 hours in, and still banging out a game every week or two. And so, if you're still on the fence about buying FTL: Faster Than Light, ask yourself this: do you want a game that you'll play once and never touch again, or do you want a game that still has tons of replay-value after a frankly embarassing amount of time?

Between the constant raids on my ship, Ion Storms and Solar flares, the crew now has the projected service lifetime of 3 days. If it wasn't for the clone machine I myself would have been gone a long time ago. On our journey back to the Federation base, I can't help but wonder if I've done this before... Sometimes when on the bridge I swear I have experienced the events unfolding before - An untrustworthy slug merchant, an infestation of alien spiders on a nearby station.

TL;DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Faster than Light is a 'Space Rogue-Like' game that came into being by virtue of a Kickstarter project by Indie Developer Subset Games. It promises a starship captain experience where the player can manage both crew and ship in relative detail.PLOT (No Spoilers):The player takes the role of a Starship Captain with vital information that will help turn the tide of war in the on going conflict between the Rebels and the Federation. The player is allowed to select and manage a variety of ships, each having their own set of crew and abilities which can expand as you progress. Once again, upgrade your ship, expand your crew and try to stay alive till the very end.PROS:+ Gameplay over Graphics: - The game sports simple pixel art graphics that invokes a retro feel, and, in my opinion, suits it very well. The gameplay is what makes this game shine however and as stated in the INTRODUCTION, this game attempts to simulate a Starship captain by letting the player assign crew to man the ships internal systems, order power to be diverted to different parts of the ship, focus fire on an enemy ship's weapon systems and many many more.+ Stratigically Brutal: - Easy, Normal or Hard, all extremley unforgiving. This is a game where you need to bite down hard and take the consequences of your actions and choices like an adult, much like all 'Rogue-Like' games. You die, then you start all-over again. Learning from your mistake is part of the game's charm.+ Wide Variety of Stuff: - Good varriety of ships, weapons, and crew all of which unlocks as you progress. The unlocking system was set up to ensure that every new game will be different and provide unique experiences.+ Soundtrack: - Great soundtrack from a small indie game. Bigger game developers should learn that not every game needs orchestral pieces to make a game's music pleasing.CONS:- No ship customization: - Aside from purchasing weapon system and ship components, you won't be able to customize the ship's looks or the layout since said layout is on a preset. I would have liked to construct my own ship. - One Game Mode: - The only available game mode is the default escape scenario. It would be nice if they would add new campaigns or scenarios like, escort mission, defense campaign etc. It would definitely spice things up. A much more expansive map would also be welcome.- Crew Interaction: - Being able to talk and may be train your crew outside combat (specially if you find an empty system) would be a welcome addition. More interaction is needed like basic dialogues between the people on your ship to give it more life. It would be a statisfying feeling if you have resolved a conflict between two crew members.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME for a great price. It's definitely not for everyone, specially people who has no patience for Rogue-Like games. This games requires 25% skill, 25% planning and 50% luck. Everytime you start a new campaign it would be a different experience from the last. The game allows most sci-fi fans to totally immerse themselves in the shoes of a Starship captain much like the heroes from the great Space Travel franchises such as Star Trek, Firefly, Babylon 5 & Battlestar Galactica.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												FTL is a unique rogue-like title: It features all the common elements of the genre such as randomly-generated events that may help or harm you, permadeath and high difficulty. What makes this one special though, is that instead of controlling a single character, you control the crew of your ship.This game puts you in control of almost everything: You order your crew to specific rooms, be it to provide your ship with a bonus, repair a broken system, patch a hull breach, fight enemy boarders or put out fires.Meanwhile you as the player has to make smart decisions which involves opening or closing airlocks to ""kill"" fires or suffocate enemy invaders, managing your reactor's power to decide what do you want operating at full, partial or no capacity at this particular moment, and figuring out which enemy system you want to try and take out with your ship's weapons.Almost everything in this game is randomly generated with very few exceptions such as your ship's starting equipment.This game also features achievements (general and ship-specific) and unlockable ships: You can have 9 different ships, each with 2 different layouts for a total of 18. They are really different in playstyle and can make your game way easier or way harder depending on your choices. This can provide you with some replayability, if you are into ""collecting"". Some ships can be really hard to find, however.The difficulty may discourage some people from playing it, but that's a fact with nearly every rogue-like. The way I see it, this is how it goes: When you start a run, there's a chance you will fail and that chance will never go away. What you can do about is use what you can find and devise good strategies to make that chance of failure as minimal as possible.The graphics and soundtrack are not ""high-tech"" but are very artistic instead. If you are a fan of pixel art and chiptune music (which you can also buy as DLC). This game delivers an incredible experience in that aspect. Not everyone likes those though, so I recommend you watch the teaser to get a feel of it if you haven't already.Finally, if there's anything bad I can say about this game is that the random encounters/events are kinda limited and you'll soon figure out the best course of action for most of them. They could use slightly more variety. A very minor complaint, in my opinion.So, if you are after a game that will provide you with a unique ""star-trek-ish"" crew/ship managing experience based on randomly generated elements, then FTL is well-worth the price for you!

A bit about the game and developers.FTL: Faster Than Light is a space simulation game developed and published by a tiny indie company that has just two members, Subset Games. Great job developers!About Gameplay.So, as I said, FTL is a space simulation game. In it your objective is to fly from one point of the galaxy to the other. You're being chased by rebels, because you've stolen something from them. I say that this game is space simulation because you need to tell your ship crew what to fix, where to go, where to put fire down, and so on and on. You also decide where will your ship shoot at your opponent.Don't let this game fool you. It looks very fun and relaxing, but it is actually quite complex! Imagine how much you have to attack next - enemy's shield, or maybe guns.. Maybe their engine so they couldn't dodge... Or maybe their medical area so their crewman can't heal - while you have to make sure that there are no hostiles on your ship, and if there are, you have to order your crewmen to kill them. Then you have to put down the fires, fix your guns, fix your shields, fix your oxygen and so on and on.Now, don't get me wrong. This game is amazing! Also, in case that your ship gets destroyed, you have to do everything from the beginning. And that is what actually makes this game hard. There are never more than just one opponent (at least I've never faced more than one!) in one battle, but it's still quite hard to beat them. There are a lot of ships and ships skins that you can unlock as you progress in the game. Sadly I don't know what is your reward for beating the game, since I've only got to the half of it after trying the game out many, many times.In the game there are a lot of other areas in which you can jump to that can actually hurt your ship. In those areas there can be either meteors, which can ""beat your ship"" to death, or you can come too close to the sun which will then make your hull get damaged, which means you can die! There are also some random planets on which you can, randomly, get more crewmen on your ship. They can all even be different races! Every race has their own bonuses, but sadly I don't know them so I can't talk too much about that.Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking, the game is very pixelish. Well of course, it's an pixel, indie game! And I have to say, it's very well done! I love the artwork, the explosions, the space, the look of ships. It's very well done. Audio is very relaxing as well. I really enjoy all of the background songs in the game.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- A lot of ships to unlocks (and skins!)- Very nice background pictures and audio.- Cheap!Cons:- Quite hard.Final grade:  8/10Extra info:  Get this game. You won't regret it! It's just amazing.Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] ",388,79,23,71,45,5,77

												Here we are, the three humans that took care of the good ol' Kestrel since the very beginning, the three Zoltans they rescued from slave traders, a rockman person saved from kidnappers and the mantis they picked up from a crash site. No turning back, everyone knows what must be done. Take down that Flagship at any cost.Spirits are low on the ship, as our weapons are really underwhelming. Just a burst laser, a better burst laser and a rocket launcher that was on the ship since... nobody knows when. The speedy detour we took around the Flagship's path to the base yeilded nothing useful but the last pieces of scrap which we put into our cloning bay, as we had nothing else to spend it on.Here it comes, with it's four giant guns pointed at us, it's powerful shields up, it's huge crew taking positions, the boarding party already teleporting, their cloak at the ready and their hacking drone already latched onto our sensors system. I fire off the mind control and all hell breaks loose.Volleys of every kind of projectile you can imagine fly towards us constantly, barrage after barrage. Soldiers pop up everywhere, blasting our reinforced doors and sabotaging our systems.I have full faith in my pilot, and he has full faith in the engine crew.I ask for an estimate dodge chance. 55%, he says, with a fearless look that gave me the courage to go on under all this crushing pressure.Volley after volley, good ol' Kestrel did maneuvers I thought were impossible, dodging most of the missiles, lasers, beams and ion blasts as our weak weapons barely got through their shields.Every volley was a heart attack. Especially that missile launcher. The missiles that hit punched holes in our hull, draining it of oxygen, set the rooms ablaze and made the whole structure seem like it would collapse and shatter into hundreds of pieces at any second.My crew valiantly fought all the fires and fixed every piece of electronics, as best as they could. My mind control caused chaos on the Flagship, and I could see it through the sensors when the hacking drone had to cool down, but even then, that ship was terrifyingly powerful. It was really disheartening to see the damage repaired while the hacking drone made mind control impossible as designating targets was not possible without our sensors, and the enemy ship cloaked.Yet we kept fighting. Bit by bit, we tore piece by piece off of it. Punched every little hole, one by one. Every last enemy soldier boarding our ship was suffocated mercilessly, and survivors that came crawling in were kicked while they were down.A final missile dislodged a huge chunk of it, and it looked like it was done.We could not be more wrong.The ship was just damaged, and it managed to emergency FTL jump away. I cursed everything. I had serious thoughts of jumping out of the airlock to end all this unbearable suffering. But then my pilot called me up on the comms.""So, let's finish this, eh? That hunk'o'junk hasn't seen all we got to offer yet!""Fifty five percent dodge chance. Five lasers and a missile. Fifty five percent.We can do this. I hope.We quickly pulled back to patch up the few holes we had left and to let the oxygen generator refill our ship, almost starved from the vital gas by all the breaches, and got ready for round two.The first round was just the tip of the iceberg, and true hell had only begun.Even with a huge chunk missing, and with it one of it's signature cannons, it was not any weaker. In fact, it only became tougher after reinforcements beamed into it and it deployed it's drone system.Drones swarmed us, shooting up the shields, breaching our hull and running around destroying everything. These drones were tough. They would literally punch a hole in one of our outer walls, enter a room and begin trashing it. No oxygen. Even our toughest crewmembers needed to team up on one to stand the slighest chance of taking them down. It would be all quickly over if not for the cloning bay. But what truly amazed me, was their resolve.These were people that died up to a dozen times within just a few minutes.They would throw themselves at the terrifying robots, just holding their breath, and take them down with their own corpses if necessary. I could not have asked for a more valiant crew, nor I deserved to.But as the bloody territory war was fought inside our ship, a war of attrition with no clear winner was happening on the outside. Their defense drones would render our lowly missile launcher useless, and our lasers needed a perfect volley to simply scratch their hull.Meanwhile, the barrages went on. Fifty five percent dodge. My pilot is doing his job. Maybe he's scared. I'm sure we all are. But he doesn't show it. Oftentimes I feel he is holding the ship and all us together, preventing us from snapping and giving up. But there is no time to delve into these things when the mind control is recharged and awaits it's target.We keep on going, our ship, good ol' Kestrel, starting to give in to all the stray shots and holes the breaching drones are making. My screen light up with warnings. It is hard to breathe, really hard. We can barely keep ourselves supplied.The Flagship is not giving in. All we've done is superficial damage.An explosion and a warning brings grim news. Our oxygen generator room is breached, and the drone is already breaking down the door to the backup battery. Two good men, or, rather, a man and a woman's sacrifice drops the scary robot.Close to passing out from the lack of oxygen, I give order to repair the generator.""Just hold your breath... alright?""The ship is in utter chaos. Everyone is leaving their pot and doing side jobs and emergency maintenance more than their real jobs. After the two newly-appointed engineers collapse on the floor, the oxygen is fixed, and we can all breathe again... sort of. Though there are more breaches to fix, and more drones coming in.I start having my doubts, and angrily fire our surplus missiles at their defense drone fruitlessly, just out of rage.But then it happens.A lucky laser hit a sensitive control board. Or a munitions box. Or... who cares. Their engine room was set ablaze, and I seized the chance to mind control the operator. With the improved abilities the mind control gave them, they fended off their allies until the fire was so big it was out of control. Their engines were down. They could not dodge. This was the miracle we needed.All of our lasers focused their shields system. Four shield layers, five shots. It was easy with a stationary target. After a few volleys their shield went down. With a nice fire to go with it. A final mind control took the lives of every last operator in the ship, besides the weapons specialists in their sealed main cannon chambers. The Flagship was ablaze, and their drone control system soon went down. With no defense drones or engines, even our humble weapons made quick work of it.But it had one last trick up it's sleeve. A last bail-out FTL jump. We healed the heavily wounded and took positions. We are ready.It comes back. It looks... not very threatening. It's main cannons motly disabled, no crew to repair the damages... The fire was put out, but... my mind control didn't go through. Something was up with their shields. Even our missiles collided with them.I give the order and our weapons keep firing at them. And then it happens. A power surge warning.A power surge? But, their drone system is destroyed beyond repair, and their main cannons are barely functional, what could it be, I asked myself.As if answering my question, the biggest laser volley I've ever seen lit up the emptiness of space. I could not even count how many there were. Too many. But, somehow, our pilot dodges most of them. Leaving the shields to do their jobs.After it's shields went down, the Flagship's fate was sealed.We all cheered, victorious.I will always admire you, Will.55% dodge/10 ",96,6,0,5,7,0,3

												Faster than Light is an awesome top down, real time strategy, star ship simulator. Its fun, challenging, diverse and random. There are some real difficulty spikes that lead me to believe that its a dead end and impossible to beat that specific random challenge. But that's what random is. This is one of the only games that I sank time into and it was fun doing it.You are tasked with traveling through the galaxy, visiting sectors along the way. Each sector is like a game map with several locations. When you enter a sector, you see all the locations as dots on your star map. From there you need to plot a course in your mind to the exit of the sector. Each one of the locations is a gamble, will they have an enemy ship? Maybe a friendly ship? Perhaps a quest that will ask you to visit a different location on the map. It is all random. There are ship upgrades that will let you see various things on the map like where hostile ships are or if its a dangerous location.At its core, FTL is a real time strategy game with a pause.  For the most part you'll be fighting other ships, one on one. This is where the real thrill comes in for me. A game of chess. Weapons will power over time and you can fire them one by one, or save up all your weapons to use them all at once. Its all point and click with a few hot keys. The combat feels relaxing, fun and engaging with some tense moments, like having to fight next to a sun, hoping the flames don't burn your ship from the inside out, but its never stressful.The ship's hull is its health. Even if a crew constantly repairs everything you damage, they can't repair the hull without visiting a store to replenish it. To get to the hull, you need to get through the shields. Torpedoes can go through the shield but cost you a torpedo. Beam weapons won't affect the shield at all. Lasers will damage the shield, but unless the shield room itself gets damaged, the shields merely regenerate. There are ion weapons that temporarily disable rooms or shields. You can teleport over a party, but if the ship gets destroyed or escapes, your crew will be lost!  The teleporter has a cool down after its used. They're stuck on the ship until the teleporter is ready again.Each ship is different, even if it looks the same on the outside, the rooms and weapons are different. Most ships have bridges, engines, shields and weapons. There are other rooms like oxygen, medbays to heal, cloaking to ensure enemies can't shoot you, teleporters to take a ship from the inside, oxygen, sensors, droid room and even a door mechanism room. Systems that all require power from the reactor. A free update for the game ""advanced edition,"" added so many new rooms with new tactics and strategies. A mind control room that you can mind control the enemy crew. Hacking that breaks a room on an enemy ship over and over again while locking the doors of the room to ensure no one can get in or out. A clone bay that revives crew when they've died.The game forces you to mix up your strategies. Sometimes you'll fly into a nebula that will drain your reactor power, so you'll have to chose what you want active. How long can your crew survive without oxygen, because you need more power to your shields, engines or weapons? Its up to you and it feels so good to have the choice and the variety.When you explore too leisurely visiting every location the fleet might catch up. You're always being perused and the enemy fleet will progress like a wave to catch you. Their ships are overpowered. You can survive the first ship or two, but the ships will always be at your next location if you let their wave of progress overtake you. The only way to reset the wave is to exit the sector and visit a new sector. You can slow the progress of the wave by visiting locations in nebula and other things that can slow the wave. This ensures that you never feel overpowered, but it doesn't hinder your exploration.You have a limited crew and your ship has areas that get damaged, so you send the crew to repair those areas. If your engines get taken out you can't move. If your oxygen room gets taken out everyone on your ship will die. Holes get punctured in your hull from breaching weapons that you need to fix. Fires that start will spread from room to room. You can either have your people extinguish them OR you can open up the exterior doors of your ship and suck out all the O2. Enemies can then take out your door controls where you can't open or close your doors. These aren't just tactics that enemies use against you, these are your own tactics. Everything is balanced. Ships are just as sturdy as yours unless you're on easy difficulty.You can purchase or find weapons from destroyed ships or in random events. The weapons have a lot of diversity. Missiles and bombs go through enemy shields. Lasers can damage shields and rooms. Various types of beams can't damage shields, only rooms and crew. Ion weapons disable room systems. Shoot the shield to disable the shield temporarily. Shoot the engine room to disable their engines. Every weapon has a different recharge rate so you need to time your attacks. There are also robot drones that have weapons too and swarm around your ship or the enemies. There is a lot of play diversity and different strategies for every ship.You'll find plenty of alien races and learn how to deal with them all. Not just that, but you'll have them aboard your ship. The slug race is slow, weak, but has the ability to perceive what is in the rooms around them or see in nebula, so you won't need sensors. The Rockmen have a high defense, are fireproof, but slow. The mantis are great attackers, but can't repair as efficiently. The Engi have double the repair speed but they only do half the damage in hand to hand combat. The Zoltan can power the room they're in to spare power from your generator. The Crystal can lock down any room they're in, don't take as much damage from suffocation, but they move slightly slower. The Lanius will suck the oxygen from a room. Humans are the standard race that doesn't have any perk.You can hire new crew from stores, or pick them up along the way. There are slave ships that you can liberate or buy them from. Each member of your crew will gain experience on whatever they're working on. So its better to have a dedicated engineer than someone that goes from shields, to engineering, to piloting the ship. Their repair skills will also increase as they repair things. So when you're not in battle, it might be a good idea to have the entire crew help repair things.The game feels like Star Trek, while still being its own unique property. Helping civilizations, taking down space pirates, saving the federation from the rebel scum. The graphics might be simple, but you see exactly what's going on and you can even play it on some low tech systems. The music and sound design are excellent. The music is calming, spacy and enjoyable on its own.Each game lasts about 3 or 4 hours. Playing through and accomplishing goals will unlock new ships and new interior configurations for ships that you have. Each ship plays different and incorporates different strategies, not to mention the crew is different. Some ships start with a cloaking device, long range sensors, but no shields. Others have a super weapon, that cuts through other ships when its fully powered, but has a poor configuration. Still some ships are completely drone operated with only minimal weapons. Every game is a new way to play.There is a lot of strategy, depth and replay value to this game. Do you take out your enemy's engine, shields, weapons or robotic drones first? There are random events that make new challenges. Its a wonderful game worth $10.The game developer was nice enough to make a free update that adds even more content and replayability! The upgrades add a lot more quirky fun. Things like mind control, new weapons, a new race and new playable ships give you a lot of reason to return.			",1128,324,52,104,96,15,167

												Time to share my FTL story.It was a stealth ship - gifted by the Engi, a race of half organic half mechanical engineers who seeked to assist the Federation in any way they could. The Federation of course, were more than happy to accept the gift - In particular Tomas, JP and Shelton who were estatic at commandeering this state of the art technology. To aid them in the task, they hired an Engi, an act which they agreed would be fitting for it's first journey.Off they went, with hope hanging on a basic cloak system, the glaive beam and a couple of lasers. It was tough going at first without a shield, but they managed to rescue a Mantis, save a Rockman and acquire a drone. With a growing crew and the debris of pirates and foolish aggressors in their wake, the ragtag bunch of aliens fled the ever advancing rebel fleet. At one point the rebel fleet and the stealth ship clashed - but Tomas held steady at the helm, trusting his new crew members to fend off the enemies who boarded the craft and fired incessantly upon the blue-black creature. At one point, the engine caught fire - and JP came running out, it was unfortunately too much for a human. The gruff Rockman took one look, went in, and came out unscathed. It was a close one - they managed to escape and maintain some distance, but clearly things needed an improvement. And so in a timelapse-esque style, the ship grew in power and systems - upgraded engines, triple shields, terrifying drones and an energy sucking glaive beam that nearly bankrupted them all. But the stats of this weapon were too good to pass up, and Tomas the captain willingly threw in most of the ship's power to accomodate the beast. A few scrapes and cloaking maneuvers by Shelton made complete mincemeat of anyone who dared challenge the stealth ship, and by now the Rockman had made a friend, who was more than willing to see the mission through. Elsewhere, a young mantis teenager eager to participate in war games hopped on from his homelands, making the group seven in total. Though they all spoke different languages, and had different ideals, none dared challenge the eternal darkness and death that came with space, and it was this silent wish to live that propeled them onwards, as an engine would propel a shuttle. Of course, all journeys have to lead somewhere. For the lucky 7, it was time for the final battle. The rebel flagship closed in and Tomas maneuvered the craft with expert skill. Meanwhile, Shelton hammered at the enemy, drones fully engaged whilst the Rockmen focused their efforts on keeping the shields and cloak in orchestrated time. The Mantis ran around the cabins watching the carnage unfold - his time would come.Yet the mistake soon presented itself - the glaive beam was a too slow and power hungry and a wayward shot took it out almost immediately, leaving the ship with pitiful lazers. A barrage of missiles punctured metal and ripped debris into space - and with it, a horrible whine and woosh as air vacated the mangled rooms. It was at this time that the enemy teleported in, and the Mantis sprung into action. He clawed and carved his way through flesh and bone. The rockmen ran from room to room, extinguishing fires. Too little too late. With alarms blaring, Tomas looked on in horror - the engines were down, the health station was completely engulfed in fire and worse of all, the oxygen system had failed. Leaving the controls of what was now a sitting duck, the frightened Engi and Tomas crouched over the oxygen system, desperately trying to revive the lungs of a cold beast. Meanwhile, the Mantis was not having a easy time. Inexperienced and without help, a delicate dash ensued, as he dodged through vacuumed rooms and flaming debris. Dazed and terribly hurt, he headed to the engines. JP was nowhere to be seen - he was in fact also horribly injured, and lay in the sensor room, flames just feet away.Shelton had in this time also suffered terribly - first fire, then half his health to suffocation - he left the Rockmen to deal with the flames and crawled back to his controls, and it was then he realised that in all the frantic action, and with the ship 2 bars to oblivion, his prized drones were still up and running! The words hull critical flashed over and over through his screen, but he took several deep breaths.. and waited. The enemy ship turned to face them, it's weapons drawn, ready to seal the fate of it's prey. Shelton paused. There. The drones took the shield down for a split second and Shelton fired.A single desperate lazer shot made itself across the minute gap, past the regenerating shield. It tore into the hull and hit the engine with a horrifying explosion. In space, no one can hear you scream, and no one heard the explosions either. The crew watched as the flagship ripped itself apart. They were alive. Barely, but still alive.And that is the story of my 7 man crew. Tomas and buddies/10. Highly recommended.

												FTL is an excellent example of how difficulty can be fun. I won't say that FTL is for everyone. It can be mind-numbingly difficult at times. It's the kind of game where you will play it for 20+ hours before your first win. On easy. The complexity and counterplay between making a decision during a battle and making a decision on what to buy or which beacon to explore leaves you with a rich gaming experience as each of these decisions can impact your attempt overall. Surprising depth in an amazingly simple package.			",127,17,0,24,14,0,45

												On accident I took the medicine needed for an entire planet to survive.11/10it happens. As for a real review/message to newcomers in case if people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by my quick and unoriginal comment, here:The game is fun, but can be RNG based, so a great deal of luck is needed for a beginner to win at first. After you start learning your own tricks and tips, the game will be less RNG reliant and more based on skill since you can use that skill to make the best out of a terrible RNG result or maybe even avoid an RNG tragedy entirely. Learn to play different ships since they are EXTREMELY varied because one may be more fun or easier for you (Those Lanius ships, horry♥♥♥♥♥♥lol they are fun and easy to command). You can board, shoot, hack, set aflame, and send drones to kill off a ship. Don't be discouraged by early deaths since there will be a learning curve. It will get increasingly fun until you actually complete it. Also, Advanced edition made the game very fun. I highly recommending it for a first playthrough.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is a large amount of content and hundreds of different combinations of events ensuring no game is the same as the one you previously played. Pros-Fairly simple to learn-Different scenarios for different gameplay each time-Different playing strategies-GREAT SOUNDTRACKCons-Death... So much death...

												FTL is an unique game, unlike anything you've played before. It mixes RTS combat with turn-based navigation and a story generator that will make you think well every decision you make. Its randomness  is a bit too much, but this is what makes it so special: it's impossible to know what awaits you.The game is cheap, has a huge replay value, thanks to its roguelike elements, comes with a free integrated expansion and mod support. There's a lot of cool mods made by the community (you can find them at www.ftlgame.com), including the Captain's Edition, an unofficial expansion that adds tons of content.Judging by the screenshots, FTL looks like a complicated game to play, but fear not, it isn't. It's quite simple to be honest. And surprisingly addictive. If you want a game to play over and over again, FTL can be your next choice.			",356,81,21,51,56,6,66

												""do you think FTL is a good game?""TLDR: I think it's a fantastic game, FTL is a gold standard. But since you asked, I'll say why:The gameplay is great. You really want to start on Easy, and use the pause button very frequently. It's really a turn based game don't try to play it in real time. Then just try stuff, explore solar systems, and have a great time. Normal mode is hard enough that lots of people never beat it, and then they added a hard more that really is tough.The graphics are very simple but also very clean and clear. There is a lot more variation visually than you might think, but you will always know exactly what is happening at a glance. The music is really, really great. You don't need to be a fan of any specific type of music to appreciate how well the tone is constantly transmitted to you. Personally I wind up turning the music off in any game I play after a while, because you have heard it sooo many times, but with FTL I turn it back on, sometimes.There is lots of content to see. The different types of ships can change the tactical combat hugely, all kinds of things will have effects on the interactions you will have. Some people get frustrated because they have a hard time beating the final boss of the game, but the truth is that exploring the galaxy in various ways and encountering various things, the basic gameplay itself, is the point. The first time I got to the boss it was an accident and I was disappointed because I didn't get to finish the delivery quest I was working on.I have over 100 hours logged into Steam, and this game has gotten me through at least one long internet-free vacation on top of that. Most of that was before they added a huge, free expansion pack, too. If tactical turn based rougue like lite whatever space exploration sounds fun to you, at all, you will get some time out of this.The cherry on top of the FTL sundae is the price, it's been in a few bundles and goes 70-85% off pretty frequently. It's worth it at any price, really.			",1393,487,36,193,177,10,217

												A game that is always fun to play regardless of story, progress or success. The playing of the game itself is the ultimate reward. Dynamic, unexpected and consistently interesting combat and mechanics. Loads of ships and play styles. A change of ship, acquiring new upgrades or crew members, all have real impact on how you play. Something you can pick up for 5 minutes or 5 hours.If you haven't played it, now is the time. Find out why so many developers invoke FTL when they want to sell you on the idea that their game is fun and has depth and why it's almost never a good idea, because expecting something as good as FTL is almost always unfair to anything that isn't FTL One of the finest games ever made.

												Personal Rating: Terrific but unforgiving Space SimClassic Rating: ★★★★☆What makes FTL good for me?✓ Spaaaace: this is a quite simple Space Simulator and yet it's features' rich. ✓ Great atmosphere, short game sessions and high replay value.✓ Excellent Soundtrack, fits perfectly into gameplay.✓ Cute graphics, even if it lacks a proper fullscreen/high res setting.And then it's tough too because of:✘ RNG, which can be so frustrating.✘ Permadeath: True, you cannot save mid-game, you can only save and quit (to continue later).✘ A lot of micromanagement involved: every choice is hard to make and you can get killed in so many ways, each time a different one.I believe every one owns FTL already but if you don't yet, take advantage of the next sale and give it a go.

												Second playthrough:I encounter a pirate taking advantage of some poor defenseless civilians on some world...I decide to be the hero. I eradicate the pirate scum, however during the battle my medbay catches on fire!I send ensign Willow and Dolan into the fray to put out the fires.The battle is intense, yet seems manageable at first. Then, the fire catches on in the door control room, so I send the pilot, Hector, to assist.Both Willow and Dolan begin suffering from smoke inhalation and 3rd degree burns, so I tell them to get the hell out of there! Hector is also beginning to lost the fight with the flames, so I have him run back into the cockpit. As I try to figure out, wtf do I do now?... the fire catches on in the sensor room. In a short time I can no longer see any room on the ship other than those occupied by the horrified crew. It seems as if the end is here, after only 2 missions, when Hector gets the bright idea ""Hey, what if we turn off the oxygen systems!"" (You see, the rooms were not adjacent to the airlock, and even if they were, the door control room was destroyed so there was no possibility to remotely access them anyway.)Such a brilliant idea! It put out the fires! Then hector goes in to repair the medbay, with only 6 hp, and because, idk, maybe the fire accelerated the rate at which the oxygen was drained from that room, he suffocates and dies. But at least his dying words informed the rest of the crew that the plan indeed worked. Hector died a hero.Knowing the risks at this point, Willow waited until the O2 systems restored life support throughout the ship before going in to repair the medbay. After Willow and Dolan rocevered from their wounds, they finished repairing the rest of the ship. Now it is time to hold an honorable funeral for Hector.			",37,3,0,9,15,1,19

												I'm pretty sure every nerd from my generation wanted to be a starship captain at some point. And while plenty of attempts at capital ship management have come and gone over the years, few seemed to capture the spirit of being a space commander like FTL. Featuring equal parts tactical combat, executive decisions, and airlocking tiny crewmembers, it's the one captaining sim that crosses over into whatever part of sci-fi tickles your fancy.In a charming twist, you are a federation captain trying to outrun the dastardly rebellion with valuable intel on their next move. There are dozens of ships you can start with, all featuring their own armaments, crews, and gimmicks, and all needing to be unlocked through deeds in game. You then have eight sectors of space to cross without being blasted, eaten, stranded, or otherwise murdered by hopping from jump point to jump point, one step ahead of the ever-encroaching rebel fleet. Some jump points will have enemy ships to fight, some will have story encounters where you get text options, some will have merchants, and so on. There's a remarkable amount of things to run into in FTL, so much that even 30 hours in you may be encountering things that are new to you.A large part of that journey of discovery is going to be the enemy ships that try to kill you. There are many kinds across the different races and factions, each one randomly rolled with weapons and systems. This is where the combat system really shines, because your own weapons and systems can be targeted manually to focus on the rooms that are causing you the most problems. If they have really nasty guns, you can obliterate their weapon control. If they have teleporters to send over boarding parties, you can blast it. If they're trying to get away, you can knock their engines out. Battles play out in real time but at a very measured pace, and you can pause freely to assess the situation and give new orders. It's an armchair commander's dream come true, watching the little crews scramble around their ships, fighting and putting out fires, as both vessels trade volleys.There's a lot to learn about the game, especially after the free update it got awhile back. Your ship can be upgraded with teleporters, drones, mind control, hacking, cloning bays, and more. Currency comes in the form of scrap, and learning how to best use your scrap might be the hardest part of the game since it needs to be spread across buying new equipment, upgrading your ship, and repairing your hull. FTL is a carefully-balanced game, keeping you a hair away from cold vacuum unless you've really mastered its intricacies. You need to know when to retreat from battle, when upgrading doors is more important that shields, and how long your crew can hold their breath. The learning curve is steep, but if you like the gameplay, having more to learn keeps the replay value high.Excellent, detailed pixel art and a delightfully atmospheric soundtrack round out this extremely deep package. With three difficulty levels and a bunch of unlockables and (internal) achievements to shoot for, FTL is an easy recommendation to anyone wanting a spaceship game in general. Your command over your vessel is so nuanced and gratifying that you'll find yourself caught up in the plight of your tiny crew over and over again. Mastering the art of combat and the delicate resource balance will take time and patience, but sticking it out to become a proper captain is a fantastically rewarding experience.

												As the rebels have come closer to find our ship and destroy us before we could send the message to what remains of the Federation Fleet, me and my crew decided to use the Long-Range Beacon to go to a nebula sector.What first seemed like a good idea, soon had bite back and hit us hard.Just as we were going through the nebula, observing the surroundings through every window possible, we soon found ourselves shot by a Mantis warship! They didn't even consider negotiating they just wanted our scraps and weapons.We locked on to their ship and started shooting, but in a mere second we had a boarding party on our ship. My crew wasn't capable of fighting 4 enemies at once, Berkley rushed to the cockpit as Matthieu and Jason locked themselves in the door control room and locked down the entire ship. Jason quickly opened the airlocks and vented every bit of oxygen from the ship, except the cockpit, surveillance room and door control room.As we were fighting with the intruders, our ship got devastated by enemy fire. Just after the intruders suffocated, we've got a direct hit on the life support system with a hull breach, but we managed to destroy their ship after all.Celebration had to wait, the life support system was down, we had a hull breach and the oxygen was escaping from the ship fast. Only 5% remaining, meaning there wasn't any oxygen left on the ship, but in the door control room and the cockpit. Berkley was wounded in the running and we had to make a decision fast. So I sent Matthieu and Jason to the life support system to repair it and the hull breach.Just before they closed the intercom channel, Matthieu said: ""It was an honour serving with you Captain.""They knew they signed up for a one way trip to save the rest of us. They took a deep breath, held it and ran to save the ship. Matthieu was losing consciousness fast and halfway through the repair he started to ran back to the control room to get some air, but he couldn't open the door. A few bangs on the door and it was over. Matthieu was gone. Jason held it for as long as he could, Matthieu repaired the hull breach so he had to worry about the life support system. Struggling with staying awake Jason pushed one last button before he exhaled his soul into the empty space and the system was back online. Oxygen started to spread across the ship, me and Berkley can finally breathe up.We rushed out from the cockpit to save the rest of the crew but it was too late. CPR and the med bay couldn't help them, they were already clinically dead. So it was only the two of us.Berkley started repairing the shield, the engines and the weapons system while I planned our route out of this wicked and cursed nebula.The damage was bad. Berkley got everything back to operational status but our hull damage was worse than ever. The ship barely held itself together.We managed to make it to a Long-Range Beacon and chose to go to a civilian sector now, hoping we would avoid any fight. The two of us could barely operate this ship, to be fully combat-effective, we tried to keep a low-profile until we get some crew members willing to join.After a few FTL jumps, I quikcly realized that no matter how hard I try to avoid a firefight, war doesn't work like that. No sectors are safe from pirates, slavers, rebel symphatizers and criminals. A pirate ship fully equipped and ready to blow us to pieces, required a toll from us to go past this sector. We didn't have too much scrap and it wasn't enough for them. We begged for their mercy but they didn't listen. One last fight, we locked on their ship and started shooting. It was only a few shot. With the first 3 shot they took out our engines, the surveillance room and the shields. Berkley got severely injured but was still trying to fight the fire in the engine room which came from the explosion, though due to his injuries Berkley was consumed by the fire in the end.Shooting a few more rockets and laser shots in the enemy seemed like a hopeless effort to breach through their strong shields and the last shot have marked our fate.As the ship was blown to pieces and I've got sucked out into space by the vacuum, there was only a few seconds to reflect on my life.Only a few seconds until I became the frozen captive of the empty space.I strongly recommend this game!You have the abilityto re-route power on your ship, vent the rooms to kill the intruders, while you are under fire and repairing severe damages on your ship, you have to cause damage to the enemy ship as well.Can't write much about it. Just simply amazing I always wanted to manage my own starship and crew. :DMass Effect was just a little demo to what this game offers for you. :D			",61,1,1,3,3,1,2

												FTL is the world's premiere door management simulator.---Your ship has been struck by an incendiary bomb, and the shield generator room is on fire. Never fear: instead of sending your soldiers in to put the fire out, simply open the doors to space and let the vacuum do it for you.Piratical praying mantises have just teleported into your cockpit, and if you'd upgraded your doors, they wouldn't be tearing through the ship, and your soldiers, like a hot knife through butter. But you didn't, because you wanted a bigger gun. So now you're all dead.A massive laser has cut a hole in your engine room, and you've sent half your crew to patch it up. Hope you remembered to open the ship's interior doors to balance out the atmosphere, so they don't suffocate in the process.Two of your crew have teleported to the enemy ship and are sabotaging its cloaking generator. To keep the enemy out, you've hacked the cloaking device--including its doors. Now, their heavily-upgraded door system is keeping them out, not you.You've got two crew left, and one of them just got mind-controlled by your alien foe. The engine room is his domain, now--but your last crew member is safe in the pilot's seat, behind a thick, thick door.---Almost every game has doors in it, but few of them do much with them. If FTL can make doors this important to your tactical choices, just imagine the depth you can achieve with  lasers, drones, teleporters, cloaking devices, mind control, power, sensors, and more?

												There are some games, which you can easily describe in a sentence. Army man shoots another army man, the team of Russia, Aztecs and Rome gets destroyed by the sneaky Gandhi, survivor walks for an hour, finds another survivor and drinks bleach. Yet, as much as I try to put FTL into a single sentence, I keep failing. A space-ship commander simulator, which lets you relive your captain fantasies of Star Trek? An easy to pick up rogue-lite, which will make you scream as your three hours’ worth of upgrades are blasted into junk by the final boss? A story, with an outcome almost entirely the same every time you play, but with a journey worth an entire sci-fi novel by itself? All of those things and much, much more are present here.FTL stands for Faster Than Light. A term usually used in various science fiction works. Just like this game. You might command a ship consisting of a bunch of humans and a slug, going through the Rock homeworlds and getting ambushed by space pirates. You direct all your power to the weapons, blast them a few rounds and then masterfully evade their gigantic missile by activating your cloaking device. After the pirates beg for mercy, you ponder for a minute about how much scrap and fuel can you get if you’d leave them or destroy them. Moments later, their orange-and-purple ship is obliterated into thousands of tiny pieces in spectacular 2D graphics. Your crew has just finished fixing the oxygen bay and you’re ready to move out. As you’re about to engage your FTL Engine, you take a second to admire the gorgeous scenery, I mean, space. Space can be really beautiful too, you know. Three minutes later your whole crew dies to killer Rock-men, who boarded your ship. Time to start again. FTL stands for Flying Till Losing. Because once you lose you can’t fly. Unless you restart the game. But why would you restart such an amazing run with a space-monk Zoltan Cruiser. They might be weak in melee combat, but their super-shields disable enemy boarding systems, so killer Rock-men aren’t a problem now. Navigating through the map, you see a distress signal left by someone. Great, people in distress always mean there’s some money, err, scrap to be found! Bah, another pirate ambush. Oh well, all you have to do is send all power to the guns and… BOOM! Your ship is nigh-unstoppable. Oh man, in space nobody can hear you scream, but the sounds of explosion and lasers shooting are so amazing, almost as awesome as the battle music! The themes are just great, they accompany, but not overshadow what happens in the game. Well, time to move on. Six minutes later you find yourself unable to escape the pursuing rebels and clash against one of their giant ships. Your super shield is gone almost immediately, and you meekly Zoltan crew dies from the engulfing flames. Let’s restart.FTL stands for Failing To Leave. Basically, this is one addictive game. Yes, frustration might get you, since it’s almost inevitable that your game will end up as a loss, this game is that hard. However, various unlockable ships and layouts help give some sense of progression, as this is a permanent-death game. Still, after a break, you will want to play more. Boot the game up, maybe choose a different ship. Yeah, the Engi Layout B seems cool-enough. Different ships not only change the visuals, but essentially the way you play. Standard ships might use the “blast-and-away” tactics, but horrible space-bugs Mantis usually try to get their prey by boarding. Space-human-robots (seeing a pattern here? SPACE!) Engies love to use drones and that means that they rarely do all the fighting themselves, instead, relying on autonomous robots to protect or attack. Alternative ship layouts take it one step further, in Engi case, there’s only one crew-member on board, rest of them are drones. That would be extremely problematic, however, various updates and even mods help the game get even more complex. For example, Captain’s Edition mod allows the sole Engi create new crewmember holograms. With an army of holo-friends, my Engi is ready to win this game. Twelve minutes later, the Engi ship runs out of fuel, getting lost in deep space. We will try again.FTL also stands for Flailing Through Levels. Your Rock cruiser finally manages to reach close to the final stage. Take a moment, go ahead, and reflect what a run was that. You saved a space station from an outbreak, helped the Zoltans reach nirvana, beat the mighty Mantis pirate KazaaakplethKilik and even unlocked his ship. You fought countless pirates, saved a defective rebel and helped lay off a siege of a friendly space station. One last foe until you’re ready to fight what awaits at the end of the game. The huge rebel space-ship proves no match for your skills, as you seamlessly transfer power from guns, to engines, to clone bay, all while choosing which parts of the opposing ship should be destroyed. The dream scenario: a victory against a worthy foe with minimal losses. You take a deep breath, time to see what lies in the final level. Eighteen minutes later, you enjoy the final moments of a Rock cruiser, little flaming bits of it flying in space. The boss was so close to defeat, yet you still lost. We are ready to win next time.

												FTL is a roguelike game based in space, where you guide your ship from beacon to beacon, and sector to sector. At each beacon, you encounter an event. Sometimes it will be nothing, sometimes it will be a pirate fight, sometimes it will be someone in distress that needs your help. It puts you in different scenarios, where your actions determine your fate, your future, and that of the creatures around you. The great soundtrack of this game will easily get stuck in your head, and you still won’t hate it! With runs lasting up to 2 hours if you drag it on to the end, this game is fun and worthwhile, if not simply to get a couple hours for your money’s worth.The controls are very simple, and most of the buttons have hotkeys to speed things up and make it easier. However, sometimes the controls are unresponsive. You can click and even press the hotkeys as much as you want, and it won’t work. I have played on multiple different computers, and have even talked to friends experiencing the same problem. This is one of the biggest issues with the game, as timing is often vital in battle situations and being delayed even a second can get you screwed in battle.While this game is very fun to start, and without a doubt quite challenging, it does eventually get boring and repetitive. There isn’t very much variation in the events, and you end up going through the same situations over and over again with very few different possible outcomes. The events are essentially what makes the game interesting, and I think having more to this aspect of the game would increase the amount of time you spend playing FTL by a lot. Even the advanced edition content added very little from what I could tell. Although this doesn’t affect gameplay at all and isn’t a big deal, I don’t like how you can’t have your own preset ship and crewman names, and crewman positions. If you want to set your own names, you have to reset it individually each time (aside from using the restart button to keep the same names as your last run). And every run, the crew will start in the default positions, so if you don’t like them, you have to move them every time. I often forget and end up moving them in the middle of the first fight, which isn’t a big deal, but can be annoying.Being able to set the crew positions is one of the most useful features. You can have your crew running around and repairing things or fighting off intruders, and when they’re all done, send them all back to their positions instantly at the press of a button! It’s useful to keep everyone in position at all time. It’s also really helpful given that moving crew individually is kind of awkward. The left click-right click maneuver is weird, and annoying to get used to. Left click to select then left click to move would work fine, as it’s the same system used for the weapons. Then right click can be used to deselect. Currently it’s the reverse of the controls for weapon use, and this makes it even more inconvenient to get used to.While many people will tell you that this game is extremely difficult, I will have to disagree. I found that it’s challenging, but sometimes in the end you just kind of get killed by random events. Sometimes a random event will get a lucky shot in, and you lose a vital team member or just an unlucky sequence of shots that puts you in a really bad situation. Of course sometimes you will lose of making your own mistake or being new to the game and what not, but often it will be because of an unlucky bad situation you were put in.The end-game sectors are where the game starts to legitimately get tougher. This is a good thing, because the progressive increase in difficulty forces you to adapt your strategy and equipment to take down shields more efficiently and make sure you can survive yourself. This transition into the more difficult sectors can be tough, and there’s really no way to get past it unless you’re ready for it coming out of the previous sectors. You need to upgrade your ship sufficiently, get better weapons and the system upgrades to power them, at least 3 levels of shield and probably a couple extra crewmen from the default 3. Sometimes this is impossible, and it can ruin a run, but it also forces you to think ahead a bit and prepare, which is good. In the end though, it should always be possible to win a run using just skill of the game.The final boss is also the only extremely hard part of the game. You have to fight 3 phases of it, in between which you could in theory go back to a repair station and fix up your ship, but chances are you either won’t be able to get to one without it being taken over by the rebels, or on your way back after getting fixed up you’ll fight more rebels and get weakened again. The later phases honestly become close to impossible without certain exact equipment which you have to be lucky to get.Overall, this game is fun for a while, and if you’re willing to persevere through all the tough parts to get really good at this game, there could easily be more than 100 hours worth of gameplay to unlock all the extra content. But in the end, for your casual gamer or roguelike lover, this game is probably only worthwhile to get while it’s on sale (which does happen pretty frequently). For me, this game was fun for a while, but about 15 hours in I started getting bored of runs half way through and it stopped being worthwhile to keep playing.			",65,9,0,6,6,1,4

												NEVER GO FOR THE GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS...unless you have a clone bay that is...It's a game that's based on 10% skill and 90% luck (aka 0.00...01% skill and 99.99...99% luck).It's a game that requires patience and can easily take 10+ hours to beat for the first time.It's a game you will definitely not beat on the first try.It's a game that will make you want to impale the devs on a cactus and let them die of thirst. Or in FTL speak, give them up to slavers.It's a game with amazing replayibility, and is amazingly addictive.It's a game that's easily moddable (you can find mods at www.ftlgame.com).It's a game that I've managed one victory on hard mode.It's a game that I'm still learning things from and finding new events.It's a game I give 10/10, have 151 hours in, and bought for $3.33. Worth way more than I paid.			",65,5,0,7,6,0,17

FTL delivers well-balanced and entertaining gameplay. You will feel true panic when their systems are being overloaded and the oxygen room takes a hit whilst their crew is simultaneously running around for repairs and fighting off enemies who’ve boarded the vessel. The action can get hectic, but it never stops being fun.Combat is great with challenging micromanagement, as crew members of each species are fitted for different tasks. There are a four types of weaponry: missiles, lasers, beams, and bombs. Each have their own advantages - missiles go through shields, lasers don’t require ammo, beams hit more than one room, and bombs simply explode a lot. Finding what combinations work best – and exploiting the ones which do – is one of the most entertaining parts of the game. The only thing FTL truly lacks is full-featured content. What it has included in the game is well-balanced and performs to near perfection, but there might not be enough to satisfy players who want to thoroughly explore the game.THE GOOD- Impressive depth- Intuitive gameplay- Great value for money- Great combat- Fun story decisionsTHE BAD- Basic audioDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

												 let's be honest here: in war, there are no good guys and bad guys, it's us and it's them. it is their job to kill us, while it is our job to kill them and survive. that's that's what's behind the rebel captain telling you ""it's nothng personal, just following orders.""it's up to the player make the decisions to either follow the general ""rules of war"", be a inhumane monster, or some mix that just brings max benefit. what's so great about the vagueness of the story is that the player can and often will fill in the blanks. many times without even realizing they are (i mean, look how often ""space nazis"" comes up, and there's really no indication of this at all).the gameplay is all about learning to deal with what you are given.  though it may seem harsh sometimes, it is still possible to beat the game on hard with every ship.  you need to learn what to upgrade, and when.  you also need to know when you need to put that on the backburner to buy an important weapon or augmentation.  pause often.the music is enjoyable, and the graphics serve to let you know what is happening, which is all i really ask for in a game.the developers are fairly swell, a crowdfunding success story.  they even gave us advanced edition, which is a ton of content.

												Victory is sweetest when you've experienced defeat, and FTL allows you to experience that tenfold. Easy to learn yet difficult to master, FTL is not all about RNG but about the player's perseverance and dedication. But that can be said about any rougelike. What make's FTL special is its pausable real time combat system, allowing for easy micromanagement and the development of complex strategies. And strategy pays off.The iPad version is a great way to pass time while traveling for those who don't want to spend hours at a computer.			",58,6,0,3,8,1,2

												- Played game a few times but i'll tell the story when i got to the Boss.- Ok i heard this ship was difficult so i got to give it EVERYTHING i got- Uses tacticts and does pretty well- Then a middle part of the battle when i missed ALL OF MY SHOTS- At this time i had about 15 hp left so i was still good - Loses more and more but then he has 3hp left- Pray that shots will hit- After a while of trading shots and in panic because of alot of my stations (Like the piloting room the shield room and so on) was on fire and some on red damage- The boss has 1 hp, and so do i- All my shots miss - 3 of his hits me GG10/10 would be tied with a Flagship again. And be sad because i failedIm going to continue trying btw.- My second try was with the Engi ship....- Pretty much same storyFeel even more sad- I tried a 3rd time, finished him off. - I COMPLETELY forgot that he has more than 1 life.- Failed against the drone flagship.Many tries, got some ships, but then the Great Day!After losses upon losses I DID IT. (On easy mode)The Federation Cruiser is my hero.And when i say that i the WoozieWolf! I FEEL ACCOMPLISHED. It took me 18 hours of testing strategies, trial and error, to do it, but that's not bad!And i say GG Now this is a more serious part of the review.I'll have to say this game is alot of fun, even IF you're a bit of a casual player. You just have to learn the basics. It may be difficult, stressing, triggering and even boring. But it's not the competitive aspect of the game that made me love it, it's the feel of acomplishment. Like when i got the Federation ship, and won the game with it, and how i got the rock ship, and when i unlocked all of these i got the LANIUS cruiser. And the replayability is, just crazy. And if you want a challange on easy mode just use a type C ship. They're usually difficult to use. And i do TRULY recommend this game if you have time and effort to use. You'll truly love it if you like singleplayer games. (And space! :D)Well this is the end of my ""Review""I hope it Helps?And maybe got you to buy the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I REALLY wish there was some sort of neutral review option instead of the up or down thumbs. Let me just say that this game is extremely fun. It is extremely polished and it will keep you coming back for more time and time again when you die. And yes, you will die....ALOT. The main problem i have with this game is how it always seems like your opponents dont play by the same rules as you. This is laughably apparent when you encounter the flagship, but more on that later.This is a game where the RNG (random number generator or random number god) holds your fate in its hand almost every time you do a jump. It does not matter how decked out your ship is, how many max level crew you have or how prepared you THINK you are. Like i said in the previous paragraph, the game does not play by the same rules as you, and you will find many enounters that feel unfair, or some that are flat out impossible to win against depending on what ship you pick.And that leads me to the games boss, the flagship. If you manage to get to this behemoth of a ship, you will probably do what i did the first time i encountered it. First you will be awe struck at how big and how many systems and weapons it has, and then when it fires that first volley of lasers and missles which seem to never end, you will sit back, laugh out loud and roll your eyes. I am by no means saying the flagship cant be beaten, because it most definitely can. The problem is in order to beat it there are really only a small list of ship ""builds"" that are effective, and even with those setups, grasping victory can seem very difficult. Alot of the time you have to rely on luck, because while you think that 55% evasion you have actually equals 55%, it will feel like 10% when a full volley of missles and 2 volleys of lasers all impact with almost no misses whatsoever.As i said, the game is very fun, its definitely worth your time, and you will come back for more no matter how stupidly frustrating it can be.  Just realize that all the planning and ship upgrades in the world are just one or two jumps from ending up as space debris at any given moment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this game for 3$ on a steam sale, which I realise is a total steal now that I've had my time to play it. I am yet to have a boring moment in my 8 hours of playing, as I have been occupied every second. It manages to do this even with its conceptually repetitive playthroughs, each short but still lively with original content and dilemmas that keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. To put it in perspective, I have NEVER been without a chore, either fleeing, attacking, repairing, upgrading, or attempting to douse fires via lack of oxygen but find that the oxygen generator room is broken and that I'll have to repair it, but soon realise that it's completely futile as both the oxygen room itself and all the rooms around it are devoid of any oxygen, and that I might as well restart now as my crewmates will slowly suffocate to death but maybe, MAYBE, PLEASE I'M BEGIING YOU-   Nope, nevermind. I rate this game a solid 8/10, which my former self would've said nah, not worth it, CS:GO can keep me awake until 2 o'clock in the morning before I remember that I have multiple quizzes and tests the next day. But if you put it into perspective, I wouldn't rate many games above 8 that cost 30 bucks or more, and I literally snagged this for a TENTH of that price. Now my new ""Wait, I have homework tomorrow, right? Eh, whatever..."" game, can confirm totally worth.			",38,5,0,4,10,0,1

1-sentence review :Great game with great atmosphere, although the combats lack a little bit of depth and can get repetitive, especially at the beginning of a run ; it is anyway a must-play by everybody who calls himself a gamer ! :)Pros :- many different ships, builds & equipments- many different events- great gameplay mechanisms- skills matter, but...Cons :- ... but luck matters a lot, even if there's a lot of skills to learn, luck will decide of the fate more often than not ; for me, it's ok, but it's better to be aware of that- once learned, combats are relatively simple, and get repetitive, especially in the early stages ; reworking the weapon systems with more frequent upgrades and easier swapping (ie: could resell weapon for a better price) would have fixed a good part of the issue			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FTL is an impressive indie title which grasps players by the neck and makes them sweat with every decision as they are thrust into the threshold of space. FTL's Soundtrack is incredibly well done. It has a retro style to it, but that doesn't mean it is cheap. Far from it, actually, as the soundtrack professionally weaves emotions of adventure, battle, and most of all, going against all odds as you survive against the difficulty of your journey. This can be noticed as you can hear the happier, adventurerous themes while you explore the systems, or the intensity of the final battle, amplified by the drums. Also the overall melody of the soundtrack feels like something straight out of a space adventure, which helps it develop a little bit more of a personality, a personality, which, most games seem to have left behind.FTL's Graphical style is unique, it's top down and you see into the ship, and the characters are little sprites. At release, it was interesting to see a game go back to this style, and going back to it, it actually ages quite well. It's not visually impressive, but it doesn't look bad either. Also, this means the game runs on basically anything.The art style actually complements the gameplay, as the gameplay is the most important part of the game. Looking at the ship from a top-down perspective allows you to make tactical decisions based on the room, based on what is happening in the room, and based on who, or what, is in the room. For instance, is there a fire in the next room? Can we starve the room of oxygen to remove the fire? Can we lock the doors to keep intruders at bay and possibly kill them using the oxygen deprived environment or the raging inferno? Is the hull breached in the room, and is it safe enough to fix it before we suffer critical damage?These are the kinds of questions you will constantly ask yourself over the course of the game, and these are the sort of questions that will keep you playing.In FTL, you command a ship with your crew, and you may unlock more ships ( and therefore, more playstyles ), which will allow you to make completely different journeys each time, especially considering the fact that no journey will ever be the same. Each ship has a different crew, and you can even name the crew, making the experience just a little bit more personal.""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.""Er, speaking of the crew, every ship needs a crew. When you lose all of your crew members, you will lose the game. You'll also lose if the ship is blown up, but that was a given.The crew is a vital part of the gameplay experience. You'll need multiple members to utilize every system in the ship, and I'll talk about systems later. The crew is needed to repair critical damage, man systems, fight in close quarters, and participate in various events that you will encounter. There are different species, all with different benefits. Here's a few:Human - Trains skills fasterRockman - No Fire Damage, 150 Health, slowed movement.Zoltan - Provides 1 free power to room, 75 health, explodes on death.Engi - Repairs fast, horrible at combat.Now, these aren't all of the species, because I want to let you discover them, and because it'll be a nice surprise. Certain species can have a positive influence on events, so be sure to add a touch of diversity to the crew.FTL has a perma-death system. There is no checkpoints. No savestates, or whatever. No going back until you die or complete your mission.Victory or death.So, how do you survive? This sounds tough.Well, a big part of survival in FTL is the combat, because well, there are so many things that will try to kill you.The weapons you have on your ship play a huge role in this, so let's list a couple to give you a good understanding.Lasers - Simple, but effective. They are versatile, but have no particular strength. They are easily blocked by enemy shields.Since lasers have many variations, they can be very powerful if you've got the right strategy in mind.Missiles - This type of weapon will penetrate enemy shields and has a good chance to do some solid damage and even breach hulls, but it is easily countered by defensive drones.These weapons consume one missile, so they are a bit costly to maintain.Weapons aren't the only important thing in battle.Systems are powerful additions to your arsenal, especially the essential ones. They are just as important as weapons, if not more important.Shields and engines are the big two that will keep you alive. Shields stop damage, and engines allow you to escape and evade.The weapons system is also important. If these don't work, you can't fight back. And if you can fight back, you'll probably die too.You also need oxygen, because without it, the crew can't breathe, obviously, and die.And there are also sensors, which serve as your eyes ( aside from the crew ).Now here is where crew and systems come hand-in-hand:Having someone man a particular system makes it work a bit better. Keeping the crew alive will reward them with expertise as they get better at what they do.A good pilot means you can evade a bit more. Someone good at repairing can fix things faster than the regular guy.A crew good at combat, and armed with a teleporter, can jump onto the enemy vessel and kill all of the enemy.The importance of systems make it that much more tense in combat. Let's say, for instance, that with a couple of hits to my ship, I'm dead.If I don't pull off the next battle like a pro, I'm done for. Here's where systems and weapons work together to create an impressive gameplay dynamic:I've got powerful shields that lets me absorb the enemy laser fire, but they won't hold up forever.I've got two missiles, and two lasers, and my upgraded sensors allows me to see inside the enemy ship.I notice that they only have two crew members for whatever reason, so I target their weapons, to keep myself alive, and then I focus on the room where the second enemy crew member is, killing him with a lucky hull breach and fire in the room.That crew member happened to be manning the shield systems at the time, so I get to easily pound the enemy with lasers.The last enemy, who is trying to escape, rushes to the cockpit, which I target. With the cockpit in ruins, he has to repair it before he can escape. And he can't fight back without an active weapon system.He's done for, and for now, I live.Let's fast forward a bit, and let's say I went into a nebula. My sensors are down, and my crew are my only eyes on the ship. Even I don't know who, or what is on my ship. We don't even have that much power to spare, so I can only power the vital systems, and only use one of my weapons.I battle an enemy, and he takes out my shield, but I can't spare anyone to fix it because he also got lucky and hit my oxygen at the same time. Since I couldn't tell what was happening on my ship, a fire broke out and is now consuming half of my ship. My engines are burned before I can deprive the room of oxygen, and we're sitting ducks. One final laser hits my ship, and our story ends.Another big part of survival is based on the choices you make.In FTL, you are sometimes forced to make tough decisions that can either help you, or hurt you.Sometimes you will ask yourself, 'Is this risk worth it? What if I lose someone?'Sometimes you will tell yourself, 'I have to take this risk. If I don't, we're going to die.'While some people argue that it is too luck based and random at times, I have to disagree, because this adds to the tense nature of the choices you make.In real life, when you make a decision, you don't know what will, or could happen, and in these random events, sometimes you will come across a bit of text that reveals a bit more of the universe to you, giving the game a little bit more personality as you move faster than light.

												I'll be honest : I am not keen on really difficult games and Rogue-likes are not my preferred games either. Yet, FTL is a almost insanely hard rogue-like and I have enjoyed so many times playing it (and losing miserably). Winning a game is arguably one of my proudest moments on videogames.What works brilliantly with FTL is that it's hard, but as games are played over and over, the player will get better, without feeling any sense of boredom or thinking that he/she cannot beat the game. The game can be beat, and the stories with your ship and crew are vividly tales, accompanied by a superb musical score, if you are into electronic space music.Anyway, don't let yourself evade this game because of its genre or its difficulty. It's worth it.			",170,53,11,20,33,3,36

												I agree with everything positive said about this game.Also, this game is mean. It doesn't like me. It won't like you. Oh, you'll like the game, but it will use that to its advantage to show you how much it *doesn't* like you. Sometimes you may think it likes you. You may think FTL is your friend. But that's just to make you that much more upset when it shows you otherwise. It will hurt your feelings. I'm only playing it on easy, and I'm quite angsty at the moment.You'll be going along, happily building your ship up and lazering the crap out of anyone who gets in your way, gathering up scrap, and then suddenly something comes at you with a missile launcher (bypasses shields), missiles your shields, and their two beam drones make lunch meat out of your ship, while you're all ""b-b-but...I can shoot them like 7 times a round! I mean, I could before my weapons room was ON FIRE.""  The game is very RNG dependant, but I almost feel like that's kind of realistic, in this case. Regardless, the RNG plus the ability to screw yourself up, is pretty brutal.TRIGGER WARNING: THIS GAME HURTS FEELINGS ON PURPOSE.11/10 would be sad and angry metal salami (SAAMS) againPS - Screw the shop owner that warned me how dangerous things were when I pulled in with multiple sections of my ship ablaze.

												The first thing anyone should know about FTL: Faster Than Light, is you will die, often. FTL is Very fun game if you don't mind a challenging experience and permadeath. The storyline is basically you have to fly across the galaxy with an important objective, to warn your people of the incoming invasion, or something along those lines. The base gameplay is almost a turn based action game, with the ability to pause and select how and where you wish to attack. You command the basic ship at the start with the ability to unlock more ships as you progress through the game. The game is composed of 5 Sectors, each with ramping difficulty, but most players should be able to survive through them. The final stage the play must fight a boss ship, winning the game if they destroy it, but restarting all over if the fail. Depending on the ship you fly, there are all kinds of different mods, weapons, rooms, and crew members (of many races and abilities) to acquire, creating many different playstyles. These are purchased with scrap, the in game currency acquired by selling things at stores, completing side mission and destroying ships. Destroying ships also gives you drone parts, used for different types of drones, missiles, used for, well, missile launchers, and fuel. If you ship runs out of fuel in space, you can either wait for the bad guy army to catch up to you, or you can set a distress beacon. Throughout the game, the bad guys are chasing after you. You only have so much time to acquire resources and move on before you are overwhelmed. The galaxy in the game is randomly generated each time, and each sector is randomly generated as well, and each area in each sector is also randomly generated. The game will never be the same 2 playthroughs in a row. This adds replayability into the game, making the permadeath seem less of a drawback and more of an opportunity. The game, although retro looking, is actually beautiful. The graphic style suits the game very very well. The sound in the game is amazing, the music is so inviting and fits the game perfectly.FTL does many things right.ReplayabilityMany play stylesa constant feeling that every choice you make has real significanceThe graphic style of the game suits it very well. The music and sound of the game are phenomenal and fit so wellThe diverse races make the galaxy seem more populatedThe random events and their consequences make the player feel more in controlThe DLC/expansion is freeModding communityHas steam trading cardsFTL does some things wrong. The end boss is extremely difficult There are a few bugs that still haven't been patched outThe game can feel tedious if played more than 20 hoursSome playstyles, although fun, are near impossible to win withSometimes sectors are over populated, and you get into too many space battlesThe “luck of the draw” feeling comes in as you continue to playThis game is very fun to someone who likes a challenge. I would suggest that the best way to enjoy this game is not look try to enjoy beating the boss, enjoy the journey through space. Or even too try to earn the achievements to give the game another perpous. The game has its issues but all in all it is a great deal of fun. The modest price of $10.99(CAD) Is worth is to someone who might put 15+ hours into it. If its on sale, i think everyone should pick up this game, it's a wonderful little nugget of gold in the vast desert that is the steam indie game section.  ",400,61,6,26,50,1,63

 Faster than Death  TL;DR FTL is a Difficult and extremely intense strategy game, With every fight being one that might end your journey and resources being scarce you’ll be on the edge of your seat throughout your adventures. A fantastic soundtrack that always sets the tone of the battle. The Further in the adventure you get the more attached to your crew you’ll become making their demise that more real.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Great soundtrackLarge array of ships to choose fromIntense strategic battlesVery easy to start a new game Many secrets and challenges to unlockCons Random difficulty rampsVery dependent on RNGNo way to save ships through a new game+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayThis game is one of the few game I use the pause feature in to strategize my attacks and defense. After you do place where you want to attack you’ll have to sit back and watch at the edge of your seat as your weapons charge up and hope that they land. There are instances where your ship will catch fire or have a breach or be invaded, then you must fix the problems while still in the middle of a space battle. The game is great at being simple chaotic fun. The management of resources is just as important as anything else, you need to get as much scrap before fighting the final boss at a better chance to win. If your ship runs out of fuel you’ll be at the mercy of passing ships while still being chased by the rebellion. StoryKnowing that you are being chased by an overwhelming enemy and there are more ahead of you adds so much to the tension of the game. You can’t stay in a sector to long or you’re going to get caught by the extremely difficult rebellion battlecruisers. You are forced to continue and to meet the final boss with the little resources you were able to get. Characters What FTL does beautifully is creating character you get attached to without them being unique. The longer they are able to survive in the journey the better the become at the job they were assigned, so it really is crushing when one of them dies because you weren’t paying attention to the oxygen levels or something small like that. It is rare in a run to hit the max limit on crew sizes at least for very long. Art/Graphics With the simple pixel art and animations FTL is able to convey extreme space battles and an overwhelming sense of dread. With slight additions made to your ui, like a red flashing light the game jumps from 3 to a 10 really fast.Bonus Notes FTL I like to believe is a game for any steam library it’s a brilliant lunch game and the permadeath aspects means little commitment, the ability to just hop into a new game makes it worth the small price. Also, the addition of free content makes me love the developers of the game.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamship ",271,48,3,29,28,5,37

												This might seem a bit lengthy, but hear me out... I was playing the game, of coarse, and I happened to come across an enemy that only had a Burst Laser to hurt me (for those who don't know, it fires two lasers at your ship). I had two shields up and all he would do was bring them both down, recharge his weapon, and hit me again, doing literally no damage to my ship's hull what so ever. At that time, I was about to destroy the enemies' ship, but then I realised something... My crew was leveling up despite me doing nothing Their skill increased as this helpless little enemy was trying his hardest to simply put a scratch on me, so I did what anyone would have done. I left the game running, went to the kitchen, heated up some food, ate the food, went on Youtube, watched some videos, went back to the game, noticed they were skilled up all the way in that one section of the ship, switched them around, went to the bathroom, did some school work, came back, switched them around again, took a nap, watched all episodes of Game of Thrones, ran a marathon, cured cancer, etc etc. I did this until they were fully leveled up in everything that required nothing to do. 10/10 Would find loophole again			",89,40,1,9,13,0,3

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a true gem in the rogue-like genre that never fails to disappoint. FTL has you take charge of a ship (of your choice) in the Federation fleet to take on the Rebels and defeat their flagship. FTL is all about managing your ship and your crew effectively in order to make your ship powerful enough to fight the boss (good luck with that one).+Nice art style+An incredibly good OST+It's set in space, who doesn't love space?+Each playthrough (depending on which systems you get and whether or not you beat the boss) takes between 20-30 minutes so it's easy to play a quick game+A wide range of ships to choose from/unlock including different layouts of the same ship+Several different races, each with their own specialities and backstories+Lots of customisation options for ships+Different ships suit different playstyles +Plenty of different enemy ship types+Extremely replayable+Some really good mods, especially FTL Infinite, and the game is simple to mod+/-The boss is extremely hard to beat, I still haven't beaten it at the time of writing this review but it doesn't really matter because playing through the game and unlocking new ships is where the fun comes from-Some of the ships are extremely difficult to unlock-It has in-game achievements but no Steam achievementsVerdict:9.5In my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best, rogue-likes on Steam and is a must have for all rogue-like fans.El K.

												Beautiful game.I named my ship ""The Golden Perv"" and my crew were aptly ""Sir.Jimmy Saville"", ""Gary Glitter"" and the notorious ""Rolf Harris"". We drifted through space, far and wide. Helping those who sent distress signels are fighting tyranny wherever we found it! We were determined to finish our mission, and deliver the information (which was actually CP) to whever we had to go. We ended up crashing on a planet. We repaired our ship and rescued a man. We became good friends, sharing many jokes and rounds of ""Play Rolfs digerydoo while dancing on the table like a hooker"". We bonded. Allies. Then we were CRUELY attacked by pirates, our hull badly damaged, sheilds down and oxygen depleting. Rolf Harris and Sir Jimmy Saville tried to fix the oxygen while Gary Glitter and the man we picked up fought bravely. A missile struck the ship. Jimmy and Rolf were no more. RIP. But we fought them back and lived! Then we were ambushed yet again! This time, Gary Glitter died. The strange man had inherited the ship. He drifed. Years on end, missing his friends. Then he was stuck in an astroid belt, having the sheilds pummled by rock, while he was shot upon. The laser beams and missiles were set to auto as the strange man tried fixing the continually damage oxygen system. A fire started, and he burnt to death. Scared, alone, out of breath, and crispy is how the saga ended for The Golden Perv.			",183,37,0,26,41,3,18

												Faster Than Light is quite an amazing little game. It looks over simplistic at first, but there are several layers to discover, strategies and random events to make every attempt to beat the game challenging, unique and a lot of fun (expect most attemps will fail). It quickly became one of my favorites in my library of 1300+ games.This game is not for everyone, but if you like difficult turn-based strategy (combat is actually ""real-time with pause""), sci-fi, single player and roguelikes/permanent-death, you cannot go wrong with this one. It's definately not a game for those who only enjoy action games and mindless shooting and running. It takes a only a few hours to complete a game if you make it to the end, but you will probably have to restart several dozen of times before you reach that point in the first (unless you play in easy mode, which I never tried so I don't know).That being said, it you are not turned off by anything I wrote, buy FTL immediately. Gameplay is absolutely fantastic and addictive.			",670,427,9,150,59,6,155

												There is absolutely nothing more demoralizing than dedicating almost 2 - 3 hours on a single playthrough just to get to the final boss and die. Yes there is. Dedicating another playthrough of 2 - 3 hours just to get to the final boss and die again. So if you're up to the task of wasting hours of your life away just to fall short of the finish line, try it. The feeling of victory is sweet and you will proudly soak up the accopmlishment of knowing you've saved the Federation. But if you lose, you sit there wondering to yourself... Is it me? Do I suck? Or is this game just cruel? Why do I keep coming back to it? Could I have done anything different? Is there a perfect load out? Is it just luck? Is it even possible to beat this game on any other mode but EASY? Am I a masochist? What am I doing with my life? Questions you will no doubt ask yourself. I know I have...			",43,6,0,3,5,0,3

												I put off buying this game for a long time, mostly because i thought i wouldn't like it. Many of my friends & family kept pestering me to buy it, and a couple of years later i finally purchased it during one of the steam sales. After getting in a few hours of FTL, i now wish i had bought the game at launch day. It's absurdly difficult, but so wonderfully entertaining that you will keep coming back for more. I'm an absolute sucker for games with awesome soundtracks, and i fell deeply in love with FTL's beautifully soothing and atmospheric music. This game has brought me more joy and happiness than most AAA games have given me in the past decade. Faster Than Light is living proof that excellent game design more often than not, is more important than having a game with ultra high graphics and an insanely high budget.Seriously, buy this game.9.5/10			",222,48,2,15,13,1,11

Although you follow the same general storyline in every play through, it still introduces new challenges and thought provoking events.  You are constantly running into issues where you have to make hard moral decisions that will affect your progress in the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys happiness.     12/10			",13,4,0,1,4,0,2

												A game where you control your crew members and the starship they pilot, going on missions, dealing with crises, battling foes, and having encounters with weird aliens has a lot of appeal.  This game brims with potential, most of which it lives up to.In the beginning, though, you don't really know what you're up against.  Playing on easy until you've got the confidence to advance is almost a necessity.  The game can feel capricious, punishing you for taking any risk, or slowly bleeding you by opportunity cost for taking no risk.  Later on,you'll know how the encounters you'll be facing stack up, and will only bother with the outfits that work well or choices that have paid out in the past.  There's still a few different playstyles, using different types of weapons, or boarding, or such, but it can definitely play out in a similar manner.It's also kind of a pain to unlock everything, because doing so involves either playing perfectly to get achievements or getting very lucky with finding certain encounters.  The crystal ship, in particular, is such a huge annoyance that I'll call it out specifically.  That one really should have been made so that you could advance towards it over multiple games, rather than having to get that '1 in a million' run.There are other minor irritations, too, like how poorly the game handles power juggling with Zoltan crew members.Once you've seen everything the game can do, you start to feel more acutely the stuff it can't do.  You'll never get in a big space battle with multiple ships.  You'll never go on a real 'away mission', at least one that's not handled entirely through text.  You'll never play anything but the same scenario (defeating the rebel flagship), unless you experiment with some user-made mods.Still, what's there is pretty good quality, and there are a lot of different encounters.  Some of them are really rare, while others crop up all over the place.  It's a nice game for short increments of time.Ed. The advanced edition just makes it even better.			",42,8,0,5,6,0,11

												This took a long while to for me to understand and appreciate.  At first I thought it to be ridiculously hard and luck driven, so I raged and uninstalled it with the intent to never play it again.  Sometime later I came across a tips and tricks thread and got a desire to play again.  I soon learned that I was playing the game poorly, and that it is not luck driven at all.  *See DarkTwinge's videos on Twitch.*  Shortly after I got my first win on easy... then my second... then my third.  I saw how fun this game can be.Then I took break from the game and forgot about it for a while.  Now that the free expansion was released, I decided to install it again and explore the content.  So I fired up a game and, 90 minutes later, I beat the game on my first try.  What a blast.If you are having a hard time with this game, please do not give up.  Take a break if you need to.  Then find why you are failing, come back, and correct the problems.  I'm glad I did because otherwise I would have missed out on really enjoying what this game has to offer.Highly recommended.

The main reason it's going to be hideous is because I'm not going to allow myself to delete anything I type, so this is all pretty much off the bat. :)When I first saw a trailer of this game a couple of years back, I made the mistake of thinking it'd be boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also initially found it to be that way for the tutorial, followed by the first half hour or so of gameplay... just some stupid nerdy sci-fi game where you tackle some stupid galaxy in your stupid ship with stupid lasers and stupid shield, stupid crew and stupid random♥♥♥♥♥♥happens all the stupid time and... hm, this game seems to have more to it than I thought, I actually like it and am a complete idiot. And then I played it for a stupid length of time and loved it, the end. ^^Play this game.			",376,87,22,67,31,3,53

												Loved it and want more. Any update would be fantastic. I guess that the mods are good to, but I'd love an official update to this game.A few things to note:You will die.You will die a lot.You will die more than you win.You can't save your progress. You die, you start over.HOWEVER:When you win, you'll be honestly proud of yourself for fighting so hard to win, because you have to do so much in order to win that you will feel like you've finished a journey or something. Either way, it's very rewarding when you win.The soundtrack is fantastic.The time between starting the game and death is random, fun, and is also never exactly the same.The side missions are fun, especially when you manage to unlock new ships. Plus the different species are interesting and sometimes game changing.The subtle lore of the game and the backstory of the different species, the cause of the war, etc.All in all, I'd recommend this game to someone who is cool-headed and loves a good old fashioned space explorer. And is willing to die.A lot.Seriously, prepare to die, and get ready to fly. Through an airlock. Or, you know, to victory.Maybe.FTL.BUY IT.			",3,0,0,1,1,0,9

												""Just a few hit points on the hull, and these are the final moments of FTL. My sweaty hands press sweaty buttons as the flagship bears down upon the S.S. A-Hole. If only my Mom could see me now.""Let’s start off with the basics — FTL is a Rogue-LITE. There’s permadeath, but that’s about the only thing that really connects it to the classic concept of a rogue-like game. In fact, I think FTL is basically its own classification. I’ve never really played anything quite like it before, and it was refreshing to see a new concept on the market.Let’s talk about the pros. FTL’s gameplay is super solid. So far, I’ve come across no bugs at all, everything works as it should. The tutorial correctly explains each mechanic, and they’re each so simple that I thought at first the game would be a dud. Oh boy, how I was wrong. These simple mechanics scale into a huge atmosphere of strategy, where each move you make could decide your life or death in the final battle with the flagship. Just like in XCOM, you get attached to your crew super quickly, and when one dies it’s almost enough to rage quit. Each race manages to bring a different component to your crew, which again adds to the overall strategy.The combat relies on your micromanagement of different weapons, and your outfit in general. It’s satisfying to find a weapons strategy that destroys the enemy. Thankfully, there isn’t just ONE strategy to choose from, although they all revolve around your opponent’s shields.""One by one, my crew members are dead. The shields are down, the weapons turn orange, this is the end. But I know I just need a one more shot. I can do this.""Them cons tho.FTL does fall short in a few instances, and none bigger than the lore. If FTL could create a real world around it’s fantastic gameplay, the game would be SO MUCH BETTER. Also, the text-heavy encounters try to be physiologically difficult to decide on, but honestly it’s super easy to figure them out. Another large shortcoming is the lack of weapon variety and quest variety. Even with the expanded universe I find quests that I’ve already done and are super easy to do again with my foreknowledge. I just can’t see myself replaying this with so little variety.""One second. The weapon is charged, but so is his. They both fire.""			",49,18,0,18,4,0,6

This is a game that will make you think and have you plan out your next strategy.  The graphics are appealing, and the learning curve is small. For $10, it can't be beat.			",165,9,2,9,18,0,12

												FTL is a fantastic game that mixes elements of exploration, rogue-like event randomness, crew/ship management and survival in a perfect blend. Strategic play feels rewarded and the depth of combat rarely gets old. A variety of alien species, different ships, different layouts and random sectors/system help provide huge replay value. A winning run through the game can take up to around two hours.It is not an easy game which is both a blessing and a curse. Losing a decent run due to the RNG (random number generator) nature to some of the events you might come across as you travel to the final battle can sometimes get to you. It's worth sticking with for those good runs, even if they end in failure, that see you score high or tell an exciting story.The recent free content patch in the form of the Advanced Edition added a swathe of new features, events, ship systems and even a new race and playable ship. It has made a great game even better - even if it has also made the final boss even more frustrating and difficult!If you want to check out some first impressions of mine on the FTL Advanced Edition feel free to check out this video:

												The amount of work and balancing that has gone into this $10 game is simply astounding. It's well written, well designed, full of strange hidden activities and unlockable ships, and has the best music this side of Risk of Rain. And they're not even done improving it. Another huge, free, expansion is on its way. (as of Feb. 2014) I would call the learning curve extreme (even by Rogue-like standards) but the game is a rare masterpiece, and it's well worth the time you'll spend being brutally crushed by aliens. If I could only recommend one game from the last five years, it would be FTL.			",90,6,5,13,14,2,32

												Nice mix of roguelike and strategy/tactical game. Not so complicated as most of roguelikes, what is an advantage for players don't know this genre. From one point of wiev it's quite simple game, but from other, in this simple mechanics you have a lot of possibilities and strategies in combat. Very well thought and designed indie game.VERDICT:If you're a fan of rogue-like games, you should try it. It's good and fresh.If you're in mood to play smaller game, try it. One game won't take you too much time.But if you're a fan of good graphics and animations, keep looking.Like this review?

												FTL is a game that people of every age should play because it teaches you two inevitabilities1. FTL isn't fair2. FTL is a constant struggleAs such, FTL is one of the greatest 'life lessons simulators' around. Not only do you learn that life isn't fair and that it's a constant struggle you will inevitably lose to, you also get to experience the sheer monotony of life every time you click restart, begin from same start you've seen after your 40th unsuccessful run, and set off into space knowing that you will not succeed or ever come close to doing so. I would fully reccomend this to anyone wanting to educate themselves or friends/family/loved ones about the harsh realities of life.			",181,32,2,24,21,0,21

												I don't know why I love FTL that much. There's a lot of luck involved, the boss is near impossible, you quickly end up using pretty much the same tactics in every battles, and it might just be me but since most texts are more or less the same, I almost always skip them. I still find myself coming back to it again and again. Why am I doing that? Is it because of the nice atmosphere, the empowerement of commanding a crew and managing a ship into battle, the thrills of jumping from a star to another, not knowing what awaits and if I'll survive this time...Yeah, I objectively can't say why I'm in love with this game; the best I can do is to explain the feeling of adventure I get when I'm playing it.

												When single player games claim to have ""replayablity"" as a tagline, I generally roll my eyes. Usually these ""infinitely replayable"" games hold my interest for one full playthrough unless they are mind-numbingly boring or unplayably buggy, but I rarely ever start second playthrough (let alone complete one). I bought FTL at deep discount ($2.49) expecting to play through it once, kill a few hours, and get my money's worth. For once, I was incredibly suprised by a supposedly ""replayable"" game. I've spent about 30 hours on FTL, beaten the flagship once, and I'm still on the edge of my seat. There is something about the combination of true roguelike RNG and built-in replay mechanics that makes FTL something special. Though I've gotten many unlucky runs where everything seemed stacked against me, each crushing defeat felt truly unique. While FTL can be frustrating, it has never felt unfair. There is always something new to learn or try out. There is a real thrill that comes out of constructing a strategy, trying to implement it, and inevitably adapting it based on the hand you are dealt. STRONGLY RECOMMEND, even at full price.

												I got this game a few years ago and played a solid 25 hours making no headway because I was doing everything wrong. Over the past two weeks I picked it up again with the goal of finally winning. Took about 20 additional hours for my first (and thus far only) victory on Normal mode. I feel a lot better about reviewing it now that I've got enough hours and a victory logged. 100% recommended.You are the captain of a ship. You have to micromanage your crew and systems (weapons, shields, engines, oxygen. and piloting being the primary systems that you start with, with various systems and subsystems that differ from ship to ship or can be purchased along the way. Your goal is to explore every sector of the galaxy, progressing towards an exit beacon that propels you into the next one. You have limited time in each sector, and every jump costs one fuel. You'll often stumble across shops that let you install new weapons, hire new crew, buy new systems, buy basics like fuel and missiles, sell things you don't want anymore, and repair your ship if need be. Tons of different events that you can encounter on your travels, all having various outcomes based on your decisions. You'll make decisions or run into hostile ships after each jump with the goal being to survive long enough to upgrade your ship, get better weapons, make it to the end, and beat the final boss. That's FTL in a nutshell. Once you learn the ropes, the best ways to attack and defend, optimal ways to upgrade your ship, which events will punish you and which ones will help, you'll gradually make it further and further. On the surface the game seems completely RNG-based (and indeed, you can play perfectly and have a stretch of unlucky breaks that kill your run, or a stretch of lucky ones that win it), but the more you play, the better you get. You learn the tricks of the trade and suddenly you're relying way less on RNG and way more on your own skill.You start with one ship unlocked, and can unlock more through various quests in-game or by beating the game with other ships. There are ten ships in total, eight of which have three layouts, two of which have two. That's a grand total of 28 ships to choose from each with its own starting strengths, weaknesses, and intended playstyle. Different starting weapons and systems really shake things up. Lots of replay value.Game has three difficulties now, easy, normal, and hard. Normal is punishingly hard at times and it will take you a while to beat. You're gonna die a lot, but that's part of the fun. Even on easy mode, it's unlikely you'll be winning when you first start playing, as the game is still challenging and you stlil need to learn the ins and outs. I didn't play on easy mode even once until I had cleared normal (which happened at the 45 hour mark, but again the first 25 hours were me playing totally wrong so let's say 20), and what I learned in normal means I can win easy almost every time now, while normal is still very challenging and hard mode is completely beyond me.Captain your vessel, blow things up, die a lot, cry when your oxygen gets blown up and you suffocate from a hull breach, don't fight the giant alien spiders (they are no joke), get stranded with no fuel, go on a grand adventure, rinse and repeat until you win, cry again, and then rinse and repeat some more. That's FTL baby!			",145,34,1,24,16,1,20

												This game is incredible, and very challenging!  The only caveat is you have to enjoy roguelike gameplay where you build a sweet ship and then lose it all by doing something stupid.  Every time I die I learn something and come away with a new story.  For example, learning to board other ships instead of simply attacking them got me a few good stories about how I killed my crew and lost the game.  Some minor spoilers: The first time I did it, I accidentally left my ship's guns on autoattack and blew up the ship I boarded with my crew still on it.  The second time I did it, I boarded an ""auto-scout"" ship, which has no crew and therefore no oxygen, and my crew died before I could get them back.  The third time I did it I had the ship down to 1 health and didn't consider that we were in an asteroid field where it could blow up without me attacking it, and it did.  Eventually I got the hang of boarding ships and the payoff is well worth it.			",375,99,14,35,77,18,71

												How did I miss writing a review for this?FTL is hands down the only rogue-like with replayability that I enjoy. You obviously don't know me so I guess that isn't saying much to you though. The game has a similar feel to XCOM:enemy unknown in its strategy system. If you rush and don't think things through, bad things will happen. And you will REALLY feel it in the long run. Unlike XCOM, playthroughs are shorter and you will learn from each mistake. The UI is beautifully done, and nearly every strategy you can come up with is viable. And it better be, because this game is HARD. I haven't personally even come close to beating the game on anything above the easiest setting. Advanced addition was an incredible update that added more to the gameplay, races, weapons, interactions, soundtrack and metagame. Everything feels even more chaotic, as you truly feel like a captain of a starship navigating in a maze of alien forces coming after your♥♥♥♥♥ One wrong move and you're dead. One wrong move and it will cost you scrap that couldve gotten you that missle to pierce those shields you just didn't have the firepower to break through. One cheap out of repairing your health and you were one shot away from killing that drone and it kills you. One... you get the point. As stressful as it sounds, the one mistake costs you mechanics of the game give it incredible depth and replayability. Did I also mention that Advanced Edition can be turned off if you want to play the legacy version of the game? And oh yeah baby, this game has mods too. If you wanted a whole new campaign and an even bigger update than ADV edition was, Captains edition has you covered. If you just feel like adding a star destroyer as a playable ship, then whatever floats your boat.In conclusion I'm not sure what else you could possibly ask for this title. The devs have gone above and beyond the standard, and though it likely won't happen, I would absolutely love another update here in 2016. This may be an old title, but it's far from dead.Happy flying, Federation! Crush the Rebels!10/10 from me.			",148,21,0,9,9,2,8

												Roguelike/lite / choose your own space adventure. Nicely designed game about your own selected crew in your own selected spaceship of which you can unlock more by progressing in the game and acchieving certain feats. The choose-your-own-adventure part of the game is nicely done, visit different nodes in space which may or may not give you loot, a challenge or progress the story a bit depending on your crew/ship/previous choices. The combat is real time with a turnbased feel to it due to the timing/cooldowns of the abilities. Beating the game for the first time might take some time, but just once you figured it all out you get a run in which you get absolutely slaughtered from the get go.The devs even released a free DLV adding a whole new race and some other mechanics to the mix. In conclusion: for the subgenre of games it's in, it's one of the best.			",164,24,3,12,12,2,28

												What's a good way to sum up this roguelike spaceship simulator?Well, in one moment you could get very lucky in acquiring hefty scraps rewards, new crewmen, even say augments or weapons that give you a better chance at surviving to the end of the game. In another moment, you could be suffering the loss of a crewman through an event or be taking on the wrong kind of ship in the wrong type of environment... where you either win with heavy ship damages/casualties or lose in a very horrific fashion.See, this is FTL: Faster Than Light in a nutshell... a game where you play as a Federation Crusier on a mission back to deliver something to HQ while outrunning the Rebel Army within different sectors that has a lot things that are probably going to kill you if you're not lucky/prepared. Now much of this game revolves around a few things: luck, how well you can operate within different given situations, and what your style of ship-to-ship combat pertains to. A game like this, I feel at least, will sometimes be more luck-driven than as to how well you can handle a given situation. Of course, if you have certain augments/crewmen/weapons/etc when you arrive at some certain events, it can make traveling through the various sectors that you will come across a heck of a lot easier.Something to note: As with many roguelikes, you have to constantly stay ahead of the Rebel Army, indicated by a massive wall on your ship's radar as you jump from beacon to beacon within each sector. Now I don't think I need to say this, but it is ill advised to go straight to the exit of each sector. If you want to make it all the way to endgame, you must explore as much of the sector as possible while staying ahead of the Rebel Army before you're forced to leave the sector at the exit beacon. Doing this, you can get the most out of each sector in terms of scraps (among other things) to help upgrade your ship as well as buy weapons, augments, ship systems, and various other things from shops that you will come across.Word of warning: Make sure you plot your course through each sector thoroughly so that you will reach the exit while getting as much out the sector as possible... otherwise you may end up at dead-end points which will severely hamper your progress... or worse make you backtrack through the Rebel Fighter ships of the Rebel Army... which, to keep in mind, they do NOT mess around. Also, keep in mind of what sectors you visit... because each one has their own events, enemy ships, and hazards to deal with. Engi Sectors, for example, have ships that are bad to go against if you're particularly fond of using drones, Zoltan Sectors have you, more often than not, dealing with Zoltan Ships that have Super Shields that can't easily be bypassed with teleporters (unless you're on the Advanced Edition which offers a specific bypass augment), Mantis Sectors has you against ships that will try to board and kill off your crew, and so on and so forth.If you're lucky though, you may come across specific events that will help you in unlocking newer ships (which can alternatively be done for each one by beating the game with a specific ship)... which for some is easy to do, and others are easier said than done. Each starting ship that you unlock have different perks, advantages, etc. that can offer a different and unique experience to the game.I'm rambling at this point... so do I recommend this game? Sure, why not. If you like the notorious roguelike genre of games, I'd say go for it... it's worth the money, and you'll likely be spending hours upon hours unlocking each type of ship while taking on the different challenges that the game has to offer... while likely experiencing some frustrating difficulty spikes during gameplay.

												There's a lot I could say about this game, but I'm pretty confident that whatever I say, some other review has already covered it in depth.As such, what I can really say from myself is that FTL provides me with an immersive space adventure that's different each time; you never know for certain what's going to happen next. The ability to name your ship and each crewmember only adds to this. Sure, after playing for so long, I've seen almost every encounter type available, but when I'm playing I just feel like I'm in control of my ship and its crew, struggling to get along until the bitter end in this cruel universe. Each action has immediate consequences, and somehow making it to the end and defeating the final boss provides an extreme sense of satisfaction.Of course, this game isn't about getting to the end; it's about the journey along the way. The possibilities are endless, just like the reaches of space.... Except for the abrupt ending to your journey, which is almost certain you will die a very sudden, brutal, exploding death.

It looks cheap, but it's a very good experience.Space battles are static (sort of), but trust me 0.1 sec delay and your ship will be destroyed.Plenty of weapons, plenty of ships to command.Choose your own playstyle:- Board the ships, kill the crew.- Set ships on fire, and watch everyone to be baked alive.- Let the enemy crew suffocate, while you are disabling O2 systems.- Shower enemies with rockets, lasers, debris.- Send your drones to do your dirty work.This game more of a strategy. So grab it, and have a nice journey.			",179,43,0,34,29,1,42

												I think FTL is a very addictive game ♥ You start with a crew and a ship. You have a mission to survive and there are so many ways to fail, yet so many places to explore and unpredictable events to unravel. What makes the game really fun is the decisions you make for your ship to survive and your strategy of micro-managing your crew, situations and resources in order to make it to your goal. Depending on the roles you give to each crew member will also depend which skills and strengths they develop.There are some interesting species to encounter and play as in FTL, from fireproof rockmen to telepathic slugs. The random name generation is quite amusing too.As a roguelike game, this means there is no mercy if you die and your ship explodes. Failling means the end and you will need to start all over again. The feeling is bad, but the desire to play again is always there, just to see if luck is in your hands next time.Also, you can unlock ships, in-game achivements and layouts if you do keep playing over again, depending on what you encounter and how far you get.Sometimes when played for too long with the same ship and crew, it's easy to become attached to the crew members. RIP Charlie :(I think those of you who ♥ sci-fi, challenging, strategic and resourceful survival games will really enjoy and play FTL over and over again. ♥ ",936,446,28,144,88,3,138

Recommended: FTL is a game that is intentionally punishing in the end fight, but irrespective of that, the journey to said end fight is often quite fun.  There is perhaps an over-reliance on procedural generation that can make the game overly inconsistent in difficulty, but to many, that's the appeal.  At it's heart, FTL is a simple space tactical game that uses it's rogue-like elements with decent proficiency to create that often-sought ""just one more game"" replayability.  It's not going to sell someone new to rogue-likes, I don't think, but it is well worth a look for fans of the genre.Read the full review on Highland Arrow here[www.highlandarrow.com] ",529,137,9,122,58,3,89

												After spending a few hours on this game I can already wholeheartedly recommend it. It's an indie game, so don't expect great graphics, but what you can expect is gameplay that will blow you away, a great soundtrack and an addiction to playing. You can restart the game countless times and the path will never be the same. Battles are nice and sometimes you have to think twice or even three times what is the best position for the laser, what room to hit, should I kill the crew? et cetera. There are some hidden ways of obtaining new ships or crew so even after hours of playing you will not know or have everything. The game can be hard, or even frustrating at times (even if you know how to play the game), knowing is only half the battle and in this case, thinking is the other.Bottomline, if you are looking for a great singleplayer indie game you won't be disappointed. 10/10			",77,9,1,2,4,1,4

												I think the best part of strategy games is often learning how everything works and interacts and actually experiencing the learning curve first hand. It can be frustrating because you'll die because of something you didn't know about- but you remember it for next time and forge ahead and slowly climb the ranks.FTL is excellent at this process. I've died in this game more than I've died in just about any other game and I've barely been playing it over more than a few months, but rather than getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off and ragequitting I'm encouraged to try something new, to adjust my upgrade order, to select a different interaction with a ship, to mix up my weapons or combat technique or any number of different approaches to avoid or deal with the same problem in the future.It's a game that relies on RNG heavily, which normally makes for a really boring end game, but with FTL there's tons of end-game content and once you think you've learned everything and mastered the intricacies of turns, combat, crew members, upgrades and everything else there's still a heap of goals to strive for, new challenges to attempt and things to do.It's a fantastic game that never makes me feel rushed, and in those moments when I do feel pressured because I'm losing it's alright because I know I can adapt and try things a little different next time and get just a little bit better and a little bit further.

												Don't judge my review from the amount of hours on Steam. I've been playing FTL on the iPad since last year.Here's what I have to say.10 reasons for a 10/101. Dying over and over again, many times is the game. Unless you win the final fight.2. You will see giant alien spiders atleast once in every playthrough.(what I mean is you reach sector 8) Always reject them unless you have a clone bay.3. Ship layout doesn't always guarantee victory(even you Mantis B and Crystal B)4. Unlocking the Crystal ship is like winning the lottery. Match all three encounters and you win the prize.5. The game's soundtrack fits the game's theme perfectly, starting as a calm track; then becoming faster as you get into a fight.6. If you're surviving, you'll die. If you're thriving, you will die. If you're lucky, you'll win.7.  Boarding with 4 mantis/2 crystal & 2 mantis/4 rockmen with fire is extremely fun! Getting boarded, isn't.8. I love how stupidly powerful/stupid/powerful the enemy ships are. I wonder if they fixed the 5 shielded auto ship.9. The euphoria, ecstacy when winning a game will outweigh all of the times you lost before then.10.  Modding is extremely fun. Especially Captain's Edition, ship mods, and graphics mods.Those are ten decent reasons to buy FTL.P.S. ion intruders, ♥♥♥♥ off			",40,5,0,2,9,2,6

												FTL: Faster Than Light. A gloriously simple, yet complex game. This is a top-down rogue-like that simulates the experiences of managing a crew on your own spaceship in a futuristic setting. It was initially released on the 14th of September back in 2012 and is currently on sale for £6.99 or $9.99 on Steam.Chances are, if you’re into Sci-Fi, Strategy or Rogue-likes and you play on Steam. Then you’ve seen or heard of this game. It was also massively popularised by YouTubers such as Nerd3 and TotalBiscuit. And if you haven't, then you're actually missing out on quite a lot. The premise of the game, is that you control a crew of different races in different ships as you try to flee from the ongoing Rebellion and complete your mission for the Galactic Federation.One of the most notable things about the game is it's easily recognisable Indie and Pixely design which seems to give an Arcade or Retro feel without limiting the game to such a style entirely. However the design still feels exclusively (and entirely) it's own, although their is a definite feel of inspiration from games such as Spelunky, X-Com and the classic board game of Battleships.One of my favourite additions to the game would have to be it’s free expansion pack: “FTL:AE (Advanced Edition)”. This added a whole new series of Ship Classes, weapons, events, augments and a whole new race.If you do intend to play this game, then be warned: If you find yourself enjoying this game, then you will soon find it incredibly addicting and infuriating, terrifying and heart-breaking. However one of the biggest falls to this game is how quickly the use of RNG becomes an annoying sensation of ""Copy and Paste"" and the repetitive feelness of the same scenarios occurring time after time.In Summary;This game is a must get. Even if you aren’t a fan of rogue-likes or micro-managing in games, I would still recommend this. The gameplay is innovative and the design is immersive in it’s own 2D way. The variety of mod's and achievements/unlockables also make this game so replayable that at times, it almost becomes second-nature. It's only downsides are it's difficult gameplay and at times it's repetitiveness...Pro's:- Detailed & Beautiful Pixel Graphics- Beautiful Soundtrack (2 Hours Long)- Unique Gameplay- Variety in Freedom of Choice- Good Modding CommunityCon's:- Repetitive Gameplay- Insane Difficulty Curves- Overly Addictive & Infuriating9.5/10			",163,40,2,15,15,0,21

												This game is amazing. You control your own ship and crew, and destroy your enemies as you hop from sector to sector to the last Federation base. (And maybe find a few weapons just floating in outer space.) Make careful decisions, and surely you will succeed in the Last Stand.Amazing soundtrack as well. Really worth getting, especially during a sale.			",80,5,1,3,12,2,9

												The good: Random, roguelike play, text based rpg aspects, no two games are alike. Unlocks, and varations on how you set up your ships (I don't mean the layouts but after you start) lead to much replayability. The bad: The game does everything it can to make you miserable and or lose. Before the expansion this was also true but not quite so vehemently. The end boss even on easy is impossible for me but apparently some people have solved it. After 64 hours I am giving up on it. Even with Advanced mode off the game is 10x harder than it was. Getting near my scores of several years ago is severely challenging in a bad way. Sometimes it feels like a run through is a complete waste of time. The ugly: What do you want for cheap? The game is too hard for people who aren't willing to dedicate their lives to solving it. I suspect being under 40 years old helps (because lets face it us old folks just aren't as 'smart' as we used to be.) And having the patience of job probably doesn't hurt either. The game has no frills graphics which I like but may be unexciting for those raised on MMOs and fancy gizmos. Overall: There is plenty of fun in it and I would recommend it for anyone who doesn't mind losing. All the time. Where you lose in the game will vary and much of the time it won't seem like you have much control over it. Even if you are great at multitasking and micromanaging the challenges are insurmountable. This is the nature of Rogue's descendents. Even those set in space. Except for the ones that are more 'like-lite' than 'like'.As they say the meaning is in the journey not in the destination so play it and revel in the many fiery deaths you get to experience. Unlocking ships is a mini game that can be fun if you get very lucky. I've managed 4 in 4 years so hey. Advanced edition offers more things to confound, amuse and mystify you. (New races, items, ships, etc)Don't be embarrassed to play on easy and don't forget to look for help because the game is designed to be ultra hard even on the easy mode. (There are people who will need to show their epine by claiming otherwise but ignore them. The truth is you learn in baby steps and die repeatedly, horribly and without mercy. You do get to do pretty mean things to others while doing so, so there is that.)Especially learn what the basics of the game are and then learn the basic 'no nos' because that will get you pretty far. Sector 8 is not hard to get to (though intact may be a different story) once you've managed to get to sector 5 which is not hard to get to once you learn how to get through sectors without being blown randomly. And then you get to learn how to die to the Rebel Flagship. If not in the first battle then in the next or the last. Only the lucky and skillful survive the final battle. I am neither so far.

												Captain's Log, Stardate -309538.54318873666We have just departed the Federation base and the crew is optimistic about our chances, despite the fact that we have literally the entire Rebel fleet just a few light years behind us. We're passing an asteroid field and have decided to investigate it for resources that may aid in our journey. Captain out.And so begins your journey in FTL, where you, a lone ship, needs to cross to the far side of the galaxy to deliver important schematics regarding a superweapon the Rebels have constructed, and which you'll face in combat in the final sector. Sound familiar? It should, because FTL is a game meant to evoke memories of all those times you imagined being a starship captain, and placing you in control of everything from the crew's roles to where power is being allocated.In the grand tradition of Baldur's Gate, the game also features real-time-with-pause, which you'll need to use when everything starts exploding, catching on fire or being boarded by a killer robot. There's a bevy of ships to unlock (many of which bear an uncanny resemblence to famous sci-fi vessels like the SSV Normandy), each of which also has a variant that plays in very different ways, and since the game itself isn't very long, it's been designed for tremendous replay value. And you will get a LOT of that, since it's also punishingly hard, yet generally fair in how it kills youOf course, sometimes the RNG is merciless and you're dead within the first few minutes, but there's something about this game which makes you just want to click New Game again and go for it once more.Beacon destination set. Preparing to jump to light speed. Engage!			",1054,350,41,206,138,15,196

												This game is a FireFly simulator (you haven't watch it?! Begone, vilespawn!). You need to manage resource in a small spaceship on it's journey to impending doom. It seem simple at first, but the first minute you died, you will be angry and want to try again. But yet, you will fail again, many times, and times again. The control, gameplay, balance is crafted to perfection, don't be deceived by the simple graphic (is not pixel base, thank God), the graphic is what you want in this hectic, frenzy, chaotic game. You maybe want to spend just an half an hour, but before you three hours has passed. So be very careful my friend, because this is more than you ever wanted.			",328,81,11,33,26,4,50

												this game is so awesome! it looks simple, but is a hell of fun with great ambience and deeply satisfying if you beat the final flagship, even if it´s frustrating at times (if you die there and did all the way for nothing). but you know which mistake caused your failure and you will click ""start"" soon again, because the challenge makes this game such great fun! try it on easy to learn the well designed mechanics and then take your stand on normal or even hard. the replayability is great since you have 10 different ships, almost all of them coming in 3 layouts, which means many hours of cool gameplay. don´t miss out on that gem, because it´s a 10/10 masterpiece! :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The graphics are 2D and a bit basic, but the gameplay will definitely grasp you from the first minutes.

												FTL is the single most frustrating game that I have ever played and I love it. No two games are ever the same. No matter how hard you try to duplicate that near perfect run, something will happen to make it vastly different from before. I'll just use the setup I killed the Mothership on, what's that? Dead in Sector 1? RAGEQUIT! Only, every time I do 'ragequit' I restart the game. I just can't get away from it. It's gravitational pull is too strong! (Hey look, a space joke. Go me!) FTL is nothing short of a modern day masterpiece. It's one of the very few games that I could listen to a soundtrack of again and again. I will show this game to my children, and they will die. I'm not very good at picking favourites, I have a very changeable personality and bounce around a lot. Saying that, a game would have to be rather incredible to even be considered in the same breath as FTL.			",1315,465,45,230,179,17,254

Posted: July 6, 2016
												Well, I just picked this game up a few days ago during the 2016 Steam Summer sale for 3 bucks. The first time I loaded it up, by the time I stopped I had over 13 hours played. That's how quickly this game hooked me. I just couldn't put it down. It's not possible to better spend 3 dollars!I didn't beat the game until about 19 hours played (on normal difficulty). I pride myself at being well above average at most video games so when this game posed this much of a challenge for me to beat just the one time, I felt a real sense of accomplishment.For new players thinking of getting this game, you have to understand that this game is very difficult. If you don't want to experience the frustration of dying your way through learning the basics repeatedly, you may want to invest the time to read a few guides, pull up the wiki and/or watch a few Youtube videos giving you some pointers and tips. That being said, I personally refrained from reading/watching any guides myself and while things were frustrating at times, learning the game firsthand this way was an extremely rewarding experience. I just know that not all gamers are like me and I'd hate to see someone quit this amazing game prematurely due to the frustration that learning it can cause.The game is not without fault though. While it's difficulty is one of it's primary attractions, it's also one of it's most apparent weaknesses. There are times this game is so punishing that it borders on the unfair.As good as this game is, great even, it requires a fair amount of luck. IMO, this is a fault. It may be better phrased that you have to avoid being unlucky. What I mean by this is, the game hinges on quite a bit of RNG. This RNG can be the difference between you becoming a Space God or you literally being so weak the game becomes unwinnable. Here's what I mean...Now I'll stipulate that this was fairly early on for me and I was very much still learning, but I played one game where I managed to get far enough into the game without being offered anything in the way of weapon upgrades that I literally could not destroy the enemy ships I was fighting against. With the default arsenal you're provided, it was not possible for me to win. I went through three entire sectors (fairly large chunks of the game) looking for a new weapon and found none. This is what I mean by having to avoid being unlucky, because due to the procedural nature of the game, while this is exceptionally uncommon, it's quite possible for the game to simply not give you the tools to actually win, forcing you to start over. Now while I've had my fair share of unlucky runs, this was the only run where I felt there was literally no chance at all for victory.Otherwise, expect this game to be like other procedural games where you'll have really great runs where the game gives you everything and bad runs where you're struggling to stay afloat. This is not in of itself a bad thing as it becomes very fun and FTL pulls it of beautifully. So beautifully that it becomes quite addicting. Starting a brand-new game and not knowing what wonders are in store for you this time or what horrors are bound to beset you and your crew is just an intoxicating experience that will enchant you from start to finish. And while this game will be frustrating at times, starting over from scratch almost immediately washes away any lingering adverse emotions the previous run may have left as you set out again, confident that during this new run, things are going to be different!

												I have never played another game that's been quite as immersive as FTL. If you haven't played it, you might dismiss it as some overly complex 2d strategy game that you'll never get the hang of and quit in frustration. Trust me, it's more than that. You assume the role of captain on your very own starship, which you're able to build on and customize as you go. Sounds easy enough, right? Nope. After travelling through beautiful and randomly generated galaxies with your loyal crew, the soundtrack will permeate your soul and appeal to your adventureous side just a tad too much. You'll make a command blunder and lose part or all of your crew who, by this point, feel like family. You'll be lucky to escape with anyone at all. You'll lie awake at night, kicking yourself for your moment of indescretion. You'll run through all the options that you could have taken but failed to do so. Eventually, you'll come to terms with your grief and return to the game to start over. Maybe things will go better for you this time. In time, you'll become a battle-hardened leader with a strategy and a passion for victory.Being a fan of Star Trek, nothing else has better helped me to feel the pressures and uncertainties faced by Kirk and Picard. This game practically generates Star Trek plots for you to tell your friends (and perhaps embellish the truth to make you look like you knew what you were doing facing those Mantis instead of fleeing). This is my favorite game and it's a true masterpiece. I highly recommend it. ",63,15,0,7,6,0,4

												This is one of my favourite games of all time. It has a lot of replayability, customisation and is very quirky. The art is amazing and detailed with no big flashy graphics. The soundtrack is also really cool and adds to the game. The Glaive Beam is soooooooooooo good, one-shotting a ship is so much fun. There is so much choice on how you play, which can give you better options for the encounters. I'd definitely recommend this game, 12/10. Final note: Giant alien spiders may cause rage quits. I warned you.			",11,3,0,5,3,0,2

												One of the best Rogue-likes I've ever played. The game is short enough that it doesn't feel overwhelming to get through, there are plenty of unlockables to keep it interesting (10 ships with I believe 28 different layouts between them), and it's challenging enough that every victory is very satisfying. The amazing soundtrack and atmosphere of the game is of course also a plus. I think it's worth a lot more than the $10 it's listed at, so if you can catch it on sale it's an absolute must-buy.

												I would highly recommend this to anybody who enjoys a good strategy game. After you learn the basics and all, It can become very, VERY, addicting. The day i bought it i spent 7 hours on it. Overall, Great game IMO. 9/0 would buy again.EDIT: After about another 3 hours, I feel I should add on to the review. The game is difficult and I almost guarantee you will not beat it in your first playthroughs. The goal of the game is to explore different areas of the map as the rebel fleet is chasing you. There are 3 types of the map. Nebulas, Civilian, and Hostile. Nebulas are areas of the map that block out your sensors, disabling you to see in areas of the ship that your crew isn't in. Nebulas will slow down the rebel fleet, but are difficult to traverse. Civilian areas are areas of the map that are mostly poulated by civilians. There are pirates here, so don't be stupid. I find plenty of merchants in this area so it is a good area to restock and repair. Hostile areas are areas mostly controled by hostiles, obviously. You can expect to battle nearly every checkpoint you travel to. Watch your hull, and make sure you repair it whenever you can. I hope this helps. If you have a question either comment on my profile or comment on the review.			",20,2,0,0,2,0,1

												A game that honestly looks pretty confusing, but is actually really easy and fun to pick up. Although the tutorial will have you stumble along as you blindly try to remember what each and every little system and sub-system does, once you get started the game becomes really easy to learn. That is, until you really start getting into it.Although at first you may be finding yourself dominating any ship that comes in your path, because of your beautiful, marvelous, non-AI brain, you'll be quickly fighting ships that, if exercise is not cautioned, will ♥♥♥♥ you up. Easy mode is probably what I'd start on first, since normal might as well be called ""No-forgiveness mode"".Despite the difficulty itself, the events and scenarios that the game will throw at you are varied and hard to avoid. Sometimes you'll have to fly through Nebulas where you're sensors will be effected, thus not allowing you to monitor your whole ship (or the enemies), you may think ""How is it a big deal if I can't see inside some parts of my ship?"" Well, smart guy/girl, if the opposing ship hits your ship, and causes a fire, you won't know where it is unless if you have a crew member in the room where the fire started, -OR- the opposing ship could beam its crew onto your ship, and they can go march about within your ship, tearing it apart from the inside and out, all while you fight an enemy spaceship.Speaking of crew, you start out with three crew members, and can get more at any point in the game. They can man various systems to improve their performance, put out fires, fix broken/destroyed systems, and, with a teleporter, can be beamed on the enemy ship to wreck havoc. I could go on about how great this game is, but in short: Go and buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have yet to find a game as finely balanced as FTL.  370 hours in and I'm still learning new strategies, and still struggling to do well on the game's normal difficulty.  It is rare to find a game that can still surprise me as often as this one does.  Yesterday I had the best ship and crew that I've ever put together, to a point where I was sure I'd breeze through to the end and curbstomp the final ship.  I died hard and fast to a lightweight ship that got the better of me because I decided to turn off my Vulcan canon and teleport over to their ship to finish them off.  I watched my beautiful perfect run fall apart, and saw my ship disintegrate.  My failure was complete.  I started a new game immediately.  I am addicted in the most wonderful way.

												FTL could have been the ultimate bada.s.s. Star Trek game. The game draws inspiration from this franchise but is not a rip-off at all. It has enough style and lore by itself. I'll be brief: graphics are good, music is too (love how themes change when you enter battle mode - it's the same theme only more tense), story is made up by you - a rouge-like experience where no game session is similar. BUT! One word:  gameplay . It is so damn deep and addictive! I loose several hours in a row in it though I don't usually play a video game too long in one session. Battle system is especially awesome. It's of a sheer joy to participate in tactical exchange between two starships: you control systems and subsystems, fix damaged ones, choose the right time to fire different weapons, harass the enemy with combat drones... It feels like gold to break enemy's shields and then cut their hull with laser! FTL got different unique races, augmentations, unlockable ships... Advanced Edition which came out in April of 2014 added to the gameplay a lot - new features, races, updated hud. Hard to believe it was free too. Game is an absolute must-own for sci-fi fans. Everyone else, buy it too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You shouldn't be deterred by the difficulty, once you learn the ropes of the game, you'll spend hours jumping from beacon to beacon, trying to outrun the Rebel fleet. Being tactical about your moves and not taking needless risks will take you consistently to the end of the game. I've clocked in around 10 hours, and I still have a desire to play.

For me it was definitely a satisfying experience - the one when the game pisses you off just enough to think ""I'll show them next time!"" :)It is a rogue like space-captain simulator where you take command of a spaceship with a very important mission that can save the galaxy far far away. You need to upgrade your ships subsystems and be clever about it! Space scrap you gather will only suffice for some upgrades and those define the way you tackle your opponents so.. be smart, be experienced and don't be discouraged by some early failures... The game is worth it :)			",118,40,2,26,8,2,28

												Space fans prepare yourself for another great game! FTL is a 2D, space adventure game where you carry information that is vital for the Federation. Your mission is to survive and travel to the Federation base and pass on the info before you die. On your journey you encounter pirates, rebels, mercernaries, slave traders, shops, and various races of aliens as well as the common humans. You can outfit your ship with different systems and technology that have different uses and provide different strategies. E.g ion weapons disable sytems for a short time, beam weapons damage multiple targets and rockets/bombs ignore shields. Different races have advantages too, so choose ones that suit you, some have exceptional engineering skills, others have better combat skills. All in all, the game is great fun and even if you're not into space games give it a chance. It'll surprise you, you'll be determined to make it to the end and unlock all of the ships. As a bonus it has a free DLC that comes with it so be sure to give it a try. 10 out of 10 would shoot lasers again and also 10 out of 10 would watch Star Wars again. :D			",26,2,0,2,1,0,1

												Human mind can barely understand how something so simple as FTL can still be so ingredibly complex and fun. If you are a fan of science fiction series like Star trek: TNG, Babylon 5, Stargate, etc. You will be addicted right away. You really feel like being a captain of your ship and you have to make decisions with the knowledge you have at a time. Things can really turn upside down just after the next FTL-jump.You can't describe the intense you got while playing this game.Tough sacrifices and narrow escapes of certain death are always part of your journey as you carry on the mission. Worthy experience to anyone who is able to learn from mistakes and won't give up easily.edit: nominated for steam awards 2016.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			",84,20,0,9,11,1,31

												Completing a game of FTL is a satisfying victory I feel every self-respecting person should experience at least once. I thought that after I had beat the game one time, I would be done with it and move on to something else. That was not the case. I had continued to play the game over and over, trying to beat it with every ship and I had found myself even re-using ships I'd already beaten the game with. Simply put, the game has great replay-value.After 100 hours of playing this game, FTL had become one of my all time favorite games. Some compare its gameplay to that of a rougelike, due to an incidental and randomized journey through space and of course: perma-death. However I'd say the game is too unique to be classified under any one genre, but it's definitely an exciting game of strategy and survival.The game can be played at your own pace due to being able to pause and queue up commands at your own leisure, or it can be played as a brutally-challenging action-game that requires quick decisions. Even if you play the game slowly, it's still very difficult. The dastardly nature of the game makes it feel like all odds are against you and the only way to win is through sheer luck, but that is in fact not the case, as an experienced FTL player can beat the game (destroying the Flagship) consistently as long as they are careful and make the right choices. I've even wrote a detailed guide explaining this further.Although the game play is simple in concept, you'll notice it is fairly in-depth. You command a cruiser with up to 8 people on board, ranging from humans to alien bugs to rockmen -- each with their own unique traits and stats; i.e. Rockmen are slow, hard to kill and immune to fire while Humans' unique trait is being ""boring"". When you encounter an enemy cruiser, you must destroy their ship, flee or, when given the opportunity: negotiate. You have an arsenal of offensive options at your disposal such as weapons, drones, or boarding-crew. Additionally you have an entire ship of units to individually control in order to man certain parts of the ship (such as Pilot or Weapons room), repair broken systems, extinguish fires or fight off invaders. At it's simplest level, you're basically just shooting a laser at the enemy's ship until he blows up. At it's most complex level... you're actively using your Cloaking system to dodge enemy missiles, teleporting your crew onto the enemy ship to kill their pilot and disable their shield systems, carefully micromanaging your boarders so they don't die, lining up a salvo of lasers and beam weapons so they hit the enemy ship in rapid succession for maximum effectiveness, moving your engineer to repair one of your systems while you micromanage the blast-doors on your ship to extinguish fires and stop enemy boarders from approaching your weapons room. FTL's game play has a lot of depth and variety.And finally, the aesthetics. The visuals are simple and beautiful, it's got this sort of retro feel to it and everything is crisp and well-designed. The soundtrack is incredible, too, and even after 100 hours I still find myself nodding my head to the music and enjoying the overall atmospheric feel of the soundtrack.So to summarize: the game is amazing, challenging, has a lot of replay value, great aesthetics, and is definitely worth the $10.

												Before you try this game, here are a couple facts regarding FTL:FTL does not like you. FTL does not want to be your friend. FTL would love nothing more than to push you down the stairs and ruin your perfectly good day and kick you when you're trying to get back up, because that's just what FTL does for fun.The game is basically Oregon Trail in space. Except you also have to defend yourself against enemy spaceships shooting at you, and outrun a gigantic rebel army, and decide what to use your limited scrap pieces for, and deal with your sensors being down in this nebula and oh god the fire is spreading to other rooms in my ship but I can't open the air locks because my oxygen system is damaged and the enemy jammed my weapons where did these intruders come from crap did my pilot just die son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ and I was almost at the exit beacon too			",300,99,0,45,15,1,34

												An ever-changing game experience, with random events, numerous hidden storylines, and difficult-to-get unlockables makes the replay value on this game high and mighty. One could spend months, years at a time playing through FTL, and like a snowflake, never run into a repeat. That, coupled with the game's creative and beautiful collection of stories, artwork, and music makes for one of the greatest experiences anyone could hope to witness from even the best of this century's newest games. The undeniable beauty makes the pain of losing bearable... The infinite choices gives you hope that you can avoid it... And the rare but unequaled sensation of self-fulfillment makes it all worth that one extra try. A true masterpiece.			",32,11,0,1,1,0,3

												FTL: Faster than Light is a modern first person shooter set in the pre-historic era. Players team up with familiar faces such as Yoda from Cooking Mama: Hitler's Revenge, Dark Magician Girl from The Eldar Scrools: Minecraft, Kobe Bryant from Sleep Simulator 1966 and Cicero from Octodad: Ninja Warrior to battle against the evil forces of the Australian Government.The main protagonist, Scratch Cat (Voiced by Dwayne Cena), leads his team of up to 7 cultists through Customs and Border Security as they try to free the Jewish slaves from the clutches of the Pharaoh with the help of Mike Tyson and the Duke of Deception whilst saving Christmas and trying to find Wally. The varying enemy types really brighten the song up as they provide the driver with new challenges at each turn. Personally, my favorite boss battle is the very first one against The Dynamic Duo; Sir. Lynch III and Dr. Breen where players are forced to endure being called an embarrassment for a whole month. A few negatives that I have about the game are that there aren't a lot of choices on the menu and the water is too cold. These may be only minor things that may only affect some people but I feel that it is important that I identify these things.Something that I feel I should point out to anyone interested in this recipe is that the PvP aspect of the game can be very challenging and confusing to newcomers of the country. Though being a FPS, the LoL PvP suddenly changes the game into an open world MMORPG where monkeys rule the earth. This sudden change has been reported to give trees cancer and thus, caution should be taken when accessing the PvP feature under the sea.All in all, Fire Emblem: Awakening is a really well developed game with a passionate dev team. The car has great performance, gameplay, visuals and add a dash of salt to seal the deal. I really enjoyed my first lap and I feel as if many other would too. I give Watch Doge: New Vegas a score of 32.33 uh, repeating of course chicken nuggers out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start by addressing some of the complaints about this games such as it being all based on luck and how it lacks content. There is a huge amount, I would even go as far as saying an equal amount of strategy to this game as there is luck. From what you buy, to if you decide to buy anything at all and instead choose to upgrade your ship giving it that extra fire power or hiding behind your many layers of shields. There are so many different ways of playing this game and a large amount of content if you bother to use it. You are able to unlock new ships and new set ups from completing runs and unlocking achievements along the way giving you an insentive to beat the unbeatable. This game is for the people who are prepared to get frustrated, pull out their hair, quit the game and then come back to it the next day with a fresh mindset and with the hunger to get further each time, learning more and more with every click of the start button. I have heard many times that the game is unfair and too one sided, let me just say ""You is mad, cus You is bad"".I think its more than fair to say a large proportion of the game will come down to luck and finding either exactly what you need at a shop/encounter or you finding useless items not worth the jump taken to get there. For me this adds to the challenge and gives the game more depth, without it there would be less need for exploration of a star system and a lack of increasing intensity that you might not find a shop before you run out of fuel or needed items. If you were able to jump to a shop and have the full range of items from the game to choose from then this game would be a breeze. If you land at a shop and find the useless crap we all dread to stumble upon after jumping strategicly to the only shop visible then move on! Discover another shop. There are multiple shops per star system it just takes planning and insightful purchases to easily discover most of the map before moving on. However this game is not all based on random blind luck and any one that tells you so well...... I question their inteligence and so should you. This game has been built for replayability and the challenge that comes with it. Of course if you decide to send you crew down to a planet to help survivors there is a good chance they will not come back..... so dont!. If you rescue a crazy man from a pod or planet DONT take him on board. ""If you avoid risky encounters then you survive risky encounters"". That is a phrase that should be forced upon people when they start up the game. As for the lack of content....... well I have to say that I haven't encountered this as a problem. I understand the feeling of getting to the final boss with an almost perfect ship, defeating him and not being able to help but want to carry on. Surely this in its self proves that the game has been entertaining though. In my eyes if I come to the end of a movie and I am left wanting more then surely that movie was a success and made me feel exactly how it should have. Going back to pure content, I have played this game and have gone through so many runs of it. Obviously I have my favourite set up that I tend to repeat and replicate from time to time to beat the boss or at least see if I can get that far, but there are so many different ways you can play the game. There are so many different set ups to choose from and the thing is.... its all up to you. There was FREE DLC content that added even more if you thought there wasnt enough in the game, but beware it makes it more of a challenge.p.s. Avoid the nebula!			",72,3,2,6,6,0,15

												SPAAAAACE!!! No seriously, this game rocks asteroids. Adventure, micro-management, combat, strategy, everything is as polished as a Naboo Starfighter. There is a real sense of progression and achievement as you conquer increasingly difficult galaxies while building up the strength of your ship and crew. Combat is smart and relies not only on your current build but also on your ability to adapt your tactics to the current situation. FTL being a rogue-like there is also a bit of luck involved, but I didn't find that frustrating as randomness in FTL creates a sense of tension and helplessness that adds a lot to the atmosphere. All in all, FTL is a great game that's easy to understand but challenging to master and you'll enjoy every last bit of it, slugs, zoltans and all!			",95,7,2,1,2,1,19

												FTL where to begin it's one of my favorite games of all time. the thing about it is people complain it's hard because of RNG and other means that can't be controlled. people say it's ""too hard"" or ""i wish there was a Legit save feature"" but IT'S A ROUGE TYPE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HARD THERE ARE ""RUNS"" NOT SAVES MEANING IT'S MEANT FOR A ONE TIME TRY THEN RESTART.(SIDE-NOTE I'm going to guess that if i go to say the binding of isaac area it will be the same thing about the game being hard) for anyone getting ready  to buy this game look at guides play a little before reading guides some of the guides may invalid here soon because of the update coming up but it's worth looking at the guides. (most of the update seems to be more end game content.) but overall i suggest buying FTL but if you don't like dying over and over without hard saves or luck based events than i woould stray away from this game and other rouge types			",92,9,0,10,9,3,1

												One moment your ship is fine the next you have a populated force scanning your crew and you find out that your crew member has commited villany crimes.You will be traveling through space when you stumble across a space pirate who attacks and then surrenders,in return gives you a slave.You can have robots to protect your ship or drones too.You can hire aliens to be part of your crew.You could come too close to a solar flare and your ship starts to burn.Your oxygen room is hit by a laser and then your crew starts to choke.You get a pirate asking you to hand over you crew or they will destroy you.You can choose multiple ships and customize your crew.You can have different ship layouts.Everytime you start a new adventure the place you visit in randomly generated so it is always new.There is so much to do and so much to unlock and it will take ages to explore the adventures you will endure with Faster Than Light.I couldn't recommend enough as even I was scared it was not worth my money and that I could find a better game for my moneys worth.If you like Star Wars,Star Trek,Mass Effect,Halo,Space,Planets,Aliens,Robots,Drones,Space Pirates,Space Ships,Random events,Lots of content,Awesome music,Good Mods,Powerful weapons and anything Sci-fi or anything like I just said then you owe it to yourself to buy this brilliant game.10/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FTL: Faster Than Light – Avanced Edition is a space tactical adventure game. Travel across a series of star systems, surviving friendly or deadly encounters along your way, upgrading your equipment and accomplishing various quests. But time runs short as you are pursued by the rebel fleet, and only by making it to the last system quickly enough do you stand any chance of saving the Federation.Pros: This game has plenty of replayability. You have series of systems to fly through, and in each case a selection of branching paths, making each playthrough different. There is a bunch of accomplishments that unlock alternative ship designs. You can select your crew, depending on your starting ship species, from people you save, make deal for slaves of hire people on space stations, and your crew will get experienced in whatever they are tasked at doing. You have a limited amount of upgrades you can add to your ship, making where you apply these upgrades a critical decision on the type and quantity of equipment you can have and use.Cons: I've said it before, but retro graphics just aren't my thing, and I'll leave it at that. The game doesn't allow you enough time to explore as much as you'd like to, as time is always a factor and you just have so many warp points you can travel to before you're caught up by the enemy fleet. Rooms are all pre-assigned, so you can't chose where to install your systems when you upgrade your ship: there's a pre-determined room in which it goes no matter what your defense strategy in case of boarding may be.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youIf you don't mind the graphics (or even enjoy them) and enjoy a simplified rogue-like challenge, this game may be for you. It's exactly what it's advertising to be, so if the game seems interesting to you, it probably will be.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Cute, little rogue-like spaceship sim game.The role is simple, fly on the other side of galaxy map to warn your fleet about upcoming rebel invasion and it's weaknesses.Flying through 8 sectors, each containing many systems you have to hold on and maintain many encounters of enemies, random events and threats by space phenomena.Given yourself the ship of your choice, you can upgrade and set pretty much anything giving you so large options of Micromanagement. From manning the ship systems with your crew to weapons, shields, drones and ship's energy power distribution. During combats you can also pause the game any moment, thinking and planning your moves ahead which comes handy in most of the chaotic situations.Destroying enemy ships provides you with gear and scrap for which you can buy better stuff in Stores scattered over the space. Not only by simply destroying enemy ships you get victorious, you can also either disable their life support systems or send in the Assault team both resulting in killing the enemy crew, giving you much more rewards.Getting through the game makes you unlock more new ships or their new weapon/system/crew layouts after successfully completing achievements with each of them. Can you save yourself while getting through the space with Rebel fleet chasing your tail making you not to stop for long in each sector?Personally I am not much of a fan of Rogue like games but this one can be hard, fun and still mannageable at once.TL;DR -> 8,5/10, Would buy again.

												One of my favorite games of 2012. With its randomized events and surprisingly deep ship-to-ship combat, somehow it pretty much never gets old. Whether I make it to the end or not, every voyage comes with a story. FTL is one of those games that proves that it's clever and unpredictable gameplay that makes a classic, not fancy graphics.

												Although it beats me every time, I keep coming back for more. A cruel mistress which teases you with possibilities and strikes you down with failure.I absolutely love it. It's like having a wife. You love her cause you bought her, but the spark is gone. You go back for a few rounds because its good while it lasts, however you learn once again that she cannot control her temper. It's OK, you have found a new, young, flirtateous and exciting love (CS:GO).This game is amazing, though. The soundtrack is sick, too. Buy it, steal it, own it, play it.			",30,0,0,0,5,0,7

												FTL (Personally known by me as, 'For The Loss') is a fantastic, yet brutal spaceship management simulator kind of game. Now, let me get this out of the way first:Do NOT let the graphics or any gameplay videos you may have watched put you off or mislead you.It may seem boring, but I assure you, it is anything but boring! I would definitely put it up there with all of the most intense and nail-biting anxiety kind of games out there. Things will go wrong, and it will go, REALLY wrong. I won't spoil some of the awesome, random text based adventure type events you can get thrown into - many which require interesting decisions that could be risky or extremely rewarding. But I will tell you this: AVOID ALL GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS AT ALL COSTS. Another aspect I like about the game is that it forces you to make many morally questioning decisions - and not have the added consequence of facing penalties or filling some kind of renegade-like bar. You could show mercy on a surrendering pirate for a bribe, or just blow it to smitherines and scrounge the extra scrap from their ship. That being a very basic example of what FTL has to offer. The galaxy is in chaos, and there won't be a Jiminy Cricket on your shoulders or any form of Devil's Advocate telling you what to do. While the game can be brutal at times, I love how most of the time, every time you fail and your ship explodes, it is due to you being that little bit extra over-confident. By not visiting every star system possible, by running out of fuel, by not having a good variety of crew member races or even just not upgrading your shields enough etc. Whilst some deaths may be a little unfair (with the rare events of random spawns of four enemy mantises instantly aboard your ship), most are justified.  You will fail a lot; it's taken me around 30 hours to fully complete one game on just EASY difficulty. A full game should only take around 2 hours to complete in the first place. I still must attempt to complete the game on Medium and Hard difficulty, unlock all the other ships in the game, unlock all the achievements, and even try out the recently added Advanced Edition with tons of new content. Unlike some short indie games, FTL has tons of replayability value, while still holding it's unique charm and memorable moments. Now, I don't think I can be bothered talking about everything, as this review is already dragging on, and I'd like you to find out many of the other surprises yourself if you get the game. But I'll just talk about the sound design now, which in my opinion, is AWESOME.There's something strangely satisfying about charging up your lasers, and unleashing hell on a hostile ship. The pew pews could not be better, or any more visually satisfying, unless it was perhaps given a blockbuster budget and directed by Michael Bay, I suppose. The music can also really immerse you into the game, especially in the moments of exploring the systems peacefully, with some really catchy songs thrown in there. I've heard some complaints about the combat music being a bit bland, but I personally quite liked that too. Overall, Kudos soundtrack guy! :D (Ben Prunty). TL:DR: If you love Star Wars/Star Trex/Firefly/Cowboy Bebop/Any space sci-fi series, and always wanted to experience the kind of hardships of running a spaceship and crew successfully through the galaxy. Buy this game.If you enjoy challenging games, which the industry has a huge lack of these days. Buy this game.  If this game happens to be on sale. BUY THIS GAME.I'd give it a solid 9.5/10. :)			",49,5,5,7,10,0,10

												Probably one of the best space themed roguelikes I've played yet. The spaceship battle system is deep and fun to master, but even that it is just a small fraction of every element (random events, races, weapons, planets...) that keeps this charming exploration together. FTL keeps you hooked each time you start a new game and begin your intergalatic journey to deliver a message to the Federation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I get bored with games very easily. However, I have not gotten bored with this one yet. There are so many ships to unlock, achievements to be gotten, and best of all, the game changes each time you play. Many people say this game relies on luck, and it does, but I like that. It means that there is no strategy that is guaranteed to work each time, which makes it harder, but a lot more fun. This is not a game you play twice and win. You can play hundreds of times and might still not win, but it's not the winning that's fun. It's finding that perfect weapon for your build, that teleporter just when you need it, unlocking a new ship. I could go on and on. This is a very hard game, and it's very unforgiving, but winning isn't what makes this game fun. Its the journey.			",32,6,0,3,16,0,5

 Space fighting awesomenessThis is, with no doubt, a game that by far didn't live up to my expectations. It exceeded my expectations, it suprised me in every way, positively. It is a 2D game, but more emmersive than most games I ever played. Battlefield, Bioshock, Arma , Crysis; all top-notch, high end, GPU busting games, FTL communicated the athmosphere to me in the best way. There is a reason you can buy the soundtrack seperatly on Steam, it's in complete synchronisation with the genre of the game. Every run you make in the game is different, every run has got it's good moments, but also moments where you become so annoyed you could smash you keyboard in half. You unlock, discover, and think with this game, it grasps your attention, and doesn't let go untill you finish the run. Add the AE update on top of this all, bringing FREE extra content to the community, and you've got yourself a classic. Try to name games who bring the same kind of content nowaday, and are actually fully caring about the community. I'm extremely satisfied with this game, and it was one of the best purchases I ever made in gaming. It is an experience you don't want to miss. I recommend you spend that 10 euros/dollars, or less when it's on sale, it's worth every single cent. And yes, I'm a fanboy now.			",170,27,3,6,13,0,29

Faster Than Light is a 2D roguelike game set in space, the roguelike genre has been crawling its way back into the spotlight, however it's not common to be set in such environment.You're part of the Galactic Federation that assigned you critical information that you must deliver eight sectors away, to do so you're given a spaceship that you must upgrade and fill with crew... All this, while being chased by the Rebel force, nice setup.Faster Than Light relies heavily in random generated encounters since every time you warp to a location, you have hundreds of possible encounters with multiple outcomes, however this outcomes are sometime random as well, since the answer you gave on one playthrough might not have the same outcome on the next one. Often enough you'll feel the game cheated on you and that the result wasn't fair, however this also makes the game alive and filled with high risk high reward situations.The combat system is pretty straight forward, when your weapons are loaded you can fire, when your enemy has their weapons loaded they can fire back, however you can assign crew members to certain stations, for example to the shield station which will make the shields recharge faster or to the engine station that will help you dodge incoming fire. Even though encounters are important you also have to make decisions inside your ship by choosing your crew members which unlock special encounters solutions but also come with their pros and cons.

												One of my favorite games of 2012. With its randomized events and surprisingly deep ship-to-ship combat, somehow it pretty much never gets old. Whether I make it to the end or not, every voyage comes with a story. FTL is one of those games that proves that it's clever and unpredictable gameplay that makes a classic, not fancy graphics.

Faster Than Light is a 2D roguelike game set in space, the roguelike genre has been crawling its way back into the spotlight, however it's not common to be set in such environment.You're part of the Galactic Federation that assigned you critical information that you must deliver eight sectors away, to do so you're given a spaceship that you must upgrade and fill with crew... All this, while being chased by the Rebel force, nice setup.Faster Than Light relies heavily in random generated encounters since every time you warp to a location, you have hundreds of possible encounters with multiple outcomes, however this outcomes are sometime random as well, since the answer you gave on one playthrough might not have the same outcome on the next one. Often enough you'll feel the game cheated on you and that the result wasn't fair, however this also makes the game alive and filled with high risk high reward situations.The combat system is pretty straight forward, when your weapons are loaded you can fire, when your enemy has their weapons loaded they can fire back, however you can assign crew members to certain stations, for example to the shield station which will make the shields recharge faster or to the engine station that will help you dodge incoming fire. Even though encounters are important you also have to make decisions inside your ship by choosing your crew members which unlock special encounters solutions but also come with their pros and cons. You'll have a whole bunch to choose from the Humans, the Engi, the Mantis, the Rockmen, the Zoltan, the Slugs, The Crystal and finally the Lanius.The art of this game really stands out mainly the soundtrack that is masterfully done setting the perfect atmosphere for a game that leaves you on the edge of your chair, you'll know what I'm talking about once everythings starts going wrong and your entire ship is set ablaze or when you find yourself drifting  in space with no fuel, waiting for friend or foe to approach you with a helping hand or a loaded cannon.However not everythings perfect, even though the game is filled with Quests and Encounters they somewhat lose their essence after some playthroughs when you start seeing them repeat too often with outcomes that you are now aware and can predict most of the time.

This is a long review, so if you just want a quick summary of this game please skip to Results and read from there.Subset Games makes an amazingly epic choose your own adventure space combat game. Similar to a storybook FTL: Faster than Light allows you to choose destinations to approach with each location giving you a dialogue with options explaining events at the chosen location. Campaign:You play as a federation ship whose mission is to fly throughout eight space sectors in order to deliver vital information to federation fleet. The rebels are taking over the entire space system and you must fight tooth and nail to achieve victory. In each system you will run across a variety of different individuals from Pirates, Aliens, Bandits, Slavers, Smugglers, Merchants, and Humanitarians who all trove the galaxy. As the game progresses you build a ship, stock it with a crew, maintain base systems, and complete quests. The end of the game is a three part battle with an monstrous flagship which unless equip can be near impossible. FTL: Faster Than Light is a fun game that’s highly addictive and keeps you wanting to come back for more. The combat is gripping, the constant threat of an oncoming fleet of rebels keeps you moving, and the amazing scenarios make you want not. This fantastic game although great has its limitations and may not be for everyone. FTL is a hard game, even on the easiest difficulty it is no cakewalk. Advanced Edition Content adds new items to the game adding more complexity and difficulty to an already hard enough situation. Gameplay:The game plays rather smoothly. Each “jump” you do acts as a turn and allows for the rebel fleet to progress further through a sector of the galaxy. If you and the rebel fleet cross paths you enter a battle, which if you play your cards right you can escape or even win. There is a steep learners curve, but once you’ve figured out the general game mechanics FTL plays rather easily. You have the ability to pause the game during any battle in order to maneuver troops and properly decide how to place your shots. The game asks you scenarios and the result of them are entirely dumb luck, so be prepared to take chances. For example you may end up trying to communicate with an alien race and get great rewards or an equal possibility is that crew member may die. The battles can be very intense and there can be situations where you are perfectly equip and the luck of where an asteroid lands can completely change a guaranteed victory into a struggling brawl. Difficulty:This game has a lot of luck involved, so about half of the difficulty in this game is the luck and not the skill. Although this may seem to make the game look bad, it offers variability that many games do not. You will be on your toes not just because of the difficulty from the actual skill of the game, but also because anything can happen and in one foul swoop you’re ship and crew will be gone. If you want examples of why please comment as I have many examples where I have lost because of luck, but don’t worry I also have lots of why I have lost because of skill as well haha. Hints:1) Make sure you visit every possible point you can for each sector, fight off as many enemies as possible because every piece of scrap matters and you will need it all if you want to win.2) Make sure you take advantage of your crew, the longer they man a station the more efficient they become at it.3) It’s a good idea to have a crew member in every station that placing one in can provide a benefit to your ship. 4) The mind control device is probably one of the best ways to distract an enemy ship’s crew and help easily destroy the ships interior. 5) The enemy ships will always have weapons of equal charge time charged before you.6) The best way to give yourself first shot advantage is the cloaking field, it is worth saving up for.7) The Flagship has four guns, the best way to defeat it is to defeat the crewmember manning each gun.8) In my opinion the best way to defeat the flagship is with as many flak cannons as you can get (and possibly a missle that teleports itself), the cloaking field, and mind control. This will allow you to control a crew member of the enemy ship, go invisible while you recharge your weapons, and garantee you hit through the flagships shields. 9) If you kill every person in the flagship an AI takes over which is a lot harder than if you just leave someone alive (try and kill everyone except one person that way you can use them with your mind control). Results:FTL is an amazing game, but it’s not for everyone. The graphics are not top of the line and the difficulty level is high enough to make you want to strangle someone. FTL offers so fantastic fights that really keep you on the edge of your seat coupled with fantastic variety making each play through feel like a new game. If you quit a game it will create a save, but you can only load that save one time meaning that if you die you must start over. I recommend FTL, and would even recommend paying full price, but if get this on a sale it is definitely a steam-steal. Pros:+Amazing depth and variety throughout the campaign+Option to play with or without advanced edition content+Loads of different weapons to choose from+Quests and distress signals to keep you invested in each sector+Choose your own path so you can preemptively target your gameplay.+Epic space battles that focus on managing both the interior and exterior of a ship. +Many different ship designs, but good luck getting them unless you plan to invest several hundred hours into this game. +Different sector types that offer different combat and elements. Cons:-The choice results are random, there are a lot of take your chance situations.-The battles can be decided by dumb luck rather than skill.-The final boss battle (the flagship) is rediculously difficult. [for advice check the hints section]-FTL has a lack of resolution settings and in windowed mode it looks like is barely 1024x768 and does not allow you to make it larger.			",331,44,5,40,30,0,70

												Let me just start this review by saying that you can't go wrong with an indie game like this one. GraphicsEvery single one of these elements will not be altered by mods, I'll leave that for my mods segemnt towards the end of this review. The graphics of FTL are simple yet extravagent, the game itself is simple, the UI is easy to understand and learn, and the different backgrounds/planets and stars all have their unique characteristics and look absolutely lovely. This game is simplistic, so I can't really take points off of it for having simple textures, it's meant to be that way. GameplayOkay so first off this is a difficult lil game to learn in it's own respects, you have to master the art of pressing the spacebar (pause) before and after every show you take, and every shot your opponent takes. If you don't, well you'll end up losing crew members (which some crew members could take the entire length of the adventure to level up, and a loss like that is devestating to your progress). The best tip I can give you is to prepare to press the number keys (for your weapon systems) and the spacebar (for pausing the game) quite often as that will help you plan your strategy of attack a lot easier than not doing so in the first place. Obviously, I didn't pay attention to the tips or numbers above every panel in the game so it took me a while to realize I could use hotkeys, which made the game a lot more difficult than it should've been for me when first starting to play.  StoryThis game doesn't have much of a story, you're the captain of your own warship that gets sent on a mission to find a stronghold. Along the way you encounter ships and planets/asteroid fields and even colonies that try to brutally murder you and your crew within mere seconds of jumping into orbit. Your objective is to get to the end, with a powerful crew, upgraded subsystems and the weaponry to destroy the final boss (which is really, really difficult if you're unprepared). Overall it's an adventurious lil game and very, very addicting. You'll be racing to speedrun and beat highscores for hours if you get lucky enough to find good weapons along your journey. Mod SupportFinally right? This is one of the most amazing parts of FTL as literally every part of this game can be altered through modifications that the developers even asked the community to make. From the story, where you can make finite decisions, endless journies and even completely different campaigns and stories such as Infinite Space. To the graphic overhauls where you get new backgrounds and visual elements from mods like Better Backgrounds and Planets to a mod like Crew Diversity that allows you to have multiple crew members with different visual looks and personalities. Here's the list of all working mods at this very moment, I recommend starting off with Captain's Edition and seeing how you like it from there, as the base game was stupendous but the mods make it into a gem of an adventure.  SummarySo in total, I've spent countless hours on this game and on experiencing the diffrent ways of playing through it, although the Infinite Space mod has no real ending other than you either becoming so overpowered that you literally cannot die, or you dying within your first two sectors, it's still lovely. I'd recommend that you buy this game because it's an adventure, it's a simple pleasure and it's enjoyable yet addictive. For a cheap pricetag, I managed to snag it for $2 through a steam sale a few years back. Obviously worth it, since I put so many hours into it and so much time into this review. Go buy it, it's worth it. Overall, a solid 9/10 from my perspective, if you were able to learn the UI elements more simply (before the tutorial was introduced, because that's when I started playing. Yes, all the way back in 2013, I believe) and able to learn how to maneuver through combat, then I'd give it a perfect 10/10.			",65,6,0,6,5,0,2

												Faster Than Light is one of my favourite games on Steam.The premise of the game is that you are a memeber of ""The Federation"" and you have valuable information against a group of Rebels which have fragmented The Federation in a war. You and your crew jumps from Beacon to Beacon, from sector to sector, until you reach the 8th - and last sector, where you fight the rebel Flagship.The game plays well, with there being many different options to suit your playstyle. There are atleast 6 species of the Galaxy that can join your crew, ranging from Mantis Insectoids to Crystal men. There are many upgrades that allow you to improve you ships firepower and overall stats - some of which are upgrades for how much power your Reactor and sytems take in and can hold.FTL can be very unforgiving, however it is relatively fair in how it throws you into situations. Many times it's a product of your own doing. Except for the Space Spiders. Never trust the space spiders.Combat consists of your crew powering up the weapons systems and then targeting parts of the enemy ship. It is very satisfying and is executed excellently. It is fun to play and very strategic (hint: press Spacebar to pause, you'll need it) whilst being easy to access for new players. Hitting systems can cause a variety of things that will turn the odds in your favour. The enemies can also do these things to you too, so it can screw you over too. There are sometimes options for you to let your enemies live, in exchange for goods. You can choose to take this offer and show mercy, or kill them. These are ""events"" and happen throughout the game. Events help you to gather scrap and get special upgrades and ships. These were rather well done and are very high quality, with a huge amount of variety between them.I think this is a must have. FTL is very satisfying, with a huge a amount of replayability. There is a vast amount of content, and there is even more to come with FTL: Advanced Edition which is free to any Faster Than Light owner.			",340,41,1,21,16,1,23

												What an awesome game!When you start it for the first time it's a little confusing, you don't know what the systems do, what you tripulation is good for, what the best upgrades are and how to spend your money smartly.Your first 2 to 3 hours will be spend learning all this, and dying, you will die alright, you will die a thousand times in a thousand different ways.You´ll get so close to finishing the game, and you´ll scream every time the final boss will destroy you for a very small miscaculation.Finally after putting more than 20 hours I can finish the game most times I try, and every time is different and challenging, everytime I unlock new ships and things to do.I recommend starting with the regular edition and getting to the special edition features after the first time you can finish the game.In short, the game is super well designed, dying in space has never been so fun!

I came very close to winning after maybe a dozen runs.  What's fascinating is how you can find more and more layers to the tactics of combat as your progress.

												I would say that of all the indie roguelikes out there, this by one of the best. A fantastic, unforgiving strategy game, FTL excels in every category.The art direction is instantly appealing and solely responsible for making the universe feel like one.It is very easy to learn, but you'll have many of hours ahead of you if you want to overcome this beast. Even though it can seem at times that it is merely based only on chance, resource management and your approach are a large factor into how far you will make itThe real thrill comes from not devastating an enemy ship, but from barely getting out of tough scrapes where you had to order your crew back and forth between repairing the life support system, manning the weapons, opening airlocks to fan out fires, and fending off boarding parties on the bridge.And the music. It adds so much to the game. Without it it wouldn't be FTL.Definitely worth full price.			",472,132,6,82,66,1,109

												It's 2016 and you definitely could see let's plays and other reviews of this game, so I'll leave the boring details out.This is the kind of game that makes you start it on a Sunday evening at 11 P.M. to play it for 15 minues. The thing is, 15 minutes later it's 7 A.M. and you're late to work.The gameplay is fantastic and the replay value is nigh infinite.The soundtrack is a masterpiece, it fits the game's theme fantastically and creates powerful mood of lonely space exploration. It's almost romantic.The only problem I can think of is incorrect naming of difficulty levels. They're not Easy, Normal, Hard, but Hard, Very Hard and Almost Impossible respectively. You will rage quit a lot at first, but then you'll start loving the way it hurts.tl;dr: I haven't enjoyed a game as much since my childhood.			",116,21,1,13,7,1,15

												FTL is an entertaining, very replayable and murderously RNG-dependent roguelike-like. Good for space captain fantasies, even if you will likely be violently disabused of them.You control a Federation spaceship transporting intelligence that must make its way through sectors of space being chased by the Rebel fleet, for the intel points out their fleet's weaknesses. This plot is lightly described yet more than serviceable - more on this later.Gameplay consists of turn-based jumping between FTL beacons and fighting enemies in pausable real-time combat involving charging and aiming weapons & drones, and/or deploying your own crew to board or defend against boarders. Ship systems and additional items can be bought & upgraded using scrap metal, which can be found or salvaged from defeated enemies.You must also manage your fuel supply, as well as missile and drone supplies if you use either of them. If your ship's hull takes enough damage, or your crewmembers die, your game's over.Sometimes, multiple-choice events happen - they don't change between playthroughs with the exception of different choices being unlocked with upgraded systems or crewmembers of different species. You might come to remember some of the right choices after encountering them multiple times, but the Advanced Edition seems to add enough events that this isn't as big an issue.You can also unlock quite a variety of ships between playthroughs, some of which are better than others, but most of which provide new and interesting playstyles.While you have a lot of variety between upgrades, offensive and defensive strategies to choose from, apart from your starting equipment you are quite simply more dependent on random chance than usual for a game like this. This is compounded by the fact that on difficulties above Easy, you receive less resources and the game generates tougher enemies (in exchange for increased score of course). You can and will go from doing pretty well to barely limping along in the space of one jump. The difficulty wouldn't be so bad if you had more of a guarantee of receiving the tools to deal with or run away from it if you need to.Which is to say nothing of the final boss. It's grossly overpowered and pretty unfair even for a roguelike-like, especially when you never found enough resources to upgrade your systems enough to even stand a chance - or never got the chance to use them to upgrade in the first place because you were taking so much damage. To say nothing of how it turns FTL's metagame on its head with how different the final fight is.The fact is, with the flagship you need to pursue certain upgrades and ship strategies much more than others, unless you pick one of the most powerful ships, and/or go overkill or are lucky enough with other strategies. With all of this in mind, new players should therefore start on Easy - while I can respect its presence, it's kind of baffling why people thought the game needed a Hard mode in addition to Normal.I think there's a little bit of a bright side to the difficulty, though. FTL is not only a quite fun and quite polished game, but a quite involving game, and if you become involved it makes the near-deaths and actual deaths that much more intense. On that note, you can re-name your ship and its crewmembers, and giving them personalized names only adds to the immersion. The touch of the plot is light to allow the players to fill in the gaps with their imagination, and experience their own space adventures. This isn't as much of an advantage when you simply want to win, however.At least the devs' handling of the Advanced Edition is stellar. It features additional content in almost every area, including events written by Chris Avellone of Fallout fame, and you can even turn the additional content off for the vanilla experience.Of mention is the mod community. The official forums are host to an easy-to-use mod installation tool, and many user-created mods that you can pick & choose from. They range from minor event/cosmetic additions to new ships to entire new campaigns, and can greatly extend the life of the game. Just make sure you're on top of your game and mod updates.If you like your spaceships and your roguelike-likes, pick this up - and the soundtrack is great too - but be prepared to die and die again.

												This is what makes up a good game. The strategy involved and the amount of times you will be defeated will give you a sense of satisfied frusteration. You will be proud of yourself for making the right moves, one after another. Then let the frusteration set in when you make that one mistake, die, and have to begin all over again.

												It's 2016 and you definitely could see let's plays and other reviews of this game, so I'll leave the boring details out.This is the kind of game that makes you start it on a Sunday evening at 11 P.M. to play it for 15 minues. The thing is, 15 minutes later it's 7 A.M. and you're late to work.The gameplay is fantastic and the replay value is nigh infinite.The soundtrack is a masterpiece, it fits the game's theme fantastically and creates powerful mood of lonely space exploration. It's almost romantic.The only problem I can think of is incorrect naming of difficulty levels. They're not Easy, Normal, Hard, but Hard, Very Hard and Almost Impossible respectively. You will rage quit a lot at first, but then you'll start loving the way it hurts.tl;dr: I haven't enjoyed a game as much since my childhood.			",116,21,1,13,7,1,15

Laconic Review: FTL: Faster Than Light is a perfect recipe for an addictive game. Its deceptive simplicity is betrayed by the room for strategy and tactics. This coupled with its rapid difficulty climb makes it absolutely engrossing. Its replayability is unquestionably high thanks to the game’s heavy use of RNG and its Oregon Trail-esque scenarios which can make a particular run easy or end it then and there. The game creates a retro vibe with its charming pixel art style and a very fitting soundtrack that definitely deserves to be sold on its own.9/10P.S. NEVER SEND IN CREW TO HELP WITH GIANT ALIEN SPIDERS IT NEVER  WORKS OUTFull Review:  FTL: Faster Than Light is another edition to the ever growing rogue-lite genre. Affectionately reffered to as “Oregon Trail in Space,” FTL is about making your way across a galaxy to deliver vital information about enemy rebels to The Federation. Along this trip you must equip yourself with weapons, fight enemy ships, and make Oregon Trail esque decision that can either lead to great rewards or have your best crew member be eaten by a giant alien spiders.The combat in FTL can be described as “semi-turn based.” Weapons require time to charge up before firing, however different weapons take different amounts of time to charge making it so weapons go off at set intervals but not strictly in turns. You can also target specific systems of the enemy ship to fire on in order to minimize damage taken and maximize damage dealt. For example, a common tactic is to use missiles, which ignore shields, to take out the shield system so that you may use your rapid fire laser weapons to take out their weapon system.There are 4 different weapon types: Laser, Beam, Missile, and Ion, each which have their own merits and disadvantages allowing a wide array of strategy to be used. However arming yourself and manfighting any ship that comes your way isn’t your only option. Along your trip in FTL you will come across stores which can sell you new crew members, weapons, ship augments, and ship systems for scrap you collect by defeating ships or as rewards for random scenarios. One possible system you can arm yourself with is a Drone Control system, which allows you to let drone AI do all the fighting for you while you can just focus on defense. Another system you can get is the Crew Teleport system which you use to send your most combat effective crewmembers onto the enemy ship. This allows you to defeat the enemy without destroying the ship which yields more scrap and has a chance to get you a new weapon, drone schematic, or ship augment.As this is a rogue-lite game, FTL makes extensive use of RNG. For example, you must make your way through 8 “sectors,” each sector has a procedurally generated star map with around 20 beacons each. The content and pattern of the beacons vary wildly with the only real guarantee being that you can make it from the starting point to the exit beacon that takes you to the next sector. Moreover, sectors are randomly made into one of three types, hostile, civilian, and nebula, each with their own race specific subtype. The sector type determines what is sold in stores, the likelihood of certain outcomes for scenarios, the types of enemies you face, and sector exclusive scenarios. While you can only go through 8 sectors in the game, the map will you give you multiple paths to choose from so you are not at the total mercy of RNG.FTL further elaborates its rogue-lite elements with its replayability. In fact the only overall progress possible in this game is unlocking new ships to start with. You unlock these ships by getting achievements, completing specific quests, and beating the game repeatedly. However the achievements required to unlock ships are seldom easy. The quests needed to unlock ships usually require you to make a few specific decisions across multiple scenarios while praying that RNG is with you. Not only that, beating the game is very difficult, as you advance across sectors enemy ships become better equipped to the point that making it to Sector 8 is a feat on its own. Then there’s what awaits at Sector 8, the Rebel Flagship, an enemy so strong it makes all other before it seem like shieldless auto-scouts.FTL has an almost retro feel thanks to its pixel art graphics. While not necessarily impressive, it works. It’s the closest thing FTL has as a weak point but in a way that only serves as a deterrent for those who wouldn’t be able to enjoy the gameplay to begin with. The graphics are complimented with the atmospheric chiptune soundrack. A soundtrack which definitely deserves to be sold on its own.Personally, I have a strong affinity towards roguelike and rogue-lite games and FTL is no exception. The way that doing the same thing in certain scenarios doesn’t always yield the same result across playthroughs can be both exciting and incredibly frustrating. Likewise the placement of stores and the frequency of difficult enemies can make me want to destroy my computer. But that’s just part of the challenge and what makes this game addictive. But remember, never try to send in crew to help with giant alien spiders			",75,17,0,10,18,0,13

												FTL... Where do I start? Let me get this off my chest right off the bat: This game is going to kick your♥♥♥♥♥ Even on it's ""Easy"" mode, it took me multiple runs through the game before I even made it to the last sector. It took me countless more runs to finally defeat the boss, and let me tell you, the first time you defeat the enemy flagship it is immensely gratifying.Everything about this game is fun. The combat mechanics and how you manage your ship is very clever, and you have to be constantly vigilant in a fight, lest your enemy get in that fatal hit on you. In a lot of the text-based encounters, there's a risk-vs-reward factor, where going in and say, investigating an abandoned space station might net you some extra scrap metal, but you might also lose your best Pilot in the process. The variety in ships you use and of those you can encounter is aplenty, and any number of different playstyles can be used with varying degrees of success.The little things about it are great too: there's just enough background information to hold the plot together, while also leaving lots to your imagination. The graphic style is quite charming, and every note of the soundtrack works perfectly in tandem with what's going on in the game.All in all, a great little indie title, for a very reasonable price. 9/10			",43,10,0,5,2,0,1

★★★★★One of the best games I've played in the last 10 years. Though I don't like Star Trek, I can see how fans of those series can totally dig this. I don't play ithe game as often as it encourages you to, but I do still listen to de amazing soundtrack almost daily. It's a great mix of action, micromanaging, exploration and (ad-hoc) planning. It's deep, engaging, interesting, rewarding but also punishing. This game made a footprint in the gaming industry as you can see the rogue-like aspects (and the managing) everywhere nowadays.It's worth every cent it's asking, no matter if it is the mobile version or the Steam version.

												This cruel rougelike will test you to your very limits. A small mistake will cost you big here, although there are many things you cannot control. A lot of this game has RNG aspects, causing some very frustrating situations (I'm looking at you, giant alien spiders!). This game is insanely difficult, and there is no doubt that all players have raged at some point. There are many difficult situations to be made at times. An example of this is what to spend your precious scrap on. A single mistake can cost you big time, and can often result in the death of a crewmember or a loss entirely.In spite of this, this game is a blast to play, and it is very satisfying to hear the sound of a hull breach in an enemy ship or to destroy a ship. There are many different alien races that all have different advantages and disadvantages to them. For example, Rockmen have increased health but move much more slowly. There are many different ships that can be unlocked, with entirely different play styles.I have passed 20 hours of playtime at the time of writing, yet I've barely scratched the surface of this outstanding game. Unless you get angry REALLY easily, it would be idiotic not to pick up this game NOW.			",92,15,0,10,10,0,4

												Addictive and fun to play, FTL is the space roguelike that will have you desperatley struggling time and time again to complete it. Along the way you can unlock different ship layouts, recruit different races with different stats, but different weapons and upgrade different parts of your ship and, well every game will be different is what I'm trying to say! Very enjoyable and not very expensive, definitely worth a look if you are interested.			",237,90,3,34,19,3,37

												Random generation of the maps allow for nearly infite replayability. To me this is what games should be, solid game mechanics on top of flexible levels allowing you to play what makes the game fun over and over. At times you can feel invincible tearing through easy encouters, only to make a bad warp and have your game crumble in front of you. Other times you'll feel like you're barely outrunning the rebel menace and finding salvation through a lucky jump to some great ship parts. This game is not for people who like to know what is always coming, but I personally love how it always leaves me questioning if I am making the right decision. Buy this game if you like strategic thinking in an uncertain world.			",75,11,0,10,27,0,28

												A game where you click enemy ships to slowly murder them until you can make a second layer of shields from slowly murdered ships. If you successfully murder enough enemy ships, you will get the exclusive priveledge of getting stomped by one huge ship that ♥♥♥♥♥ on the rules you encounter up to that point and does whatever it wants.BUT, if you murder ships in the most efficient way possible, select the right sentences when needed, effectively utilize murdered ship pieces and know everything the big ship will throw at you, you can MAYBE even get a chance of stomping the big ship back... until it ""gets away"" when ""destroyed"" only to come back two more times and stomp you anyway.Yes, the game is a mouse-driven RNG based rouge-like with a bit of a learning curve and a surprising amount of depth.It does involve a Dark Souls amount of death, and there is never a guarantee that you will win. But a lot of the RNG can be manipulated with enough skill and knowledge.Very effective time waster. I never really understood why people like The Binding of Isaac until I got into this.

												I highly recommend FTL. It's a game that you can save and quite within a few minutes notice, but when you come back you are immidiatly immersed in the game play. I could barely believe I had already played over 7 hrs of it. as a bus rider, I like a game that is highly entertaing and deep, but can be saved at a moments notice so I can jum off the bus. Aditionally the permanance of death in this game makes the stakes super high. It is upsetting to loose crew members you have been working with for a long period of time, which is a testiment to how it emotionally bring you into the world of FTL.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An exclent statagy game with extremely high replayability its extremely hard untill you have at least 20+ hr in the game. Then you start unlocking cool ships and geting better runs through the star system. Practice and time is required to be invested in the game to really be good. Overall a nice paced game and well made with one of the best sound tracks I have ever heard. 9.5/10			",59,4,0,8,18,0,14

												Nonserious review: OH GOD EVERYTHING IS BURNING PLEASE HELP ME OH GOD THE OXYGEN IS GONE WAIT DON'T BLOW US UP PLE- *explosions form a 9/10*Serious review = the rest of thisFTL is a space ship game in which you are the captain of a space ship trying to save the galaxy (universe?) from the Rebels, as you are playing the Federation. It is an extremely brutal game, which is good, because while excessive brutality is bad, I'd rather have that then have excessive hand-holding. As a review would do, pros and cons and neutrals will come next.PROS:Extreme difficulty, but not unfair difficulty. This game is very, very, VERY hard to actually win, in fact, in 26 hours, I have only won ONE TIME. Most of the times you lose, it is because you forgot to do something essential, such as repair the doors, put out the fire in the oxygen room before letting out all of the oxygen to put out the other fires, putting out fires, upgrading, etceteraA plethora (wow, who uses that word anymore?) of weapons. You got good weapons, bad weapons, pew pew weapons, BWEEE weapons, PCHEW weapons, VWABABA weapons, and more (in order, good weapons, bad weapons, laser weapons, beam weapons, explosive weapons, teleporting weapons)All the replayability ever. I can 100% guarantee that you will NEVER play the same run twice. Sometimes you'll get the GLAIVE BEAM OF DEATH, sometimes you will get the basic laser of OH GOD WE CAN'T PENETRATE THEIR SHIELDS, and sometimes you'll get both of them and then you can actually do somethingSo many unlockables. There are I believe 10 or 11 ships, maybe only 8, I really don't remember. Every ship has 3 types of that ship you can unlock except for 1 or 2 of them, plus they all have 2 ways of unlocking them, except for 3 of them, and one of them is one you start withMusic. The music is absolutely amazing. That is allNEUTRALSThere are noneNEGATIVESUuuuuuuuuuuuh... I can't think of any. And that is a good thing!All in all, this game is amazing and addictive, and I give it a 9/10. Why not a 10/10 even though I couldn't think of any negatives? BECAUSE THE GAME REFUSES TO GIVE ME THE GLAIVE BEAM! OH GOD GAME NO I'M SORRY FOR YELLING PLEASE NO DON'T SET THE OXYGEN SUPPLY ON FIRE OH GOD IS THAT A MANTIS BOMBER I'M SORR-			",80,17,0,12,16,1,7

												I've put a bout 60 hours into the game, but I think it has a fatal flaw. Randomness is the single greatest factor in if you can actually win a run. I get that its a roguelike, and as such it has some amount of RNG to it, but it feels like RNG is the biggest thing that determines if you live or die. Sometimes the game shops won't spawn weapons/upgrades strong enough to defeat the final boss. Other times the enemy ships evade all your attacks and you can't dodge a single shot. Sometimes events give you scrap(money that you can buy ship upgrades with), and other times they kill a crew member, damage your ship, or have some other detrimental effect. The number of runs in this game that I've had where it feels like I was sunk from the beginning, where the tools to beat the game just didn't exist, is too high. RNG needs to be toned down in the game.			",94,7,1,12,8,0,24

												FTL Is an all around awesome game. Simple, easy to lear gameplay mechanings, a really well designed and extremly thought out UI, combat system, and over-all game mechanincs make this one super easy to pick up, and tons of fun to really tweak and master. The soundtrack is fantastic, the graphics are clean and look nice without having to have a gaming rig.  Not a big install, and overall the game seems well polished without any bugs. Don't be afraid to play this game more than once, or more than a few dozen or hundred times. And don't be afraid to love every single one of those runs, because they will all be different, and more importantly, they will all be fun. Each time you play again. If this were in an arcade, it would be the game we all sink our quarters into a few rounds, every single time we go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Work in ProgressThis review is incomplete. I will update/finish it when I find the time.This is currently my favorite offline game. Anytime my usual addictions are unavailable, I always head straight for FTL and tackle another playthrough. This game is easily worth the $10 USD price tag, if not more. The recent expansion pack only adds to this value, and I almost feel guilty for not paying for so much content. It could have easily been a $5 DLC. FTL is a roguelite space simulation game developed by Subset Games. It features perma-death, realtime strategy with the ability to pause and give orders, randomized level design, and nearly endless replay value.Starting off with the tutorial, you'll get a quick briefing of the plot and objective, followed by a rundown of the UI. After jumping to the next location, you'll find your first battle which offers some helpful tips like using missiles to take out enemy shield systems. After combat, upgrade your ships reactor and weapon system and you're all set. The whole tutorial takes about 5 minutes. If you can't be bothered with 5 minutes, skip it. You can mouse-over just about everything for detailed tooltips at any point in the game.My biggest, and only notable, gripe with this game is that it doesn't support Steam Achievements. I find this very odd since it has it's own in-game achievements not recognized by Steam.			",151,22,2,20,14,3,51

												Faster Than Light is a space semi-rouglike where you pilot a ship through space and micromanage the crew and systems onboard while trying to fight off enemies that will not stop until you're a pile of smoldering space-scrap.  It has a huge amount of hype behind it, and it is mostly well deserved.  The music is superb, the gameplay is fun and it's quite a charming game overall.  I would recommend picking it up, especially on sale - it hits $2.50 at times, and it is easily worth that.FTL has awesome, addictive gameplay with a high amount of replayability; however, while it may seem infinite at first, it really begins to seem like you've seen everything the game has to offer after a few play sessions.  Games take awhile, and, while random, there isn't really that big of a pool of things that can happen to you out in deep space.  While there may be minor variances, it mostly boils down to: Warp into a place, oh no! there's a spaceship here, fight it, warp to the next sector.  Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, but after 4 or 5 runs, you can kind of expect what's going to happen in a future game.To combat this, there are many different unlockable ships, all of which provide different ways to play, but that said, you really don't have much motivation to go unlock those after you've dumped a couple hours into it.Pros:SoundtrackFun gameplayInteresting mechanicsCons:Not a very large pool of random things that can happen (wears out fast)Games take a long timeIt's a little disappointing to me, especially since the game was so hyped in my circles, but that's alright, it's still a really solid game and, as I said, it comes cheap.  Pick it up on a sale, but until then don't worry about missing anything too important - it's fun and random, but you won't be playing it forever. B			",711,211,14,90,55,8,86

												Best indie game I've ever played.  Crisp gameplay, well-thought out (and executed) mechanics - highly challenging, highly replayable, highly entertaining.  I've bought several copies for friends - it has been on sale quite frequently, so make sure you add it to your wishlist!Added bonus: The newly-released DLC is free(!!!!).  In an time where big studios demand $15+ for content that expands the scope of the game less than 1%, this is a breath of fresh air.  Consider me a loyal Subset Games customer from here on out!

So many ships, weapons, enemies, encounters, and tactics!!!It's only gotten better since the extra content has been added.This is one of those games that you can get so many awesome experiences out of, but unfortunately only other FTL players will know your plight. Graphic design, mechanics, and the MUSIC are also great. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to any and all. So long as you have patience. :)			",83,10,0,15,2,0,3

The engie ship currently my fave does have a gun that does damage but it has drones that shoot at the ship while your ion cannon disables defences.

												FTL is an amazing game. The strategy involved is wonderful, and as you never know what you will get on any given run, (like any roguelike) you have to adapt on the fly. This game will kill you. A lot. It is not for the faint of heart, or light of patience. But that first time you beat the game with a ship feels like absolute Nirvana.The systems are wonderful, from cloaking to shields, you have to carefully plan what you will upgrade or purchase, but they give so much diversity in what you can do to win. Hack an enemy's Oxygen and watch their crew slowly suffocate. Blast them to pieces after a jump with rockets and lasers using a preigniter. Destroy their med bay, and teleport on board with giant space insects to butcher their crew. Activate cloaking to avoid a barrage of missiles and lasers. Light their ship on fire with fire bombs and cackle maniacally as they burn.All things aside, this is a great game to burn a few (hundred) hours on. Buy it. Do it now.			",57,8,0,13,4,0,6

I have also saved the galaxy and the Federation, with my veteran crew on my glorious ship ""The Timbit""In all seriousness though, FTL is a fun space rogue-like that lets you commandeer a crew and help them survive in space to accomplish their mission, and each subsequent play-through will be memorable. Either you brilliantly navigate to the final boss and defeat the flagship with the bare minimum resources and whoop with joy. Or you may fume as you watch your ship perish, either in battle or to some other absurdity of the universe. This game is random, but it makes winning so much more interesting. Accept failed runs, and figure out the good choices that maximize your success chance on subsequent ones.The hard as nails comparison can be drawn similarly to games like Binding Of Isaac. Not for the faint of heart or impatient.Edit: I played FTL offline a lot on a laptop, so excuse my hours. Also the Advanced Edition adds substantial new content, (New Alien race, A new Ship, more upgrades and gear, galaxies, etc.).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, at the onset it's not exactly a game I thought I'd enjoy. However, at the time of publishing this review I have logged somewhere in the neighborhood of 430 hours...because it is so infinitely variable and simple (yet as strategic and complex as a randomly generated game can be!) I've unlocked *all* of the damnable quests, lost crew members that actually had developed skills to horrible infestations of giant spiders (a quest you can, of course, opt out of pursuing...but where's the fun in that?) Probably not quite what the developers had in mind when they made it, but...FTL is my go-to game when I have time constraints (i.e. kids needing to go to school in half an hour, or dinner to make, et cetera) because I can pretty much always walk away but pick up where I left off without having to overthink a next move.Also...ALWAYS explore when given the option. You can always repair your silly ship later if it doesn't pan out. And crew is expendible, after all. Just don't sell out to the stupid slavers, ever! ",5,2,0,2,2,0,2

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a beauty. With an aura of adventure and strategy so other games cannot have, this is one of my favorite games. The game's balancing is excellent. The unlockable ships are not more powerful than the starter ship; it all depends on skill and play strategies. This game can weed out the unfit by having them rage quit because of the game's difficulty, but those who are in that crowd-myself included- can enter the Easy Mode which is less of a challenge. The permadeath experience causes you to mourn a crewmember's loss in two ways more than most games; Not only do you care about them, like in most games, but you also rebuke yourself for your foolishness if it is your fault and begin freaking out a bit when your ship starts failing. And the fealing of panic is spot-on. If there's a hull breach, then another, then six fires, you start panicking. This leads me to the excellent feature of the pause button. You can plan your attacks, repairs, and defenses. For those players who want more of a hardcore experience, you can test your skills without a pause button. The risks of death in random events are high, making you want to take part in less; this is a good feature as well. The overall experience of the game makes this incredible. The satisfaction of unlocking a new ship is incredible. The difficulty of a fire or a hull breach in your ship makes the experience even better. The difficulty and yet rewards in boarding parties is amazing as well. Everything in this game can be decided by a single variable in anything. If you have enemy boarders on your Engi ship, you're a bit screwed, but if the enemy has Human crew and you attack them with the Mantis, there is a lot less struggle. This game... Is incredible.

												Faster Than Light is a must-have for tactical genre fans, and also those who likes the terms ""crew management"" and ""spaceship management"".In FTL, you are a runaway Galactic Federation ship carrying critical information that must escape the evil Rebels and reach the allied Federation fleet some sectors away.It features a top-down view, and battles are fought in real-time but can be paused using spacebar, to issue orders analyze the situation.You can upgrade the ship's modules using scrap acquired from destroying or capturing enemy ships, as well rewards from random events that happens once you arrive at a new point in space.There's shops in which you can buy equipment, crew, fuel and ammunition.The crew management is simple: there are ship consoles for each ship system module, and a console manned by one of your crew provides bonus to it's module - 25% in shields regeneration, for instance.Different races have different traits. For example: while the Humans are generic (blah, HUmans), the Mantis have a nice bonus on Close Quarters Combat - the ultimate boarders.During the battles, you can choose which room of the enemy ship your weapons should hit. Weapons vary from lasers to different kinds of missiles, bombs, cannons and also drones with different uses (repair, defense, attack, etc).Late in the game you can also equip yourself with Teleport and Cloaking modules, enabling you to invade and eliminate the enemy ship's crew using the teleport, and render yourself invisible for a few seconds using the cloak, being invulnerable to enemy targeting.And don't forget about the subsystems: Sensors, Medbay and your Doors!Leaving them broken will let your enemy run around freely inside your ship, enabling them do destroy your Oxygen system to suffocate your crew into Permadeath (yes - crew Permadeath and savegame Permadeath)!9/10, the only thing FTL doesn't provide is a continous-play mode (aka sandbox), but that doesn't affect the amazing piece of gaming art the developers delivered at all.

Yet, don't be fooled with that, sometimes the backdrops are pretty good looking.The music of this game is pretty awesome too, from slow, calm songs to stuff that quickly escalates when you're in the middle of a fight. The sound effects are simple, and it's quite easy to recognize different mechanisms or weapons. The gameplay revolves mostly around micromanaging and strategy. Your weapons, your crew, your bots, they are mostly controlled by you. And sometimes, it's hard to take control of them during the heat of the battle. You also gotta plan your route carefully. Risky, but with a high chance of getting useful stuff? Or not risking it, but being unprepared in the face of danger when a raider ship demands your stuff? But when you get used to it, and you do it smoothly, it feels good, man. The difficulty of this game is truly remarkable. Everything wants you dead. Everything can go wrong. Is there something that can go wrong? Well, it's going to go wrong for you. You try to help people just to get backstabbed by raiders, you send your people to help and one of your crew dies to a spider attack or a plague, or you want to trade just to get yourself killed and looted. What's that? You don't want to help anybody? That's pretty good, but the game will find a way to ♥♥♥♥ you up, somehow. Like spawning a huge battleship that's way more equipped than you are, ripping you apart before you manage to escape. .....And this is on easy difficulty. This game is truly amazing, and I'd go as far as to say that it is an essential steam title. It's quite cheap, too. And after 40+ hours of gameplay, I've only reached the final boss twice. So, it's probably going to give you a lot to do.			",432,92,18,35,33,4,27

												FTL is the game that filled that special space niche I was itching for. I had like five other space games on my steam's wishlist, but took them all off after I got this game.  I promise you this will be the best $10 you've spent 2012.			",141,34,1,8,8,1,25

												During the weekend of PAX 2012 I got drunk and flew an RC helicopter into a friend's monitor, scratching the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of it. I've since replaced that monitor at my own expense, but gained a memorable story and a threat I can live up to. When my friend Carl recommended FTL, I was incredibly skeptical. So skeptical, in fact, that I threatened to fly a helicopter into his stupid face. He understood the risks and held his conviction that this game is worth the $10. It was $9 at the time, but whatever, sue me over a dollar, I'll fly a helicopter into you and your lawyer. Six hours into this game and it's now safe to say Carl's stupid face will not greet my four rotary blades of destruction. This game is deceptively challenging and more importantly, deep. In my first four fledgeling hours, I was able to kill my crew and strand them in space without even trying. Now, I know how to keep them and my ship alive through all the randomized sectors and I have fun doing it.			",269,59,3,27,21,3,34

												Rogue-likes: the randomized frontier.FTL's randomness makes for some incredibly entertaining gameplay as you attempt to make the most of your trip from one side of the galaxy to the other to save the Federation, all while being chased by looming, innumerable rebel forces.You will extermish pirates to varying degrees of glee and bitterness. You will guide that lost civilian to their destination, find out it was a rebel trap, and smile. You will relish every victory.You will have to sell that Burst Laser III so you can upgrade your engines. You will open that Mantis escape pod because you are desperate for someone who can board ships. You will lose the last bit of your ship's HP to an unfortunately timed missle. Failing to make it to the end of a roughly 6-hour playthrough is what makes your victories significant.FTL is visually very simple, a hallmark of its indie production, but as much as it could benefit from a bigger-than-1280x800 resolution or perhaps even 3D graphics, I love how I can run it on my integrated graphics laptop.FTL is a tremendous value and important landmark in the history of crowdfunded games. Were I to wake up in an alternate universe where I had yet to create a Steam account, I would buy FTL again, for around three incarnations, anyway.			",51,8,0,10,5,0,8

												A Roguelike!  In Space!  With Lasers!  And catchy music that doesn't ingratiate!  ProTip:  If a pirate gives you the option to choose your death, don't pick oxygen.  Unless, you've got some hardcore weaponry you'll probably die before you can destroy him.  Take your chances and pick something else instead.  You'll probably still die though.

												I was really astonished by the sheer amount of quality this game delivers for the amount of money that I put down. It reminded me of the good old times, that I would reach out for a game in the heavily discounted bin and discover a gem. So what kind of game is Faster Than Light?Faster than light is a management game set in space. The game starts you off with your own spaceship and crew. You will unlock more spaceships and layouts of those spaceships while completing challenges and winning the game. When you start the game you are immediately informed about your mission. You are part of the federation fleet and you have crucial information which needs to be delivered to the main fleet. The problem is, rebels are chasing you down to make sure you are not able to relay your crucial information to your fleet. Thus begins the challenge, you need to explore as much as you can without falling in the hands of the rebels. The places you can visit are marked on your map. Every point has lines attached to them which indicate where you can access that area from. It is very important that you strategically choose you destinations in order to explore as much as possible without falling in the hands of the rebels. Every time you travel the rebels will come closer to you. The amount of things that you can do and find in this game is astonishing. While exploring you will encounter shops, people in need, enemies and other kinds of encounters. If you complete them, you can gain resources like: scrap metal, drone parts, fuel, crew members, missiles and sometimes even upgrades for your spaceship. These resources are vitally important because you are going to need them in order to defeat the final boss.  You will be managing your ship in a fight by: placing crew members in rooms that you want to see operated, dividing your energy over multiple spaceship systems and closing and opening doors. The rooms that are present in your spaceship are the: medical bay, shield generator, engine, pilot room, camera’s, co2 room, weapons room and more. Some of these rooms need power where others do not. You can increase the effectiveness of these rooms by: upgrading the rooms with scrap metal, allocating more power to them and placing crew members in them. Your crew members will gain experience by working in these rooms which will make the rooms more effective. For example an upgraded crew member in the weapons room will give you an increased reload speed. Each crew member has its own merits, for example humans will learn faster but some alien races will give power to a room or fight more effectively. You can find these alien crew members in shops or in encounters( some spaceships start with different alien races). Besides the rooms that you can upgrade, you can also invest in weapons, drones, systems and augmentations which will help you.Weapons have different kinds of effects ranging from setting rooms on fire to temporarily disabling systems and of course dealing damage to the hull of the ship.  Most weapons will only deplete energy but some use missiles which you only have a limited amount of.  Drones will also deplete a resource named, drone parts. Drones come in different versions such as  defensive drones, attacking drones and hacking drones. In order to destroy your opponent you must deplete your enemies hull integrity to zero. In some instances you can avoid an fight by giving up resources or making a deal with the enemy. If you feel outgunned you can always warp away with your spaceship after a set time has expired.  Enemies can also try to warp away if they are damaged enough. you can however stop the warp by damaging systems that are needed for the warp.Combat in this game is further enhanced by the addition of environmental effects. Some places you visit have ION fields or sun flares which will disable space ship systems or effect the maximum amount of energy you can use. Systems  grant additional options  such as hacking, mind control and cloaking which makes this game more interesting and engaging. Passive boosts can also be found and are called augmentations. The visuals suite the atmosphere of the game quite well.  What really stands out though is the amazing soundtrack! The music is extremely mesmerizing and really fits the theme of the game. I cannot stress you enough to at least check it out on Youtube or even better, buy it from steam.If I have to discuss a negative aspect of the game, it would be the RNG. The game randomly generates enemies and random encounters which can screw you over big time. Some of these situations can be avoided however by knowing what the possible negative effects are of the responses you give. This does not change the fact however, that there are situations where it’s  better to start over instead of trying to reach the end. In conclusion I really recommend checking this game out.  +  a lot of content/options and strategies+ graphics fit the theme well + beautiful soundtrack! + gameplay does not get stale( for me at least)+ system requirements are low-	RNG can be aggravating at times.

												Another roguelike that is extremely punishing. But it's fun to see how far you can take your ridiculously disabled ship. Eventually you get good enough to win consistently....and then you look at your playtime and realize you played over a hundred hours. Time spent enjoying my crew's misfortune is time well spent though.Lost my entire crew when I accidentally blew up the enemy ship with everyone aboard it. 10/10 would explode again.

												FTL is a great indie strategy game with awesome and well thought out game mechanics. This game can be pretty challenging at times, but it is very rewarding. Plus, it’s always new and unpredictable due to the randomly generated levels. This game could use a little extra content to spice things up because after about five hours of gameplay, you've probably experienced almost everything there is to see. Overall, I give FTL an 8/10.

												That's exactly the game I've been looking for.You select a spaceship and go into the deepest space. You manage the crew and fight with other spaceships. You'll be able to upgrade different systems like shields, engine, oxygen, weapons etc. Also there're subsystems like doors, sensors. For example, you can upgrade your doors so fire from one room won't get into another. That's really helpful, because there'll be a lot of explosions which will cause fire.While playing you gotta care about fuel and the condition of your spacecraft. If it's broken - the game ends.The best idea about this game for me is that YOU control every system and every single person from your crew you have on board. It's much more interesting this way.I strongly recommend to you buy this game if you prefer to think and not thoughtlessly shoot everything that comes in your sight. Buy it anyway.10/10!

												It's not often that a strategy game takes my interest, but when this turned up in a Humble Bundle (which I bought because of Bastion, Limbo and FEZ) it blew my mind away. I had heard of FTL of course and had seen it in the Steam Store, but it never received a second glance from me because the main image for FTL looks so boring! Just look at it for a second; about twenty orange ships moving lazily across a planet. There's no sign of speed or that they're going Faster Than Light, and it gives nothing away about what the game is all about.Maybe that's a good thing, because the game is bloody brilliant! You are the controller of a nameable vessel and you have information about the rebel fleet that is rapidly persuing you. Your ship has to travel through each area, making special Faster Than Light jumps between special beacon nodes. When you arrive at a beacon an event will take place, such as a battle, a trade or negotiations, where you choose wheather you will attack the ship, try to hide or even bring an alien crewmember on board. During a battle there's lots to do, which means a lot of work around the ship for your crewmembers (also nameable, although you'll probably get sad when one you named after your friend snuffs it). There are shields, weapons, drones, medbays and a reactor to power them all.The soundtrack is lovely, as with a lot of indie games. When you enter a battle, the music for the current galaxy gets more intense, and will have you whistling all day long. The great thing about the gameplay is that it can be paused at any time, even in the middle of a battle, so you can plan your next move. This is a great little aspect of the game, because it makes you feel like everything's happening at once and you have to choose your compromise, because this game is HARD. There are times when you feel like a pro and times when you wish you hadn't provoked the enemy, or wish that you hadn't destroyed a ship while your crew were still on board. A standard game of FTL: Faster Than Light can take about an hour and a half, and no two plays are the same. Give it a go!			",163,34,4,19,17,4,9

												FTL: Faster Than Light is the charming indie game you’ve never heard about. Or if you have heard about it, count your lucky stars. FTL has the feel of an instant classic and brings back everything you love about old games: humble yet lovely graphics, whimsical music, satisfying gameplay, and a dash of storytelling.In FTL, you play a sole ship escaping to the safety of the Federation. Since the game is a space strategy game (see roguelike), you will be using your wits to survive lest you be blasted into animated space debris. If you like strategy games, or even open-ended RPGs, you cannot go wrong with FTL. As long as you can appreciate the retro graphics, the game will reward you with surprising depth and atmosphere. Space. It’s awesome.Gameplay is where FTL delivers and micromanaging your ship is just as fluid as piloting a Nesasio Stealth Cruiser. You can open and close doors to prevent intruders or fire, send your crew to repair vital systems (or face certain death), toggle the power to your shields, and so on. A variety of ship upgrades and crew selection create choices that actually matter to the player. Outfitting your ship is complex and can be the difference between making it to the next solar system or not. Ship battles are extremely satisfying. At first, I would fire my weapons as soon as they became available. It wasn’t until my fourth run that I learned to time my lasers to break through defenses. That’s how FTL is — learning the layers of gameplay. It might seem a bit daunting at first, but the charming atmosphere will lure you in and you will be pleasantly surprised as you learn more and more.I doubt I’m the only one to have Malcolm Reynolds pilot my ship and Tali’Zorah as my trusty engineer. It’s easy to become attached to your crew, made up of certain species with their own advantages and disadvantages. Which makes it that much harder when you accidentally send them into room with the airlock open (sorry!). The playable races range from quick-repairing Engi, vicious Mantis, to well-rounded, of course, Humans. While the actual story of the game is light, the lack never detracts from the feel of the adventure. Since the solar map is randomly generated, your crew will face different dangers each play through. Still, the scenarios will eventually be familiar and may even become monotonous. But by then, you’ve already had too much fun to care.As for the music, it is nothing short of a retro masterpiece. The soundtrack is even sold on Steam. Bleeps and bloops bring out the charming space atmosphere and will play in your head even when you’re not playing the game. Rarely has a soundtrack fitted a game as perfectly as in FTL.Unlockables provide substantial replay value. New ships are the main rewards and each ship has a different playstyle. The Slug Cruiser relies on taking out the enemy crew and the Zoltan Cruiser has the protection of a unique shield. A slight drawback to the game is a lack of DLC, which is weird to say since many games suffer from too much DLC.You will die. You will die a lot. The “Normal” mode should really be called Death. Yet even when losing FTL is satisfying and not many games can pull that off. You have a sense of “maybe if I did this next time, things will go smoother” and space runs are quick enough that you won’t regret starting over. Do you have a hipster friend who tells you games are too easy these days? Yeah, right. FTL, enough said.So like most strategy games, the most satisfying part is using a mix of brains and luck to overcome a particularly difficult situation. FTL is a master of creating those scenarios. Your ship will be on its last leg, limping just ahead of the Rebels with your crew fighting Rockmen while slowly suffocating from lack of oxygen. Oh, and your ship is on fire. What will you do? Whatever you have to do to survive.Tip: Never fight alien spiders. Never!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have perished to living batteries, giant mantises, rock-solid golems, telepathic orange space slugs, synthetic cyborgs,  giant space spiders, pirates, rebels, slavers, traders, merchants, madmen, asteroids, disease, solar flares, missiles, drones, lasers, oxygen-sucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and living crystals. I have also saved the galaxy and the Federation, with my veteran crew on my glorious ship ""The Timbit""In all seriousness though, FTL is a fun space rogue-like that lets you commandeer a crew and help them survive in space to accomplish their mission, and each subsequent play-through will be memorable. Either you brilliantly navigate to the final boss and defeat the flagship with the bare minimum resources and whoop with joy. Or you may fume as you watch your ship perish, either in battle or to some other absurdity of the universe. This game is random, but it makes winning so much more interesting. Accept failed runs, and figure out the good choices that maximize your success chance on subsequent ones.The hard as nails comparison can be drawn similarly to games like Binding Of Isaac. Not for the faint of heart or impatient.Edit: I played FTL offline a lot on a laptop, so excuse my hours. Also the Advanced Edition adds substantial new content, (New Alien race, A new Ship, more upgrades and gear, galaxies, etc.).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is fantastic. A bit of a challenge but utterly brilliant! I for one love this game. Each ship you unlock is just amazing. Not one is better than the other, but they all have different playstyles. Like Kestrel is a Shoot em up Ship that relies on Guns and more guns. The engie ship currently my fave does have a gun that does damage but it has drones that shoot at the ship while your ion cannon disables defences. This game has a remarkable amount of brain testing and it is good to play and a good challenge to pass the time 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Restart #112, finally got some luck and a good crew going. Hit the 4th area and feeling like I am finally going to beat this game.  Next encounter, Mantis board my ship and blow up my oxygen generator and half my systems. I finally blow up there ship and kill the boarding party. Sadly my oxygen is depleting fast. I send my crew to repair but it's too late, everyone is slowly suffocating to death and I don't get it repaired in time....#$&@*$*@Restart #113. First and second area cleared and moving to third, need fuel badly. Run out of fuel and get attacked by some pirates. I beam my boarding party on to their ship and start attacking internally, I clear most of the enemies but I've been focusing on the boarding party to much and when I look over at my ship I see it's mostly a ball of fire. I finish taking the enemy ship and beam my crew back but the teleporter room is on fire and my crew dies before I can get them out. They were still hurt from the fight before.....I still have my pilot on board so I open my external doors and vent out all the oxygen to get the fire out, Ok fire is out but I forget the fact that my pilot needs oxygen to live...and the oxygen generator is down.....Restart #114Best Rogue like I have ever played.

You will micromanage your crew, adjust powersupply to your various systems, fend off boarding parties, put out fires,... while desperately waiting for your FTL-Drive to charge. Always one jump ahead of the rebel fleet pursuing you and permadeath (no save and load beside a save and quit) waiting in the next sector.			",49,40,2,23,40,0,21

In FTL, you play as a member of the Federaceion racers, and duke it out with the evil ""Red-Bulls""TM on your way to defeat the tremendous ""Red-Bull Fastship""TM.

												FTL is a roguelike strategy game. Anyone even remotely interested in either genre is certain to enjoy it. The game is quite challenging and has quite a lot of replay value, as the levels change for each playthrough. I oringally had little interest in this game because I am not generally a fan of sci-fi, but it turned out to be one of my favourite games of all time. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Paladin's Review: FTL: Faster Than Light. The Creator of Its Own Genre for A Reason.Genre: 2D Strategy Sci-Fi Rogue-Like. Developed & Published by: Subset GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile.Business Model: Base Game + Free ExpansionCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsI had seen this game get featured in various articles before its release and I'll admit that I kind of let this game slip under my radar until after release. Since this happened, I've been working on ways of preventing this from happening in the future. But I digress. After seeing what the game was about post-launch, I was interested in picking the game up very soon though lack of funds prevented me from getting the game initially. Thankfully, a good friend of mine gifted me the game. FTL: Faster Than Light is a rogue-like, real-time spaceship simulator. In FTL, you must fly your spaceship through hostile space, fight pirates, make diplomatic decisions, and avoid losing your entire crew and/or ship to the cold blackness of space. This game has you flying through various sectors of space collection equipment and scrap (currency) to improve the ship as well as meeting new races and seeing new regions of space. All the while, you must outrun the Rebel fleet that is trying to catch you before you reach the waiting Federation fleet. The Story and Gameplay.You're the captain of a starship for the Federation fleet that is being pursued by the overwhelming Rebel fleet. Why? Because you've learned important tactical information on how to defeat the Rebel fleet. You must deliver this information through a harrowing gauntlet of star systems and planets, avoiding overwhelming danger and surviving the odds. There are eight very dangerous sectors of space before you arrive at the Federation's Last Stand. There are up to four different paths you can take in each sector where a randomly generated situation will either benefit or debilitate your situation. After surviving the eight sectors, you'll join up with the Federation fleet to take on the invading Rebel fleet. At which point you must attack the Flagship of the Rebels directly while the Federation fleet attacks the Rebel fleet itself. Its game over if your ship or crew die at any point. For the most part, your choices have immediate consequences which will build up over time and may lead to success or failure. There are only a couple of choices you can make that will affect anything in the long-term. Generally, there are the prerequisites to acquiring new cruisers.Each new cruiser you acquire is built and balanced differently from each other to fit a certain play-style. Some are better at stealth, some have better offensive weapons and some are better at taking over the enemy ship or removing all of the crew members. Each cruiser also comes with a B-layout that changes what crew, weapons and modules are included on your ship as well as the color of the ship. There is a great variety of ships for FTL, its just unlocking them can take a long time. When starting the game you get to choose the ship, the layout, the name of the ship and the name of your initial crew, as well as which gender your Human crew are. You can also choose the difficulty setting easy or normal. However, I think they mislabeled these and its more like hard and insane. Not that its a bad thing, but ""normal"" is not as easy as you would think in most games. Once you've done all this, your ready to start out on your adventure through the stars. You can choose which planet you get to jump to from the galaxy map. Just keep in mind that every jump you make means that the rebels come that much closer to catching up to you. Even if they do, you can fight them off. Its generally not recommended because the only reward you'll get for beating them is one unit of fuel and no scrap. Scrap is the currency you use to repair your ship, buy new weapons and other miscellaneous items.While the main story may not be that strong, the real story is the journey you take in this harsh universe. Will you lose most of your crew in a freak accident only to survive all the way to the last sector on a wish and a prayer? Or will you escape from a sun's solar flare only to jump into an asteroid field and watch as your ship gets ripped apart by the asteroids and the nearby pirate's lasers? Or do you send your crew down to a randomly planet's distress call only to lose some of them as they are attacked by rebel forces? The story is played out with a lot of different text screens as you jump from one place in the galaxy map to the next. You'll encounter many different races, each with their own set of needs and personalities which you'll then have to decide what's best for your ship's continued survival. That's the fun with games like this is that you get to create the story in your head as you go along. It happened more than once that I would say ""ENGAGE"" at my monitor as my ship escaped a brutal battle or mourned over the loss of a comrade who bravely defended invading forces from taking over the ship. So, while the base story might not be much, its what you create from the universe that will really engage your interest in the game.Advanced Edition ThoughtsFTL: Advanced Edition fleshes everything about the game out, it's that simple. The new alien race adds a new mechanic where they suck the air out of the room they are in. There's new ships as well. It also comes with more music, weapons, encounters to overcome and UI enhancements to boot. It's a free expansion so no reason not to enjoy it. It can be disabled if you're wanting the vanilla FTL experience. PC SettingsFTL's settings are a bit lacking. You only have a few options to control the size of the game on your screen. Those included are: windowed mode, full-screen (stretched), full-screen (black borders) and full-screen (FTL's native resolution) which is not your monitor's resolution. You also have no control over key bindings, though the default keys are pretty smartly placed. There are also a bunch of other minor settings you can enable or disable to your liking and you can see in the screenshot above. Overall, my biggest criticism of the settings choices would be the lack of resolution options as I'm not a bit fan of the current ones but they should work well enough for you. The game also features a good tutorial to get you up to speed on how to play. There is also a Stats screen which contains your best performance and achievements for each ship you've flown. The game is well polished as far as being free from any bugs or crashing problems are concerned. Final ThoughtsFTL is a fantastic game and I don't think I'm saying anything new there. There's plenty of content and challenge, as I got 30 hours out of it. Though the RNG can easily ruin a run and I'd classify it as overly harsh, but there's something to enjoy every run. It's one of the few games that genuinely gives the feeling of being a starship captain. If your looking for a starship simulator that is an enjoyable, simple, and well crafted experience, then give FTL: Faster Than Light a look. This became my Game of the Year in 2012.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,57

												I have heard quite a lot about this game prior to getting it myself (thank you Humble Bundle!). However I was not prepared for such a mind-blowing experience. I was captivated for over 20 hours, leaving the screen only to pee or grab something to bite. And something like that did not happen to me for a LOOOONG time. But you may ask what is the game about. Basically you get a space ship, crew and some weapons to start with. From then you write the story yourself. Do you feel like a badass? Name your captain Mal Reynolds and fly your Serenity through the space to warn the Federation about the Rebel fleet attack (oh wait, something is not right here) or maybe you want to fly your own Enterprise. Everything is up to you.But first you need to get over the simplistic graphics. These are rather functional, but come with an advantage of leaving a lot up to your own imagination, which may serve you better than anything drawn by ""A"" class designers in the end. So what are you waiting for? Hurry up on your own boundless space adventure. It does not matter whether you prefer Cpt. Reynolds or Cpt. Kirk, FTL: Faster Than Light has it all!

												This next-gen game should be the first thing on your christmas list. In this revolutionary take on sci-fi racing games, you speed alongside fellow spacemen in an attempt to break the universal speed record. In FTL, you play as a member of the Federaceion racers, and duke it out with the evil ""Red-Bulls""TM on your way to defeat the tremendous ""Red-Bull Fastship""TM. With an immense number of levels and a wonderfully designed AI opposition, you could say this game made my heart beat faster than light.			",163,15,2,17,23,2,23

												This game is glorious, but can be difficult and punishing. On your first play, your ship is probably going to be destroyed, your entire crew is going to die, and you just don't know how you are supposed to survive the harsh realities of intergalactic space travel.Be sure to do easy mode the first few play-throughs while you figure how it works. Normal difficulty is really hard and you will probably starve for resources somewhere around sector five or six.I initially thought this game did not have much replayability, but I was wrong. Playing with the different ships and configurations can be a real challenge and encourages different play styles.			",164,26,1,6,8,0,15

												Such a simple concept, yet, such a complex gameplay. This game is one of the most addicting indie games I have played in a long time. Makes you feel like if you are actually a space captain. I couldnt recommend this game more. Although it is pretty hard and unforgiven in many cases but heck, the fun of the game is losing believe it or not.9 out 10 Must own			",110,13,1,13,3,1,11

Ludicrious Speed.Faster Than Light = Roguelike + Spaceships - SpaceflightIn a space capsule (sci-fi analogy for ""nut shell""), FTL is a roguelike space crew simulator.  If that sentence appealed to you at all, go ahead and buy the game with zero regrets.A typical gameplay session consists of picking a jump point to go to and getting into a battle scenario and/or dangerous space phenomenon/multiple choice scenario.  Battles focus on using your ships strengths most effectively to destroy or disable the enemy ship.  You assign power to your various systems (Shields, Drones, Weapons, Engines, Cloak, etc) and during a very difficult battle it becomes a very tense balacning act.  Luckily you can pause the game at any time to weigh your options.  You also run into phenomenon such as solar flares and meteor storms that pose a threat to your ship.  To make matters worse, these encounters typically coincide with an enemy attack.  You also run into decision-making scenarios that can either help or harm your ship and crew.  Should you send crew to that planet surface to fend off an attack of alien spiders?  There will be a reward if you succeed, but you might lose a crew member in the process.  During these scenarios, if you possess a specific type of crew or system it can give you an additional choice amongst the options that greatly tilt the outcome in your favor.Prepare yourself for frustration though.  Having a good run typically means that you were able to stockpile large amounts of scrap and run into the right merchants at the right time selling exactly the right things.  Some ship types are particularly hindered if you aren't able to expand their capabilities in specific ways to offset their inherent weaknesses.You will tractor beam this game because: You are a roguelike addict. You like the idea of micromanaging a ship's crew and various systems. You enjoy highly tactical battles. You are sometimes a glutton for punishment.You will blow this game out the airlock because: You hate roguelikes and randomization. You hate micromanagement. You crave action-based combat. You don't want to play a game that will sometimes frustrate you.The Bottom LineFTL is a very inventive game that simultanesouly scratches the roguelike and hard sci-fi itch.  It is also at times a very difficult or even unfair game, but if you like your roguelikes then this won't dissuade you.  As a bonus, the game also has a great musical score that fits the theme perfectly.This is a must buy for me.  I would also love to see a sequel that expands the core formula by placing it into a open-universe setting rather than a linear branching path progression.			",146,39,2,20,9,1,16

												-crew killed by pirates-crew killed by fire-crew killed by asphyxiation-crew killed by asphyxiation again-crew killed by asphyxiation yet again-crew killed by asphyxiati... HOLY S%&!... this is hard (that's what she said)all in all fun, the visuals of the game actually remind me of a little game called Bik A Space Adventure; however that is where the similarities stop. This game is incredibly difficult and is one of the few games you should not be ashamed to play on easy. The concept is that you basically run a space ship that is carrying important information for The Federation/Universal gov thingy ,,, besides the point, the idea is that you cross various sectors of galaxies with your crew fighting space pirates, various aliens, rebels, etc... On your journey you will die a lot, and if you think ""oh I'll only die a few times"" or ""couldn't be that bad"" YOU ARE WRONG! You will die repeatedly in bizzare ways and other ways that make you believe that there is some malevolent god laughing at your feable attempts. However this should not diture casuals such as myself away from this game; it may be difficult, yet is still a blast for those less ""rouge like"" inclined because dying is half the fun and most of the battle. Any who I reccomend to pick this bad boy up on sale and join me in the serial  killer like process of almost systematically sufficating your crew.Best asphxyation sim out there 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This highly addictive spaceship- and crewmanagement simulation puts you in a spaceship captain's seat. Your goal is to deliver vital information to Federation's HQ passing eight more or less hostile sectors. You will micromanage your crew, adjust powersupply to your various systems, fend off boarding parties, put out fires,... while desperately waiting for your FTL-Drive to charge. Always one jump ahead of the rebel fleet pursuing you and permadeath (no save and load beside a save and quit) waiting in the next sector.			",49,40,2,23,40,0,21

												FTL is a roguelike strategy game. Anyone even remotely interested in either genre is certain to enjoy it. The game is quite challenging and has quite a lot of replay value, as the levels change for each playthrough. I oringally had little interest in this game because I am not generally a fan of sci-fi, but it turned out to be one of my favourite games of all time. Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I cannot recommend this game enough. With the hundreds of randomly generated encounters and the constant stress of possible permadeath constantly looming over your head, you're going to play this game 100 times over. A lot of hard to unlock content and for everything you unlock a second version to unlock. The replayability of this game is enormous because it's never the same game twice. Pick this up and lose your soul for a while. Its really worth it.			",93,16,2,27,9,0,10

A Paladin's Review: FTL: Faster Than Light. The Creator of Its Own Genre for A Reason.Genre: 2D Strategy Sci-Fi Rogue-Like. Developed & Published by: Subset GamesPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux and Mobile.Business Model: Base Game + Free ExpansionCopy Gifted By A Friend Read the full and unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsI had seen this game get featured in various articles before its release and I'll admit that I kind of let this game slip under my radar until after release. Since this happened, I've been working on ways of preventing this from happening in the future. But I digress. After seeing what the game was about post-launch, I was interested in picking the game up very soon though lack of funds prevented me from getting the game initially. Thankfully, a good friend of mine gifted me the game. FTL: Faster Than Light is a rogue-like, real-time spaceship simulator. In FTL, you must fly your spaceship through hostile space, fight pirates, make diplomatic decisions, and avoid losing your entire crew and/or ship to the cold blackness of space. This game has you flying through various sectors of space collection equipment and scrap (currency) to improve the ship as well as meeting new races and seeing new regions of space. All the while, you must outrun the Rebel fleet that is trying to catch you before you reach the waiting Federation fleet. The Story and Gameplay.You're the captain of a starship for the Federation fleet that is being pursued by the overwhelming Rebel fleet. Why? Because you've learned important tactical information on how to defeat the Rebel fleet. You must deliver this information through a harrowing gauntlet of star systems and planets, avoiding overwhelming danger and surviving the odds. There are eight very dangerous sectors of space before you arrive at the Federation's Last Stand. There are up to four different paths you can take in each sector where a randomly generated situation will either benefit or debilitate your situation. After surviving the eight sectors, you'll join up with the Federation fleet to take on the invading Rebel fleet. At which point you must attack the Flagship of the Rebels directly while the Federation fleet attacks the Rebel fleet itself. Its game over if your ship or crew die at any point. For the most part, your choices have immediate consequences which will build up over time and may lead to success or failure. There are only a couple of choices you can make that will affect anything in the long-term. Generally, there are the prerequisites to acquiring new cruisers.Each new cruiser you acquire is built and balanced differently from each other to fit a certain play-style. Some are better at stealth, some have better offensive weapons and some are better at taking over the enemy ship or removing all of the crew members. Each cruiser also comes with a B-layout that changes what crew, weapons and modules are included on your ship as well as the color of the ship. There is a great variety of ships for FTL, its just unlocking them can take a long time. When starting the game you get to choose the ship, the layout, the name of the ship and the name of your initial crew, as well as which gender your Human crew are. You can also choose the difficulty setting easy or normal. However, I think they mislabeled these and its more like hard and insane. Not that its a bad thing, but ""normal"" is not as easy as you would think in most games. Once you've done all this, your ready to start out on your adventure through the stars. You can choose which planet you get to jump to from the galaxy map. Just keep in mind that every jump you make means that the rebels come that much closer to catching up to you. Even if they do, you can fight them off. Its generally not recommended because the only reward you'll get for beating them is one unit of fuel and no scrap. Scrap is the currency you use to repair your ship, buy new weapons and other miscellaneous items.While the main story may not be that strong, the real story is the journey you take in this harsh universe. Will you lose most of your crew in a freak accident only to survive all the way to the last sector on a wish and a prayer? Or will you escape from a sun's solar flare only to jump into an asteroid field and watch as your ship gets ripped apart by the asteroids and the nearby pirate's lasers? Or do you send your crew down to a randomly planet's distress call only to lose some of them as they are attacked by rebel forces? The story is played out with a lot of different text screens as you jump from one place in the galaxy map to the next. You'll encounter many different races, each with their own set of needs and personalities which you'll then have to decide what's best for your ship's continued survival. That's the fun with games like this is that you get to create the story in your head as you go along. It happened more than once that I would say ""ENGAGE"" at my monitor as my ship escaped a brutal battle or mourned over the loss of a comrade who bravely defended invading forces from taking over the ship. So, while the base story might not be much, its what you create from the universe that will really engage your interest in the game.Advanced Edition ThoughtsFTL: Advanced Edition fleshes everything about the game out, it's that simple. The new alien race adds a new mechanic where they suck the air out of the room they are in. There's new ships as well. It also comes with more music, weapons, encounters to overcome and UI enhancements to boot. It's a free expansion so no reason not to enjoy it. It can be disabled if you're wanting the vanilla FTL experience. PC SettingsFTL's settings are a bit lacking. You only have a few options to control the size of the game on your screen. Those included are: windowed mode, full-screen (stretched), full-screen (black borders) and full-screen (FTL's native resolution) which is not your monitor's resolution. You also have no control over key bindings, though the default keys are pretty smartly placed. There are also a bunch of other minor settings you can enable or disable to your liking and you can see in the screenshot above. Overall, my biggest criticism of the settings choices would be the lack of resolution options as I'm not a bit fan of the current ones but they should work well enough for you. The game also features a good tutorial to get you up to speed on how to play. There is also a Stats screen which contains your best performance and achievements for each ship you've flown. The game is well polished as far as being free from any bugs or crashing problems are concerned. Final ThoughtsFTL is a fantastic game and I don't think I'm saying anything new there. There's plenty of content and challenge, as I got 30 hours out of it. Though the RNG can easily ruin a run and I'd classify it as overly harsh, but there's something to enjoy every run. It's one of the few games that genuinely gives the feeling of being a starship captain. If your looking for a starship simulator that is an enjoyable, simple, and well crafted experience, then give FTL: Faster Than Light a look. This became my Game of the Year in 2012.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,57

												I was really astonished by the sheer amount of quality this game delivers for the amount of money that I put down. It reminded me of the good old times, that I would reach out for a game in the heavily discounted bin and discover a gem. So what kind of game is Faster Than Light?Faster than light is a management game set in space. The game starts you off with your own spaceship and crew. You will unlock more spaceships and layouts of those spaceships while completing challenges and winning the game. When you start the game you are immediately informed about your mission. You are part of the federation fleet and you have crucial information which needs to be delivered to the main fleet. The problem is, rebels are chasing you down to make sure you are not able to relay your crucial information to your fleet. Thus begins the challenge, you need to explore as much as you can without falling in the hands of the rebels. The places you can visit are marked on your map. Every point has lines attached to them which indicate where you can access that area from. It is very important that you strategically choose you destinations in order to explore as much as possible without falling in the hands of the rebels. Every time you travel the rebels will come closer to you. The amount of things that you can do and find in this game is astonishing. While exploring you will encounter shops, people in need, enemies and other kinds of encounters. If you complete them, you can gain resources like: scrap metal, drone parts, fuel, crew members, missiles and sometimes even upgrades for your spaceship. These resources are vitally important because you are going to need them in order to defeat the final boss.  You will be managing your ship in a fight by: placing crew members in rooms that you want to see operated, dividing your energy over multiple spaceship systems and closing and opening doors. The rooms that are present in your spaceship are the: medical bay, shield generator, engine, pilot room, camera’s, co2 room, weapons room and more. Some of these rooms need power where others do not. You can increase the effectiveness of these rooms by: upgrading the rooms with scrap metal, allocating more power to them and placing crew members in them. Your crew members will gain experience by working in these rooms which will make the rooms more effective. For example an upgraded crew member in the weapons room will give you an increased reload speed. Each crew member has its own merits, for example humans will learn faster but some alien races will give power to a room or fight more effectively. You can find these alien crew members in shops or in encounters( some spaceships start with different alien races). Besides the rooms that you can upgrade, you can also invest in weapons, drones, systems and augmentations which will help you.Weapons have different kinds of effects ranging from setting rooms on fire to temporarily disabling systems and of course dealing damage to the hull of the ship.  Most weapons will only deplete energy but some use missiles which you only have a limited amount of.  Drones will also deplete a resource named, drone parts. Drones come in different versions such as  defensive drones, attacking drones and hacking drones. In order to destroy your opponent you must deplete your enemies hull integrity to zero. In some instances you can avoid an fight by giving up resources or making a deal with the enemy. If you feel outgunned you can always warp away with your spaceship after a set time has expired.  Enemies can also try to warp away if they are damaged enough. you can however stop the warp by damaging systems that are needed for the warp.Combat in this game is further enhanced by the addition of environmental effects. Some places you visit have ION fields or sun flares which will disable space ship systems or effect the maximum amount of energy you can use. Systems  grant additional options  such as hacking, mind control and cloaking which makes this game more interesting and engaging. Passive boosts can also be found and are called augmentations. The visuals suite the atmosphere of the game quite well.  What really stands out though is the amazing soundtrack! The music is extremely mesmerizing and really fits the theme of the game. I cannot stress you enough to at least check it out on Youtube or even better, buy it from steam.If I have to discuss a negative aspect of the game, it would be the RNG. The game randomly generates enemies and random encounters which can screw you over big time. Some of these situations can be avoided however by knowing what the possible negative effects are of the responses you give. This does not change the fact however, that there are situations where it’s  better to start over instead of trying to reach the end. In conclusion I really recommend checking this game out.  +  a lot of content/options and strategies+ graphics fit the theme well + beautiful soundtrack! + gameplay does not get stale( for me at least)+ system requirements are low-	RNG can be aggravating at times.

The visuals suite the atmosphere of the game quite well.  What really stands out though is the amazing soundtrack! The music is extremely mesmerizing and really fits the theme of the game. I cannot stress you enough to at least check it out on Youtube or even better, buy it from steam.If I have to discuss a negative aspect of the game, it would be the RNG. The game randomly generates enemies and random encounters which can screw you over big time. Some of these situations can be avoided however by knowing what the possible negative effects are of the responses you give. This does not change the fact however, that there are situations where it’s  better to start over instead of trying to reach the end. In conclusion I really recommend checking this game out.  +  a lot of content/options and strategies+ graphics fit the theme well + beautiful soundtrack! + gameplay does not get stale( for me at least)+ system requirements are low-	RNG can be aggravating at times.

												Rogue-likes: the randomized frontier.FTL's randomness makes for some incredibly entertaining gameplay as you attempt to make the most of your trip from one side of the galaxy to the other to save the Federation, all while being chased by looming, innumerable rebel forces.You will extermish pirates to varying degrees of glee and bitterness. You will guide that lost civilian to their destination, find out it was a rebel trap, and smile. You will relish every victory.You will have to sell that Burst Laser III so you can upgrade your engines. You will open that Mantis escape pod because you are desperate for someone who can board ships. You will lose the last bit of your ship's HP to an unfortunately timed missle. Failing to make it to the end of a roughly 6-hour playthrough is what makes your victories significant.FTL is visually very simple, a hallmark of its indie production, but as much as it could benefit from a bigger-than-1280x800 resolution or perhaps even 3D graphics, I love how I can run it on my integrated graphics laptop.FTL is a tremendous value and important landmark in the history of crowdfunded games. Were I to wake up in an alternate universe where I had yet to create a Steam account, I would buy FTL again, for around three incarnations, anyway.			",51,8,0,10,5,0,8

												A Roguelike!  In Space!  With Lasers!  And catchy music that doesn't ingratiate!  ProTip:  If a pirate gives you the option to choose your death, don't pick oxygen.  Unless, you've got some hardcore weaponry you'll probably die before you can destroy him.  Take your chances and pick something else instead.  You'll probably still die though.

												Great game, but incredibly frustrating.  The ""easy"" difficulty is still practically impossible for me after 20 hours.  It's a really satisfying game if you do get good enough at it, but it's about 10 times more frustrating when you get 2 hours into a run and you lose because of a stupid mistake or because the game just didn't give you the right stuff.  Literally the only game I rage at, and the only game I keep coming back to after ragingEdit:  After 62 HOURS (over a good long while) I've finally beat the game.  On easy...  EASY!  I'll be playing this game more, and hopefully beating it on the higher levels of difficulty.http://steamcommunity.com/id/fritzpud/screenshot/48728490558739955 ",1025,273,36,146,107,12,154

												Amazing game. It's a rougelike adventure where you are at the helm of a ship that is carrying information vital to the survival of the remaining Federation fleet; the last remaining hope for the federation after their crushing defeat from the Rebels. You will have your ups and downs, sometimes escaping death by less than a second, just to have all your success of escaping near death crush down on you when the next ship you encounter happens to be a Mantis war vessel armed to the teeth. You may lose and you may find the game to be a bit harsh at times, but it can be assured that you will always come back and try to save the Federation from the verge of defeat with what little is at your disposal, time and time again. 9/10			",302,43,17,37,42,5,44

												Another roguelike that is extremely punishing. But it's fun to see how far you can take your ridiculously disabled ship. Eventually you get good enough to win consistently....and then you look at your playtime and realize you played over a hundred hours. Time spent enjoying my crew's misfortune is time well spent though.Lost my entire crew when I accidentally blew up the enemy ship with everyone aboard it. 10/10 would explode again.

												With 30k+ reviews and 97% thumbs up, I would say even if it doesn't look like all that much fun watching the videos it's worth picking up to see if you like it.I picked this game up a couple of years ago and seem to come back to it now and it again - it's truly a gem.  With an incredible mod community (Captain's Edition + Better Planets/Backgrounds, Endless Pace) you have so much content for $10 that you will get your money's worth 10x over.Be warned, this is the kind of game where you'll find yourself telling yourself ""ok, just one more jump/finsih the sector/get to the quest marker and then I'll go to bed"" and find yourself up to 2:30 in the morning.I really can' t recommend this game strongly enough			",27,6,0,7,3,0,4

												133 hours and i still havent finished it! I will keep trying though! To begin ship selection is restricted to a single vessel but once they're all unlocked through in-game events there is a great selection, each catering to different playstyles. Combat is fast and unforgiving especially if your enemy has an advantage over your craft at that time. Having a level 3 teleporter and 4 mantis boarding crew with stars means nothing if the enemy is a probe with no atmosphere on board. Good micro-management during combat is vital and incredibly satisfying when you pull it off. Fires break out, systems go down and hull breaches appear all of which require crew to manage. There are also environmental factors to consider, like solar flares igniting fires or asteroid fields wrecking your shields. Upgrading your ship is easy and there is so many different upgrades you will be experimenting for a while. Different ships start out with different systems and new systems can be installed in shops throughout the game using the in-game currency: scrap. Highly recommended.			",61,10,0,12,4,0,11

												The true definition of: ""Space Simulator Greatness"". This game seemed too simplistic at first for me to try, but after awhile, I was hooked! The mechanism and knowledge required, basing off the pictures alone is totally not what I expected. This game has so much potential which it greatly exercise. At times, ""true-knowledge"" of multitasking is required, which makes this game a challenge to play with. However, it is more important to consider that this game is probably one of the most creative and amazing space-strategy games I have played. A perfect 5/5.			",282,92,24,41,41,4,58

												By far one of my most favourite games on here. This game combines tactics, luck and the Final Boss to challenge you and replay. Its replayability comes into play when youve lost and you realise you can just start again, no frustration required. This game takes you on a journey through 8 sectors where your quest is to gather materials and upgrade your ship in preparation of fighting the Rebel Flagship, and along the way you are plunged into problem solving situations for greater or less/unexpected rewards, achievements and new ship layouts.The Advanced Edition Expansion has made the game even more greater than it already was (if that exists). The features included are things like new systems and subsystems , new weapons , new race, Type C ship layouts and even a ""hard"" difficulty and other miscellaneous additions. This has added a new twist to the gameplay and a new reason for ""fed up"" players (somehow) to begin playing it again. But regular old FTL still remains with just the click of button.£6.99 GBP / $9.99 USD / €9.99 / 249 rublesHaving played nearly/already 100 hours , for me its a must buy.			",112,6,5,6,13,1,14

You are carying vital info to defeat a rebelion in which you need to keep up against otherwise they will thrash you. you have to get to sector 8 and defeat the boss to unlock another ship or complete quests that sometimes unlock other ships, but then you do it again, and again, and again, untill you have all the ships..... but not class B or C, so then you have to complete achievments! semingly endless gameplay, so overall, definately reccomended. if you have the money, GET THIS GAME!

												Ship log #4F-T55A7LWe were given something special to help aid in the fight against the rebels, Despite the Federations plight, we were it's sole hope of triumph.Throughout the kestrels travels many crew members had assisted in the fight against the rebel fleet in various battles through Engi space, to an uncharted nebula.But none of us could have foreseen the great doom that which was a mere science lab.Hidden beyond it's fancy air-lock were seven madmen in coats who had somehow turned the captain against the kestrels very own crew.Before the crew knew what had happened, the captain began punching Cubin and the rest had descended upon various subsystems.Amidst the battle two other crew members were taken from us, Tomas punched to death beside the FTL drive and Nelis asphyxiated in the weapons bay.Relentless with reckless abandon, the lab-coated madmen pursued Cubin and Martin to the med-bay only to suffocate and drop lifelessly in the mid-deck one by one.Cubin and Martin retreated to the medical bay fighting a losing battle, healing their asphyxiation in a now completely decompressed kestrel.This is the ships computer logging off.Rebel : These were the last recordings aboard the Kestrel, Should i delete them sir?Rebel leader : Oh no no, this is hilarious! Broadcast this through the entire Galaxy! But uhh.. what happened to the survivors?Rebel: We destroyed the med-bay and watched.*collective chuckle*Rebel leader : You're all promoted!10/10 would check a science lab again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ship log #4F-T55A7LWe were given something special to help aid in the fight against the rebels, Despite the Federations plight, we were it's sole hope of triumph.Throughout the kestrels travels many crew members had assisted in the fight against the rebel fleet in various battles through Engi space, to an uncharted nebula.But none of us could have foreseen the great doom that which was a mere science lab.Hidden beyond it's fancy air-lock were seven madmen in coats who had somehow turned the captain against the kestrels very own crew.Before the crew knew what had happened, the captain began punching Cubin and the rest had descended upon various subsystems.Amidst the battle two other crew members were taken from us, Tomas punched to death beside the FTL drive and Nelis asphyxiated in the weapons bay.Relentless with reckless abandon, the lab-coated madmen pursued Cubin and Martin to the med-bay only to suffocate and drop lifelessly in the mid-deck one by one.Cubin and Martin retreated to the medical bay fighting a losing battle, healing their asphyxiation in a now completely decompressed kestrel.This is the ships computer logging off.Rebel : These were the last recordings aboard the Kestrel, Should i delete them sir?Rebel leader : Oh no no, this is hilarious! Broadcast this through the entire Galaxy! But uhh.. what happened to the survivors?Rebel: We destroyed the med-bay and watched.*collective chuckle*Rebel leader : You're all promoted!10/10 would check a science lab again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is an experience. Pros:- The soundtrack is legendary. Probably the best in any game i've played. - The randomly generated story you get through this rogue like is good. - The gameplay is intense. You gotta manage your ships power and coordinate attacks while at the same time dealing with fires, hull damages, boarding crews, hurt crewmembers on board your ship. Nothing feels better than after a hectic near-death high-stakes battle jumping to a store to repair and hearing the calming music come on. - The game is brutal. Getting to the end is hard because there are so many opportunities for you to die along the way. You have to manage resources and plan ahead. Play throughs take time and with perma-death, every battles has high stakes.- Combine the music, the art, and the merciless gameplay, you get an awesome atmosphere to the game. - The game costs less than $10Cons:- The game's very hard to beat- The jump animation shoulda been a bit different: make it look less like teleporation and more like quick acceleration to FTL travel.- The final boss feels unneccessary. It doesn't add any value to the gameplay, only adds plot holes to the story line. What is the federation doing sending a tiny scout vessel to fight a huge rebel flagship? Even if it did send it, why isn't the federation helping out with any artillery volleys or something? Without the boss the game is hard enough. I give this game a 9.5/10. If they removed the final boss and to compensate added an extra sector to the map, FTL would've been 10/10.			",31,6,0,2,12,0,4

												If you don't own this game, frankly, you're missing out. It's an incredibly satisfying experience, and I get hooked every time I start it up. Expect to lose. A lot. But don't feel bad about it; dying is half the fun in this game! You learn better strategies as you keep playing (and inevitably being blown to bits), and once you finally beat the final boss... you're just on top of the world. I'm not a big fan of games that rely on luck as much as this game does, but this game is too much fun for me to care. ...Or at least justify having to care. It constantly makes you think and it rewards clever thinking. Just about anyone can have fun with this game; it's well worth the investment, even at full price.			",86,17,2,0,12,2,0

												Such an excellent ""rogue-like""! The main game has almost unlimited replayability because no two runs will be the same!There's also an extensive modding community that make mods ranging from simple weapon replacements/enhancements to complete game overhauls that change the entire gameplay/story line of the game!I highly recommend it to anyone who likes gaming in general and especially to those sadistic gamers out there who love a game that challenges you to the point of almost causing ragequits! It's WELL worth the cheap $9.99 price tag, I would pay double that and STILL be very happy with my purchase!			",490,88,15,66,49,2,88

												If you don't own this game, you are missing out. FTL is a true gem of a game, something playable by people of all skill levels, with enough challenge and replayability to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay. My ONLY complains is the lack of consistency. I get a surrender offer for 6 fuel, 4 missiles, and 15 scrap..... I kill the crew leaving the ship intact, and there's 1 fuel 1 drone part, and 30 scrap. And various other events where RNG rewards create weird situations. THE only complaint. Everything else about the game is pure gold, and this one factor is very minimal but noticible. If you are offered a good surrender, take it, the kill or freely scavenging rewards may not be as good. Other than that, best of luck and have fun! The FTLgame reddit is pretty active too, so visit there if you want to learn more or have awesome stories to share!			",594,99,5,59,27,6,54

												When I describe this game to others I always mention the starting bit of Star Wars: A New Hope. You remember the ship that Princess Leia was in? She was trying to escape from the evil guys behind her.That's basically FTL in a nutshell. It's a game that gives you a lot of fun, but also a lot of nervous breakdowns. When you lose half of your crew because you wanted to help a station in distress, you quickly become a class 1 space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and start ignoring all those cries for help.The game is surprisingly hard, something I didn't see since I was a kid (mid '90s), took me a long time to see the final boss, only to get humiliated by him in 30-45 seconds.Great game! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Games such as FTL: Faster Than Light have been few and far between.  A proper rougelike, you never know what will happen during a run, and short of a proper ship layout, some luck, and a high level of skill, you probably won't get far often.  However, like any good roguelike, FTL isn't about winning everytime.  Too many games nowadays have no consequence for death.  This is all well and good in some ways, but we need more games like this one to make us genuinely try.As for the gameplay itself, I couldn't be more satisfied.  A mix of real-time and something like turn-based gameplay (you can pause the action at any time and set up what will happen next) give you the time to react to a situation as you see fit, but how you react and how it is timed is essential.  Will your weapon charge and fire, knocking out theirs before they can fire back; or should you aim instead at their shield room to make certain that your future volleys get through?  Will draining the oxygen from the engine room put out the fire before they are destroyed; or should you risk your men in the blazing room to put it out and keep that engine running?  Is that heavily guarded ship worth it, or should you sneak past?Enjoy your runs in FTL.  My advice?  Avoid giant spiders.			",239,41,3,14,10,3,5

												It's Dungeons Of Dredmor and The Binding Of Isaac but  in space. Faster Than Light is a roguelike game, meaning that if you die, it's truly game over. There's no reloading savegames, checkpoints, anything. You have to start all over again, except for a few things (like new ships or layouts) that you'll unlock during your games.The whole game is randomly created so you'll never play the same game twice. There's also a bit of micromanaging. Scrap the 'bit' part, in reality it's pretty important and you'll micromanage your crew in practically every battle. Your crew will have to repair important parts of your ship and setting them up correctly might make them reload your weapons faster, or recharge your shields faster. They'll even have to engage enemies in combat from time to time. Killed enemies will give you resources to upgrade your ship and buy stuff in shops. Stuff you desperately need in order to advance. In fact, soms of us might never even be able to complete the game, considering the fact that things are entirely random and it's also based on lots of luck. But it will never stop you from quitting the game. It's always fun, no matter what happens to your ship. You'll keep telling yourself; 'just one more game'. And isn't that what a game's supposed to do?FTL is a great game and anyone who gives it a try will absolutely learn to appreciate it. Maybe not instantly, but after a few games ? Absolutely ![Rating: 87/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

												FTL Faster Than Light is a rogue-like with the added twist of being set in space and based around ship management. The gameplay involves you mainly micromanaging your spaceship and crew as you travel through a number of random encounters trying to reach the other side of the map so you can deliver a warning to your rebel headquarters and defeat the final boss.FTL is a game that relies heavily on it's difficulty, being much shorter than your average rouge-like. You manage a number of fairly limited resources as you slowly improve your ship and crew. You gather fuel, missiles and money and hope for new and better weapons and drones as your crew members gain experience in whatever field they are working.It is a well made game and one I'm happily recommending but it's also a game that has some rather annoying limitations.Your ship has very little customization options which makes repeat playthroughs somewhat dull, an unusual trait for a rouge-like. Choosing a different ship often yields much the same gameplay as even though your starting position changes a little, the only real change longterm is the configuration of the various rooms on your ship.Another problem is the relatively short campaign you will begin to take note of once you've learned the basics and only the unforgiving higher difficulty gives it any sort of longevity.All in all FTL: Faster Than Light is a nice little game, but it is also a game that needs something more before I'll agree with the underdog hype that seems to be going around everywhere these days. Perhaps strong developer support and a growing modding community will one day make this into the game it could be but as it sits now it is nothing special.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												This game is a very well polished extension of the Roguelike genre. You pick a ship from a number of different designs each with their strengths and weaknesses, and are sent forth through a series of randomly generated star systems in the hopes of becoming powerful enough to destroy the Federation Flagship. However, instead of training a single character as you progress through the game, you improve your entire ship, its subsystems, its weapons and the crew within it.The game's charm lies within both its superb soundtrack which magnificently serves to highlight the action in the game, and its implementation of the game's different races and weapon types.

												I got this game from a bundle. I wasn't quite sure I would ever play it, because it didn't look very exciting. I couldn't have been more wrong. Last time I played a roguelike game was 25 years ago, on Unix terminals, at the computer school. It was called Fantasia, featured ASCII ""graphics"", and was extremely exciting. I remembered the excitement and decided to give FTL a shot. FTL reminded why I spent so much time on Fantasia. Roguelike games are fun, and this once is bloody excellent. Entertaining gameplay, nice music, nice graphics, and of course, permadeath ! Highly recommended !			",206,44,15,19,7,2,24

												This is a really clever game. The ship handling is especially cool, as you upgrade the ships features while also having to think of improving your generator to suit the more powerhungry merchandise you buy. You power each system at different power levels according to what's going on. You bombard enemies with a barage of deadly weapons to shut down their system. You maintain your crew and make sure to repair both combat systems and systems vital to your crews survival... In short, there are enough parameters in this game for it to be something you can be good at.If they made a sequel where they removed some of the random factor you face when umping between beacons, it would possibly be a perfect game.

												FTL is a game that covers every beautiful aspect of the gaming industry. The game is not too hard, but at the same time, not too easy. The random events gives different experiences on every journey, some good, and some bad. The game frustrates you at times, but at others it rewards you. The main mechanic that drives the game is the Permadeath feature. No saving the game and reloading it. There is no room for error in FTL, if you are destroyed becuase you didn't purchase better weapons, tough luck. It gives a feeling of individuality. When you are on the final sector of the game, you know this is it. One way or another, you'll never see your ship again, and it makes us feel sad for the poor crew. You have to manuever and plan out as the story progresses, or else you will be destroyed. Would I recommend it? Yes. I think it is one of the best Indie titles out there. With the new expansion, the game feels even more immersive then before. One of the best improvements was added customization, the fact that every journey would be even more different then before. I give this game a 9/10, one point deducted for the head-bashing boss, which I have only beaten once on easy.			",88,21,2,10,29,1,28

You need to buy this, it is so satisfying to finally beat that Flagship or unlock a new ship!And every ship and crew has a new feel and challenge.The free expansion also adds wonderfull extra possibilities and challenges.I seriously can't name a single bad thing about this game!

												FTL is one of those games that, if you don't dodge out of the gate, will grab you hard.  It's got that just-one-more jump thing, kind of like Civ.  It's got that mix and match build thing, kind of like Dredmor.  But what really makes it shine is the clever meshing of several minigames, all at once - but with the ability to pause and think about your orders.  Kind of like Baldur's gate.  But it's none of those things.  Instead, it's possibly the best spaceship game I've ever played.  Right up there with 4x treats like Sins and oldschool wonders like Escape Velocity.  It just nails that space atmosphere.It's a roguelike, it's a spacechip game, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slot machine and you'll happily spend weeks yanking it's arm to fire up a new ship full of redshirts, optimistically hurtling to their doom.

												This game though.You don't really pilot your ship, you omnisciently control it - and it's tough. If you don't die in the first system your first time, then you are inhuman. The game is incredibly unforgiving, and EVERY choice you make has an impact. Stranded civilian ship want to trade 5 missiles for two of your fuel? You run out of fuel before you can resupply at the next store, and die. Refuse a pirate trader and wind up fighting? The extra hull damage to your ship causes you to explode in the asteriod field down the way. As unforgiving as the game can be, it challenges you to make smart choices, and manage your ship cautiously and conservatively.The combat is suprisingly fun, and the sound track is quite immersive - though I don't think I would buy the standalone sound track. Everything about the game keeps you coming back for more, and it's beautiful.			",164,36,11,27,34,2,42

												FTL is a hilarious game where you control a spaceship and fight against rebels. This game just blows your mind with awesome moments. I'm not the type of player that likes singleplayers, but when I saw a stream of this game it seemed good. After buying it and getting more than 25 hours of gameplay I couldn't beat the game in easy. Even though its a really hard game you enjoy every moment you play. Everyone that had played this game remembers the giant alien spiders or having fire in all your ship. This are just some of the amazing memories this game gives you. Know it is time for the soundtrack, the soundtrack can't be described with words. Is just an amazing piece of work that improves the quality of your gameplay exponentially, the music makes you relax and enjoy each scene. It gets you pumped up when you need it and makes you think about buying the soundtrack of the game. If you don't want to spend a lot of money in games or you don't have a powerful PC I recommend you this game with all my heart. It's worth every penny, and you can easily get more than 150 hours if you enjoy the game. It haves a lot of scenarios, races, ships and 2 types of edition. If you get bored of the normal edition you can try the advanced edition. The game can be repetitive, but even after some time you get to enjoy everything about Faster Than Light.			",55,4,0,3,8,1,6

												I really have no idea why I enjoy getting blown up by rebels so much. Maybe it's the fantastic level of detail put into the mechanics of the game, or perhaps it's the amazing soundtracks this game has to offer, or possibly the wide variety of content that allows for nearly infinite replayability- no two runs are ever quite the same. However, I do know this: the feeling you get when the Rebel Flagship explodes into tiny pieces of orange shrapnel is rebel-killingly, game-winningly, ship-explodingly euphoric!			",30,8,0,8,5,0,2

												8/10This game puts you at the mercy of the all powerful random number generator. Every restart results in a varried experience: sometimes you'll be showered with loot and other times you'll get destroyed before you really get anywhere at all or run out of fuel and missiles.It's a nice change to be a part of the empire rather than the rebellion in a game, but given the difficulty of the final ""boss battle"", one wonders why the empire bothered resisting the coup to begin with.A fun game all in all, deffinitely worth playing. Always keep in mind, few problems cannot be solved with open doors.			",38,14,0,9,10,0,9

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a masterfully crafted strategy game that is a love letter to any who find space adventure even the least bit compelling.  The game's core mechanics are gripping and harmonize perfectly with it's space opera theme.  Tension is built over the course of the game by limiting the player's resources and forcing difficult decisions.  Ultimately, the game crescendos to an amazing finale that will having you cheering out loud when you finally overcome it.  I recommend FTL to anyone who has even a mild interest in this type of game.

FTL had much more depth than I originally thought, however, and I found myself immersed in the world. I love the permadeath. You can feel tension in the air as you move crewmember around repairing systems, try to suck a boarding crew out the airlock, and lock on to the enemies weapon system. The game envelopes you in its strategy and creates a believable atmosphere. A must buy, especially with a free update coming			",95,7,1,19,11,0,9

Ten bucks is well worth the hours of playing a vaguely bemused starcaptain in an uncaring universe.			",35,56,0,10,4,0,20

												This is an amazing rogue like game for those who are patient. If you are fine with seeing characters and ships whom you've grown close to blow up in mere seconds, then do we have a game for you. The main joy obtained through this game is the feeling of gradual accomplishment that is recieved through each time you, unlock a new ship, gain another achievement, or finally obtain a successful battle strategy. The name of the game is to go through multiple playthroughs, each time unlocking something to improve your chances of survival in the next playthrough. There are many achievements gain, and an incredibly tricky final boss, so this kind of game will lead to countless hours of entertainment. It's a seriously enjoyable game... other than a few minor problems. One main frustration is the level of luck needed, and also  the matter of timing. You could be an incredibly good player and still get game-overed if struck with enough bad luck. The randomly chosen inventory type of the stores can cause some mild frustration especially if you seemingly can not find any stores that sells any useful weapons. Most annoyances in game can be worked through though, so there should not be too much frustration. This game is not for the weak of heart, and if you want this game be prepared to lose a lot. This game is not necessarily about the big victories, it's something that should be savored, but not completely suaght after. For those whole are willing to make the long and arduous journey, this game can reward greatly.			",14,3,0,7,5,0,7

												This game reminds me a lot of a board game called “Battlestations” and it is in fact very similar. The game has many faces and I think that is why it has claimed many prices and nominations last year. You take control over a space ship and its crew members. You goal is to navigate through perilous star systems and avoid countless of rebel ships in order to reach the final destination and destroy the rebels once and for all. The game gives that certain feel of serenity, that people imagine outer space would feel like and at the same time it can be very stressful, testing your ship-management-skills and coordination to the fullest. It has various ships you can unlock, new crew members of different origin and species to hire, tons of weaponry and many different and unique encounters in the endless space that is Faster than Light.+ A new experience every time you play+ Arcade “easy to pick up” play+ Feels deep and complex, even though arcade style play+ Will last for decades to come- Adictive- Ruin free time with spouse ",220,99,3,41,27,2,54

												Faster Than Light is probably the best game I have ever played. With such a wide variety of ships to play as. With its massively explorable and randomly generated maps, the fact that FTL is 2D is nothing. The thing is you will never know what you will face in one of your runs as it will always be different even. the scenrios have a random chance of apearing. I would highly recommend FTL because how versatile it is.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from Metal Slug, there aren't many pixel-graphic games that I enjoy. I know, I shouldn't go around judging games based on their graphics, and I don't. I just haven't played many pixelized games.The game itself is pretty good, it's rather strategic. The goal is to navigate your way to the boss, fighting through all sorts of randomly generated areas and enemy ships, with your ship. You have control of individual crewmembers, and those have different characteristics depending on what race (species?) they are. These crewmembers have different roles, all systems and weapons need crew manning them to be usable, and there has to be a pilot at the helm or your ship cannot dodge any attacks at all. Enemy crew can invade your ship, and your people have the ability to fight them off. Systems, weapons, and the hull can be damaged, and the crew has the ability to repair them all. While ship shapes are unchangable, there are a variety to unlock and some have special perks, and you have some options on what systems and weapons to place inside and on your ship, all of which impact your ship's combat capability. The boss is incredibly hard though. I've lost track of how many times I've gotten to it, but I've never beaten it once. It apparently has several stages, but I've only ever gotten past the first. In honesty, I'm not sure if $9.99 is worth a video game like this. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but there's not very much in it and repetitiveness, for me, detracts from the appeal of a game. (I'm really iffy about prices for games... I don't think any game ever will be worth $60, unless inflation drives currency there.) I'd recommend this at full price, if you can totally spare the money, but if it's on sale? It's a great deal.Another thing I want to note is the game's music. The game itself is enjoyable, but the music is on another darn level. There was a time when I'd plug in both of my ear-phones, search up the soundtrack, and listen to it with my eyes closed. It literally gave me goosebumps and chills. I'm no expert in music or music analyzation, but I think this needs an award for its music. (Steam Awards, darn it.)I don't review often. I think this is my second or third time reviewing, and this may just be me rambling like an idiot, but thanks for sparing time to read through this. Have a good day, evening, or night, and... uh... yeah... stuff.			",78,8,0,3,6,2,14

												What is there to say about FTL other than it is an amazing game that can provide you hours of limitless fun. The wide range of weaponry allows for a variety of play styles and can keep speedrunners and explorers alike entertained. The real gem is the games combat system which allows for on the fly tactical decision making that can impact the fate of your ship and her crew, all at the slip of misplaced energy bars.The graphics of the game are charming, and allow for those with lower end computers to enjoy the same fun as people with more expensive rigs. While it may be a turn-off for some, the simplified blocky art style showcases the gritty and fearful nature of the game and what lies beyond the great expanse of space Procedural generation makes it so that no 2 adventures are the same, however the same cannot be said about the specific encounters or battles as they will inevitably repeat themselves. This can become annoying over multiple playthroughs, but overall will not detract from the game as a whole.In conclusion, I would reccomend this game to someone who has always wanted to be at the helm of their very own starship, or someone who just needs a casual breakaway from your everyday AAA-cookie cutter title.Rating: 9/10			",143,15,4,5,13,1,19

												FTL is pretty much everything you see on an episode of Star Trek.  That's literally what it is; Star Trek: The Game.  Want to divert power from weapons into shields?  By gum, you can.  Want to use your scanners to avoid enemy ships?  A valid strategy!  Do you not take a deal with the Slugs because they tend to rip you off?  Well, depends on how much you need it.Officially, FTL is a rouge-like-like.  Each round is short, usually playable in one sitting, and will vary from every other round immensely.  With fantastic music and brilliant story situations, I would highly recommend this to anyone that sees games above a simple entertainment venue as well as anyone who wanted to be Captain Kirk when they were a kid.  Both categories of people, and many more at that, will be completely satisfied.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me just start off by saying that I adore this game any other roguelike I currently own. It's a fantastic piece of work that almost seamlessly melds roguelike and strategy that's unforgiving in the hands of a novice but nontetheless rewarding and worth replaying constantly. It has the best soundtrack of any indie game I've played thus far, and making it a dynamic soundtrack with idle and battle versions definitely helped that. The writing is also interesting and clever, and definitely making it worth a try for any fan of sci-fi. Advanced Edition, the recent free expansion, expands upon the game's content by at least a third and adds yet another reason to get back at it.Regardless, I've come to dread the end level. Strategy and luck seem to go out the window in favor of luck alone. Your only real hope at winning is having fully upgraded almost everything, and if you don't have the right weapons and/or equipment you cannot hope to last the three phases of the boss. The boss presents no surprise and beating it becomes pretty formulaic. The Advanced Edition upgrades help mix it up a little and make it just a little less mind-numbing, but it still puts a dent in an otherwise near-perfect title.9.5/10			",139,18,1,16,15,0,8

												Have you ever wanted to captain your own star ship and fly through the strange and dangerous depths of space? Well now is your chance but it is not for the faint of heart.In short get this, it is an awesome rogue-like space simulator and you will not regret it. Also buy the soundtrack too, it’s very catchy.This game is great fun. The ascetics are very retro and remind me of games from yesteryear. The gameplay itself is fun, challenging and highly addictive, you will want to play it through time and again. Even when the odds are against you, and they often are, you will want to fight on and try to be the hero despite your impending doom. The in game universe is already vast and highly diverse, you never know whether the next warp will be to a friendly planet, devastated space station or rebel ambush. The whole game is more or less procedurally generated so you never have the same experience twice, which keeps it fresh each time you retry.As the captain you manage what systems you have installed in your ship, what weapons you have equipped, even which crew members fly with you. There is even a basic rpg system for each crew member, so if they do die you feel a sense of lost. I remember getting very attached to the little guys.This game will kick your butt and laugh at you whilst doing it yet that is a price that is very easily paid considering how enjoyment you’ll get. This is a 100% recommend even at full price, on sale you would be crazy not to get this. And due to a recent update it’s even better. There are also mods that can be applied for an even better experience, I recommend the Captain’s editionHave fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Brilliant little game with a good challenge, it takes awhile to get used to the difficulty but as you go on, as you get better and better and start to die less and less, you get a sense of achievement you don't get from most games. Beautiful music, amazing graphics and a fantastic concept, I would recommend this game to anyone who needs to burn time and doesn't mind becoming addicted to a game, so hit that buy button and enjoy!

												Don't let this game fool you, its not easy. Don't even try and win it at first (i've never beaten the game, even on Easy). Just try and stay alive. Then see how many sectors you can traverse. Then see how many ships you can unlock. Then see if you can beat it.Every round of this game is different and right now its my favorite pickup game on Steam. And for $5, you can't go wrong.			",186,54,6,32,37,3,53

												Excellent game for the price. Despite the linear ""plot"" to the game (make your way through eight sectors of a galaxy and defeat the final boss), you are given a huge number of options in terms of HOW you tackle this task. Whether you use boarding parties, drones or just arm yourself to the teeth with powerful weapons is entirely up to you, and there is an excellent balance that makes these all viable options.A playthrough doesn't take too long, so it's the sort of game you can play (and probably finish) in a couple of hours, or you can try out different things if you have longer. This means that it's a great game to play in either short bursts or a longer session.The unlockable ships and hidden easter eggs are the cherry on the top that may well make you come back and play this game again and again- I know they did for me. I've now gotten 72 hours out of a game that cost barely anyting- and it's been a better experience than a few games five times the price. ",249,84,27,35,36,7,65

												Oxygen is leaking through fist sized holes in a hull. Crew is fighting fire, blocked doors and enemy six legged soldiers. Fortunately assault drones are still cannoning enemy spaceship and you are gaining upper hand in one of the many battles in the FTL.You are a captain of the spaceship and micro management is all you constantly do in struggle to survive all the random encounters and events the game throws at you. Your journey is difficult, unforgiving and you never know what lies behind the corner (the space is full of corners).The space is also filled with old school visuals (great!) and simple, not disturbing music (ok). Your crew levels up and your spaceship gets upgrades. And there are other spaceships to unlock which adds to already huge replayability. But there is no (real) plot, no characters, no real immersion and unfortunately no big excitement. This game lacks soul.So soulless, but still well deserved recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												100/1 would buy againIt can get frustrating at times (CURSE YOU RNG GODS!!!) but it's a game that can be enjoyed. There are many ships to unlock, each one with a second layout to unlock. You start out with the Kestrel, which is a fine ship with a human crew. Each species has advantages/drawbacks. Humans, however, have neither. The story is amazing and there are a few things that you might not pick up on, so check out the wiki/fan theories. If you're going to play this game, play it on easy. Normal is very difficult.

												Certainly the greatest game I have played to come out this decade, game runs well is bug free and has a lot of repeatability. Even with the ability to pause whenever you like the game still presents an enthralling challenge, a good soundtrack (For the first 25 hours). You have one life and the game can take between 2 to 8 hours to reach the end, and then victory is not assured.  Game has unlock-able ships, 2 difficulties and very smooth game-play.

												It's a hard game to describe as it is simple and deep at the same time. One thing I'm sure of is that this game is beautiful, engaging and very fun. Random encounters, random shops, random events and even random galaxies make every single playthrough unique. The gameplay revolves around your tactical choices of managing a ship and their crew members, you can even hire aliens or acquire them by different means and the ship is highly customizable. Most of the events always give you a choice, and you even get bonus choices if you have a specific alien, weapon, resources or other things, that's a VERY appreciated RPG touch. The battle is simple, yet harder to master, you need to choose where the weapons should be shooting, is it wiser to take down their weapons, their shields, or their drones? Your call, and keep some crew to repair the damage. Overall, I'm really happy about this title, the trailer was great, but the game inside is so much more, truly an indie master piece.

												This game is brilliant.It looks simple, and it is, very simple, to learn to play. Mastering it, however, will take a lot longer.The game revolves around your ship, fleeing Rebel forces and trying to reach the Allied Fleet. You start off with a few crew, some minor weapons, and few empty spaces on your ship for improvements and new systems. How you develop from there is entirely up to you.You can use your scrap to upgrade your weapons, turning your ship into a powerful gunship. You have the options of buying new, stronger, weapons as the you locate stores, or traders. Or, if you are really lucky, you'll just find a random weapon floating in space.Or, perhaps you'd like to capture enemy ships instead of destroying them. Then you want teleporters, and Mantis crewmen. Mantis are the insectoid race, and they are excellent in combat. Beam them into your enemy's ship, and watch as they tear through the crew until the ship is yours.Of course, these are just two of the ways you can play this. With the Advanced Edition upgrade, you get new systems to play with, which provide you with even more options.On top of all this, there is the hangar. Even if you beat the boss, there are another 9 ship classes to check out, and most of those have three variants, so there is still loads to do.Then you have the various quests and missions to do, 8 randomly generated sectors of space to explore in each game, and even the chance of discovering a lost lost system... If you are lucky. All while on the run from the Rebel Fleet.In short, I highly recommend this game. FTL is loads of fun, and rather addictive. And even if you do get tired of playing (eventually), there are many, many mods out there for it which will change up your gameplay.			",36,26,0,19,8,0,12

												Having played FTL through multiple times, and fallen in love with the game over and over, I can officially say you should take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. With that out of the way, I love this game.StoryThe story of FTL is a simple, yet effective one, providing just enough backstory to set the player into the universe. The galaxy was controlled by the Federation, a coalition between humans and various other races, such as the robotic Engi, and the hyper-intelligent Zoltans, until the Rebellion came. Humans were fed up with being equal with other races, and led a successful rebellion against the Federation, all but destroying it. You are the commander of a small Federation cruiser, holding the only information that can help the Federation win the war. Your task is to fly through the galaxy, racing against the Rebels, to get to the last Federation base, and inform them of the weakness of the Rebel fleet.Gameplay:FTL is played from a top-down perspective, with you, the player, in control of a spaceship, requiring you to manage weapons, shields, engines, etc. to keep the ship alive in the depths of an unforgiving galaxy. When I say unforgiving, I mean unforgiving.  Just about everything is out to get you: Pirates, Rebel Ships, and Giant Alien Spiders make up only a tiny portion of the people who want to tear your ship apart peice by peice. You have to survive the constant onslaught with just your wits, carefully balancing your systems and crew to quickly end conflicts with as little damage as possible. In between events, you jump from point to point on a map of your current sector, which can hold shops, distress signals, and other miscellaneous warp points. As you travel through the galaxy, you'll acquire new crew, weapons, and systems to fight the ever-stronger enemies, in an arms race to the Federation Base, culminating into a final boss fight that will put your ship, and your skills, to the test. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and even on easy mode you will find yourself dying over and over. If you can get past the difficulty curve of the game, you'll find that it offers a very deep and rewarding experience, which will keep you coming back time and again.Visuals:The visuals in FTL are simplisitic, and two-dimensional, this doesn't mean that they are bad however. The game's art is fantastic, with the various ships, weapons, and aliens all having a unique look that suits their particular traits. The environments in this game are gorgious, with backgrounds of deep space, nebulae, and planets that never seem to get old.Writing:FTL's writing is funny, adding a bit of levity to an overall tense game. Many of the random events are incredibly out in left field, and the writing capitalizes on this, such as in the case of the aforementioned Giant Spiders. That said, the writing isn't all jokes, and also does a fantastic job of building the universe. In many of the encounters you are offered a chance to let enemy ships surrender, with really humanizes each encounter, and provides a moral dillemma with each ship you encounter. Often the rebels really aren't that dedicated to the cause, and are just average joes conscripted to help, and whether you should kill them or not is up to you.Music:One of the best aspects of this game is it's sound design. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game, with beautiful ambient music to accompany the lulls in the action, and tense tracks during tough battles. All the music in FTL is very electronic, most easily described as a mix of Chiptune, Ambient, and Trance. The music is relaxing enough to play a long session without getting boring, and engaging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat during some of the harder fights in the game. The sound effects of the various weapons, crew, and environmental hazards all fit perfectly, and can repeat without ever sound grating or annoying. Overall, the sounds and music in FTL add just as much to the experience as the visuals, if not a bit more.Problems:For all that I've said about the game being fantastic, it does have a bit of a flaw that some people may find irritating. The way you unlock ships straddles the border between a good progress system, and an annoying grind, especially with many of the type B or random event ships. To unlock Type B cruisers, you must complete two of the corresponding ship's achievements, which can be anything from a normal run, to a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ (I'm looking at you Rock Cruiser.) On top of that, there's a secret ship owned by the crystal race which has two methods of unlocking: Complete a series of random events, dependent upon about fifty thousand different dice rolls going perfectly, or beat the game with every other ship's (excluding the new Lanius cruiser) Type A and Type B configurations.  That said, none of the ships are objectively better than the others, and are really just built to suit different playstyles.Final Thoughts:FTL is a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, for a bargain price of $10, about the same as going to a movie. If you feel that FTL might not be the game for you, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale to try it. For those of you intrigued by the concept of a spaceship simulator, or like strategy games, buy it. You won't be disappointed.			",81,16,3,8,2,1,4

When I say unforgiving, I mean unforgiving.  Just about everything is out to get you: Pirates, Rebel Ships, and Giant Alien Spiders make up only a tiny portion of the people who want to tear your ship apart peice by peice. You have to survive the constant onslaught with just your wits, carefully balancing your systems and crew to quickly end conflicts with as little damage as possible. In between events, you jump from point to point on a map of your current sector, which can hold shops, distress signals, and other miscellaneous warp points. As you travel through the galaxy, you'll acquire new crew, weapons, and systems to fight the ever-stronger enemies, in an arms race to the Federation Base, culminating into a final boss fight that will put your ship, and your skills, to the test. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and even on easy mode you will find yourself dying over and over. If you can get past the difficulty curve of the game, you'll find that it offers a very deep and rewarding experience, which will keep you coming back time and again.Visuals:The visuals in FTL are simplisitic, and two-dimensional, this doesn't mean that they are bad however. The game's art is fantastic, with the various ships, weapons, and aliens all having a unique look that suits their particular traits. The environments in this game are gorgious, with backgrounds of deep space, nebulae, and planets that never seem to get old.Writing:FTL's writing is funny, adding a bit of levity to an overall tense game. Many of the random events are incredibly out in left field, and the writing capitalizes on this, such as in the case of the aforementioned Giant Spiders. That said, the writing isn't all jokes, and also does a fantastic job of building the universe. In many of the encounters you are offered a chance to let enemy ships surrender, with really humanizes each encounter, and provides a moral dillemma with each ship you encounter. Often the rebels really aren't that dedicated to the cause, and are just average joes conscripted to help, and whether you should kill them or not is up to you.Music:One of the best aspects of this game is it's sound design. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game, with beautiful ambient music to accompany the lulls in the action, and tense tracks during tough battles. All the music in FTL is very electronic, most easily described as a mix of Chiptune, Ambient, and Trance. The music is relaxing enough to play a long session without getting boring, and engaging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat during some of the harder fights in the game. The sound effects of the various weapons, crew, and environmental hazards all fit perfectly, and can repeat without ever sound grating or annoying. Overall, the sounds and music in FTL add just as much to the experience as the visuals, if not a bit more.Problems:For all that I've said about the game being fantastic, it does have a bit of a flaw that some people may find irritating. The way you unlock ships straddles the border between a good progress system, and an annoying grind, especially with many of the type B or random event ships. To unlock Type B cruisers, you must complete two of the corresponding ship's achievements, which can be anything from a normal run, to a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ (I'm looking at you Rock Cruiser.) On top of that, there's a secret ship owned by the crystal race which has two methods of unlocking: Complete a series of random events, dependent upon about fifty thousand different dice rolls going perfectly, or beat the game with every other ship's (excluding the new Lanius cruiser) Type A and Type B configurations.  That said, none of the ships are objectively better than the others, and are really just built to suit different playstyles.Final Thoughts:FTL is a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, for a bargain price of $10, about the same as going to a movie. If you feel that FTL might not be the game for you, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale to try it. For those of you intrigued by the concept of a spaceship simulator, or like strategy games, buy it. You won't be disappointed.			",81,16,3,8,2,1,4

												Remember the old text based adventures that were choice based? Probably not.But FTL is kinda like that only that you gain some level of control over your fate. A lot of things are randomly generated so you can't really plan ahead.You are the mastermind of a ship and its crew, you are fighting against time to get across space. In order to survive the many ordeals of spacefaring you need to get money to recruit people, buy fuel, missiles and ship parts. You can also flat out upgrade the ship and the parts you own. But since you can't plan ahead you never know what you need, and neither are the shop offering the same items or are in the same place. So that's a game of dice. In the end you will most likely die on your way to the goal, but you learned some sort of valuable lesson, probably. You will feel frustrated but also ready to get right up in the saddle and try again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don'r really know what to say about this game that hasn't been said already. I've been playing since release and after years it still feels good and I still feel like I want to play more. I remember after having finished it so many times I was looking for more outside of it (and I found Out There, which is great but very different).This is a modern classic for me. PRO+ it never gets boring+ it's easy to pickup but hard to master+ it's always different+ it's rich of secretsCON- it eats up your lifeSTEAM CONTROLLER: with a good config the Steam Controller really shines on this game.

												I have seen several youtubers play, FTL. And ever since I have wanted to own FTL myself. However when I bought it and hoped into the game, it was very difficult at first and I had to re-try after countless times of dying to the same Mantis Pirate ship. Eventually I got through that. I guess what i am trying to say is that, FTL requires alot of trial and error, as there many different ways that you can interact in any given situation. So I recommend the game to everyone as long as they are okay dying on that first few attempts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When strategy meets action, there's a slim chance for success. FTL doesn't know what a no-win situation is, and smashes through the gaming barrier of the two genres with pinpoint accuracy. This game belongs in your library. Here's why:Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of you in a tiny little vessel struggling to stay ahead of a fleet that is gunning for you with big, nasty battle-cruisers capable of vaporizing your ship and your crew with it....but not if you're clever.FTL puts you in the seat of the captain, granting you the freedom to wage war, (or not) at your discretion. You place people at the con, promote others to chief engineer, or grant them control over the weapon systems. It's up to you, and their lives are riding on your ability to think on your feet. If you've ever seen an episode of Star Trek, you know that things don't ever go the way you plan them to. The same applies here. Should you grant sanctuary to a rogue mantis? Will you risk the lives of your crew to stop a fire spreading on a colony? Dare you grant mercy to the crew of the warships trying to kill you?The choices are real, and the consequences can come back to haunt you on your next jump. So many times have I been stuck staring at the screen, with the grim understanding that I've just backed myself into a corner. However improbable though, your split-second decisions can turn the tide of war in your favor, yielding great riches or rare devices for your ship.The soundtrack is stimulating. With a score by Ben Prunty that not only keeps you pumped, but grants that delightful sense of immersion through ambience, you'll be wanting the OST by the end of your first playthrough. Invest in the soundtrack bundle.The dialogue is believable, and well-crafted. You'll never meet a situation that you're bored by, as you meet not only malicious bounty hunters, but obscure traders who sell black-market goods in the dark corners of the galaxy. With the ability to name and customize your crew, the chance to lose yourself in the cast of your very own sci-fi thriller is quite likely.You'll get attached to ships. You'll invest great time and effort into crafting the perfect frigate or cruiser, stealth bomber or invasion drop-ship as you find new and creative ways to travel the universe. You'll regret losing crew-mates, and you'll feel genuine rage at the overwhelmingly intelligent AI as they access the weaknesses of your vessel and turn your ship into a bucket of holes.Most of all though; you'll never look back and question that this game was money well-spent. FTL is a must-have for any person who wants to get infinite-replay value on the bridge of a starship. Don't take my word for it though...*points ahead*Thrusters on full.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The more you play the better you will get and you'll finally be able to get to the end. It is a new experience each time you play with things going from good to bad in an instant. Highly recommend.

												Firstly the soundtrack to this game is awesome, fits the feel of the game perfectly. FTL is pretty challenging with the hardest difficulty being normal, but that is hard enough. It takes lots of critical thinking and luck to win this game, due to limited resources and time, and managing all of the ships systems, crew members, and enemies either shooting you, teleporting onto your ship, and/or sending drones to attack.  A few missed attacks and you could go from a clear victory to death against the wrong opponent.  Great indie title that everyone should consider.			",419,101,11,64,28,6,69

												When I first played this game I must admit that it was not the file obtained from Steam that I was using.  However, after playing FTL for a while it has become one of my favourite games and the effort that has been put into creating this game is immense, so evident in fact that I bought the game because the developers simply deserve it.  Through an intoxicating mix of luck, strategy, and permadeath, this game presents players with countless scenarios and tools that can be used to progress throughout the galaxy.  The gameplay is incredible and very rogue-esque allowing for a modern incarnation of a game viewed as a classic by many.  The atmosphere generated by the universe of the game encourages great immersion and the soundtrack within FTL is one of the best I have ever heard.  Oh, and kudos to Subset Games for their uncommon chivalry in making a huge expansion pack for the game free to all players.  This sort of thing is not seen much anymore and it is a testament to just how much the developers care about the players who have invested in this amazing experience.  I am looking forward to any new adventure that Subset develops and I will without a doubt be playing it.  FTL is an incredible game that achieves everything it sets out to achieve and more, the game deserves nothing less than full marks and I recommend it to everyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FTL is a hilarious game where you control a spaceship and fight against rebels. This game just blows your mind with awesome moments. I'm not the type of player that likes singleplayers, but when I saw a stream of this game it seemed good. After buying it and getting more than 25 hours of gameplay I couldn't beat the game in easy. Even though its a really hard game you enjoy every moment you play. Everyone that had played this game remembers the giant alien spiders or having fire in all your ship. This are just some of the amazing memories this game gives you. Know it is time for the soundtrack, the soundtrack can't be described with words. Is just an amazing piece of work that improves the quality of your gameplay exponentially, the music makes you relax and enjoy each scene. It gets you pumped up when you need it and makes you think about buying the soundtrack of the game. If you don't want to spend a lot of money in games or you don't have a powerful PC I recommend you this game with all my heart. It's worth every penny, and you can easily get more than 150 hours if you enjoy the game. It haves a lot of scenarios, races, ships and 2 types of edition. If you get bored of the normal edition you can try the advanced edition. The game can be repetitive, but even after some time you get to enjoy everything about Faster Than Light.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from Metal Slug, there aren't many pixel-graphic games that I enjoy. I know, I shouldn't go around judging games based on their graphics, and I don't. I just haven't played many pixelized games.The game itself is pretty good, it's rather strategic. The goal is to navigate your way to the boss, fighting through all sorts of randomly generated areas and enemy ships, with your ship. You have control of individual crewmembers, and those have different characteristics depending on what race (species?) they are. These crewmembers have different roles, all systems and weapons need crew manning them to be usable, and there has to be a pilot at the helm or your ship cannot dodge any attacks at all. Enemy crew can invade your ship, and your people have the ability to fight them off. Systems, weapons, and the hull can be damaged, and the crew has the ability to repair them all. While ship shapes are unchangable, there are a variety to unlock and some have special perks, and you have some options on what systems and weapons to place inside and on your ship, all of which impact your ship's combat capability. The boss is incredibly hard though. I've lost track of how many times I've gotten to it, but I've never beaten it once. It apparently has several stages, but I've only ever gotten past the first. In honesty, I'm not sure if $9.99 is worth a video game like this. Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but there's not very much in it and repetitiveness, for me, detracts from the appeal of a game. (I'm really iffy about prices for games... I don't think any game ever will be worth $60, unless inflation drives currency there.) I'd recommend this at full price, if you can totally spare the money, but if it's on sale? It's a great deal.Another thing I want to note is the game's music. The game itself is enjoyable, but the music is on another darn level. There was a time when I'd plug in both of my ear-phones, search up the soundtrack, and listen to it with my eyes closed. It literally gave me goosebumps and chills. I'm no expert in music or music analyzation, but I think this needs an award for its music. (Steam Awards, darn it.)I don't review often. I think this is my second or third time reviewing, and this may just be me rambling like an idiot, but thanks for sparing time to read through this. Have a good day, evening, or night, and... uh... yeah... stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People who think games like Dark Souls is hard have probably never played FTL before. This strategy game where you control a space-ship that is running away from the Rebel fleet in an attempt to save the galaxy is honestly one of the most difficult rouge-like's that I've ever played. There were so many times when I'd reach the final boss of the game with max health and soon find my ship completely destroyed in mere moments simply because they'd breach my defenses before I could even graze their ship. This unforgiving game only lets you have one life throughout the whole game, and finding that the game runs on the weirdest random number generator doesn't exactly make things a lot easier on the player. The different weapons and ships make this game a hell of a lot more interesting, as you constantly have to make changes to your every move throughout the entire game. One moment, you may be dominating a supply ship to the point where they try to flee; but they can't because you shot down their engines. The next, the exact same thing is happening to you. With the new Advanced Edition, the entire game pretty much was changed and rebalanced (Flak is the most OP weapon. Get as much as you can). This game deserves a 9/10, for it's only problem being that unlocking new ships is too vague for most people to get, and with it's weird random number generator it makes it nearly impossible to determine if ""this gameplay will get me a new ship to use"".

												Captain Picard is my favourite character, since he's a pretty faithful recreation. Worf is made out of rocks, for some reason, and they just decided to cut Riker altogether. It's recommended that you buy a replica Starfleet uniform and elevate your chair on some sort of platform before playing. Remember not to simply click the buttons, but to actively shout ""Divert power from the engines to the shield generator! Charge the main lasers!"" Your neighbors will hate you and move away. 8/10			",113,26,1,12,11,0,11

												A rogue-like space mission in which you must deliver the last hope of a dying Federation in a marathon trip through several varied sectors. Your journey is restricted both by your limited fuel and the approaching Rebel fleet, so grinding isn't really an option. Each game should take around a half hour to an hour and a half and there is a nearly endless combination of weapons and modules to experiment with. Everything is controlled by very simple resources and upgrade trees, keeping the learning curve short. All great things which make for a great game. What I couldn't get over, and what drains a good portion of the fun out of this game for me, is just how random a rogue-like. It is nearly impossible to set a goal beyond survival and success. Various weapon combinations might excite you, but there is no guarantee you'll ever get a shot at testing them. The trade off here is, of course, that each playthrough is unique and if that's what you're looking for, FTL is perfect for you. However, if you look to strategy games for intense planning and not the fun a constant wrench in the works makes for, this might not be the game for you.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Not sure how to classify FTL in terms of genre or playstyle, as it's pretty unique. It's a roguelike space simulator where you control your crew and ship as you race through various solar systems towards the end game. An individual game maybe lasts an hour or two or until you die (can be much sooner), but while winning is the goal, trying out new tactics and combinations of weapons is the fun part of the game.You control a few crew members in a ship with various parts. You can assign a crewman to pilot the ship, one to control the ship's shields, and have a third crew rotate between manning the weapons systems and doing ship repairs. When you get into a fight, your ship takes localized damage that interferes with your ship's functions in every way. Thus, combat is a game of maintaining your ship and taking out the enemy as quickly as possible to minimize the mayhem they cause. Sometimes your ship will be boarded and you'll have to determine how to kill the enemy crew who are breaking stuff and attacking your own crew while trying to destroy an enemy ship that is likely still shooting you. The game has a million tactical possibilities every playthrough and is wildly popular.It's cheap, and if you've got enough patience to play a game where the journey is the enjoyment, not the ending, you'll probably like FTL.

												FTL is a game that you WILL die to, and that should definitely not make you quit. Due to this game's AMAZING replayability, every run will be different, you will never have the exact same run, which is exciting in every form.The music is definitely rememberable, for a small team of course.Ever since Advanced edition came out, the game has even more to offer, you can even alter your playing style, do you prefer sheer weapon power, Boarding tactics, or do you want a mass drone army?The game offers many variety of ships, from the default Kestral to the Lanius cruiser, each with their own unique playing style which is sure to fit some people!The line is, FTL is an amazing game, it's not for someone that doesn't likes its genre, but if you like Rogue Indie games, get this masterpiece. You won't regret it.			",49,6,1,7,6,0,5

												Pro:1- Each vessel are unique in their kind whatever the race you control the alternative ships give you a different experience.2- Each race have their own attributes3- There's no perfect ship! Some prefer to play defensively as other like rush like a pig in the trash! You can be succesful as long you anticipated the dangers.4- The game is harder than it may look like. Harder in a good way, i mean contrary to other games of the same kind the CPU intelligence doesn't cheat, it use indepth strategy like an another human player would do.5- Music are awesome.6- Intuitive control7- High replayabilityCon:1- Avanced mode is easier than normal mode. So i would suggest to new players to start in advanced mode to learn the mechanics before going to normal mode where the game is much more balanced, so by definition much harder.2- As this is a ""rogue-like"" game, you can't save! Well you can it you make backup of the continue savefile, but there is no properly save-file system, so new player in this kind of game may get more time to learn the mechanic as they will often die early in the game...

												Boy...This is a tricky one.I'm not going to NOT recommend it. It's a good game, that's for sure, and I don't regret buying it. I've only played 7 hours so far, but there's no doubt I'll sink in some more hours so... yeah, it's a good game.But it's really not as marvellous and great and perfect as some reviews suggest. For one thing, this game does not have ""awesome random events"". The game IS one gigantic random event. There's really nothing you can do that you are SURE will bring in positive or negative outcomes. This total lack of control feels refreshing at times, but it's more frustrating than anything else in my opinion. Some randomness is good, but to me, things get old pretty fast when everything works on a dice roll.Other than that, the game is pretty hard and unforgiving. Good change of pace, considering the amount of titles that get thrown at our face where actions have no consequences. So don't get too attached to your crew... you'll see them die soon enough.So... yeah. I like this game. But it's not the game of the century. It got so much praise that I guess I'm just a tad disappointed. Actually, I see it more as a time killer, kind of like Eufloria (yes, I did just compare FTL to Eufloria. Go figure).But hey, that's just my opinion. Grab it for 2 or 3 bucks on sale and make your own opinion, you probably won't regret it.			",73,27,0,24,28,0,42

												There is a learning curve to this game and when you learn what to do you don't feel like you've learnt what to do because you just die. I died fighting the first ship and ever since then when i thought i was getting the better i would get 360 no scoped and would have to start over again. The game is pretty fun but you have to restart the game over again which is punishing and there is no save point so if you have to go you gotta go and restart. The combat system is good but the game wasn't really fun because i just kept dieing. For $10 this game is alright but if you want to get a game where you just die you might as well get Dark Souls tbh. Dark Souls indie space Ship Edition. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredibly fun. A bit of a learning curve, especially in managing your crew during combat, choosing the right weapons and upgrades, but once you get the hand of it, FTL is an incredibly addictive roguelike strategy-rpg. Don't mind dying a lot, I've lost the game nearly a hundred times hahaha, but it's a satisfying loss: you know what you did wrong, you learn from past mistakes and your next run is closer than the last one to victory.

												What is there to say about FTL other than it is an amazing game that can provide you hours of limitless fun. The wide range of weaponry allows for a variety of play styles and can keep speedrunners and explorers alike entertained. The real gem is the games combat system which allows for on the fly tactical decision making that can impact the fate of your ship and her crew, all at the slip of misplaced energy bars.The graphics of the game are charming, and allow for those with lower end computers to enjoy the same fun as people with more expensive rigs. While it may be a turn-off for some, the simplified blocky art style showcases the gritty and fearful nature of the game and what lies beyond the great expanse of space Procedural generation makes it so that no 2 adventures are the same, however the same cannot be said about the specific encounters or battles as they will inevitably repeat themselves. This can become annoying over multiple playthroughs, but overall will not detract from the game as a whole.In conclusion, I would reccomend this game to someone who has always wanted to be at the helm of their very own starship, or someone who just needs a casual breakaway from your everyday AAA-cookie cutter title.Rating: 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FTL is pretty much everything you see on an episode of Star Trek.  That's literally what it is; Star Trek: The Game.  Want to divert power from weapons into shields?  By gum, you can.  Want to use your scanners to avoid enemy ships?  A valid strategy!  Do you not take a deal with the Slugs because they tend to rip you off?  Well, depends on how much you need it.Officially, FTL is a rouge-like-like.  Each round is short, usually playable in one sitting, and will vary from every other round immensely.  With fantastic music and brilliant story situations, I would highly recommend this to anyone that sees games above a simple entertainment venue as well as anyone who wanted to be Captain Kirk when they were a kid.  Both categories of people, and many more at that, will be completely satisfied.			",94,24,2,5,7,0,5

												Let me just start off by saying that I adore this game any other roguelike I currently own. It's a fantastic piece of work that almost seamlessly melds roguelike and strategy that's unforgiving in the hands of a novice but nontetheless rewarding and worth replaying constantly. It has the best soundtrack of any indie game I've played thus far, and making it a dynamic soundtrack with idle and battle versions definitely helped that. The writing is also interesting and clever, and definitely making it worth a try for any fan of sci-fi. Advanced Edition, the recent free expansion, expands upon the game's content by at least a third and adds yet another reason to get back at it.Regardless, I've come to dread the end level. Strategy and luck seem to go out the window in favor of luck alone. Your only real hope at winning is having fully upgraded almost everything, and if you don't have the right weapons and/or equipment you cannot hope to last the three phases of the boss. The boss presents no surprise and beating it becomes pretty formulaic. The Advanced Edition upgrades help mix it up a little and make it just a little less mind-numbing, but it still puts a dent in an otherwise near-perfect title.9.5/10			",139,18,1,16,15,0,8

												I absolutely love this game and have poured hours into it. FTL has so many amazing features, my favourite being the many different paths one can take to develop your ship to destroy your enemies in various ways. You can disable/destroy their oxygen thereby suffocating them, transport your crew into their ship and kill them from the inside, set fires throughout their ship that will eventually consume them or simply destroy their hull.  The games mechanics are almost flawless, but the storyline needs some work. In fact I pay no attention to it when I perform a run since it is the same everytime. IMO there should either be multiple storylines, or one that explains the multiple runs, like in Spelunky for instance.All in all this greatest flaw that I can see takes little from the game, and I highly suggest buying it.

												Having played FTL through multiple times, and fallen in love with the game over and over, I can officially say you should take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt. With that out of the way, I love this game.StoryThe story of FTL is a simple, yet effective one, providing just enough backstory to set the player into the universe. The galaxy was controlled by the Federation, a coalition between humans and various other races, such as the robotic Engi, and the hyper-intelligent Zoltans, until the Rebellion came. Humans were fed up with being equal with other races, and led a successful rebellion against the Federation, all but destroying it. You are the commander of a small Federation cruiser, holding the only information that can help the Federation win the war. Your task is to fly through the galaxy, racing against the Rebels, to get to the last Federation base, and inform them of the weakness of the Rebel fleet.Gameplay:FTL is played from a top-down perspective, with you, the player, in control of a spaceship, requiring you to manage weapons, shields, engines, etc. to keep the ship alive in the depths of an unforgiving galaxy. When I say unforgiving, I mean unforgiving.  Just about everything is out to get you: Pirates, Rebel Ships, and Giant Alien Spiders make up only a tiny portion of the people who want to tear your ship apart peice by peice. You have to survive the constant onslaught with just your wits, carefully balancing your systems and crew to quickly end conflicts with as little damage as possible. In between events, you jump from point to point on a map of your current sector, which can hold shops, distress signals, and other miscellaneous warp points. As you travel through the galaxy, you'll acquire new crew, weapons, and systems to fight the ever-stronger enemies, in an arms race to the Federation Base, culminating into a final boss fight that will put your ship, and your skills, to the test. This game is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, and even on easy mode you will find yourself dying over and over. If you can get past the difficulty curve of the game, you'll find that it offers a very deep and rewarding experience, which will keep you coming back time and again.Visuals:The visuals in FTL are simplisitic, and two-dimensional, this doesn't mean that they are bad however. The game's art is fantastic, with the various ships, weapons, and aliens all having a unique look that suits their particular traits. The environments in this game are gorgious, with backgrounds of deep space, nebulae, and planets that never seem to get old.Writing:FTL's writing is funny, adding a bit of levity to an overall tense game. Many of the random events are incredibly out in left field, and the writing capitalizes on this, such as in the case of the aforementioned Giant Spiders. That said, the writing isn't all jokes, and also does a fantastic job of building the universe. In many of the encounters you are offered a chance to let enemy ships surrender, with really humanizes each encounter, and provides a moral dillemma with each ship you encounter. Often the rebels really aren't that dedicated to the cause, and are just average joes conscripted to help, and whether you should kill them or not is up to you.Music:One of the best aspects of this game is it's sound design. This game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game, with beautiful ambient music to accompany the lulls in the action, and tense tracks during tough battles. All the music in FTL is very electronic, most easily described as a mix of Chiptune, Ambient, and Trance. The music is relaxing enough to play a long session without getting boring, and engaging enough to keep you on the edge of your seat during some of the harder fights in the game. The sound effects of the various weapons, crew, and environmental hazards all fit perfectly, and can repeat without ever sound grating or annoying. Overall, the sounds and music in FTL add just as much to the experience as the visuals, if not a bit more.Problems:For all that I've said about the game being fantastic, it does have a bit of a flaw that some people may find irritating. The way you unlock ships straddles the border between a good progress system, and an annoying grind, especially with many of the type B or random event ships. To unlock Type B cruisers, you must complete two of the corresponding ship's achievements, which can be anything from a normal run, to a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ (I'm looking at you Rock Cruiser.) On top of that, there's a secret ship owned by the crystal race which has two methods of unlocking: Complete a series of random events, dependent upon about fifty thousand different dice rolls going perfectly, or beat the game with every other ship's (excluding the new Lanius cruiser) Type A and Type B configurations.  That said, none of the ships are objectively better than the others, and are really just built to suit different playstyles.Final Thoughts:FTL is a great game that will provide hours of entertainment, for a bargain price of $10, about the same as going to a movie. If you feel that FTL might not be the game for you, I recommend waiting until it goes on sale to try it. For those of you intrigued by the concept of a spaceship simulator, or like strategy games, buy it. You won't be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not sure how to classify FTL in terms of genre or playstyle, as it's pretty unique. It's a roguelike space simulator where you control your crew and ship as you race through various solar systems towards the end game. An individual game maybe lasts an hour or two or until you die (can be much sooner), but while winning is the goal, trying out new tactics and combinations of weapons is the fun part of the game.You control a few crew members in a ship with various parts. You can assign a crewman to pilot the ship, one to control the ship's shields, and have a third crew rotate between manning the weapons systems and doing ship repairs. When you get into a fight, your ship takes localized damage that interferes with your ship's functions in every way. Thus, combat is a game of maintaining your ship and taking out the enemy as quickly as possible to minimize the mayhem they cause. Sometimes your ship will be boarded and you'll have to determine how to kill the enemy crew who are breaking stuff and attacking your own crew while trying to destroy an enemy ship that is likely still shooting you. The game has a million tactical possibilities every playthrough and is wildly popular.It's cheap, and if you've got enough patience to play a game where the journey is the enjoyment, not the ending, you'll probably like FTL.

Due to this game's AMAZING replayability, every run will be different, you will never have the exact same run, which is exciting in every form.The music is definitely rememberable, for a small team of course.Ever since Advanced edition came out, the game has even more to offer, you can even alter your playing style, do you prefer sheer weapon power, Boarding tactics, or do you want a mass drone army?The game offers many variety of ships, from the default Kestral to the Lanius cruiser, each with their own unique playing style which is sure to fit some people!The line is, FTL is an amazing game, it's not for someone that doesn't likes its genre, but if you like Rogue Indie games, get this masterpiece.

												This is just one of those games that you have to play. The fun lies in the challenge and the limitless combinations of strategy involved in trying to beat it. Will you focus on shields and speed? will you try to maximize your cloaking technology? or will you simply but everything into your weapons and try to destroy the enemy before they get a shot off? This is a game that you can play 50 times and still find things on try 51 that you havent seen or done yet. As a note, do not expect to beat this game on your first try.			",155,29,1,25,15,0,22

												Heavily addicting little RTS game with a beautiful soundtrack! Just think Oregon Trail set in the Star Wars universe and that sums up this game perfectly. It took several playthroughs before I realized the game has more depth than it first appears, with plenty of special conditions and tests hidden thorough the game to unlock new ships. Another thing worth mentioning is the mod support, there is extensive modding community with this game that have created customized mods, an easy-to-use mod manager, and the ability to even write your own missions. My favorite mod so far has to be the one that disables the pursuing Rebel fleet allowing the player to visit every planet along the way. But even then, you won’t see everything there is to see after a few playthroughs… ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent game for the price. Despite the linear ""plot"" to the game (make your way through eight sectors of a galaxy and defeat the final boss), you are given a huge number of options in terms of HOW you tackle this task. Whether you use boarding parties, drones or just arm yourself to the teeth with powerful weapons is entirely up to you, and there is an excellent balance that makes these all viable options.A playthrough doesn't take too long, so it's the sort of game you can play (and probably finish) in a couple of hours, or you can try out different things if you have longer. This means that it's a great game to play in either short bursts or a longer session.The unlockable ships and hidden easter eggs are the cherry on the top that may well make you come back and play this game again and again- I know they did for me. I've now gotten 72 hours out of a game that cost barely anyting- and it's been a better experience than a few games five times the price. ",249,84,27,35,36,7,65

												In my honest opinion, FTL is amazing.When it was the standard edition I thought it was pretty good, and I still put quite a few hours into it, but to me it felt like it was just a little lacking.  After playing through a few times, I had decided upon my normal strategy, and varied little through different play throughs.  That may not be a problem for some more adventurous gamers, but after finding something that worked I just wanted to stick with it.  For me, the advanced edition solved that problem.  I thoroughly enjoy the new race, the Lanius, although my favorite part is probably the expansion of the available weapons.  Missiles, lasers, ions and beams was a good start, but often I just wished there was a little more variety in those classes themselves.  I found myself always trying to find as many 'burst laser IIs' as I could, maybe with an occasional beam weapon.  Now, I really enjoy trying to decide between the chain lasers, normal lasers, scrap throwers and ion stunners, all of which I think add a great deal of new tactics and depth to the gameplay.  Overall, I think this game is very well done, totally worth the money, and the day they come out with an FTL 2, or let you battle your ships with other players I'm sure I'll be lost in deep space for a very long time.

Last time I played a roguelike game was 25 years ago, on Unix terminals, at the computer school. It was called Fantasia, featured ASCII ""graphics"", and was extremely exciting. I remembered the excitement and decided to give FTL a shot. FTL reminded why I spent so much time on Fantasia. Roguelike games are fun, and this once is bloody excellent. Entertaining gameplay, nice music, nice graphics, and of course, permadeath ! Highly recommended !			",206,44,15,19,7,2,24

												This game though.You don't really pilot your ship, you omnisciently control it - and it's tough. If you don't die in the first system your first time, then you are inhuman. The game is incredibly unforgiving, and EVERY choice you make has an impact. Stranded civilian ship want to trade 5 missiles for two of your fuel? You run out of fuel before you can resupply at the next store, and die. Refuse a pirate trader and wind up fighting? The extra hull damage to your ship causes you to explode in the asteriod field down the way. As unforgiving as the game can be, it challenges you to make smart choices, and manage your ship cautiously and conservatively.The combat is suprisingly fun, and the sound track is quite immersive - though I don't think I would buy the standalone sound track. Everything about the game keeps you coming back for more, and it's beautiful.			",164,36,11,27,34,2,42

												Have you ever wanted to captain your own star ship and fly through the strange and dangerous depths of space? Well now is your chance but it is not for the faint of heart.In short get this, it is an awesome rogue-like space simulator and you will not regret it. Also buy the soundtrack too, it’s very catchy.This game is great fun. The ascetics are very retro and remind me of games from yesteryear. The gameplay itself is fun, challenging and highly addictive, you will want to play it through time and again. Even when the odds are against you, and they often are, you will want to fight on and try to be the hero despite your impending doom. The in game universe is already vast and highly diverse, you never know whether the next warp will be to a friendly planet, devastated space station or rebel ambush. The whole game is more or less procedurally generated so you never have the same experience twice, which keeps it fresh each time you retry.As the captain you manage what systems you have installed in your ship, what weapons you have equipped, even which crew members fly with you. There is even a basic rpg system for each crew member, so if they do die you feel a sense of lost. I remember getting very attached to the little guys.This game will kick your butt and laugh at you whilst doing it yet that is a price that is very easily paid considering how enjoyment you’ll get. This is a 100% recommend even at full price, on sale you would be crazy not to get this. And due to a recent update it’s even better. There are also mods that can be applied for an even better experience, I recommend the Captain’s editionHave fun ^_^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is only now that I have a better idea of how to play this game.If I remember correctly, I bought it at release. I just couldn't get the hang of HOW to play it, so it frustrated me to no end. That's different now.Although it looks to be very straight forward and arcady, I think it definitely is not.You need to think about a combination of upgrades and weaponry that you want to try and collect.There is a lot of random chances going on per each event that you encounter, so anything could happen to your plans.I like it a lot. For me, it is the right blend of casual and depth.I feel the artwork is wonderful. The score is decent too.There are mods for this little gem, as well. I've tried the Captain's Edition mod. Not having mastered vanilla well enough yet, the CE mod makes it a lot harder. It adds a whole lot more content, though. And more depth to the choices you are faced to make.I'm sure this game isn't for everyone. In a sense it is a rogue-like, you loose the game if you die and the only saving there is, is when you exit the game entirely. The only loading that is available is when you want to continue a game.For me, that adds to the intensity. You gotta think about your endgame, right off the start. Am I gonna go down this way? Or the other? Will I try trading with this mercenary? Or do I suspect he will board me and damage my ship?The currency used is metal scrap. You use it to trade and to upgrade your ship. You'll want to gather as much as possible  in the first two sectors, spending as few as possible until you can get your first upgrades without losing your backup scrap for repairs. Which you might need a lot.There's different ships and most ships have up to three different layouts. You unlock these through specific events or beating the game with a previous ship.Each ship has it's own pros and cons, layout and starting equipment/crew. Adapt your strategy accordingly.Wholefully recommend!			",128,39,6,21,28,0,38

												Hands down, one of my favorite strategy games ever. Typically, I play roguelikes, but as a RTS game, as much as I like them, I suck at them. Unlike FTL, its much more simpler than stuff like AoE, or WC3, therefore I love the management and gameplay. The soundtrack by Ben Prunty is definitely one of the best soundtracks in gaming, IMO. Graphics are simple, pixelly, nothing too flashy. Of course, as a roguelike, it's not for the weak, or the short fused so pray to the RNG Gods. But if there is no risk, there is no reward, right?Some of my friends don't see the appeal, but if you like RTS, or normal strategy games that are not real time then go ahead and buy this (or ask me to buy it for you).

												FTL is a very intresting and complex game, it's quite basic in terms of weapons, ships, races, sectors, and graphics. But that does not make it a basic game by any means, infact it can be the hardest game you have ever played and has almost unlimited replay value. Infact if told to, i probably would have payed double the asking price, its that good. It is a ship based game that takes place in a certain galaxy, and you, the captain need to guide your ship through 8 chalanging sectors, to save the galaxy. You have 9 completely different ships to chose from, each with their own different, races, layouts, weapons, designs, strategies, and of course types. There are currently 3 different layouts of each ship thus there are technicaly 29 different ships to chose from. Will you chose to go weapons heavy and obliverate anything that comes in your way,(limited by, luck.) or will you chose to methodicaly board and take out your enemies for better rewards the choice is usually yours. Luck is a huge factor in this game, but dont let luck control you! Be the bettter pilot and lead the Federation to victory!			",93,6,0,11,10,1,21

												It's the middle of the night here but I just had to post this after another great run.Is this game hard to learn? Yes.Will you die a lot? Yes.Has it multiple difficulty modes? YesSo Easy mode is easy? HELL NO!BUT you WILL get the hang of it and find tactics for each ship. After 30h gameplay i just had to give it a good review and support this amazing game. You need to buy this, it is so satisfying to finally beat that Flagship or unlock a new ship!And every ship and crew has a new feel and challenge.The free expansion also adds wonderfull extra possibilities and challenges.I seriously can't name a single bad thing about this game!

												Fun rogue-like game, the first of its kind I have seen (I am not too familiar with this genre of games). Set in space to great ambient music, you jump from area to area hoping to maintain your supplies and upgrade your ship, and avoid tough enemies. There are enough conditions in place to give you the feeling of a ship trying to outrun a  fleet and deliver a message, the game wonderfully blending in plot with mechanics, and each playthrough is different enough to be worth another. Great challenging and fun game.			",133,39,1,19,8,2,38

												Insanely addictive. I've lost hours to this game in ways I haven't seen since Civilization II. You keep wanting to say, ""Just one more system"" or ""Just one more run"". Basically, it's a roguelike. Procedurally generated sectors (levels) with random encounters, and the threat of the rebels on your heels pushing you forward. Upgrade your ship, hire new crew, and hope you're prepared enough for the final battle. I funded this game on KickStarter so I got early access to it and I've already put in a dozen hours. This game is absolutely worth the price of admission.			",111,42,2,14,10,5,25

												Most people think that managing a space shuttle is as easy as eating a fry: 2 steps and nothing can go wrong. But in FTL they add not only mayonaise and ketchup but also many others like wasabi and cheese sauce, that don't really fit. In this game, there's only one sauce for every situation. Picking the wrong one is NOT an option. Combining sauces is the thing you do on higher difficulties. They HAVE to match.			",71,11,0,20,2,0,9

												Disclaimer: Have you ever wandered trough Steam, checking out several games, their screenshots, checking them out to add to the wishlist (or buying them right there on the spot)? Well, I did. It was a cold winter sales, Steam made a huge sale on this game, the screenshots didn't promise much but since I'm generally hyped for Sci-Fi ships games I went away and got it. Well, it was cheap, it was indie (I like to support indie developers) so it wouldn't be a total loss. I downloaded the game (pretty small download) and the next few hours of my life were lost in this brilliant masterpiece.This game is an RTS/RPG mixture in wich you have your own ship and crew with minimalistic graphics, you travel trough space and sometimes you encounter some enemy ships (or you decide to turn hostile on them). You have to controll your crew and the game ends when they die. Pretty easy until here right? Now add up the fact that you have several modules on your ship, upgrades, money, fuel and ammunition. Getting more complex isn't it? Now add up the fact that you are prompted with most of the choices you have to do like, for example, you detect a ship who's requesting help, you go near it and they approach you with a question like: ""We got out of fuel, could you give us some?"" and then they prompt you with 2 choices: a) Give them the fuel (and wander if they'll give you something when you reach a safe spot or maybe you're just a good soul); b) Kill them and steal their money and ammunition. All of this and much more, make one of the most fun, innovative and immersive games I've played recently.Overall: 9/10Words can't describe this game at all. It's a immersive experience without using pretty graphics. Using it's own originality it conquered a space among most of the AAA games I've played and I don't regret a single penny from what I paid.PS: They upgrade everyone to Advanced Edition without asking for a single extra buck, +1 for that!

												This 2-d overhead starship-crew simulator is deceptively indepth.  Each time you start up a new game, you will get a fresh ship and crew, which you must help survive through all the sectors until a final boss confrontation at the end.Whether you complete your mission or are destroyed, nothing carries over to your next playthrough, but you are able to unlock  several new ship types and alternate starting loadouts for the ships.  There is some slight customization, you can rename your ship and each starting crewmember, and adjust crewmen colors.When presented with options, you'll have to weigh the safety of your crew with the chance to acquire extra scrap.  Remember, noone is safe in a galaxy of terror, so try not to get attached to your crew.  You'll have the chance to recruit new members through hiring at space stations or rescuing them from slavers, and it is an enjoyable experience trying to preserve their lives while at the same time trying to protect your ship from enemy attacks.You'll often have to make decisions that will have serious consequences.  Do you hang around in one sector longer in order to aquire extra resources, at the risk of the rebel fleet catching up to you and forcing a fight with an elite enemy in order to jump to the next sector?  Do you choose to travel into a nebula where your sensors are useless and your engine's power is halved, but giving you more time to improve your ship while the rebel fleet moves more slowly through the nebula as well?The simple graphics are charming in their own way, the sound effects adequate.  The tension from fights are relieved by the ability to pause at any time to queue up actions, but you'll still find yourself tensing up whenever the enemy ship fires rockets, to see if they harmlessly fly by or hit a key system.As for combat, their are multiple ways you can set your ship up.  You can focus on rapid fire enery weapons that knock down shields fast and allow you to use heavy beams to sweep across several rooms of the enemy ship.  You can focus on building up drone units, that launch and circle the enemy ship doing constant damage, or defensive drones that knock down missles before they can hit, or drones that travel throughout your ship, repairing the hull and fighting intruders.  You can install a teleportation chamber and send your hardiest crew members directly over to fight the enemy crew.The total package makes for an engaging experience that first party companies try to achieve with huge budgets and complex systems.  It is a game you can play as a small diversion when you have 20 minutes, coming back to your save when you can, or you can spend hours at a time cruising the galaxy.  If you can appreciate the gameplay despite the dated presentation of the graphics, I would definitely recommend FTL.			",39,6,0,7,3,0,2

												Definately recommend this game. I have over 116 hours plugged in and I have no intention of slowing down. You play with a top down view of your ship and you control your crew as you command them to manage systems, repair your ship, fight boarders, and put out fires. Thoughout the game you advance through 8 different sectors before finally defending your base against the federalists' super-ship. The game is however, made up of many mini-encounters with a little decision based story at each jump beacon, where you can fight other ships, purchase unknown weapons and visit stores. Although I have long since worn out the different situations and each playthrough (a single game lasts roughly three hours for me) is more a question of which assortment of randomely generated content I will encounter rather than the exploration of the game it used to be, I will say that in the games defense I have played over 100 hours. This game offers extensive, if not infinate, replayability and is a placeholder in games of it's genre.			",18,2,0,2,3,0,1

												Just buy this game. You want a challenge that is completely satisfying, even when you and all your closest friends (because you named your crew of course) die just because you forgot to turn your oxygen back on or some other hilarious reason? I played through this game probably 20-30 times before I beat the mother ship the first time. Every single second was worth it.Buy it, sale or no sale, it will be worth any amount of dollars you spend on it. Also, - dont judge my play time. I sank around 100 hours into the game before I realized I loved it enough to buy it. I bought it on steam, and on the ipad. BUY IT and you won't be disappointed. Support these great developers.

												Awesome game.  Very reminiscent of the Flash-powered games I used to play every day on Newgrounds and Armored Games.  Very, very addictive.  It is a very hard strategy game, and it can get a bit frustrating, but it is worth the $2.49 sale price easily.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												Pros:Great replay value with many ship types, randomly generated sector maps and ""challenging"" difficulty.Cons:This game's hard mode isn't just hard, it's randomly hard, which limits the possibility of compensating with your own skill. You live and die by the will of RNG. One time you get to sector 8 by the skin of your teeth, without finding any decent weapon, another time you find a Chain Vulcan just floating in space in the first sector. Same goes for enemies you encounter. It's also regrettable that the game doesnt have steam achievements.[edit]After additional 50h of playing I've come to a conclusion that the game actually scales enemies' setups (shields, weapons, engine strength) according to how good weapons/drones you own (even if you can't yet use them), making the game easier for unlucky runs and harder for lucky runs. It diminishes the role of RNG a bit, making it possible for skilled players to make do with what little they find.			",152,73,2,37,29,1,8

												I bought this from GOG one day.First time I played, I played ten hours straight. I could not stop. FTL became a brief obsession. Every mistake matters. You die, you lose, no take backs. This is my story.A risky jump landed us into a tense firefight next to an exploding star, setting fire to random portions of our ship. The oxygen and shields went out. One of the crew desperately tried to get the oxygen back. He succeeded, but he was trapped. The medbay is on the other side of the flames. There was nothing I could have done. Jonas Flake. Engineer, soldier, and friend. Died on 4042 AD at 1600 hours. He saved us all.  We will carry on.			",125,24,1,6,9,1,20

												This game is awesome and does what a lot of games I've seen attempted but can't exactly pull off. Don't let the graphics throw you (though if that's your hang up, clearly the game isn't for you) and check it out. Be prepared to die a lot though. It is not an easy game. But the challenge is what adds to the fun. You control a star ship, the mission is simple (get from point A to point B) but the encounters in between are what will test both your wits and reaction. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed (unless you hate space games, in which case I hate your face).			",616,96,7,131,25,4,100

												An excellent game. Every playthrough is different, just in a rogue-like. The dev's really hit the nail on the head in the combat. The learning curve isn't too difficult to your modern day gamer, and is a delight to old classic gamers. If you haven't picked this one up yet, I highly suggest you do. A lot of unlockables that don't even get achieved on your first playthrough, and even then lots of different ways to play. The game has a customized way to play, and a lot of replayability.

												At the time of posting I have exactly 100 games on steam, and because of my limited time most of them are untouched. Yet somehow FTL still has over forty hours logged on it, with countless epic games engraved in my memory even though I've only actually beaten it twice. Lots of games claim to do a lot with a little, but this game has you attaching personality and sentiment to the little clusters of pixels that serve as your crew just by giving them a name and the ability to walk around.By the end of a long game, I feel like I've written--no LIVED--a novel about a hardbitten crew plying their way in an unforgiving galaxy. This game is the perfect example of situationally dependent strategy.It is a fantastic single player experience, but still long for one thing: head-to-head combat. Picture this, you and an opponent spawn at mega-store with a certain amount of scrap to kit your ships out, and then you jump into battle with each other, seeing each other for the first time. The pausing issue could be solved by just making pause time limited, or nonexistent for a real hectic challenge.+++EDIT+++The Advanced Edition content is absolutely fantastic. The new ships and lore in the form of the Lanius are an absolute joy, but veteran players will appreciate the more subtle changes. The ability to rename crew, even found crew, mid-voyage is awesome, and the ability to save crew positions and send them back there with a single click is handy as well.			",207,43,1,23,20,0,30

												An excellent game. Every playthrough is different, just in a rogue-like. The dev's really hit the nail on the head in the combat. The learning curve isn't too difficult to your modern day gamer, and is a delight to old classic gamers. If you haven't picked this one up yet, I highly suggest you do. A lot of unlockables that don't even get achieved on your first playthrough, and even then lots of different ways to play. The game has a customized way to play, and a lot of replayability.

												Do you like space? Do you like procedurally generated games? Do you like watching a bad move doom your spaceship crew to suffocate, forcing you to create a new game? Good! FTL is actually one of my favorite games ever. EVER. And the best part is, while every mistake counts, there is really no way to tell if a situation will end poorly. You just need to hope. And if you are lucky, every time you play you'll lear something new, or ghet a new ship. AND IT WILL NEVER HELP YOU TAKE ON THE FINAL BOSS			",128,19,0,17,9,1,14

												First off this game will teach you that even though you think things are going well that it can come crashing down if a mistake is made. Losing is just another learning experience that even though you may have lost right before you got further you still go back and try again because it was fun. FTL is great. Winner has never been so sweet when the last boss goes down and the VIctory message appears. I recommend starting on easy. Consistantly win then go up a difficulty. Advanced edition does come into play with its massive updates to random events, weapons, upgrades, and even new ship layouts and a new ship and a new alien. 10/10 worth every cent spent.

												One of my favorite games and one you can keep coming back to. Be warned; it is difficult and involves chance. You can and probably will get into unwinnable situations and can even make it all the way to the end but unable to win. Still, the variety of different crew, ships, challenges, and ways to specialize your ship make it fun. I love the fire weapons personally.Why blow the enemy ship up with lasers and missiles when you can light the whole thing on fire?My only criticism is that some of the unlocks require several steps and are based on certain events occuring, but there is no way to know which is right for the unlock.I think I got this on sale, but it's well worth the $10, especially now with more free content.

												There are few games that after a few hours of painstakingly doing everything to succeed, only to horribly die anyway, you think to yourself you cannot wait to do it all again. FTL is one of those games.Overall, the game is not difficult. Overall, the concept of it is rather simple. Captain your ship from A to B, and do not die in the process. However, the choices you make as a new player will most likely kill your crew. Then, as you learn what is and is not a good idea, you get a little farther. Finally, once you think you have it all down, you get over confident and get your ship blown up anyhow. To add to it all, every playthrough is random (Rogue-like) so you cannot learn a pattern to ""win"".In addtion to that replay value, you can get different ships that are unlocked through various methods, which do not necessarily make the game any easier or harder, but rather fit a certain playstyle better. Now, you could upgrade any ship to do any of these specializations (or all), but each ship also gets different crewmembers (each race has their own abilities) and layouts.tl;dr Do yourself a favor and get this game!

												While an average game in FTL lasts for maybe 30 min tops, this took me 23 hours to complete. I think that's a testimony how good this game can be. I absolutely love this game and although it is a hard game for me, I feel like it doesn't get boring since new try is so easy to begin. After advanced edition content, the game got even more versatile and I feel I will return to this later on. Musics are excellent, although somewhat annoyingly change too quickly when jumping to combat. Graphics are clear and look good. Visual feedback could be somewhat better, but it's a small flaw barely worth mentioning.If you like games, get this. If you don't like games, get this anyway so they keep making more.If one wants to find flaws in it, missing steam achievements is one. Hardly any other comes to mind and I'm not going to spend time just to find one real flaw.			",193,41,1,16,12,4,50

												If you like Star Wars or geek over spaceships,this is the game for you. I don't, but I still caught myself rambling on about the difference between Ion and Laser weapons, how many alien races are in the game, ship types, etc. So this game sets up a science fiction world that you quickly become immersed in, and once you boot this game up, it's hard to stop playing.As you may have seen from gameplay (or firsthand experienc), this is an RPG. Even if you don't really like RPGs, the game's space combat is easy to pick up but hard to master. In FTL, it also helps to be lucky. Depending on that, you can get more valuable scrap material to buy weapons from stores or upgrade your ship. You can also randomly get quests to unlock more spaceships, so there is variety in that aspect to. Just don't expect to beat the game on your first try.			",65,6,0,1,3,0,4

												It's certainly addicting and fun, at least while you're doing well. Not to mention that using built-in exploits and leadership skills (read: tag-teaming boarders and fires, or luring said boarders into the med bay and fighting them with heals) can be pretty gratifying. However, I find a large margin of error to be the fact that it's just as fortuitous as, well, real space travel and war... in our present with our technology. Seriously, what kind of faster-than-light spaceship crew doesn't have anything better than a fire extinguisher? Why can't we isolate the cabins to vent oxygen only from the ones that are on fire? What material did they build it from that is so mysteriously flammable? And once you think you've got the timing of the weapons right and everything, and you've fully upgraded your shields and you've got decent weapons and a dependable dodge rating, the flagship puts up a kind of underwhelming fight... at least until suddenly your entire med bay is on fire and your crew drops dead because the system is too damaged for heals while you're still getting battered by the flagship but since all hands are on deck (and dying) to put out the stupid fire then your shields reload as slow as molasses in a vaccum and then you just die. Like you never even spent any time working your butt off to get your ship the best it can be, all those thrilling escapes and chases by the rebel fleet and the times you went six jumps with three hull points left and got to a repair station by the skin of your teeth, like those never even happened. And why? So you can do it all again. Nothing compared to the rush I get when I start off a fresh adventure, but it's agonizing to have to start from the bottom every time, considering this is the only permadeath-upgrade-your-way-unscripted-rpg game that I own or have ever played. No idea why I keep coming back to it, but I do and I can say I'll keep playing until it manages to really♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, and considering the way I died against the flagship on easy and I've still got the stomach to hit restart, I can't see myself rage-deleting the local content anytime soon.

On a side note, the pause feature is not only amazing for planing out your attack but it is also nice if you are working on other projects or you need to take a break. You can come right back and FTL is there waiting for you.			",28,8,0,1,3,0,1

												After 14 hours and dozens of tries, I beat the game...on easy....FTL doesn't mess around. This game is damn difficult and will really punish you if you make the wrong choice or upgrade something for your ship that you shouldn't have. You really just have to pray that you'll find enough scrap metal and hope your entire crew doesn't suffocate from one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ coming aboard and going straight for the ♥♥♥♥ing oxygen supply...Anyways, you'll rage a lot, but the game is very entertaining and very rewarding.

												One of the best strategic rogue-like even to this day that inspired many other games such as ConvoyAlso pretty unforgivable one and heavily depends on random like most rogue-like gamesHas pretty steep difference between difficulties, i beaten the game on Easy more than 18 times and yet to finish it on NormalMusic is also one of the best parts of the game, i can listen to it for hours without getting bored out of it, sector 8 music makes my heart beat fasterAdanced Edition was the best update that fixed most of the faults and bugs of default FTLAlso added the whole new race and much more systems\weapons increase the overall fun and difficulty of your runaway from rebel fleet			",155,8,1,5,12,1,21

												FTL:Faster Than Light is rouge like space-simulator made by indie developer Subset Games where you play a Federation Fleet Commander of a small courier ship holding vital information on the Rebellions new ship that could face destroy the Federation grip on the galaxy.  Along the way, you will make friends and unite together to stop the rebels. Or more accurately you will bumble through several sectors with half the crew you started out with, absolutely zero scrap and a ship held together with the chewed up bubblegum, spit and the sheer willpower of fi-And you're space debris.Lovely.FTL as the introduction suggests, has you exploring various randomly generated sectors where you gather scrap, unlock new and better ships with benefits (and minuses of course) till you reach the final boss fight. Which you won't. Unless you are extremely lucky and even then. You may as well pat yourself on the back for making it that far. Because the rebel flagship will send you straight to the start faster than two shakes of a lamb's tail. You may think I'm complaining. But believe me, that is exactly what I love about FTL. It's hard. Therefore you must think of a plan and organise your crew. Who you will grow affectionate towards until you have to send one of them into the fire of oxygenator  to repair it while you and your surviving crew members cower in the med-bay. The game will keep you going for hours and hours, dying and replaying, dying and replaying and then dying some more. You can unlock various ships by completing a series of complex quests that you will /never/ find out how to complete without looking up a guide how to do it or at least  what I had to do. The random encounters are a nice touch but I found myself getting the same ones over and over again. With the odd variation. For example, I will pick up a Mantis crewman stranded on a planet and he will join my crew on one run. But on the next, he will stab my shield operator in the gullet and teleport onto a level three shielded ship. The randomness is both a thing I love and hate in equal measure and while I like the unforgivingness of this game many others will not. But you came to read my opinion, not others.Right now FTL is on sale at £2.09, which is an absolute steal and may as well be throwing it on mass through people's windows. I recommend getting it and while you're at it. Nominate it for an award. God knows it deserves it.It might make you racist against Mantis, though. ",50,3,0,8,2,0,1

You take control of a pizza delivery cruiser on your way to the Federation base, but the rebellion doesn't want you to get tipped, and they're pulling out all the stops to make sure that the pizza arrives cold, or even not at all! Fight your way through the many star-systems in the galaxy to make sure the customer gets their Hot-N-Ready pizza, defeat vile Pizza-Stealing Rebels, Zoltan speed enforcement zones, Mantis drive-bys, Rock shakedowns, and even the dreaded Engy tollbooths!Can you make it within 30 minutes or less?

												This is an awesome [enter Sci Fi franchise of your choice here] emulator. You command a ship that is fleeing an enemy fleet and you have limited resources in order to cross vast swathes of the galaxy. You cannot save everyone and people are going to die. You can be good or bad and the consequences are largely random (rather then getting the usual short-term boosts for evil and long term boosts for good). Even on easy it takes a while to get out of the first stages. It has the best, most desperate, moments of BSG and DS9. Here are a few decisions I have had to make while playing:- Should I flush my engineer into space to put out a fire or should I have my crew rush to his aid while I am in the middle of a fire fight?- Should I replace my engineer with an ill-begotten slave from a slave trader?- Should I allow that slave ship I am attacking to bribe me not to attack them because I am in perilous shape and need the supplies?- How long can I afford to suffocate my crew for?It is great, cheap, and it works on Linux.

												FTL is a game I keep coming back to.It is one of the most challenging indie games and it comes with a great soundtrack that I can listen to all day.I still struggle when playing this game and I am still learning on how to beat the harder difficulties.With a lot of unique races and hidden background lore found in various events and texts, this game made me feel very immersed in the world it has created with its beautiful design.This game features one of the most amazing moments in my entire gaming life and with the amount of great mods there is no way I will ever forget this game.The gameplay might not be for everyone. Those who like it will find this game quickly rising on top of their favourites list though.The game is really cheap. If you ever have the money, I really recommend you getting this game when you can. You will most likely not regret it.			",97,6,4,5,11,2,13

												Simple but effective. I have held off buying this game for quite  a long time but I'm glad that I finally purchased this. The perfect coffee ( or your choice of beverage) game. To be able to chill, explore the galaxy, captain a ship, get into some Star Trekian battles along the way. Sometimes you don't need amazing 3D graphic games to have fun.			",57,5,5,1,4,0,4

												This is currently my favorite game in my entire Steam library.  I pour so many hours into this game it's starting to become a problem.FTL is a roguelike that puts you in control of your own federation starship on a mission to travel to and destroy the rebel flagship; sounds pretty easy right?.  Apparently, the rebels are winning because this federation has miniscule resources and as such you recieve a ship that's severely under-equiped for the job.  It is up to you, and your crew, to find the resources you need to make it to the end and defeat the flagship, a task that can be challenging even on the easiest difficulty.I refrain from calling it hard as it's really not as long as you make all the right decisions.  The word 'unforgiving' is a better description, as one mistake is all it takes to get a game over.  You can pause the game at any time during combat so there's no presure to fast click and multi-task in the heat of combat so the only reason failure is your own poor decision making, and that really appeals to me.Since you can name your ship and starting crew I'm tempted to call this ""Oregon Trail in Space"", and that's probably all I needed to say.  It has all the same appeal, difficulty, and unforgiving environment ""Oregon Trail"" had just that instead of choosing starting resources you choose a ship.			",199,77,3,17,39,3,25

												This game is one of the best 10$ games that I have bought so far! Its an arcade like style of play as though you only have 1 life per gameplay, but thats the idea to die! lol, As every gameplay you do they will be different and random events and sometimes you do good and sometimes you dont.... You use ur own strategy everytime you play and what you run into things along your trip, but this could also affect it by what you run into.... So if you like a good strategy game and kind of like a board game movement with some awesome space combat action being 2D time base lol I would recommend this game to you!			",153,9,8,12,29,1,44

However when I bought it and hoped into the game, it was very difficult at first and I had to re-try after countless times of dying to the same Mantis Pirate ship. Eventually I got through that. I guess what i am trying to say is that, FTL requires alot of trial and error, as there many different ways that you can interact in any given situation. So I recommend the game to everyone as long as they are okay dying on that first few attempts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When strategy meets action, there's a slim chance for success. FTL doesn't know what a no-win situation is, and smashes through the gaming barrier of the two genres with pinpoint accuracy. This game belongs in your library. Here's why:Space. The final frontier. These are the voyages of you in a tiny little vessel struggling to stay ahead of a fleet that is gunning for you with big, nasty battle-cruisers capable of vaporizing your ship and your crew with it....but not if you're clever.FTL puts you in the seat of the captain, granting you the freedom to wage war, (or not) at your discretion. You place people at the con, promote others to chief engineer, or grant them control over the weapon systems. It's up to you, and their lives are riding on your ability to think on your feet. If you've ever seen an episode of Star Trek, you know that things don't ever go the way you plan them to. The same applies here. Should you grant sanctuary to a rogue mantis? Will you risk the lives of your crew to stop a fire spreading on a colony? Dare you grant mercy to the crew of the warships trying to kill you?The choices are real, and the consequences can come back to haunt you on your next jump. So many times have I been stuck staring at the screen, with the grim understanding that I've just backed myself into a corner. However improbable though, your split-second decisions can turn the tide of war in your favor, yielding great riches or rare devices for your ship.The soundtrack is stimulating. With a score by Ben Prunty that not only keeps you pumped, but grants that delightful sense of immersion through ambience, you'll be wanting the OST by the end of your first playthrough. Invest in the soundtrack bundle.The dialogue is believable, and well-crafted. You'll never meet a situation that you're bored by, as you meet not only malicious bounty hunters, but obscure traders who sell black-market goods in the dark corners of the galaxy. With the ability to name and customize your crew, the chance to lose yourself in the cast of your very own sci-fi thriller is quite likely.You'll get attached to ships. You'll invest great time and effort into crafting the perfect frigate or cruiser, stealth bomber or invasion drop-ship as you find new and creative ways to travel the universe. You'll regret losing crew-mates, and you'll feel genuine rage at the overwhelmingly intelligent AI as they access the weaknesses of your vessel and turn your ship into a bucket of holes.Most of all though; you'll never look back and question that this game was money well-spent. FTL is a must-have for any person who wants to get infinite-replay value on the bridge of a starship. Don't take my word for it though...*points ahead*Thrusters on full.			",286,49,4,25,12,3,18

												An addictive fun game.Faster than light (FTL) is a very addictive and fun game set in the ""Space simulation"" genre.Don't let the graphics deter you from buying the game, graphics doesn't equal to fun.The game has great replayability as nothing is the same on your next playthrough, every new playthrough is totally random and can either let you go on free of harm or totally mess you up.in FTL you control a ship, which is called ""The Kestrel"" by default, but you can rename it. with this ship you also control your crew, power, upgrades and your choices you make when prompted.   When starting the first playthrough you will be greeted with the selection screen and your 3 crew mates, as you go on through the game you unlock new ships and upgrades to play with on your next playthrough...that is of course if you can get through the sectors easily and not be deemed ""Unfit"" by the RNG lords....The RNG used in this game is fantastic, at times you will get frustrated with it and at other times you will be thankful for it.I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a game with great replay value!

												I don'r really know what to say about this game that hasn't been said already. I've been playing since release and after years it still feels good and I still feel like I want to play more. I remember after having finished it so many times I was looking for more outside of it (and I found Out There, which is great but very different).This is a modern classic for me. PRO+ it never gets boring+ it's easy to pickup but hard to master+ it's always different+ it's rich of secretsCON- it eats up your lifeSTEAM CONTROLLER: with a good config the Steam Controller really shines on this game. But it might take some time to learn the controls again.Just buy the game. It's impossible to regret it.Vote: 10/10 ",470,179,36,66,74,7,79

												If anyone has played dungeon crawl, and liked it, this game is for you. While definitely not as hard as crawl, there will be many YASD moments (yet another stupid death). The game is heavily luck based, and usually one mistake will spell your destruction. It can be frustrating. If you don't like rouge-like difficulty then this is not the game for you. All that being said, I like the game a lot. Once you get the hang of it - and accept the fact your probably going to die - it's very fun			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best games I've ever played. This game is unique. It's a space roguelike where literally everything except your starting equipment and final boss are randomized.In FTL, you control your crew of 3 humans on the Kestrel, a discontinued Federation ship in a galaxy dominated by the Rebel fleet.You have information vital to the war effort.They want it back.In this game, the starting ship is the Kestrel, not particularly well-armed but also quite well-rounded, effective against most ships with its Burst Laser Mk.II and Artemis Missile, which are not very strong but are still brutally effective. Many systems purchasable like the Cloak, Cloning, Teleporter, Mind Control, and Hacking to evade enemy attacks, bring back dead crew members, send crew members to enemy ships to fight hand-to-hand with their crews, take control of enemy crew members, and disable or entirely reverse the effects of the enemy systems, including doors to lock enemies in rooms, oxygen to choke enemy crew members, or piloting to take away their ability to FTL jump away to escape you or evade your missiles.The many weapons available include lasers, bombs, missiles, beams, and ions, which each have special effects on enemy ships. Lasers fire varying numbers of projectiles with varying strengths, but all lasers, no matter the strength, take down one shield bubble. Missiles and bombs penetrate shields, missiles doing damage to the hull, bombs damaging crewmembers and systems. Bombs can also be fired at your own ship, which can be useful against intruders or if using healing bombs (yes, those are a thing). Beams fire a terrifying laser across the ship. They cannot miss but few have the ability to penetrate shields, and all do damage to the hull based on the base damage and number of rooms hit. Ion weapons temporarily disable enemy systems. If the enemy shields are up, the ion damage will be applied to the enemy shield, keeping one bubble of shield from applying itself for a short time. All weapons can have special powers, like a particularly high hull breach chance (breach missiles) or stunning crewmembers in the room affected (ion stun).The various kinds of crew members include humans or many different aliens. Humans are ""common and uninteresting"" and learn skills faster. The Engi repair systems faster but deal less damage in melee combat. The Zoltan power the system they are in and explode on death, damaging enemies in the room, but have 30% less health than other crew members. The Rockmen have 50% more health and are immune to fire, but move much more slowly. The Mantis move much faster and deal much more damage than other species, but will repair systems half as quickly. The Slugs will reveal the locations of enemies in adjacent rooms and are immune to mind control, which is very useful in late game advanced edition. The Lanius are useful because they do not take damage from suffocation, but they also drain oxygen from the room they're in, making them a double-edged sword. There is also a secret race, but it's a secret, so I won't tell about it. Aw, the hell with it, I will. The Crystal are ancestors of the Rockmen, they still take damage from suffocation but take less, have the ability to lock a room and keep everyone in or out as well as make the room invincible, have 25% less health, and move 20% slower.This game is a lovely piece to have on your digital shelf and you should buy it immediately. Seriously, buy it now. By reading this, you're wasting precious time you could be spending on this masterpiece. Your playstyle determines whether you win. Refine your tactics, unlock new technology, evolve.Strategy is everything.Bad things will happen, but you must pull forward. Seriously, the damn Slugs disabled my oxygen and lit fires. All except 3 of my crew died in a fire or suffocation. I had to fight the boss with four people. FOUR. I won, but only because of my [dramaticmusic] HALBERD BEAM[/dramaticmusic]. Anyway, BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.Will you succeed in your mission?**(I heard that leaving things open-ended is a great way to make anything much better)			",160,11,0,8,6,3,13

												In FTL you are in the command of a ship and its crew and must travel through space facing random events and battles. This game is about management skills rather than maneuvering skills. There are 9 unique ships total, each with 2 different layouts, 7 different crew races with unique traits, and tons of weapons, including your crew that may be used to board enemy ships. But what makes FTL unique is how brutal this game is. One single tiny bad decision may turn a so far good run into a nightmare.Battles can get really hectic and will keep you on your toes. Pausing the game to think your way through a fight is the rule. The fear of death, always present. Once you're dead, either start a new game or cry. No second chance. All of this, plus the fantastic soundtrack, makes FTL a very emotionally engaging, tense game. Its random nature makes every run unique. The unlockable ships and the variety of ways with which you can specialize them gives the game a great replay value. FTL is amazing.			",137,24,0,16,6,1,15

												A lone federation ship must pass through a gauntlet of hostile alien space systems in the brutally difficult roguelike sci-fi adventure FTL. Just like its namesake, you must navigate each system by making faster-than-light jumps between locations and discovering new worlds and challenges all while fleeing a rapidly advancing rebel fleet while carrying the secret of how to defeat its most fearsome weapon: the rebel flagship.Gameplay in FTL is simple and straightforward. You can move crew from room to room in your ship, leaving them at stations like pilot, engine, and shields to boost the efficiency of those systems. Attacks are all performed by clicking weapons and then clicking on the enemy ship on the right side of the screen. Power management is also a big part of the game with reactor energy being scarce at times and requiring you to juggle allocation to specific systems when needed. Occasionally enemies will also teleport into your ship (something you can also do) and you will have to move crew around to fight or flee.This game is both really forgiving and also really unforgiving as far as roguelikes go. For example, if the rebel fleet does actually catch up to you, you have a chance to escape and it’s not an immediate game over. Having specific species of crew or ship systems will often give you blue dialogue options which are guaranteed to be successful. On the other hand, the RNG can be downright brutal and some runs will be doomed to failure if you cannot accrue the necessary weapons and systems to face the final boss. Certain ship configurations, such as the stealth ship, are especially vulnerable to bad RNG and will require many a restart before you finally get the right mix.Despite its crazy high difficulty, FTL is really fun and you’ll likely find yourself spending hours and hours trying to win without even realizing it until you check your clock and notice you’ve spent half a day flying around in space.

												This is a game that will take you from an amused smile to an enraged scream in pretty much every play through. Just please do note, that this is a positive thing.FTL has some really compelling game mechanics that add significane and weight to your actions with the fact that every new play through being randomized simply adding to the game by giving infinite replay value.Just to bring it all together in a terrible Doge Meme summary. Such Fear. Great Risk. Such Game. Much Wow.A more proper attempting at reviewing this great game can be found on my blog over here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2013/04/ftl-faster-than-light.html.			",101,42,0,14,8,1,15

												This is not the game for you if you think you are a strategist.  Strategy means little in the face of this game's insanely high luck factor requirement.  Many will find this game to be an exercise in frustration and futility, being constantly outclassed by the enemy.  Others will think they are doing well, only to be tooled by a battle where the enemy ship is maxed out, with all of your shots missing and your shields constantly being ignored by waves of missiles.  In short, luck plays far too much of a role in this game and player skill means little, as a result.			",1577,664,50,253,219,17,302

												FTL:Faster Than Light is pretty challenging, makes you think hard and hold your breath in combat as your ship and the enemy tear each other apart, while your crew tries to put out all the fires and repair all the holes in the hull! But hey, at least when all the oxygen is gone out of the ship through the holes, the fires will stop, as well! Too bad your crew needs that sweet, sweet O2. My point is, you're gonna have to make a lot of difficult decisions in the heat of battle in this game, and don't mess up, cause getting everyone on your side killed is amazingly easy! (For example, accidentally open all the doors and leak out the oxygen. Whoops! Then again, you could use the same trick when enemies board your ship. Makes them really re-think the whole boarding thing. Strategy!) Lots of variety in how you handle difficult situations both in and out of combat, loads of different ways to build and upgrade your ship, and  lots of ships (plus different ship layouts!) to unlock. One of the best rogue-like games out there, and well worth the money.In short, FTL: Faster Than Light is a damn awesome and fun game.			",120,34,2,9,6,2,20

												A solid silly, but frustration game. This game features it's randomized encounters, with random difficulty. Expect to die a lot and whatever you do FOR THE LOVE OF GOD and All your game progress DO NOT USE WINDOW's X to CLOSE (Rage quit the game). You will Delete your Data by doing so. I've done it twice.Quit the game with the Escape and Button, (Quit) In game to save your data.Over than that Big Bug, the game is silly if redundant. You spend hours grinding out achievements for new Ships only to discover that the first ship you get is the best ship. Very Ironic indeed.The Sound Track and random probability outcome can make things Nerve-racking. Word of Advice if you have 4 crew Members DO NOT BOARD STATIONS Or SHIPS, Your Crew is SO IMPORTANT.This game is good time killer, best you watch the clock.			",58,2,0,4,7,0,3

The gameplay, the art, the music, none of it is a let down, it's all wonderfully done. Many games have tried the whole ""pilot your own spaceship"" gameplay, and failed. FTL did it perfectly.

												I hate this game. Every time I play it, I always die and the game never gives me godly weapons. How can I be super overpowered if I don't get weapons by Sector 2????? And who ever thought up the idea of permadeath? This concept sucks. Why can't I just resume my progress from a save point? Other games like COD (Our lord and savior) have this. Why can't FTL have this?Why isn't this game an FPS? It's so stupid. I don't want a top down, I want an FPS of me fighting other ships. Too bad the devs didn't get any ideas from COD (Our lord and savior).Overall, this game is terrible. 10/10 would recommend to absolutely anyone at all.			",47,7,0,4,2,0,2

												In space, no one will hear your ship's hull being disintegrated... multiple times.FTL is a space-themed rouge-lite that succeeds on two levels. One, the writing, world, events and story are surprising catalyst, that gives you that long waited feel of being a captain on the space-worthy craft. Mechanics of managing the ship are simple, yet really complex and game likes to throw you into plethora of different problems to solve while running away from the rebels. Building your crew, repairing and upgrading ship, encountering aliens, both friendly and not, space combat... it really brings the fantasy to life even with the minimalistic presentation. You will certainly enjoy the moment to moment, self-story building, least before the moment when game runs out of unique random encounters.Then, the second main positive comes it. Variety of game options, mechanics, different ships or playstyles you can incorporate. During your journey you will unlock many different ships that operate on drastically different premises, that make multiple playthoughs an enjoyable experience, despite you knowing the exact odds of Giant Space Spiders eating your crew. FTL stops being narrative-oriented here and becomes hardcore game of judging risk and different choices. It's unbelievable how addicting this is and many meaningful strategic decisions you can make. Playtime doesn't lie, replayability is right here.I extremely enjoyed time spent on this title. While beating the game was certainly hard, the satisfaction of doing so gives just enough kick to you for the next space voyage. Highly recommended!			",168,39,11,6,6,2,16

												FTL is a fantastic, strategic rouge like game that focuses on your ability to freeze time and command your men, drones, and weapons according to the latest predicament and then unfreeze to watch your crew and equipment obey your every whim. You’ll experience topnotch artwork, a sublime sound track, intriguing ship designed, and superb game play. Through your many playthroughs you’ll unlock new ships, encounter never before seen aliens with special and helpful abilities, purchase new weapons, buy new systems/subsystems for your ship, and, finally, you’ll fight the rebel flagship and decided the fate of the federation. This game is one of my personal favorites and I suggest it to all gamers despite their age or gender. 10/10.			",72,26,0,7,8,0,12

												Most games start good and get worse as time goes on. Whatever you think of the first few moments of this one, it gets better from there. The end game is amazing, because by then you've built your ship to suit your play style, but it can't generate enough energy to power everything at once. The game isn't truly tense until you have to give up powering what you want in order to power what you need.			",30,6,0,10,11,2,8

												One of the best rogue-likes you gona see. The game is quite simple and yet brilliantly executed, it delivers amazing retro graphics, exquisite music and unforgettable exprience every time you play. However, be aware that is one of the most unforgivable and hardest game out there, dying in endless set ups is part of the experience of improving, and the game really make you fell good when u beat it. In short if you like hard games whit a lot of random stuff, customization and new history every time you play, FTL is your choice.			",191,38,5,41,18,1,37

												This game is wonderful - 10/10Graphics - 9/10 The art style is made up of wonderfully nostalgic 2D images, with a typical over head view of the action the players point of view has been tested through time in the RTS genre and cannot be faulted. My only bug bear is I'd like a little more customisation for my ships/crew colours etc.Sound - 10/10 The sound is also pretty nostalgic for anyone who played games before the mid 90s, the melodic theme is catchy and non-invasive while the sound effects are exactly what you'd expect, the lazers. bombs and shields all sound perfect.Gameplay - 10/10 The quick paced gameplay is exhilerating, managing your crew is vital and tense strategic decisions arise regularly in combat on each playthrough. The inclusion of a pause function is vital to your survival as when the more intense battles take place every second is vital! The very inclusion of a pause function makes the game much more accessible to newcomers of strategy. A save upon exit function (no going back to your save if you die) reflects the games Rogue-Like roots. Overall - 10/10 This is one of my favourite games, it's hard there is no sugar coating it, but oh so addictive!A must buy title in my eyes!			",179,35,5,37,17,1,40

												I'd write a more detailed review if I had time.For now: BUY THIS GAME.This was most time-for-money game I've ever gotten on Steam.I have over 100 hours on this AMAZING game, and I'll probably start playing it again with the Advanced Edition coming out (which they added for FREE btw. Finally some developers taking proper care of their customers.).Everything is good, even the soundtrack.ONE NOTE:If you just want to have fun with the game, play Normal.If you like a challenge, like me, play Hard, and ONLY Hard.I have never played Easy or Normal and probably never will.This game is so intense, fun, and challenging on Hard.Buy this game, you won't regret it!

												It's still awesome.UPDATE: Since I wrote this review they have added a free expansion pack to the the game. The ADVANCED EDITION (woo WOO wooooooo)!  Large parts of the expansion are written by Chris Avellone of Planescape Torment fame.  It adds numerous new encounters, a new race of aliens, new sectors and more.  I didn't think you could do much to improve this game but they have done a truly impressive job.I can't stop playing this game.  No matter how many AAA titles come my way I always find myself coming back to this game.  Perfect for a 5 minute play before work or a hours upon hours in the middle of the night.  Each time you play it's a different little space adventure.  If you've ever wanted to be Captain Picard or Admiral Adama this is the game for you.  Also the soundtrack is well worth the money.

												One of my favorite games in my library right now. Reminiscent to a board game (I am an avid player of board games), named Gunship, it provides a unique experience every time you play as you customize your ship in attempt to get through to sector 8 without dying; though you will definitely be trying to unlock new ship layouts that require death. Your crews death are permanent, damage is spread through fire, breaches and hull as you run around to manage time quickly. All I can say is ""thank God for the pause function"" and the only thing I could ever want from this game is multiplayer. Please give us multiplayer. i love you.*New Content* The developers are amazing and to give us a FREE expansion that only adds to the awesomeness! Two thumbs up if possible!

												SKIP DOWN TO SECOND PARAGRAPH FOR ACTUAL REVIEW : This game.... THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME IS SO AMAZING. Its one of those games you could play casually while watching a movie or tv show and at the same time still sit down, turn off the lights focus hard core and sit down for hours type of game. I have fallen so much in love with this game, I got all the badges for it and a t-shirt. I promise uou if you at least try this game you will probally end up liking it, Like I didn't wanna give it a shot at first but you might as well because if you to end up loving it like I did you will not regret it.Now gameplay wise its amazing, before this game I always wanted a game that was a rpg kinda space shooter, and I didn't think FTL was what I wanted. I thought I wanted a fps space flying sim kinda thing but FTL filled what I wanted and more! and FTL is 10x bwtter because it has some decent story but then it has little quest and distress calls and then it is rogue like in the sense of perma death and also a game can go from 45 minutes to 4 hours. to a few days depending on you style.

												One of the best rogue-likes you gona see. The game is quite simple and yet brilliantly executed, it delivers amazing retro graphics, exquisite music and unforgettable exprience every time you play. However, be aware that is one of the most unforgivable and hardest game out there, dying in endless set ups is part of the experience of improving, and the game really make you fell good when u beat it. In short if you like hard games whit a lot of random stuff, customization and new history every time you play, FTL is your choice.			",191,38,5,41,18,1,37

												To me personally I've found this game very interesting, mainly because I am a big fan of Sci-Fi. FTL allowed me to control my own spaceship and travel thru deep dangerous space. Gameplay elements are interesting, but It takes time till you master them. For casuals, this game can be really hard and frustrating, but if you surpass this point, you'll be greatly rewarded and FTL shows you in entirely different perspective. ;)Few months ago, FTL received free expansion pack delivering a lot of new content (new ships, race, quests I believe) which extends your gametime greatly. Some people complain about graphic - I don't care, I don't need to have photorealistic 3D graphic to enjoy interesting game and to be honest - I can't imagine playing FTL with graphic described above. Buy it or not? Hell, how come you don't have this game already? ;)			",455,120,28,36,75,5,82

												FTL: Faster Than Light is a roguelike or rather rogue-lite title that has characteristics of strategy and simulation games. The player is in control of a starship that is fleeing from the powerful rebel forces. The ship needs to get to the fleet command and warn them before it is too late. On your way you come through various randomly generated sectors. You cannot stay in one sector for too long as the rebel forces are closing in on you and take over more of the map every turn.When I first saw footage of the game I was mildly confused. Was that one screen really all you see during the game? Yes, it actually is. That's not a bad thing, though. In the main part of the screen you always see your ship from above. If there is an enemy ship it will be displayed on the right. While fights are played in real-time the map screen is turn based. On the sector map you can perform one FTL jump per turn to get to a beacon. Most beacons have a random event when you first jump there. That event can be something that just happens, like a sudden fight or something that you find. In most cases however a window pops up and you can choose from several options. Depending on your ships systems, subsystems and crew more options become available. Your ship is equipped with various systems and subsystems. All of those, as well as the ship's raw ""attributes"" can be upgraded with scrap. You can also use scrap to buy additional systems and subsystems as well as weapons or crew members or just have your ship repaired.Fights are played in real-time. Luckily you can pause and give orders whenever you want. Every weapon has a certain preparation time before it can shoot and can be aimed at any of the enemy ship's rooms. If a room with a system receives a direct hit that system is damaged and has to be repaired. There is, depending on the weapon, also a possibility for a fire or a hull breach. During a fight you have to micromanage your crew to keep the ship functional. If there is system damage the crew can fix it. They can also repair hull breaches and put out fires. It is however also beneficial to have your crew man certain systems since it raises the particular system's effectivity and the piloting system does not even work properly without a crew member to man it. It is also possible to open and close doors given the door system is working. Opening doors to space can be very beneficial to put out fires or suffocate boarders.There is a number of races that can all join your crew. Every race has unique characteristics and some of them give you special options in random events. There are various unlockable ship types and layouts for each type. Those don't simply change the room layout but also the starting systems and crew. So your playstyle will not only vary per ship but also per layout.On the one hand  FTL: Faster Than Light is due to its random generation to a certain extent luck based. On the other hand however there is much room for creativity and strategy. There is a multitude of ship systems and weapons to choose from. Every race has its advantages (and some of them have disadvantages too). There are many meaningful choices to make and if you play for a while you can see yourself getting better every time.I can definitely recommend this to anybody who likes rogue-lites, strategy or simulation games.More reviews here ",268,35,3,26,16,4,28

												FTL is a Sex-based RPG set in space. Your main objective is to obtain the Crystal Cruiser, which is near impossible to obtain unless you're really, really, really lucky.

												I almost expect my breath to frost the glass of the view screen before me.  Space is cold, after all.I shake off my uneasiness as the docking clamps are disengaged.  The FTL Drive that delivered us to this point powers down, light thrusters coming online to keep it from drifting from its beacon.I push power to the engines, jumping the ship to a nearby beacon.As soon as we arrive, we are fired upon by a Rebel ship.  A missile hits our shield generator, allowing a concentrated beam to slice through our oxygen production generator, and our engines in one clean cut.  I order our oxygen brought back online; we're sitting ducks without our engine, but we'll die without oxygen even if we survive this encounter.Rapid blaster fire pelts our hull, damaging our weapons systems enough to take our main weapon offline.I fire our last missile in a last ditch attempt to shake them off of us, only to watch in despair as they cloak, the missile passing them entirely.As fire engulfs our systems and our oxygen levels drop below even the danger zone, my only solace is in knowing that the cloning facility will soon come online, and I'll have another go.

												To put it succinctly, this game is like small-scale Star Trek.  You direct crew members to areas of your ship to man consoles or make repairs while targeting weapons at specific parts of enemy ships.   On top of this strategic leadership, it is a rogue-like at heart, with a single poorly-met encounter leaving you starting from the beginning with a shiny new ship... and a determination to avoid the same mistakes.You will become addicted.

												Sigh...I...cannot in good faith recommend this game.  Not to everyone.  Is it bad?  Hell no.  This game is remarkably polished in a number of aspects.  The problem is, the game isn't very fun.  At least not in the long run.  When you start off, you will be full of wonder, piloting your starship into unknown realms, trying to save the your allies from the rebels!  Then you'll die, lose everything and have to start over again.  This pattern will repeat for about 20 times before you become super frustrated and give up on the game.Let me reiterate...FTL is not a bad game.  It is damn good.  However, it fails in one crucial way.  It does not give you a feeling of incremental progress.  Some may like the challenge that that brings, but for a rogue-like to be worth your time these days, with so many other rogue-likes out there, it needs to make your time meaningful.  FTL is a time waster...it will kill you over and over again and it will be due to randomness, not to any fault of your own.  And seldom ever will the game change or improve.  Of the over 10 ships to unlock, I got...four.  After many failed attempts.  By accident.  Each death was just as frustratingly stupid and unavoidable as the last.If you like that, fine, have at it, the game's mechanics are solid, but...FTL just wastes my time.  And I cannot recommend it on those merits alone.			",73,23,0,18,2,0,9

												FTL is one of those games that became popular due to internet celebrities streaming it, not because it's outstanding. Dying on turn one is no fun in any game.This is one of those games that is better to watch someone else play than to play yourself, go watch it on twitch or youtube, you'll get a better experience.I'm not saying the game is bad but I personally just can't get into it. The game is played by you making jumps from one system/planet to another while the rebel fleet chase you down, which is fine but each jump can literally be game over and so its a glorified mine sweeper.Its a game someone can watch you play and it will seem exciting but the reality is that the base concept of the game is dull and the metagame of maximizing scrap so you can run the typical build order also dull for example; No matter what, if you are in sector 1, then get 2 shields.Sitting still against an enemy that has no hopes of getting through your shields, is a good idea for skill level ups.Kill everyone and everything because then you get more scrap. So on and so forth.I don't feel like I need to adapt to whats going on, just that I am going through the motions again and again. Every single time I deviated from the 'plan' such as trying a new weapon or going for a different build order, I get killed. As long as I do the same thing over and over during the early turns, I will be fine. You don't even need to take my word for it as if you are reading this on steam then you can just go to the guides section and they will explain exactly the same thing. It is the illusion of choice because there is only 1 way to build your ship in the early game if you want to survive the late game.The games music drones on comepletely ignoring current events and is otherwise unremarkable. I don't feel like the USS enterprise or other space fantasy captains, the music sounds disjointed from the game and just sounds generic. Normally I wouldn't point this out except for the fact the soundtrack is sold seperately, save your money.You need to get scrap in order to do aything such as upgrade your ship or buy shop parts, but those are random so you can only buy what you are lucky enough to get, just like a deck building card game. I don't really mind because that is also the nature of rogue-likes but what I do mind is that you can die very quickly in sector 1 because your first jump is a rebel ship that just happens to counter your ship perfectly. Its rare but it does happen. Later on after sector 1, enemy ships seem to just ""randomly"" have subsystems that perfectly counter your build which also leads to the wonderful metagame of gaming the game and that seems to be all the guides and all the videos I watched about this game. If you want to deviate from the cookie cutter build then you just have to 'trick' the game and that gets really boring.The last boss is the perfect example of 'gaming the game'. If you kill the crew in regular fights then you win. Against the last boss this isn't the case, instead the last boss gets harder! So instead you kill everyone except the one person who mans the lasers because lasers can't hurt you if you have your shields up meaning you can kill that form of the last boss at your leisure. Last boss has 3 forms by the way, because why wouldn't it. No you don't heal in between rounds, its a 'rogue-like' so its supposed to be ""hard"". The game has potential and free DLC was also made for the game which is always great. Overall I recommend this game simply because if you don't like the game, you will very easily find out very, very quickly in time to get a refund and if you do like the game then you don't really care what I, or anyone else says. For me personally I would like it if the game encouraged experimentation. So many builds or weapon combos are just going to get you killed and its infuriating that such suicidal options are even incuded.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews ",165,36,3,41,9,1,48

												This game is really fun and challenging when you start playing it becuase you can feel that the game mechanics give it a lot of depth and you wan't wait to learn how the game works so you can figure out how to win and develop strategies. But as you keep playing it, you slowly begin to realize how wrong you were, and that the reality is there is no depth to the game because everything that happens depends almost entirely on luck and how little anything you actually do matters.You can play flawlessly, making all the right decisions, buying all the right upgrades to turn your ship into the perfect combat vessel that can dodge most shots, has the shields to absorb whatever manages to get through and still has a powerful enough armament to destroy anything you come across, but it won't matter because in the next battle suddenly you will be forced into a situation that is literally impossible to survive. This isn't fun, this isn't good gameplay, it's just terrible game design (or lack thereof) and I really wish people would stop making excuses for games whose developers bought into the fallacy that ""everything determined by RNG = hard = good game"" because it never works.And the most frustrating thing is that this is by no means a bad game. It is otherwise very well designed and is actually really fun as long as the RNG isn't arbitrarily killing you off. The only thing the game has to do to improve is to reduce the supremacy of the RNG in determining everything that happens and to let the player's actions have more influence. I don't care if they leave in a ""hardcore mode"" or call less random mode ""baby difficulty"" or whatever, I just want to enjoy playing a game.			",167,7,0,27,12,0,51

To all my friends and random people who read this, this game is great. And not like the""skyrim"" or ""CS:GO"" great. Its a querky little space ship game that is highly replayable and enjoyable. The concepts seem easy at first but prove to be conp[licated. There isnt one set formula to just win the game. It takes trial and error to find out certain things but it always feels like a different adventure. Devs deserve full price and more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've unlocked just one ship in 10 hours. I'll never get even half of them. I'm excited about the upcoming free DLC. Also, seek out the mod that replaces the background graphics with high resolution alternatives.Edit: new free Advanced Edition is great but I still can't unlock anymore ships or still even beat the game on easy. I have to give up and move onto something else. There's just no way to make a powerful enough ship to fight that final boss.			",501,122,11,54,26,6,76

												WARNING: Addictive game!STORY: “I managed to once almost get a secret achievement and we were half way through a sector and found a container that seemed to have a life form frozen within. I believe we then traversed space, luckily finding a science vessel that was under attack from a droid.We saved the crew and as a reward they revived the life form in the container. It turned out the life form was of an ancient race, and he gave us ordinance to the remainder of his people so that we could take him home. We were half way there and we sadly got attacked by pirates that teleported on the ship and killed the ancient race guy… later we went mental at such a loss and died shortly after… the end.”REVIEW: At first you’ll play through and maybe try and do everything perfectly, but then you realise it’s a rough-like style (I didn’t read that lol) and you’ll instantly get hooked with trying to unlock all the goodies and get as far as you can :)There are great little extras to find though out the game, that makes the world that much richer and much more engaging for you, the player!

												FTL is one of only 5 games that holds a spot in my ""Favorites"" category.  I'm always happy to hop in for a new game even after putting it down for months.  The exploration and story is vague enough for one to build up the details of the universe in their own imagination.  This is a really nice game to play with some other sci-fi on in the background.  I still have ships to unlock and with most ships having at least one varient layout there's a lot of variety within a multitude of tactics for a player to pursue.  Variety lies in ship layouts, starting technologies, starting weapons / drones (if any), starting species on one's ship.  You'll never be able to combine everything as you travel across the 8 sectors leading to the final (3 part) showdown so you'll have to choose wisely among the limited set of options you'll be exposed to.  This is a rogue-like that leaves me daydreaming about my strategy.			",180,29,0,19,8,2,28

												FTL is a very detailed strategy game; it became very enjoyable once I grasped the depth of the game mechanics.  In FTL, you assume command of a Federation fleet spaceship, the goal is to “run” to the other end of the galaxy and deliver data onboard your ship that is vital to the Federation fleet.  You must race across a randomly generated galaxy via a web of sectors; each sector is yet another web of interconnected quadrants.  The goal within a sector is to explore as many quadrants as possible, finding the exit, and not getting caught by the pursuing Rebel fleet.  Overall, FTL is a challenging space simulation game with detailed strategic gameplay.The one initial hurdle for FTL is its steep learning curve.  The title does come with a tutorial but it only explains the basic game mechanics.  The learning process starts with the first game.  It took me about three games to fully understand all the features; I think anyone who plays this title must go through this process to get the full value of the game.  Furthermore, I believe this title will be “hard to swallow” for those players not familiar with the concept of permanent death.I had no idea of what to expect from FTL.  I think I developed some expectations after playing the tutorial.  Once I played my first game and failed miserably, I thought the game was going to be a waste of my time; my expectations fell to the floor.  Like I said before, it wasn’t until two gameplays later that I fully understood the overall concept and goals of the game; after that I was hooked.  I truly believe FTL is just one of those titles that offer no grey areas; you like it or you don’t.In my opinion, the graphics in FTL are of medium quality, offering a highly detailed 2D top-view perspective.  In FTL, the main character is the spaceship you choose to command; eventually, you’re able to unlock different types of spaceships as you accomplish certain achievements.  As you progress in the journey through the galaxy, you’re able to upgrade your ship.  The only objects FTL allows you to interact with are the individual crew members onboard your vessel; each member has a set of skills that can be developed throughout the game, i.e. a crew member that is always assigned to conduct repairs eventually becomes your repair specialist.  The menu system in FTL is simple and very user friendly.FTL is mainly played utilizing the mouse; point, click, and drag depending on the interaction.  Other than the space bar to pause the game, FTL offers some keyboard commands in the form of shortcuts; in my opinion, they aren’t really necessary.  Overall, the game controls for FTL are simple and somewhat intuitive.In FTL the story is short and simple.  The real immersion value of the game is the well balanced combination of exploration and tough decision making; FTL does not allow you to completely explore the entire galaxy, but when you add the random encounters along with the time constraints imposed by a pursuing enemy, FTL draws your attention and engages you by forcing the player to make life and death decisions.  I played the game for 9 hours, and at times I had to make some very tough calls to ensure the survival of my space ship and crew members.The musical score in FTL, in my opinion, is very rich and augments the experience of immersion into the vast galaxy exploration theme; after all, the original musical soundtrack is available for purchase separately.  The sound effects in FTL are consistent with the high level of thrill and excitement during gameplay; especially when it comes to combat.  FTL does not offer any voice-overs, the random encounters are all text based.  Overall, FTL’s audio is a perfect match with all other elements in the game.FTL is already a very detailed complex game, where critical thinking is of the essence.  One feature that would make this title better, is to allow for more diversity in the difficulty levels.  FTL currently only offers easy and normal gameplay, adding a “this is my first time” option would really bridge the gap on the learning curve.  Another feature that would make this title even better is to include an encounter editor; FTL has hundreds of encounters, but there have been numerous times where I found myself saying, “I’ve seen this already.”  Also, the ability to share player created encounters would fortify the community aspect of the game and pretty much guarantee infinite possibilities.The one element that makes FTL exciting is the concept of permanent death; it provokes critical thinking and gives you the true immersion value of what it would be like to command a Federation fleet space vessel.  Every action a player takes is nerve racking, bad decisions only lead to failure; just like in real life.  The “permadeath” concept may not be popular with all types of gamers, but I think it’s worth experimenting with. ",35,7,0,7,19,0,31

												My initial feelings of FTL still haven't changed with the latest edition.There is such a huge discrepancy between the main game and the final boss fight. It constantly feels like I'm on a stroll through the main game, hoping to get the right gear to fight the final boss, if not, I'm screwed. It feels like a gear check. It feels like I need to employ certain strategies specifically aimed at the final boss and the rest of the game is just window dressing compared to that.			",286,71,18,36,21,9,29

												At first, it's a great, challenging game that'll have you hooked all the way through the final boss area.   Then, after awhile, you can dive into the challenges of the different ships that are unlocked and find a whole new way of playing the game while the final boss still challenges you.   It's rare that you have games like that still; knowing that no matter how great or bad you're doing, the final boss will ALWAYS be a uphill fight til the end!			",206,19,3,31,18,4,67

												It is a roguelike in space. What else can I say? There are quite a few different ships that you can unlock, different layouts of each ship to go for, different races, dangers, rewards, and events to challange you. Do you send one of your ccrew to fight the giant spider or leave the ones who need help behind for the mission? Do you fire that one last shot to try and win or hold back so you dont miss and possibly lose? Each game is always different for me. I admit I usually only play on the Easy mode, and still I can have a difficult time. But I love the randomness that each game can give, that each crew member can provide. Always wondering if that next jump is the one that helps me to win....or will have me blow up into a million pieces and hav e to restart all over again.			",273,76,2,35,11,2,25

												It took me several hours before I could defeat the final ship for the first time but it didn't bother me at all. Every time, you learn a new tactic to dodge hits, take out systems, manage your crew. I already spent a good amount of hours and I haven't even unlocked all ships yet. FTL is one of the first games I bought on Steam and is absolutely a must-have game. Every play is different and you'll need to adjust your game play to the ship you've chosen. Don't be discouraged by its difficulty the first time you play. FTL will offer you countless hours of fun (and some cursing at intergalactic pirates).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Story/Setting/CharactersThis is one of those games where there isn't much story driving the game, because the game mechanics as well as the user's own want or need to be the biggest baddest spaceship captain ever drive gameplay far more than, ""The Rebels are chasing you!"" It's a great retro game and has a lot of details about each species, each with their own unique abilities.  The look and feel of the different ships is great, each one is very unique to the different species. While the individual species are neat, the actual crew members them selves aren't really memorable. I mean sure when you get Phil Gates and Kernal Mustard as crew members you remember them. There are quite a few Easter Eggs to find as well, but since the game is procedurally generated have fun finding them.-Not a lot of story-Great setting7/10Look/FeelThe art style couldn't be more perfect for this game, with its' minimal 16 bit graphics, top down interface, and the ability to fight giant spiders (because giant space spiders are no joke) , I can't get enough. It really appeals to my childhood love of the SNES and the Sega. It gives the game far more charm than if they were to use current graphics.9/10GameplayThis is where the meat of the game is. This is really what makes the game so compelling. It's procedurally generated, so it will be different every time you select new game. Taking a hit to your ship is kind of a big deal, death means starting from scratch, and shops that will repair your ship are few and far between. The game is incredibly hard and beating it requires skill, cunning, and a whole lot of luck. 9/10Music/SoundThe music is pretty good, it almost puts me to sleep sometimes with it's slow space EDM. It has a great soundtrack but don't play if you are tired you might end up sleeping on your keyboard. The fight music is pretty good, and some of the specific danger areas have great tunes as well.  8/10ReplayabilityWith the difficulty of the game, you'll play it for quite a while before you beat it, and even then with the amount of unlockable ships and the procedurally generated environments, it's got tons of replayability.10/10			",70,4,1,8,2,0,4

												FTL is a great game for every age. it may be difficult to play but a very fun and entertaining game.One thing to think about before buying this game, is that you need to use your brain when playing against the enemy ships, because that this game is no easy win. It requires strategy, logical thinking, and a LOT of willpower because that you will die atleast a couple of times before winning on easy.8/10Even though the game is very good gameplay, its lacking at graphics, if you ask me almost any game would be better with extreme textures BUT sould be able to toggle.

It's got an intresting system for combat one that I personally like. All in all it's pretty good and relitively cheap.

												Faster Than Light is one of the most entertaining games I have ever played, and certainly one of the more challenging games around. This game will make you think hard, play hard and lose hard.The atmosphere of the game is compelling. The music that accompanies you through your journeys is enjoyable, and the sense of eternal doom and damnation is always upon you.There are a fair number of ships, which all have different emphasis on certain tactics. Therefore, there is always one that appeals to your style of playing. The environment is ever-changing; not two games are alike, thus the game always has new surprises in store for you. With the new Advanced Edition, there is even additional content for free!However, the game can be exceptionally difficult, even on the easiest difficulty. This might discourage many players from playing or even finishing the game. Do not get discouraged, though, as you eventually will find a way to defeat the last boss, and when you do, a glorious sensation of victory awaits.With that said, FTL is a great game that offers many hours of quality play time. Each new game will pose new challenges that can be solved in different ways. However, you are bound to fail most of the time, so, arm yourself with patience, and good luck.This indie game deserves a total of 10/10, worth every penny			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After pulling the trigger and purchasing FTL, I can say that the past year will be looked back upon as being lesser than what it could have been. This game is epic...it rewards the quick thinking  and smites those who are not up to the challenge. Regardless of which category you fall into, you will keep coming back for more.

												This is one of the most amazing space-themed games ever. It's half-roguelike, half-RTS. The soundtrack also gets a special mention, because it's way different than what we're used to hear in space opera stuff.Only complaint: the game is kinda short on content at the moment and is a bit too based on luck. Still, though, it will draw you in like very few games do. Recommended!EDIT: as of the Advanced Edition, I don't really have any more complaints about the game. It's still somewhat reliant on RNG, but there's a lot of tactical depth added with the new modules. Ten outta ten.			",277,120,0,17,16,2,12

												15 attempts,12 hours and one victory! That was just the easy mode.... Faster than light is a game where you can choose your ship, train your crew and build it to be the best it can before it is boarded by angry bug men and has enough holes in it to make the titanic look like it had a grazed knee. It is a superb experience for both the dedicated and the more casual and a must have for every gamer.			",152,11,0,9,12,1,26

												I always liked the gameplay of roguelikes but was never really into the typical fantasy setting they were framed in. This, though, this is neat. A space roguelike. Over half a dozen ship types all suited to different playstyles, randomized galaxies so no two playthroughs are ever the same, and a difficulty very much in-tune with the genre it comes from -- it's quite easy to get killed misjudging a situation or taking too big a risk.Travel from encounter to encounter is turn-based (the enemy fleet pursuing you only advances when you choose to warp to the next system), but combat and ship operations are real-time. To avoid being overwhelmed by the concerns of surviving a fight in space, the pause feature (Spacebar) allows you to queue commands to execute when you unpause.It's a fairly small game which won't offer you 8-hour playthroughs or awesome graphics, but what content it does have is well worth the price tag.

												FTL is a mixture of emotions, happiness, loss, sorrow. You will get so drawn into the game that when that one missile pierces your shields and blows up your ship, your life feels like it has no meaning. I will always recommend this to a friend as it is a great mixture of game types.			",46,17,1,3,18,1,17

												FTL is all about stories and impossible situations. Low on health? Survive five more jumps with lots and lots of close calls. Having the perfect ship? Die by the hand of a single enemy within thirty seconds. This unpredictable nature is what makes FTL interesting, even after hours and hours of playing. You will name ships after the captain of a glorious run, hoping it will bring luck to your new crew. You will spend hours reading absurd stories by other players. Highly recommended.

												A brilliant game in its simplicity.  It reminds me of a roguelike game in space.  When you believe yourself to be an unstoppable force in space you will find yourself humbled by the very next encounter.  A frustrating game in its difficulty and incredibly satisfying when conquered.  Excellent replayability as each time you play the map is randomly generated so each play through is unlike the last.

												Faster than Light is a game that puts you at the captain's seat of a spaceship trying to escape the pursuit of the Rebel fleet. You must escape through a number of sectors with many hazards before finally confronting the flagship of the Rebel fleet.However on your journey you are faced with a myriad of challenges that keep you on your toes. Should you fly towards a distress signal and save the crew in trouble or risk flying into a trap and potentially lose one of your own crewmembers?You can upgrade your ship to tailor to your style of play. Want to play defensively and let robots to do all the fighting for you? Sure go ahead. Want to play aggressive and pound the enemy ship using a combination of weapons such as lasers, missiles, ion cannons and beams? No problem. Feel like taking on the enemy up close and personal by boarding them then killing the crew in melee combat? Feel free to do so.But be prepared to flexible in your approach and think of other ways to fight if one crewmember goes down or when fires begin spread on your ship or when the enemy boards you and brings the fight to you.The learning curve is steep but not overly harsh. You will see your ship blow up many times because you didn't pay attention for that crucial second or that time you should have repaired your life support instead of weapons. But that feeling of success as  you defeat increasingly difficult foes or the final Flag ship is very statisfying, making you wanting to play more.This game is a gem and I recommend playing this game. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And the vast majority of people that I know fit comfortably into the latter category. FTL is a great game and it's pretty much always cheap.Just know that unlocking the ships will take time, and that there is ABSOLUTELY NO SHAME in playing on Easy until you learn the ropes because chances are good that you won't win anyway.

The game involve's ""space stations"".. What is this? Some sort of fantasy book. For one having this is completely irrelevant to the games main purpose. The game has worse controls than Crazy Taxi for the PS1. ""Use the mouse to move"" what is this some sort of 1990 Pong game.For me this game was totally worth 49 pence. PS.

												Full Review (with pictures and rating): http://www.gamingv2.com/2014/04/24/review-ftl-advanced-edition/Gaming V2 Review - FTL Advanced EditionRating: 9/10Back in September 2012 Gaming V2 was not covering PC games, and as such we did not talk about the fantastic indie title, FTL (Faster Than Light) by the two man team at Subset Games.  Exceeding their Kickstarter goal of $10,000 by an insane $190,000 for a whopping total of over $200,000 when all was said and done, FTL was given the chance to really become something great, and back in 2012, it proved the faith people had shown it was well placed and well deserved.  I openly admitted that had GV2 covered PC games back then, FTL would easily have been in contention for my personal game of the year for 2012, and that’s saying a lot when it would be running against titles like Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, Dishonored, The Walking Dead Game, Mark of the Ninja and many more.Now, in April 2014, Subset games released their first full blown content update that contained so much new material they even gave FTL the new name of “FTL Advanced Edition”, which also saw the release of the game on the iPad as well.  Included in this massive update are new ship layouts, new equipment, ship upgrades, a new race, a plethora of new side missions and a new hard mode if you feel like torturing yourself.FTL was known for being great at offering you a unique experience every time you booted it up.  No play through was the same as any prior to it.  Now with all the new side missions, ship layouts, the new race and the new equipment and upgrades, this just ensures that you will never know what’s to come, and you will love it for that.  Obviously the typical strategies are still there, but with the addition of neat new upgrades like hacking, which allows you to disable enemy systems for lengthy periods of time, a cloning bay that will allow your dead crew to come back to life at a somewhat lessened skill level, or the awesome mind control that allows you to take over enemy crew members and have them work against their own ship, your options have never been so limitless.  You can’t do it all at once, so this just further encourages you to keep on playing after you have inevitably met your demise, time after time again.Each ship type now has a ‘C’ layout version in addition to the original ‘A’ and ‘B’ layouts of the original game.  These new layouts can be unlocked by getting to the final sector using the ‘B’ type layout of that same ship, once again encouraging players to try all flavors of ship in the game.  They have also allowed previous layouts to be unlocked by beating the game with the various other ships, instead of always relying on the random events to spawn that allow you to unlock them.  This is a welcomed change, as the player had no control over which events would happen in a ply through, which can make it rather frustrating if you’re going for a specific unlock and the even just never “pops” for you.  There are also two completely brand new ships, each with multiple layouts, the Lanius cruis and Crystal cruiser.  So there is definitely no shortage of new content to unlock for those of you who like to have everything.  Ships also allow you to have crew man their passive systems now, such as doors or sensors, for further bonuses as well.  By manning one of these systems, you are increasing it’s level by one for free.  So if your doors are at a upgrade level of 1, putting a crew member in there will treat the doors like it’s a level 2 system free of charge as long as the room stays manned.  This is a great addition as it allows you to make use of any extra crew members you may have on board instead of having them stand around doing nothing if there aren’t intruders to fend off.On top of the new ships are the large amount of new weapons and drones that you will be able to purchase or find in game.  The Flak weapon is a stand out for me, as it seems to be the bane of my in game existence.  With it’s low accuracy and massive damage, I find it tears my hull apart faster than I can send crew to repair it.  I haven’t had the chance to use it myself, but once I get my hands on one, those rebels better watch out!  There are even more new drones added to the plate as well, including those that start fires on enemy ships, or the Ion Intruder which periodically emits ion pulses that ionize enemy systems, causing them to malfunction.The last thing I will touch on is the Hard mode that was added in the Advanced Edition.  A hard mode for a game that most people couldn’t even beat on the easy setting.  I for one never tried playing on Easy, as I’m a glutton for punishment and just went headstrong into Normal like a champ.  A champ that loses 90% of the attempts he makes (but has fun doing it!).  Hard mode doesn’t add anything new to the game, but it reduces the scrap rewards (scrap is the currency in FTL) for beating enemies or completing missions, makes the enemies you encounter tougher than you will find on Normal, and some other small tweaks to keep things interesting.  As stated on FTL’s official website, Hard mode is for the “more masochistic fans” and promises to make you wish you never attempted it.  I like it.The Bottom LineFor an indie game to release a content update of this size and price (free!) over a year after the release of their title, it’s pretty darn impressive and not something that just flies in under the radar.  Subset Games love their game and love their fans and it shows in every area.  If you somehow found yourself bored of the original game after all this time, the Advanced Edition offers more than enough to pick it back up and have it feel as fresh as it did the first day you tried the original game.  For anyone who has yet to pick up FTL at all, now there is even more reason to do so.  There is no excuse to not play one of 2012′s best games, revamped and upgraded for an awesome 2014 version.  Give it a shot and you won’t regret it.  FTL Advanced Edition is FTL on steroids.  The Advanced Edition does nothing more than make the original game better in every way.			",55,10,0,8,8,0,9

Mind you, I didn't play that much. I played until bored then went to meadows a new. I enjoyed the gameplay which is all there pretty much is. If you want a personal narrative, and story driven gameplay, go buy some trash by David Cage (Heavy Rain Creator). If you like RTS elements with a taste for strategy, you can do far worse then this game. It's fun for the moment, but it can become boring to play, and sometimes frustrating. I love the challenge, but there is far too big of a diffuculty curve between the 3rd galaxy and 4th galaxy. If you happen to see this on sale, buy it. If it's not on sale, you could probably do better, but it's fun for the moment. 8/10			",104,9,4,13,7,1,6

												As with Demon Souls and Dark Souls you better expect to die alot, because that is what this game is all about. No mercy.However, what makes this game really fun is those moments when the enemy ship have bombarded you with missiles and lasers ect. and you're sitting there in the middle of nowhere and desperatly trying to fix your shield so that the NEXT wave of attacks doesn't tear your ship to pieces, and the oxygen generator have started to burn. You're losing oxygen faster than money during a Steam-sale and the enemy have just tkilled your engines and now the fire that started in the oxygen generator room have spread over to the weapons controll room and MY GOD EVERYTHING IS ON FIRE!!So now you have lost power to the engines, oxygen is down and close to non-exsisting, weapons is down and half your ship is on fire. On the good side though, your shields are up again and you have managed to survive with around 10% of your original hull left. That is FTL.			",113,33,1,37,38,0,39

												An addicting, fast paced game, FTL combines retro-style graphics with old-school difficulty, providing great replay value with lots of customisation for your ship and a variety of foes that you will face. Initially I didn't understand the point of the alternative layouts of ships, but they do make you try out different strategies of play, which completely alter the way you will build towards the end-boss. Often you go through the game finding the part you need, just when after you upgraded your shields, forcing you to either sell weapons or drones or leave behind a part you ight not ever see again. The decisions you must make are really make FTL a brilliant game, which has emphasis on your actions during and  between combat.All in all, great value for money, and a unique gem of a game. Highly recommended.			",102,11,0,10,19,0,24

												The game idea is great, though I wish it was more three dimensional as well as graphicly inclined to wow the user, but instead we get a simple game which if you do not read how to operate the game, you will utterly fail. I know I did, you can check my playing of it on my channel to see me do so. But after you get past its old charm and its confusing without instruction workings, it's not that bad of a game. Be it that I will probably delete it after I get a succesful mission or 'playthrough' done, I would say it is a strategic ideal for space travel that can be a challenge to those who picture a simplistic space travel with real danger like any. Worth a free game? Yes.			",245,62,4,32,30,3,39

												FTL is a great game, it's one of the top games I would recommend. The permadeath is occasionally frustrating, but overall the game is quick enough that it isn't a serious issue, and it makes for some great tension when your ship is being held together by nothing but hopes and positive energy and you're battling a pirate in an asteroid field. The random-event generation is top-notch, and it would take weeks of playing to get anything like a largely duplicate playthrough. FTL is totally worth the $10 pricetag, but it commonly goes on sale during the Steam Sale events - you would be doing yourself a disservice to NOT pick it up for $5.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it came to making a decision on buying this game, I stayed on the fence for nearly a year. After pulling the trigger and purchasing FTL, I can say that the past year will be looked back upon as being lesser than what it could have been. This game is epic...it rewards the quick thinking  and smites those who are not up to the challenge. Regardless of which category you fall into, you will keep coming back for more.

												This game should not need my endorsement.  You should already own it.  You should already have it installed.  You should be playing it right now instead of reading this.  The game presents the player with near endless replayability as you unlock more ships, offereing different starts, and play through a world that is different each time.  The pool of events is large enough that it doesnt begin to feel repetitive even after many, MANY, play throughs.  Or should I say play attempts?  This is one of those less forgiving of games.  Easy is mamagable, but normal will rip you to shreds even if you have been lucky.  If a hard is ever realeased I will probably never be able to beat it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For everyone who is very frustration resistent and willing spend many hours into, before the first success. If you are such person, then you will recive a first class space strategy game for countless hours where decisions are everything, like in reallife. This game is unforgiving, some call it unfair and luck based. I can only say, dont listen to this people. Where the random parts in FTL plays a big rolle, with the time you spend in this game, it will give you the most valueable thing, its called experience. With enough experience and a big enough will to win, you will be able to overcome the most random parts successfully and that is satisfying as hell.It can happen that after many hours, if your frustration will peak, you will eventually start talk to FTL like to a god and ask yourself, why you need to proof your belive every damn time, but there will be day where the god also can be very generous. Dont give up! Its only up to you, what you do with the tools you will recive!Its one of the games where you start to play, and after 100h you realize, that the prize for it is just a joke and you still have fun while playing it. Every new round can be different and always something unexpected can happen you, never seen before.Edit: The AE update is a free huge content update, where many new tools were added for playing with. Some little aspects were changed also new were added. Overall this game became better through it, for everybody!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most amazing space-themed games ever. It's half-roguelike, half-RTS. The soundtrack also gets a special mention, because it's way different than what we're used to hear in space opera stuff.Only complaint: the game is kinda short on content at the moment and is a bit too based on luck. Still, though, it will draw you in like very few games do. Recommended!EDIT: as of the Advanced Edition, I don't really have any more complaints about the game. It's still somewhat reliant on RNG, but there's a lot of tactical depth added with the new modules. Ten outta ten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game with increasing difficulty as you progress. If you want to unlock ships, you actually have to work for them instead having them handed to you for sticking around for a while. I've played this game for a good while and still haven't beat the final boss. You have a map with points on each level and choose the way you want to progress through the level by juping to different points, but if you stick around too long, a fleet of ships start advancing its way across the screen until you jump to the next sector. Definitely worth the $10 and a great game to just play whenever you feel like.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Faster than light is a game where you become the captain of your very own ship, placing youself in command as you traverse across a galaxy to save the day. This arcade style game gives you control of your ship, crew, and weapons, you can customise their names etc. Gameplay, ftl provides a very real challenge when playing, you have to take your ship across various sectors in space all the while being chased by the rebel fleet. As you progress across you face an array of random events, which can either lead to riches of destruction. No play through is ever the same, and that can be frustrating at times but is a crucial part of ftl. The perma-death gameplay mechanic further making every decision you make as having serious consequences for your game, I personally love it as a game that i can sit down and think well this could occupy me for 20minutes to an hour, if i successfully reach the boss. I would recommend this game to my friends and even if you only play it once it is worth a look.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10An absolutely brilliant game that is a must-own for almost anyone, it’s endlessly replayable and presents a very distinct challenge. Its complexity doesn’t come from overwhelming the player – all the mistakes you make will be your own fault – it’s just brilliantly designed in that it requires instant critical thinking in battles and a thoughtful approach while traversing the galaxy and encountering unknown or enemy vessels. The perma-death element is what gives the game its replay value – a single session could last 15 minutes to two hours depending on your skill (and luck); dying in this game is really just a learning experience. The unlockables don’t necessarily make the game any easier and the only way you will advance further is by refining your approach. I find myself coming back to the game time and time again to see how far I can make it.			",452,100,26,71,65,4,112

												Faster than light is a game where you become the captain of your very own ship, placing youself in command as you traverse across a galaxy to save the day. This arcade style game gives you control of your ship, crew, and weapons, you can customise their names etc. Gameplay, ftl provides a very real challenge when playing, you have to take your ship across various sectors in space all the while being chased by the rebel fleet. As you progress across you face an array of random events, which can either lead to riches of destruction. No play through is ever the same, and that can be frustrating at times but is a crucial part of ftl. The perma-death gameplay mechanic further making every decision you make as having serious consequences for your game, I personally love it as a game that i can sit down and think well this could occupy me for 20minutes to an hour, if i successfully reach the boss. I would recommend this game to my friends and even if you only play it once it is worth a look.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is simple and each play through is a little different, even more so if you switch up the ships. This makes for a fun game each time after you die and it is easy to lose track of the time doing so. The up side however is also the down side, since you never know what you are jumping into without the scanner ( unless you are lucky to get it early ) so your game may not be that long.That said the game is still quite fun and I say GL HF.

												Before we start this review I'd like to say that having FTL in the title mislead me into this purchase. (I thought that this game would involve the famous internet meme ""For the Loss"".) The game involve's ""space stations"".. What is this? Some sort of fantasy book. For one having this is completely irrelevant to the games main purpose. The game has worse controls than Crazy Taxi for the PS1. ""Use the mouse to move"" what is this some sort of 1990 Pong game.For me this game was totally worth 49 pence. PS. I think the game developers are racist			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Full Review (with pictures and rating): http://www.gamingv2.com/2014/04/24/review-ftl-advanced-edition/Gaming V2 Review - FTL Advanced EditionRating: 9/10Back in September 2012 Gaming V2 was not covering PC games, and as such we did not talk about the fantastic indie title, FTL (Faster Than Light) by the two man team at Subset Games.  Exceeding their Kickstarter goal of $10,000 by an insane $190,000 for a whopping total of over $200,000 when all was said and done, FTL was given the chance to really become something great, and back in 2012, it proved the faith people had shown it was well placed and well deserved.  I openly admitted that had GV2 covered PC games back then, FTL would easily have been in contention for my personal game of the year for 2012, and that’s saying a lot when it would be running against titles like Mass Effect 3, Far Cry 3, Dishonored, The Walking Dead Game, Mark of the Ninja and many more.Now, in April 2014, Subset games released their first full blown content update that contained so much new material they even gave FTL the new name of “FTL Advanced Edition”, which also saw the release of the game on the iPad as well.  Included in this massive update are new ship layouts, new equipment, ship upgrades, a new race, a plethora of new side missions and a new hard mode if you feel like torturing yourself.FTL was known for being great at offering you a unique experience every time you booted it up.  No play through was the same as any prior to it.  Now with all the new side missions, ship layouts, the new race and the new equipment and upgrades, this just ensures that you will never know what’s to come, and you will love it for that.  Obviously the typical strategies are still there, but with the addition of neat new upgrades like hacking, which allows you to disable enemy systems for lengthy periods of time, a cloning bay that will allow your dead crew to come back to life at a somewhat lessened skill level, or the awesome mind control that allows you to take over enemy crew members and have them work against their own ship, your options have never been so limitless.  You can’t do it all at once, so this just further encourages you to keep on playing after you have inevitably met your demise, time after time again.Each ship type now has a ‘C’ layout version in addition to the original ‘A’ and ‘B’ layouts of the original game.  These new layouts can be unlocked by getting to the final sector using the ‘B’ type layout of that same ship, once again encouraging players to try all flavors of ship in the game.  They have also allowed previous layouts to be unlocked by beating the game with the various other ships, instead of always relying on the random events to spawn that allow you to unlock them.  This is a welcomed change, as the player had no control over which events would happen in a ply through, which can make it rather frustrating if you’re going for a specific unlock and the even just never “pops” for you.  There are also two completely brand new ships, each with multiple layouts, the Lanius cruis and Crystal cruiser.  So there is definitely no shortage of new content to unlock for those of you who like to have everything.  Ships also allow you to have crew man their passive systems now, such as doors or sensors, for further bonuses as well.  By manning one of these systems, you are increasing it’s level by one for free.  So if your doors are at a upgrade level of 1, putting a crew member in there will treat the doors like it’s a level 2 system free of charge as long as the room stays manned.  This is a great addition as it allows you to make use of any extra crew members you may have on board instead of having them stand around doing nothing if there aren’t intruders to fend off.On top of the new ships are the large amount of new weapons and drones that you will be able to purchase or find in game.  The Flak weapon is a stand out for me, as it seems to be the bane of my in game existence.  With it’s low accuracy and massive damage, I find it tears my hull apart faster than I can send crew to repair it.  I haven’t had the chance to use it myself, but once I get my hands on one, those rebels better watch out!  There are even more new drones added to the plate as well, including those that start fires on enemy ships, or the Ion Intruder which periodically emits ion pulses that ionize enemy systems, causing them to malfunction.The last thing I will touch on is the Hard mode that was added in the Advanced Edition.  A hard mode for a game that most people couldn’t even beat on the easy setting.  I for one never tried playing on Easy, as I’m a glutton for punishment and just went headstrong into Normal like a champ.  A champ that loses 90% of the attempts he makes (but has fun doing it!).  Hard mode doesn’t add anything new to the game, but it reduces the scrap rewards (scrap is the currency in FTL) for beating enemies or completing missions, makes the enemies you encounter tougher than you will find on Normal, and some other small tweaks to keep things interesting.  As stated on FTL’s official website, Hard mode is for the “more masochistic fans” and promises to make you wish you never attempted it.  I like it.The Bottom LineFor an indie game to release a content update of this size and price (free!) over a year after the release of their title, it’s pretty darn impressive and not something that just flies in under the radar.  Subset Games love their game and love their fans and it shows in every area.  If you somehow found yourself bored of the original game after all this time, the Advanced Edition offers more than enough to pick it back up and have it feel as fresh as it did the first day you tried the original game.  For anyone who has yet to pick up FTL at all, now there is even more reason to do so.  There is no excuse to not play one of 2012′s best games, revamped and upgraded for an awesome 2014 version.  Give it a shot and you won’t regret it.  FTL Advanced Edition is FTL on steroids.  The Advanced Edition does nothing more than make the original game better in every way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh my God, I love this soundtrack score so much! I would buy the entire game just for that... Oh wait... Just buy the soundtrack -.- In all seriousness, I enjoyed this game. Mind you, I didn't play that much. I played until bored then went to meadows a new. I enjoyed the gameplay which is all there pretty much is. If you want a personal narrative, and story driven gameplay, go buy some trash by David Cage (Heavy Rain Creator). If you like RTS elements with a taste for strategy, you can do far worse then this game. It's fun for the moment, but it can become boring to play, and sometimes frustrating. I love the challenge, but there is far too big of a diffuculty curve between the 3rd galaxy and 4th galaxy. If you happen to see this on sale, buy it. If it's not on sale, you could probably do better, but it's fun for the moment. 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not for the faint-hearted. You will die several times before you realize that Easy mode is not an accurate description of the difficulty. Though it may seem like your winning chances depend purely on RNG, there is actually a heavy amount of skill and tactics involved in the gameplay. The most satisfying feeling you will get in this game is constantly learning to master these skills and tactics which will eventually lead you to win the game. Then it becomes an addiction that carries over to other ships that you unlock. The feeling of needing to beat the game with several unlocked ships on multiple difficulties will consume many, many hours of your life.

												Other than the wonderful music, the gameplay video may leave you wondering what the big deal is with FTL.  You may wonder, ""Why does it look like the ships are just staying still, isn't there any action?""  Well don't let that deceive you.  Combat in FTL is exhilerating moment-to-moment as you make critical decisions about what your crew should be doing, putting together strategy to fend off boarding parties and put out fires on the deck, rerouting power to make sure your most essential systems get you through until you can lick your wounds.  Trust me, it's more than enough without having to manually navigate your ship.Real tension and decision-making takes place between battles, as you jump from system to system either looking for or avoiding combat, looking for loot, and ultimately finishing your mission.  If you like the idea of micromanaging a spacecraft you cannot -CANNOT- miss FTL.			",472,119,8,54,27,1,42

												Really great game for a really great price.  A game that can really change each time you play it, and dying in a terrible horrible way is part of the fun.  Basically you try to get your ship from point A to point B by choosing planets to go to on your way there.  Each planet has a random even which can be influenced by how your ship is upgraded or what crew members you have.  Part of the fun is the randomness in that sometimes you can get a lot of really great stuff, and other times it just feels like the game's mission is to ♥♥♥♥ you over anyway it can.  Again this adds to the fun and makes the game extremely challenging and replayable.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes strategy/rpg type games and doesn't mind a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must play for Trekkies and sci-fi nerds. Manage your own starship by routing power to various systems, commanding crew and making diplomatic decisions. Unlike other games making righteous decisions does not always benefit you in the long run. There is not black and white morality system here.Continued play unlocks different ships and layouts that genuinely affect gameplay. Hopelessly addictive and tonnes of replay value. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not very complex compared to other strategy games, FTL's gameplay feels unique and fun. You pilot a ship through space. You'll fight aliens. You'll make decisions about upgrading your ship. And despite your best efforts, your ship will get destroyed. And you will hate this game. And yet you will start over and try again and again and again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple in visual appearence, and sounds (including the soundtrack), both are pleasing to the eye and ear, and the gameplay is as complex as you want it to be. Hulk your ship up with firepower and rely on heavy weapons to blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of anything that stands in your way, or invest in crewmembers who excel in CQ combat and teleport them into the enemy vessel and pacify it by sabotaging lifesupport systems or simply directly wipe out the enemy crew and acquire more loot.Micromanage power distribution and crew tasks/placement in order to counter invasions, repairing vital systems or hull breaches. Your ship is on fire? open up the airlock and all doors between the fire and the lock, emptying that area of oxygen, keeping the fire from spreading, and eventually starve it to death. Its easy, yet challenging and not hard to get into, making it an excellent game that will help you kill time whilst you are waiting for a phonecall or waiting for the spouse to get all gussied up for an evening out. You will never play it the same way twice. There are also unlockable ships to be had, along with achievements that will provide interesting challenges for you to try your hands on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FTL is one of the most frustrating strategy games I've played. There are thousands of different scenarios that can, and will most likely, lead to your ship's demise. However, this does not take away from the appeal of playing over and over again. Each death is a learning opportunity to be carried over to your next play through. You need to plan ahead and also have a little bit of luck on your side if you plan on surviving in space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I love the increasing difficulty, and when I want to rip my hair out after an Energy Fighter kills me.I really like how some enemies can teleport onto your ship, and it adds a certain twist to battles when you are least expecting it.I definitely recommend this game for players that want a challenge, and that like being able to understand a game really fast, instead of going through hour tutorials.I like how you can buy new heavy duty weapons, how you can increase stats from faster heal speed to more reactor power, and I really like the soundtrack, as I think it sounds amazingly cool.Overall, I give this game a review of 10/10, as I would not change anything about this game, well, unless the developer can somehow manage to make it even better, which in that case, great!

Let me tell you this game is hard.  Not hard to learn but hard to beat.  Lots of strategy and quick thinking involved.  I really think this game has a lot more potential than just what we see here now.  I hope they make a sequal and incorporate it into a game like Master of Orion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FTL is all about stories and impossible situations. Low on health? Survive five more jumps with lots and lots of close calls. Having the perfect ship? Die by the hand of a single enemy within thirty seconds. This unpredictable nature is what makes FTL interesting, even after hours and hours of playing. You will name ships after the captain of a glorious run, hoping it will bring luck to your new crew. You will spend hours reading absurd stories by other players. Highly recommended.

												FTL is one of the funnest and addictive games I've ever played, its just so difficult to put it down.  I love having an hour session every day inbetween all the other things i have to do.  Personally one of the best games I've ever played, simple gameplay with slight complex mechanics and forcing you to take a chance or not in certain situations is by far nerve wrecking.I definately recommend people try this game.  I'm an all around gamer, mainly play FPS (for fun), Moba's such as LoL (competatively), and other games whenever i find an intresting game.  If you think you have similar tastes in games such as i, this is a must buy!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Strangely addicting, FTL is a fun game that makes a lot out of a little.  The graphics are not fancy, but that quickly disappears when you really get into the game.  The premise is simple: get to the Federation with your secret data without being destroyed.  Death is permanent.  When you die (and you will, often) you don't go back to the last save.  You go all the way back to the beginning.  Space can be brutal.  However, play through again...and again.  While you had previously been ripped apart in level 2, you now get to level six every time.  You pick up crew and lose them.  You choose weapons as you come upon them and each battle has the opportunity to be your last.  For the price, it is certainly worth a buy.  I have found it oddly addicting and, of course, it plays on any old Mac or PC.  A solid recommendation to buy if you like the thinking man's space shooter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FTL is a mixture of emotions, happiness, loss, sorrow. You will get so drawn into the game that when that one missile pierces your shields and blows up your ship, your life feels like it has no meaning. I will always recommend this to a friend as it is a great mixture of game types.			",46,17,1,3,18,1,17

												自分の艦艇をカスタマイズしながら宇宙を旅する、所謂4X系ゲーム。主に、デフォルメされた乗組員を操りながら敵艦と砲火を交えることになる。美麗な映像なんてものはどこにも無い。純粋にゲーム性だけで勝負している。およそ二時間程度で一周することができるので、気軽に楽しめる。様々なイベント、隠し要素が用意されているため、何周しても苦にならない。始めたころは理不尽な難易度に驚愕するだろうが、近年のヌルゲーを鑑みるに、かえって熱中すると思う。2012年にプレイしたゲームの中では一番面白かった。そのへんのメジャータイトルより遥かに面白い。また、Modding(改造)が比較的簡単なので、長く遊べる。score 100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an indie game done right. A basic idea (make your way through space blowing up giant ships), but you're not gonna get to the end right away. You need to carefully craft your ship according to the way you wanna play (big weapons? pirate boarding action? stealthy destruction?), manage your resources and your crew, so that you can stand a chance to free the galaxy.It's frustrating at times (when you die, you start over) but smart and thrilling.
