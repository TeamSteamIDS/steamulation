Early Access Review
Do not buy in its current state unless you want to support the developer.I completed this game in literally five minutes (and that included a CTD-induced restart). There is less content than a demo would normally offer.The developer seems to be very active and eager to take suggestions from players. However, there is currently very little content, so unless you want to go along with the ride from virtually the start of the project, I suggest you wait six months before looking at this game.The game also seems to have a very strong fanboy base. On the upside, that means that at least some people have found the previous games to be excellent (despite their mediocre ratings). On the downside, that means that this game's rating may be superficially high for the time being.On to the actual review...Note: I have played many hacking games before, starting with Uplink in 2001 and most recently HackNet. I have not played any previous Hacker Evolution games.More detailed review below:(Lack of) Content and Pre-Alpha StateThis game has literally five minutes of gameplay -- one minute if you know what to do -- and all of it is shown in the 1:18 minutes long video and screenshots on the Steam store page. The game seems to be level based, and the game currently has one level. When you complete the level, you are taken back to the main menu and your only option is to start a new game.The options menu is completely empty, and there is no saving or loading. During my five minutes of gameplay, I also experienced a CTD.The developers even say so themselves in the Early Access description:What is the current state of the Early Access version?“There is a small playable level which gives you a good overview of how the final game will look and play.”GameplayThe game has a fairly standard setup with a CLI (command-line interface) where you type commands. When you start the game, you are prompted to type 'help' to see available commands, of which there aren't that many available. Your objective is to retrieve a file, even though you are not told from where or why you should retrieve the file. The game seems to be 'roguelike', in that failure means you start over. There is no saving or loading.In order to download the file, you must gain access to one of two available servers. This is done using a balancing minigame, where you must balance your CPU, firewall and network resources using dials in the lower-right corner. These resources seem to deplete your firewall depending on how they are set up. They don't add any real depth to the game, however, as there is a single setup that works best at all times, making any tweaking pointless. The same minigame-ish setup is used both for gaining access and to download the file.And that's pretty much all there is to it at this time.SummaryPros:- Good music- The interface looks niceCons:- Virtually no content(!!!)- Unstable- Empty options menu- No story, no purpose, no nothing- Unsure about balancing mechanic- Bad GUI / UX (no tab completion, no mouse click adjustment of balance wheels)If it actually had any content, a decent story and great gameplay, this game could be good. As it currently stands, it is barely an empty shell (no pun intended) with virtually no content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I have always been a huge fan of Uplink, which is what got me looking at Exosyphen's hacker games so many years back.  The old ones are good, but this next version is a huge step forward in making hacking into an actual ""game.""  The current version is very unfinished (maybe 10 minutes of total gameplay), but Robert is updating often with huge new features and gameeplay changes.  For example, just today he added a world editor, allowing you to create your own levels!Like other reviews have stated, he is very interested in feedback from the community as he develops this game.  This is not like so many early access games that will never be finished.  I trust Robert to make this into the next big hacker game.  Support him and his studio; they will not let you down.Gameplay - Finally!  A hacker game where there is more to do than just click or type a command and wait!  With sliders to control your CPU (overclocking), Download and Upload Bandwidth, and task priority, there is constantly a mini-game keeping you engaged.  Again - in it's current state, it's nothing more than a tech-demo, but this studio is no joke and will move fast to fully flesh out this idea.As a final note - I bought a couple of Robert's old hacker games.  A few times over the years I have lost access to my account and had to email support.  Robert himself answered promptly, with an immediate fix.  He is personable and cares about his customers in a way I don't see from many other developers (I'd put him with the likes of introversion).Support Early Access Developers who will finish games!

								VERY early access.  Would not recommend on buying it's current state unless you REALLY want to support the company.  Like others have said, it's all over in about 5 boring minutes...			",107,16,2,20,20,1,38

								Definately an early access game, Pretty much just enough to show you what the interaction with the game you will have. Terminal, check. visual nmap, check. Weird cpu slider thingy, check. Dont get this as of today(8/20/2016) if you want it for content, its purely to support the devs and bring the game to life. I feel this is going to turn out well.			",250,27,7,42,31,2,30

								It’s definitely an alpha build currently but I am excited to see what’s in stall for us.  Given Roberts dedication to customer satisfaction and passion towards his games I expect we will see this develop into something enjoyable yet still challenging within a decent time frame.

Early Access Review
								I've always enjoyed the Hacker Evolution series, and to me they keep getting better and more challenging every game. IMMERSION is no different, though it is still in Early Access. The biggest (and most obvious) change is that of the dials in which you control your firewall, tasks, and upload/download speed, preferably with your mouse wheel. The devs are constantly updating, with balancing aspects and new commands to help you complete the mission. As of this review, they just balanced out the firewall decay, so it's a bit better, though you still have to keep your eye on it which is the biggest challenge. I highly enjoy the challenge of the game, though it's going to get even better with every update.			",143,28,1,33,25,2,24

Early Access Review
								Well, its been a while to wait, but developing a new engine and new features takes a lot of time, and testing, and people complain about lack of content.. Well I guess they don't get the concept of 'early access' - that being, you get to see the development of the game (bugs and all) , you get the chance to offer suggestions, improvements, ideas and so on, which are actually listened (and replied) to by the developer.While content was small to begin with, I spent a good 40+ minutes trying to figure out how to solve the first mission, which involved some really fine balancing of components in your 'system', maxing the download rate when downloading, increasing the cpu power while decrypting (and keeping a fine eye on it so the system doesn't become toast).. but now there's at least 1 patch per day released, so you can really get a feel for what is going on in Roberts mind while he's in dev mode.Early access is indeed a gamble, some succeed, others fail, and i have been burned by some, however, unlike the ones i was burned by, i know that the dev will actually strive to satisfy the fans of the game genre, so this tile, i don't really consider a gamble, rather its a rare glimpse at what is actually involved in designing, and launching a game successfully.Personally I enjoyed it, its definitely an evolution from the previous hacker titles, while still retaining the style, the music fits the theme well (much like the other titles) and the new ui is pretty intuitive too, so I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next, and once the framework is nailed, the levels will come pretty quickly i think, as the method for making them looks pretty simple and painless.. allowing for a lot of scope with extra missions etc..

								So far the game is a lot of fun.  The mix between using bash and the gui gives it a nice cyberpunk feel and managing the hacks in terms of balancing is interactive and gives you more control.  It still has a long way to go but the scripting, style, look and with the developers history this should shape up to be a great game.  Definitely worth a go.			",87,9,0,11,10,0,19

								Love the first looks of this alpha.. (31 JulyUPDATE / July 31 hei.0.018.alpha)If you are looking for a finished game then you better wait until the game reaches that stage. For exosyphen studios fans... Robert made an awesome framework again! :-) Really wonder how this game will be at the end. So far looking good!			",97,31,3,4,20,2,41

Early Access Review
								First, to address the bad reviews: If you're expecting a full story mode and a full campaign within the first week of an Early Access launch, I don't know what to tell you...  Wait until full release and you'll have a better time.  (Hopefully)If you've played earlier titles in the Hacker Evolution series, especially the first two, you'll feel right at home here.  You've got a console, you've got a map with some servers on it, and you've got some status information about your machine.  It already feels quite polished, with a nice looking UI, non-invasive animations, and exactly the type of soundtrack a game like this deserves.  As stated above, there's not a whole lot of content here, (5, maybe 10 minutes) but without a need for expensive models and textures, animations, etc I don't expect any reason why that won't change significantly before release.New to the series (Unless I forgot them in Duality, but I think they're new) are the dials in the bottom right corner. These control hacking/firewall balance, upload/download balance, and CPU clockspeed. (And therefore temperature)  Turning up your upload speed and CPU clockspeed will speed up the time it takes to break through a firewall, but at the cost of higher temperatures.  Sadly I didn't try actually overheating, but it seems like a mechanic that could add a bit more manual risk/reward to a series which is otherwise reasonably repeatable.  A good first step, time will tell how the mechanic shapes up in future.The most glaring ommision right now for me is the lack of cursor key controls.  Up will navigate command history, but left and right didn't do anything for me, more frustrating because I had first attempted control + left to go back a word at a time.EDIT: Within a week of this review going up tab complete and cursor keys are now supported.Right now this Early Access release seems to be about getting community feedback and making sure they're developing a game that people want to play.  Hacker Evolution Duality wasn't my style, and it's nice to see even a short playable game that says ""This series is going back to its roots.""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access reviewI recommend this game because I know what is Hacker Evolution. If you never played HE before you should start with the first one, If you enjoy it, then you should come back here and play Immersion. The new console looks great. Although it has only one level at the moment, the dev is working daily to add new content. The first level gives you an overview of how to game will finally look and play. I recommend this game to people who like complex games. Support the game in Early Access, the dev reply to all the e-mails personally and is listening to feedback. ",1226,392,54,136,134,14,173

								This is a very early alpha build of this game. Knowing what the other games turned into adds to my expectations of what this game could be. For early addresses the game works well and I had no issues getting it installed and running on my Linux computers.I'm not a fan of the current (8/1/2016) way to manage the three circles on the lower right side.  It's awful.... But in sure they will fine a way to handle it.Pick it up and see what you think.  ",99,19,0,8,5,1,4

								Been in love with Hacker Evolution series since Exosyphen Studios released first one. Been long time without new one so I was really happy to hear that more is coming. Probably going to be the best one so far :)Framework is nice and bug fixing is really fast so far. Not much content at the moment but still I know that this wont be waste of money - thanks to Robert. And before current patch I actually spent so much time to beat the first level. I found  adjusting CPU/Firewall a bit hard before I realised that I can just mouse click where ever I want the bar to be.Will gladly wait for future patches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I am a huge fan of the games Exosyphen Studio have released. When I found out about this new game I got it right away. My only hesitation is the bad experiences with early access and companies using it for a cash grab… *cough Spacebase. This game at the moment is extremely short, it’s very early access. But once its released I am confident it will provide many hours of enjoyment like the previous games. I recommend getting the game to support the dev, but if you are expecting any decent game play you will have to wait for a few updates as the project gets more development. In the meantime, get one of the previous games released and have fun hacking. ",294,100,7,89,65,3,88
