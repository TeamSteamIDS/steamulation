												This is such a charming simple little game. It's a waiting game, but a game of this type that you just buy, and have, and there's no microtransactions maybe contributes to how peaceful and simple and charming it is. It's essentially a little garden that you tend, and check back in on periodically. You can grow plants, and sell them to buy fertiizer and seeds and other such simple additions, or improve your shop to get more customers. But the cornerstone of this game is the cross-breeding. You can cross-pollinate plants with each other to make new species, and those species are created according to specific rules. The game within a game is figuring out what those rules are, so you can eventually create any plant you want. You end up really feeling in control of your virtual garden. It's a beautiful game and I love it to bits.			",118,32,8,21,16,0,22

												This game is simple to understand and easy to fall in love with. Its a time management game so, even if your not playing it the game will still continue to run and continue with the game. But dont worry about that, in the menu you can pause time, make it go slower, or make it go faster. Its a bit hard to make money in the beginning but after a while it speeds up. The graphic's for the customers are a bit old school but that why I love the game. Its an old school time management game and in my opinion its was worth the money. The pictures make the game look more complicated then it really is. Also as a bonus feature in the game you can collect bugs that will appear randomly on your plants every now and then. So you can try and collect all the bugs as a little bonus feature to the game. This game won't take up much of your time and it's a bit addicting so be warned!			",25,96,0,13,15,0,6

YouTube™ Video: ""SEEDS AND SEEDLINGS...AND SOME SALSA"" - Let's Play Plant Tycoon (Badly) 

			Views: 967		

			If you like it, like it! Leave a comment! Tell your friends! Tell Twitter! Tell strangers! Tell everybody! But be wary of the strangers. Especially if they're offering you sweets.		

This is Fish Tycoon, but with plants (see my Fish Tycoon review for details). It's also a better game, as it has more things to do while you are waiting for your plant DNA to fuse and create something super special or super-dead-already.Lop bits off your plants, catch bugs off your plants, spray lightly-toxic substances over your plants - it's all here. Then cart them off to your broken garden centre and watch the crazy thoughts of your customers as they decide what (and whether) to buy,It's all in real time, so don't show up one day and you will have a lot of dead stuff and the shame of knowing you killed a nursery of defenceless plants, you monster.

												Very simple yet fun game to kill time for whatever reason if you are bored or waiting for something. The plants also grow when you're not playing but you can at anytime on the menu screen make time faster, slower, or pause it if you happen to be too busy to play or free, whice is a plus for me. If you are not into relaxing or simple games, then I wouldn't recommend it.			",77,27,0,18,8,0,7

												A very light-weight game that brings you back to a time where micro-transactions were nonexistant and you could happily farm, plant, whatever without having to hand over your credit card, watch ads or praticipate in a shady promotion...A little history lesson: Before tablet games saturated the video game market with free titles you could download and turning out to be micro-transaction riddled hooplahs, we had games like this. Games like Plant Tycoon would often be found on gaming websites or the game sections of popular social networking sites where you could play the game on the website as a limited demo version or download a free full version for a limited time before a timer ran out and asked you if you liked the full game and if you wanted to buy it from their service.Keep this history lesson in mind!My personal history with this game: I was a lonely shut-in middle schooler... I had stopped going to normal school and spent nearly all of my time inside the house because i wasn't allowed to go outside. So i often played games on the internet on my old Windows XP computer. One of them was Plant Tycoon. I played it on a website called Shockwave . com which as described above - was one of those sites where you could play the game on the site as a demo version or download a full version for free that would ask you if you wanted to purchase the title from their server after a timer ran out. I always played the demo version, but i always found myself loving this game. It was perfect when i needed to get homework done or needed to practice my typing skills because it ran on real time. No needing to worry about pausing the game and coming back to it - it's a game you run in the background while you do your actual work. So when i saw the game on Steam all these years later on a Windows 7 laptop with wifi my nostalgia kicked in and i played the demo again, waiting for a sale on the actual title to happen...But it never did...For some reason this game never seems to go one sale, which was upsetting... But ultimately after arguing with myself, i spent a full 10 bucks on the title. But that proved to be 10 bucks well spent as if you're the type to justify a game's price with the hours you get out of it - you may find yourself sinking HOURS into Plant Tycoon... And don't let my current amount of gameplay hours fool you. I played the crap out of this game online in my middle school days.And that brings us back to the history lesson from before:Compare Plant Tycoon to any similar tablet game you'll find on your iPad or Kindle today... They may be free to download - yes - but then they'll ask you to either pay for some in-game currency with real money, subcribe to a service or you try to play for 'free', but then you end up paying with time - watching ads, doing fishy promotions, ect.So when you compare the option of a pay-to-wait game on your tablet and Plant Tycoon on Steam - you're probably better off with Plant Tycoon.The game has no micro-transactions that cost real money - everything you can buy you can buy with in-game currency. It runs on real time - yes -  but there are options to decide how fast or slow that in-game time moves and there's even an option to stop the clock entirely - a good option for if you're going to bed or know you won't be touching your computer for a while. The price may seem high but when compared to similar tablet games you end up with a better deal in the long run... This is really a 'mom' game. This is the kind of game that requires patience, so feel free to run it in the background while you work, cook or do any other time consuming activity you can't normally do while playing games.10 dollars is still a bit much for such a light-weight and somewhat dated game, but it doesn't ever seem to go on sale... It might be one of those rare titles that only goes on sale very few times a year? If you can snag it on sale - by all means do it. But if you or your kids are sick of tablet games that are constantly begging you for money or bombaring you with ads and you need a pay once - play forever alternative: Plant Tycoon is your game.Plant Tycoon gets 5 out of 5 from me both with and without nostalgia goggles.

												Personally, I find it to be a very enjoyable game. You could approach it systematically (perfect for people who like ticking boxes!) or just have fun breeding random plants and catching bugs. Has lots of additional features, such as time adjustment, hunt for magical plants (with special properties) and mutagenic chemicals ;) One of these games where it's fun to discover things without a guide. There's not too much place for seeds, so plan carefully!			",15,12,0,10,17,0,12

												This game is very relaxing and fun. You breed+sell plants, catch bugs, and upgrade your equipment. I had it a few years ago and put countless hours into it; now that it's on steam, I expect to put many, many more. If you like games that you can run in the background and check in on every once in a while, you'll like this game. If you want to sit there and be doing things constantly, than it might not be for you. It takes real time for your plants to grow and finding all the magic plants takes a lot of patience.

												I really really like this game. I think most of you won't. It is an older game that involves real time waiting. It is perhaps one the first of the type of game where you wait for things to happen in games. What really is neat about this game is the breeding part. You can breed different types of plants with different flowers/petals and different types/actual plant types. So you can have a vox (a black flower) cactus, tree, fern, or many other types. Sometime I will edit this review to be more complete.			",118,25,5,12,33,0,49

												This is possibly one of my fave little time-wasters I use to chill out when I need it. The graphics aren't necessarily the slickest or most HD these days, but the premise and mechanics of growing various plants while you're away keeps me coming back after all this time. Additionally the options to change how fast in-game time passes, and the ability to pause it when you're away for an extended period is one of my fave features of the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
