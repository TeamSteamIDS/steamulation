												Offroad drive is a real offroad game. it isnt traditional racing, it is time trials and u  can turn ghosts on to see opponents while playing. When i say real offroad game i mean you have to use winch and watch the pressure so you dont break cable, you can turn 4x4 on/off and lock in hubs to get diff types of traction when/where you need it. It also has  prettty nice mud and effects for vehicle interacting with it and making tracks and ruts and it affecting the physics of the vehicle. Mud washes off if you drive thru a clear water river or creek and can get muddy again.  Overall fun game but different and captures real offroading pretty dang well and its obvious the ydid their research on this game. Its a shame the market for it is kinda niche cause they did a good job on it.			",469,42,27,21,14,4,30

												Most offroad racing games have you racing around a relatively smooth dirt track that maybe has a few jumps. This game has some tracks like that, but where it really shines is when the smooth track ends at a huge pile of rocks and the only way forward is up and over.You have quite a bit of control over the vehicle with the ability to use lockers, adjust air pressure, switch between high and low gear ranges and a winch. Knowing how and when to use these systems is essential to finishing most of the tracks, thankfully a tutorial is provided. The graphics and climbing physics are impressive and there is a nice selection of vehicles, although a little more customization would be appreciated.This game has some fairly significant issues however. The driving model works quite well at low speeds (including simulating how easy it is to get stuck in deep mud) but breaks down at higher speeds on the smooth sections of the track where the vehicle has no sense of weight and slides and bounces around unrealistically. When you do get stuck without a nearby tree to use as a winch anchor, the lack of a reset button means you have to restart the race which can be extremely frustrating with the length of some of the events. The game does at least reset you if you roll the vehicle or fall off the track. In all the events you're racing a ghost ai which often feels cheaty when it effortlessly floats over a mud pit that you're stuck in up to your axles or hovers over broken rocks that hang you up at every turn. When it's not cheating it's not particularly smart and is relatively easy to beat.Unlike most offroad games, there is no free roam mode. The tracks are very detailed with lots of interesting obstacles, but you're confined to a relatively narrow corridor that resets you back on the track if you stray outside the boundaries. Sometimes these boundaries aren't very clear so you'll miss a turn and end up off the track with a time penalty. At least you have the option to set up an empty multiplayer server and drive around the tracks by yourself to better learn them and to test out the vehicles. I haven't found anyone else who has this game to test out multiplayer with so I can't comment on how well that works.For awhile this game appeared to have been abandoned with the devs being MIA but a recent update just a few days ago added additional language support so there is hope again that some of these issues will be fixed.Despite all these issues, I still had a lot of fun simply because there aren't many games that actually simulate low speed rock crawling and scrambling (besides possibly spintires which I'm waiting for a good sale on). I can hesitantly recommend this game as long as you can live with the issues and you can find it on sale, with the number of unresolved issues I wouldn't be able to recommend it at the full asking price.Pros:graphicstrack designrock crawlingCons:cheaty aipoor vehicle handing at speedno way to get unstuck without restarting raceno free roam7/10			",549,183,19,71,76,4,115

												This game is not for your average arcade racer fans. This is for people who know and understand what lockers are, what high and low 4wheel drive is for and what tire pressure effects when in the mudd or rock crawling. Off-roading is a blast and this game did a decent job capturing it. The only complaint I can think of is that it does not have a freeroam to explore an area and just create your own path through the map.For a off-road sim, this is a good one.

												This game is excellent if you are familiar with the concepts of 4x4. Realistic physics, good controls, and a lot of fun if you are into simulation games.  It runs on the Unreal engine so the graphics are decent as well. The only complaint i have is there is no free roam, which is disapointing. still definitely recommend the game.

												ORD wants really badly to be an off road SIM-style game, but it just falls short in too many aspects. From a gameplay perspective, the game just overdoes the multiple obstacles and approaches and throws them all at you at once. Imagine being taught how to build a birdhouse in a tutorial then the first race asks you to build an entire apartment complex on your own. Even with 5 hours under my belt there were simply some courses I could not win.Now from a game design perspecive, ORD is almost an embarassment. The graphcis are... Okay at best. This would have looked good in the PS2 era of gaming. There are sometimes neat lighting effects and the draw distances are surprisingly detailed but everything else is left to be desired. Also the game cannot and will not remember your control configurations. So unless you want to use the up, down, left, right, arrow keys, you'll be remapping your control scheme every time you open it up.I'm willing to let all of that pass... but the one thing that really gets under my skin is the AI design. Basically if you don't win 2 out of the 3 courses in a circuit and place SECOND in the one you don't win... you will never come in first in a circuit. The same AI driver WINS... EVERY... SINGLE... TIME. There's no coming back from any finish less than 2nd place in any given race. That's just awful game design.Even if you absolutely LOVE anything offroading related, I cannot possibly recommend this game. It's just underdesigned on so many levels and in the few places that it does shine, it overly complicates things to the point where they are frustrating. Skip this game at all costs unless you are a fan of mental toture and self-harm.			",100,9,1,6,4,0,5

												5/10, this game is not worth the money, or the time. it is not ""true-to-life"" at all. 1C should get their Ish together and make a decent game or gtfo. How do you expect us to play an offroad game where you can not go offroading? All you can do is follow the racetrack, that's it. physics are crap, suspension is not realistic by any stretch of the imagination, the sounds of the engines are too similar. Looks like they rebooted one of their old offroad games with fancy graphics. that's the only good thing about the game...the graphics.My advice: go download rigs of rods (for free), if you want an offroading game where you can do some offroading.

												This game is not fun. I have played other offroad simulators, my favorite being Screamer 4x4. That game is more than 10 years old, and it's still much more fun than this one.Off-Road drive does have some merits:-nice graphics (but nothing jaw-dropping)-all the standard off-road tools (differentials, winch...)- terrain deformationHowever, there are a lot of negative elements, which take away from the fun:- no free roam mode- limited gameplay modes- time penalty for ridiculously placed posts - so game feels like a 'keep on the track simulator'- no real carsI still play it occasionally, but only because there aren't that many other off-road sims.

Probably not (come on steam,lower the price and let more people enjoy this great game). I got a cheap steam key off ebay and its definately money well spent.8/10 IMO			",27,6,27,0,12,0,3

												A fellows, really love the game. My son turned me on to this game and I have enoyed it ever since. It comes close to the real thing for me since I lost my abilty to drive in the real world.  I was wondering if you all could make it larger were it could have multiple players roaming around the desert using GPS and then come back to camp.  The racing is cool I have a YJ Jeep and like what you all have done to make this as realistic when climping up rocks bolders and going through water. lots of fun. Thank You Very much.

												Tracks are pretty unique and the gameplay is pretty in depth compared to my few years of off-roading. Great detail with the terrain and the dirt and mud that gets on the trucks. Intersting challenges throughout all of the different locations from rocks and boulders to mud pits and swamps. The supsension can get a little over bouncy depending on the class of truck you use and the vehicles do drop power on some of the obstacles, but overall i think it's a fun game to just go mess around on			",54,1,6,2,4,0,19

												If you like off roading and rock crawling in 4lo and both axles locked this is a great game to kill the off-road bug when you can't get out there for real!  Adjust/change tire pressure, ride height, spring tension, tire size/tread, 4hi, 4lo, lock diffs. Choose the correct line and approach to get over obstacles.  If that don't work you got a winch too!

												Excellant direction with this game allowing user to focus on driving skill instead of how fast u can drive and still control the vehicle.  If you like challenge rather then GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN then this is a great alternative game.  Just began playing but decided to give review already since nice to see this change of gameplay.  As of now I give it 8/10 and if I am able to connect a wheel for driving (nice you can already assign your own keyboard controls so dont have to use arrow keys) and variety of upgrades like better differntials, brakes, etc then I will increase rating.  GREAT GAME!			",57,8,8,4,38,1,36

Posted: April 15, 2014
												I have nothing but good things to say about this game.  I come from a long history of off roading games.  The greatest offroad game I have come across was the Cabelas 4x4 Offroad series.  That was for the older, windows 98-XP system.  I have played several others such as Spin Tires (incomplete), and none have come close to the Cabelas series.  Then I saw this on youtube.  When I saw it come onto greenlight I was anxiouse for it to be green lit, and I was super happy when it went on sale.  I regret nothing of my purchase.  Ill give you a nice thorough pros/cons list of what I look for in offroadingMy list will definatly be disputable.PROSAMAZING physics.Truck mechanics (4x4, diffrentials, different tires etc) are the best I have ever seen.Ground deformation is only put where it is needed, thus reducing any lag and making the game easier to run.  The deformation that is there, is beautifulGreat truck selectionLevels are realistic to professional offroad raceing coursesSpecial tracks (mud bogs, rock climbs) test your skills of the extremesNice tutorial.  Gives you a good experience of what you're in for.Ghost truck and place indicator really add suspence, and give you a sense of competition to race against.  Some times the place indicator is innacurate, and when it says you're in 4th, you could win in 1st by a fraction of a second.CONS (most are very minor)Multiplayer and mods do not look promising to me at this point. Not much for soft body physics.  But really, it isnt needed and would just make the game more taxing.You cant add accessories to the truck (light racks, bully bars, roll cages etc.)Its only raceing - theres no checkpoint driving or free rome, but I have not found this to be much of a let down.  The racing ROCKS.Trucks do not have limited fuel.No ""super bogger"" trucks, or hard core mud bog/mud run tracks to use them on.Engine sounds arent the greatest in all trucks.In short, do I recomend this game?  Hell yes.  Solid 9/10.  Good job to everybody who worked on it, and thank you for making this beast game.EDITSince I wrote this review I have noticed that the public opinion has gone down.  If you ask me, people are picking on it to much and cant deal with a few problems from the big picture.  For $10, what did you expect?  Of course there are some problems.  One thing I saw was that there are to many obstacles.  Guess what?  Thats what pro offroading is about.  Obstacels, and lots of them. If the game is on sale, it is definatly worth it.  If you are trying to dicide between this and saving for a better game, I would save for a better game.  But, I still love it and recomend it.			",29,2,2,1,8,0,3

												Good driving mechanics. A bit dissappointing once you find out that this game requires some precision input but it doesn't really support controller. Worse still, it doesn't support force feedback. Not the one that makes your controller vibrates but the one that transmit surface, road-feel, grip level and such through your wheel, it doesn't have that.Anyway, if you want a good looking game but don't care much about controller support then it's a jolly fun game.Once again it doesn't support force-feedback. You have been warned!			",57,1,22,1,6,0,4

												4/5 good game just a few issues with some bugs, wheels getting stuck in logs/rocks and some button mapping problems but apart from that this is a real good off road game. Challenging fast paced and fun, ranging from wading through rivers and swamps to rock climbing steep cliffs the game boasts pretty good physics, not a sim but a fun game non the less.

												This game is for offroaders, what else is there to say. It has plenty of cars that can be tuned to different terrains that consist of mud, sand, rocks, obsticles and more. There are multiple races and different events to attend across the map and each one has something unique.It isn't really an easy game to play at first and needs some getting used to and the multiplayer funcion doesn't really work for some reason but overall it's an awesome Offroad Racing, it's hard to get better than that, maybe if the multiplayer functioned and the game had free ride mode with some open areas.

												This is the MOST realistic off road driving simulator ever, from changing tire pressure, to the differentials on axles.  Being a driving game means you steer and are driving with some button, on top of that some options such as changing differentials or activating 4x4 drive, require holding a modifer button and an activation button.  Thats steering, driving, two buttons to change something, all at the same time.  This isnt off road driving, its Octopus driving.  This game is rated O for octopuses, Ha, never thought I would see that!!!  Rating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00			",2655,1121,101,267,367,29,398

												The camera controls are bogus.  The winch controls are frustrating.  Many of the races require specific vehicle/setups to complete the course, much less win the race.But when things line up just right, this game is an absolute blast.  Well worth the entry fee.If using a G27, I recommend using the auto-center option at 10% in the Logitech controller manager.			",76,29,10,29,76,4,46

												With such great potential Off-Road Drive felt like it was going to be one of the best off-roading games ever, only one let down. No multiplayer at all. Contrary to the official website this game features a multiplayer section that fails to work. I even downloaded and used Hamachi & Tunngle with a friend and still no online co-op play. With such potential it is extremely sad that the makers have failed with this game. I only hope that a patch is released to fix this massive issue![UPDATE]Since I last posted this review back on the 28th of December 2012 I have since then found a fix to be able to play multiplayer/co-op with a friend in Off-Road Drive. If you are reading this and you would like to know the fix just message me.			",40,2,3,2,4,0,2

												my pc specs can definitly run this game or should but i found out that it is the game that i buggy and laggy. Off-road drive is more for console, not pc. when i first started playing this game is seemed that when the game runs, to much is focused on the enviroment. cpu runs bad ONLY when this game is running. i can play mw3 on med specs just fine, but these system requirments for offroad drive are lower than mw3 yet it still runs like poop. i wish i never bought this. oh and did i mention that multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond all repair!. never worked for me and also people on the forums. i wish this game ran smoothly because i would actually consider playing it again.

												A good game with great 4x4 mechanics and simulation. It is very race oriented, but will allow you to drive in trial races which reward you based on climbing over things rather than going as fast as possible.The camera views are decent. The view from inside the trucks seems extremely realistic.You have a limited amount of tuning options - suspension and ride height and tire selection. These values do make a difference in-game.While driving, you can select your gear, clutch is an option, you can use a winch, tire pressure is adjustable on the fly and you can enable 4 wheel drive as well as separately lock center diff and axle diffs.Overall - 6/10 for a racing game, but 10/10 for an offroad simulation game.

												Great surprise! I found this gem when I was looking for another game, I saw the screenshots and it sorta looked like a revamped, trials focused version 4x4 Evo with a 'lil bit of Spintires thrown into the mix. I added it to my wishlist and to my surprise it went on sale a week after that, so I bought it, played a bit and I wasn't dissapointed.Indeed, Off-Road Drive reminds me of 4x4 Evo 1/2 and Spintires, even better cause the latter, from what I've watched and read, looks like it doesn't offer much and gets old quickly. This game offers many different tracks, vehicles and customization options. You race against the clock and other opponents but you don't see 'em during the race tho, except for a ghost of the first and second cars when they're getting close on you, so it feels kinda like a rally game in that regard, you still feel the competitive pressure and rush; During each race, depending on the surface you're on, you'll have to change the drive mode, gears, differentials, tire pressure and you'll even have to use the winch to attach the vehicle to a tree -or something else- a few times in certain levels just to get out of the most difficult situations.A really fun game overall if you're into more 'cranial', simulation-y type of racing games, specially off-road ones, I truly recommend it.

												Best $3.74 I ever spent(on a game). Off-Road Drive > Spintires. The only thing Spintires has going for it is the mud simulation(which is 100x better). Other than that though, this game is the real ""Ultimate Off-Road Driving Experience"". I'm, also, so glad I waited to purchase it until after being so disappointed by Spintires. Helped ease the pain a bit. Just wish someone would hurry up and make Off-Road Drive 2.			",23,1,9,0,0,0,0

												Great game. Love the graphics and choices of 4wd's. I really like the slow rock crawling maps. The suspention flexes around and the choice of bigger tires is great to. I would ask that you fix something in the settings, i change the left and right controls to A and D but every time i exit the game and reopen it, the settings arent saved. it never saves?? Its just annoying having to change the settings everytime i play it. I also wanna suggest that you ad a free roam, so that you can explore the maps at your will without a time constraint or points, just so you can have a bit of fun and get some screen shots and stuff.

												A good game with great 4x4 mechanics and simulation. It is very race oriented, but will allow you to drive in trial races which reward you based on climbing over things rather than going as fast as possible.The camera views are decent. The view from inside the trucks seems extremely realistic.You have a limited amount of tuning options - suspension and ride height and tire selection. These values do make a difference in-game.While driving, you can select your gear, clutch is an option, you can use a winch, tire pressure is adjustable on the fly and you can enable 4 wheel drive as well as separately lock center diff and axle diffs.Overall - 6/10 for a racing game, but 10/10 for an offroad simulation game.

												Great surprise! I found this gem when I was looking for another game, I saw the screenshots and it sorta looked like a revamped, trials focused version 4x4 Evo with a 'lil bit of Spintires thrown into the mix. I added it to my wishlist and to my surprise it went on sale a week after that, so I bought it, played a bit and I wasn't dissapointed.Indeed, Off-Road Drive reminds me of 4x4 Evo 1/2 and Spintires, even better cause the latter, from what I've watched and read, looks like it doesn't offer much and gets old quickly. This game offers many different tracks, vehicles and customization options. You race against the clock and other opponents but you don't see 'em during the race tho, except for a ghost of the first and second cars when they're getting close on you, so it feels kinda like a rally game in that regard, you still feel the competitive pressure and rush; During each race, depending on the surface you're on, you'll have to change the drive mode, gears, differentials, tire pressure and you'll even have to use the winch to attach the vehicle to a tree -or something else- a few times in certain levels just to get out of the most difficult situations.A really fun game overall if you're into more 'cranial', simulation-y type of racing games, specially off-road ones, I truly recommend it.

												Best $3.74 I ever spent(on a game). Off-Road Drive > Spintires. The only thing Spintires has going for it is the mud simulation(which is 100x better). Other than that though, this game is the real ""Ultimate Off-Road Driving Experience"". I'm, also, so glad I waited to purchase it until after being so disappointed by Spintires. Helped ease the pain a bit. Just wish someone would hurry up and make Off-Road Drive 2.			",23,1,9,0,0,0,0

												my pc specs can definitly run this game or should but i found out that it is the game that i buggy and laggy. Off-road drive is more for console, not pc. when i first started playing this game is seemed that when the game runs, to much is focused on the enviroment. cpu runs bad ONLY when this game is running. i can play mw3 on med specs just fine, but these system requirments for offroad drive are lower than mw3 yet it still runs like poop. i wish i never bought this. oh and did i mention that multiplayer is ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond all repair!. never worked for me and also people on the forums. i wish this game ran smoothly because i would actually consider playing it again.

												Although the game appears to be dead from a development viewpoint, I'm still writing this.There are a few things that need reworked in the game; Object boundaries are pretty shoddily done, the respawn system is pretty infuriating, vehicle handling, and the vehicles ability to turn their wheels.First, object boundaries, its pretty obvious when you're in rocks that the boundaries of the vehicles and the rocks are pretty lax. By this, I mean the game will register that the object are colliding when on screen they aren't. This will make taking a particular line difficult, its pretty infuriating when you should be able to make it up a ledge but the game won't let you. I can tell that this was done to ease the work needed in programming and less processing to do client-side, it would be nice to see it refined, however. This also ties into #5, vehicles ability to turn their wheels, more when I get there, though.Respawn system, the forced respawn is rather annoying, there have been countless times when I was forcibly respawned even though I wasn't in the situation it was telling me I was. I think forced respawn should be removed and a 'You appear to be stuck, would you like a penalty-free respawn?' should be in its place. There's just no excuses for the respawn, something like that should have been fixed long ago.Vehicle handling is another spot that I can had corners cut to ease the work on the devs. When vehicle handling is lower, the vehicle isn't harder to handle, it simply won't respond to inputs as well. Yes, this is essentially the same thing, however its not. When handling is low, the vehicle simply refuses to do what you're telling it to do, IE. solid ground, full lock steering, and going 4 KPH the vehicle should turn very sharply, there is no reason for it not to, however it simply refuses to turn due to the handling mechanisms in the game. Torque, this is kinda in with the traction mechanisms of the game, low gear isn't as powerful as it should be. In most 4-wheel drive vehicles 4-low is almost unstoppable, however in the game the vehicles get bogged down far too easily. The vehicle get far too much 'traction' this is tied in with the object boundaries being lax.(Un)fortunately, this is the only game that I have found that fills this genre (Hardcore Offroad Racing), so I would have to say its the best one like it. I would recommend it because it isn't a horrible game, it just needs work to refine it.  ",65,13,4,9,26,0,3

												Not sure what to say. These guys got the right idea. Nobody to this day has still made a really good intense offroad game for pc that i know of. And im sure if there was it would sell many copies. Please make again but put some effort in this time. This off road drive is glitchy, has poor graphics and hard to see where your going because of the camers setup. But this game still has some kool features like diff lock, four by, winch, tire pressure adjustment ect.			",15,3,5,0,4,0,1

												Love this game.  It can be fiendishly difficult in places, the controls are many and you'll need to adjust them to be able to play, but it's so refreshing to find a game that is genuinely challenging, rather than just frustrating and cheesey, or just plainly too easy.I build RC rock crawlers.  Playing a game based on the full scale vehicles is about as close to my dream game as I think it is possible to get.  The complexity won't be for everyone, but it's definitely one of those games that when you get it right, it all comes together and you effortlessly get your rig over that difficult obstacle, you will find yourself cheering.

												Off-Road Drive is a must have for the 4x4 rock crawling enthusiast. This is a hidden gem.  The graphics and physics are very good, the immersion is superb, you really feel like you're bobbling around in a 4x4 on horrible terrain.  It has a good cockpit driving view and excellent free camera as well as all the usual other views.  The systems modeling is extensive and you get 20 vehicles and a lot of maps from around the world.  The game seems to come with an editor in there somewhere, and can be further modded with the Unreal3 SDK tools which you can download for free.  This is one of the real bargains on Steam.  If you like off road driving, buy it!  This is a great game and highly recommended!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
