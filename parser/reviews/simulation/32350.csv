												It's not the best Star Wars title out there, but it is one that hits me at heart. I use to play this on the PS2 when I was younger, and it was the FIRST PS2 game I ever owned. Nostalgia hit me hard when I saw Steam had this and had no choice but to by and play. I don't regret it. It's a game I have had a lot of fin playing, and the only thing that could make it better is if Jedi Starfighter became available.Basic concept of the game you play in three different ships running through various missions during the timeline of just before and during Episode I: The Pahntom Menace. You can win fairly easily, combat is okay but ONLY if you have a controller or joystick. It's difficult to manuever your hand as the game asks you to, since rolling left and right to keep yourself straight is the E and Q keys. Either have something on standby, or change the config before you tear your hair out trying to play the game.I'd rank the game on a personal level of a 6 or 7. It's fun if you don't mind spending the money, just don't expect endless hours of replay value, maybe just a small handful. Still a decent game in my opinion for fans of flight simulators and or Star Wars.			",10,1,0,4,1,0,4

READ ME: How to rebind the buttons!Everyone that say you can't rebind the buttons in this game are wrong, but you can't rebind the buttons in-game, instead you have to do it in the ""pre-loader""-thingy.When you click on the icon to start the game it brings up a Small selection screen, DO NOT PRESS ""START GAME"" YET!Instead choose:Options --> Configuration Options --> (wait) --> Select tab: KeyboardNow you just have to click in the desired field and then press the button you want, you can clear the field with Alt+Del.Pro tip:#1: Abandon all thoughts on using the mouse! (you can do it but it's crap).#2: Don't rebind all buttons to around WASD, (flying a Naboo N-1 Starfighter is a job for 2 hands!).#3: Don't use: WASD, instead use: ESDF it allows for more ""secondary buttons"" around your fingers.#4: If you have a numpad I suggest you use that for the other hand.#5: While you are in the options menu you can also change the resolution to fit your screen.

												People did not like The Phantom Menace much, so this game was already at a disadvantage as it came out.Combine that with clunky controls that are hard to set up to work halfway intuitively. My play sessions consisted of a single mission, maybe two, at a time and every time I started up the game I rebound the keys ever so slightly to make them slightly better for me.By the time the final mission rolled around I was finally pleased with how it felt, and the game was entirely enjoyable.The plot isn't anything special, but it's sufficiently seeped in Star Wars lore that it was entertaining for me. It features a cast of three new characters experiencing the invasion of Naboo and getting caught up in the conflict. Missions are split up about 50/50 between planetary battles and space battles, but you are always in one of the three titular Starfighters. Each character has his/her own ship, which controls slightly differently and has different secondary weapons and looks.It's not the huge budget movie tie-in you might be used to, but those also tend to be very bad.If you're patient enough to jump in and out to tweak the controls to work for you and have some fondness for Star Wars that at least somewhat extends to the prequel trilogy this might be a fun title to pick up.

												Are you looking for an arcade-y space combat game? Then yes, play this. In a world where space combat sims grew on trees, I might say this game was too mediocre to recommend, but in a world where this genre has been in hibernation for a decade, and Rogue Squadron doesn't work on any computer newer than Windows 98, it's hard to pass this one up.You get to fly three different ships. One is a bomber, in which you'll do a lot of airstrikes and ground based targets. One is a dogfighting specialist, with totally awesome and totally OP homings lasers. The last is the N-1 as seen in Episode 1, a powerful all around fighter. Mechanically, the game is solid, with one exception: the ridiculous camera shake whenever you get hit by anything. Which makes it almost impossible to react meaningfully if you're ever under attack, so you usually take several more hits as a consequence. The game's biggest issues come from level design, though. Some missions are straightforward and fun. However sometimes the difficulty ramps up for what usually feels like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reasons, in most cases an over-abundance of tanks or turrets that are way too accurate, do way too much damage, and make your camera shake like a maraca. And then there are friendlies you have to escort that have no interest in their own survival. There's one mission towards the end that starts out positively frantic, then you spend the rest of the mission boredly waiting for NPCs slowly move down a path. Basically, the mission design is totally inconsistent in terms of fun and the difficulty curve is whack, which is a shame because you end up spending more time retrying the frustrating bits than you do enjoying the fun parts.The story is shoddy, but serviceable. It's not well developed, and the dialog is lacking, but you can tell what they were going for, and it doesn't get in the way. Some parts rely on the movie to fill in what would be huge gaps. And yes, the plot is focused largely on the invasion of Naboo, so if you can't handle the stink of Episode 1, then don't bother, but that really shouldn't be the reason to avoid this game.There are also some unlockable bonus missions, and mission medals to earn if you want more from the game. It's just the right amount of extras, IMO.The graphics show their age, but there's nothing to complain about.Like most games in this genre, you really want a joystick, but a console controller will do. Mouse and keyboard will NOT. Note: You can't rebind keys or change other options from in the game, but you can do it from the Windows game launcher that opens before the actual game starts up. Which is kind of annoying.This review probably sounds pretty negative, but overall the game is fun. There's just not much to say about it aside from the complaints. You fly a spaceship and blow up other spaceships, what more do you want?			",99,34,1,22,19,2,22

												I've been wanting to play this again for quite some time and found it on Steam for dirt cheap.  All in all, gameplay runs good, XBOX controller works great, flying is a breeze, just as I remember from back in the day.  Some people might call the graphics a bit dated, so what? They hold up quite well and Its still one of the best space flght battlers ever IMO.  There is one major problem though, a lot of people are getting this annoying as hell screen flickering during the opening logos as well as during the cinematic cutscenes.  The rest of the game is good, no flickering during actual gameplay or minor cutscenes.  I'm on Windows 10 Home 64bit and I've tried everything to to take out the flickering.  I've done Compatibilty Mode for every system, I've looked to the forums but got more questions than answers, searched for patches, there are none.  I can still play the game just fine, and maybe I'm nitpicking a bit, but it would be great if someone could figure this mess out.  Still 8\10 from me.			",102,7,1,7,4,1,1

												I hate not reccomending this, as I used to love this game more than I did Starfox back in the day.There is nothing wrong with the game...it's still the same awesome console game...but this is a very lazy port from a console to PC. the lack of being able to change controls, and whatever the heck is wrong with the intro and cutscenes is what makes the game a letdown.I couldn't fix whatever causes my PC to shudder during cutscenes and I'm guessing its because the game is old...though I can load other older games just fine. I'll just blame that on George Lucas I guess. There's also a few fixes that may/may not work on inverting the axis and changing controls. Look to the forums for those fixes and best of luck.I got the game in a bundle so I can't gripe too much. I can't play it, but it wasn't why I bought the bundle, so nothing lost, nothing gained. However I can't reccomend this to people planning to pay for it and play it, because they probably won't get the experience they were hoping for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished playing this game for an upcoming Let's Play on my YouTube Channel. I selected it largely because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and it is a game that is really ment to play with a controller and I had recently purchased one.Star Wars Starfighter is a simple arcade flight shooter game. Most of the levels are as simple as fly here and shoot the enemies, with bonus objectives of various difficulties. Pros:-Star Wars-N-1 Starfighter-Nym-A decent storyline about a royal naboo pilot, teaming up with a scavenger and a mercenary. Also the invasion of Naboo.Cons:-Some objectives not clear-Steep difficulty curve on the final levelOther thoughts:-Graphics are dated and should be expected-You have to remap the controls for a Xbox 360 controller. Some of the controls you end up with are still odd. ",399,65,10,40,31,3,60

												If you are a Star Wars fan and enjoy arcade-style shooters, you'll probably really like this game. Players looking for a more challenging or in-depth simulation, though, might be better off looking elsewhere.Although improvements to the game’s length would have been welcome, changes to the controls are definitely not. Unfortunately, that appears to be exactly what has happened and calling it an improvement would be a significant misstatement.Starfighter looks great and has a good story, though not all its missions are engaging, and they start to feel repetitive as the game goes on. The game doesn't last that long, either.Most of the praise should be given to the music and sound effects; basically, a blast festival of famous Star Wars weapons accompanied by the magnificent music score of John Williams.An unpolished, but solid, port of a good console game.

												Starfighter has a long history behind it, and a lot to stand up against with the X-Wing series and the first Rouge Squadron both having been released prior.  The history of Star Wars flight sims is one of beauty and challenge . The X-Wing series is hailed by many as they best Star Wars flight sims ever produced. Perhaps a little complex for some players to grasp, the X-Wing series gave the player a level of control over their ship that hasn’t been seen since. But I’m not reviewing that game, I’m reviewing Starfighter.As mentioned in the Wikipedia blurb, the story follows three different pilots, from three different backgrounds, that end up working together. You’ve got the new recruit in the Naboo forces, a mercenary, and a pirate captain.  The story doesn’t have the cohesive flow one hopes to find in most video games.  Instead it has that quick mashed and thrown together vibe.  It, mostly makes sense, and so long as you don’t question much, you can follow it easy enough.  But I personally, kept asking why, and didn’t get many answers back.You fly three different ships, however you don’t get to pick which ships. Each level is assigned a different ship, and while this makes sense on the early levels.  The later ones where all the characters are fighting together, an added feature of pick-your-ship levels would have been nice, and even added a little replay-ability. Replay factory is something this game does give you.  As it tracks if you’ve beaten each mission on each skill level, as well as each mission has bonus objectives to accomplish. So right out the gate you can play every mission three times with a little personal goal of 100% completion. There are also unlockable missions, both single and multiplayer. These add a little more playtime, but not a whole lot of fun. As I noted before, the multiplayer is pretty lacking.Graphically Starfighter isn’t bad, it’s what I call PS2 graphics.  Which makes sense since that is what the game was built for.  But PS2 is also a good marking point on the graphic timeline.  If there is one constant from Lucas Arts, it’s that their games always seem to be at the top of the line for graphics.The controls were a little poor.  But I have to admit that this was probably due to the Logitech software more so than the game.  Some of the buttons weren’t mapped how one would have expected them to be, while others not used at all.  This can be fixed in either the Logitech software or in the games settings.  But since you have to exit the game to adjust the controls I never bothered, and just learned to work with it.  Maybe it’s just me, but when I play a combat flight sim, I expect to have to lead my targets.  If we’re both moving I shouldn’t be able to just put the cross hairs over the target and hit it.  I should have to send the shots ahead of them, so they fly into them.  Is this not accurate?  Because Starfighter doesn’t do that, here you just put your cross hairs over and fire.One of the big problems about the game, and more so writing about it, is that it doesn’t leave anything with you. You play it, you beat some levels, and that’s it. There really isn’t anything that you take away, no real moment that you reflect on later. It’s almost just a sort of time filler for everything else you do. Its not a bad game, its not a great game, its just a game. Stuck in this sort of grey zone of quality. I cant say I hated it, nor can I say I loved it, and I’m pretty sure in a few days I’ll have forgotten I even played it. I guess that’s what leaves the biggest mark on this game, when its not there right in front of your eyes you forget it even exists.One thing of note, if you want to check this game out, and you opt to go with the PC version.  Get it on Steam.  I’ve read some various things around the web that say the original released version is pretty much borked on Windows now.  But that the games engine was fixed for it’s Steam release.  However I would personally recommend PS2 for this.  Unless you have an epic joystick, in which case that might improve controls improving the whole experience.I didn’t play any of the multiplayer, for a few different reasons.  One being that unless the game is only multiplayer, I don’t use that as a measuring factor of it’s quality.  I’m anti social remember, I prefer to play solo.  The other being that I didn’t have anyone or the means for multiplayer.  I’m assuming it’s not network/internet capable with the multi, and that it’s just a split screen venture.

												NOTE:  Your gameplay experience will be INFINITELY better if you use a flightstick (remember people who still use those things?) or a gamepad, especially a PS2-style gamepad.  You will want to have your controls properly configured - take the time to do this or else you'll find yourself fighting with the controls instead of using them.  You are a PC gamer, keyboard and mouse is great, but this game was based off a console game, and this game is not the only console-style game out there, please take the money to get a gamepad.  It'll make your overall PC gaming experience even better.I played the X-Wing Collector's CD-ROM on my Mac Performa 637CD over a decade and a half ago and I had a blast.  I also enjoyed the immensely popular X-Wing vs TIE Fighter when it came out later and really enjoyed the space assault missions in Star Wars Battlefront 2.  I saw this on sale during the ""May the 4th be with you"" sale for $1.69, and I have to say, for less than the cost of a drink, it's a really good deal.  Once you get your controls in order, the game feels really good.It's an arcade space flight sim, much along the vein of Rogue Squadron 64, so you don't have to worry about things like managing your front and aft deflector shields or figuring out how much power you want to get into your engines, etc.  If you've played the space assault mode in SWBF2, this game plays exactly like that.  I suggest mapping your your boost/brake not to your triggers, but to your right analog up/down - it makes flying around much easier to deal with.The missions are extremely fast paced and most of them are pretty short.  This game is great for quick ""get in, get out"" play sessions.  Unlike X-Wing, where a lot of time is spent on the buildup towards the missions, this game gets you right into the thick of the action.The story is so-so, three random people end up teaming up together by chance to take on the evil Trade Federation.  You've heard it before and like any game, it adds to the universe that these games have built up.  Granted, if you've heard the news, Disney-LucasArts have officially said that none of the games or books are canon, but I'd say considering the amount of milking they've done of the franchise, they're still good enough to stand as their own stories.Word of warning, although the game runs fine on modern systems, the highest the game will run at (without registry edits) is at 1280 x 1024, and most of the textures are upscaled so they'll sometimes look blotchy.  However, it's a 12 year old game, so that's to be expected.  I've been told that the Steam version of this game was ""GOG'ized"" to make it run on modern hardware and to detect modern gamepads, so that's definitely a plus.  For $5, it's a bit too much, but if you can get this during a Steam sale, definitely get it.			",750,185,17,97,70,3,103

												Best game ever. I always wanted to play space games with real flying sensations, 3D combats in space, with beautiful graphics and full immersions, fast and reliable, the real Star Wars adventure ! This game is totally what I've been dreaming to play all my life and is the reason why I wanted to play video games.You can fly in space, shoot ennemy spaceships, fly around the big cruiser ships, bomb them, exactly like in the movie Star Wars. You can do loopings, shoot robots in some canyons, fly about some factories on the land, there are tons of different landscapes, planets, vessels, space areas, asteroid fields,...It is real 3D, I mean not like in usual games, which are 3D but in fact you move in a plan, so you play 2D (like all the FPS Call of Duty, etc, etc..). This one is real 3D, you have to move in all directions (3D directions !), you fly in real space. People are not used to that. So it takes time ; took me about a week to just know how to fly and start aiming my targets and all.It goes beyond sensation and imagination, I've been playing for a long time and was not very aware of the games released recently, but I must say that this one -released in 2002 only- has it all and is incredible. I can't think that there is possibly better games than that one nowadays and I wonder how it is not more famous or how I didn't get to know it at that time (back in 2002). This game is so cool that you can't possibly want to play another game after it.Well, so I grade this game 22/20. And I triple it. And put exponent 4 and square it.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a blast from the past! I used to own this game on PS2 and I never knew it was on steam till about a week ago. The controls are very easy to use. My mouse is a crap cheap one so I have a lot of problems keeping my mouse steady (The laser is messed up!)I read someone elses review before buying this game and he said 'Will there be a jedi starfighter on steam?' The matter of the fact is no the game was only released on PS2 and the orilgial Xbox. Sadly that is a no. But however there could be a verison coming 2015? (Episode 7???)Since it was the may 4th star wars day sale I fought why not! (£1.01) Every penny was worth it (inc the £0.01!)Check out my youtube channel www.youtube.com/DarthVaderFan92 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I LOVE Star Wars.And I LOVE this game.But not for the gameplay but because it existed and was given to me and a special time in my life.Is this a good game? Not really. It was awesome back on PS2 but this is a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor port that can't even show the companies who made it before the game starts without glitching. (Yeah, seriously that's a thing)But it's cheap and SW so whatever.			",57,4,0,4,0,0,0

												Star Wars: Starfighter is an older SW game that revolves around three separate stories; a rookie hotshot Naboo starfighter pilot, a scavenger, and a former pirate.  You play one of the three of their ships (different times for different parts of the story) and defeat the bad guys in dogfights in space or in planetary atmoshpheres.The game is a bit dated and the story is passively interesting (for SW nerds, takes place before Ep. 1).  The control scheme reflects this.  No strafing, but their is a roll option, as well as braking and boosting (which I believe is unlimited, but you lose more control of your craft).  Your lasers hit instantaneously, so targeting ahead of your enemy isn't necessary.I'd reccommend it only if you like SW games and like older flight sim feels.  There is a small learning curve with the control scheme, but I reccommend making two changes in the options screens: 1) change zoom in to R, roll left to Q, and roll right to E (default is zoom Q, roll right R, roll left E), and 2) bring up the mouse sensitivity (really bring it up, unless you are fine using the arrow keys to steer up, down, left, right).  It makes it a bit closer to Star Conflict control scheme.Probably most importantly, get it on sale.  I wouldn't pay more than 6 bucks for it.  Not that it isn't worth it, but the control scheme, dated flight sim, and niche SW flight sim appeal makes it a game only good for a few people.  If you don't like the first 3 missions, you won't like the rest of the game.			",126,32,3,20,12,0,24

												Star Wars Starfighter marked the end of the Rogue Squadron-esque arcade shooters released on PC. The story was decent, the voice acting was nice, the shooting mechanics were excellent and the graphics and sound were beautiful. The game plays much better with a mouse than Rogue Squadron ever did...but despite my love for the other games in the series, I found this one difficult to stick with compared with its predecessors, and never finished the game. I think this is because the earlier titles placed an emphasis on vehicle choice. Particularly compared with Battle for Naboo, where swapping vehicles on the fly was commonplace, locking missions into three ships felt like a step backwards for me.It's certainly worth playing - arcade flight shooters are rare on pc, and this is still a gem....but it could have been so much more. The definitive version of the game itself is also debatable: multiplayer was made a PS2 exclusive at the time, though the PC offers more control options. If you're willing to play on an old console system, I would strongly recommend Rogue Leader or Rebel Strike (which includes a cooperative multiplayer-only re-balanced version of Rogue Leader) on Gamecube over Starfighter. Regardless: I would recommend Rogue Squadron 3D here on GoG or picking up a copy of Battle for Naboo off of ebay over this title.			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												For those of you expecting a new x wing/tie fighter you will be disapointed. However this is still a fun if not short arcade space fighter simulator. The graphics are surprisingly decent enough for the time (Being a console port) and the story has some interesting characters, The fact it's a console port doesn't really do much to damage it other then there being no cursor for the menus and can work perfectly fine with a mouse and keyboard.However the game is short and I mean really short, I completed it in 3 hours for all the story mission and the bonus objectives in less of an hour. The game might not be right for some but I would still sugest you check it out if your looking for a short fun arcade space simulator.			",71,6,0,17,11,0,25

												This game is good, the controls are awfull on the PC but if you have a ps2 controller and adapter you can plug it in and it will automatically by configured to a very good set of peripherals. The biggest downfall would be once you into anything you career off into any number of different direction which may be very annoying for say the first mission. But (possible spoiler?) the skill you learn when flying in the first mission is very useful in the end. Also, this games errors have been slightly patched in the sequal although only available in physical copies under the title 'Star wars Jedi Starfighter'.

The difficulty, however, can be relentless. I had to resort to cheats in a few levels because it was so freaking hard.

												There are some games which make you play over and over after years and years. This one is one of them. No matter how old it become, it's still fun to play and it's way too realistic compared to other games, even the ones published in last several years. You will have skills of a pilot, eyes of a blind and nerves of a psycho after you finish this game in hard mode. Trying to finish this game is like solving an impossible puzzle because understanding the missions is hard because of missing informations. The story is quite short but there are some bonus missions. After you get used to play this game you won't be able to play another game.			",152,14,1,18,8,2,14

Create a second save, and it will already have all the unlocks and medals from your first save.None of those should deter you from enjoying the game, just be aware.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely underrated gem of a Star Wars game. The voice acting especially is flawless. The controls do take a bit of setting up and getting used to but after a small amount of time and configuration you'll be aces. My only gripes is that the AI becomes predictable after several plays and once you have it figured out it loses much of it's difficulty. But good luck getting all Golds on Hard because you will need it.PS. When you open the game menu don't hit Start Game, go to Options and then Configuration Options for controls. So ignore every part of any review that says 'controls can't be changed.'			",81,13,0,5,6,1,34

												A half-donky port of a half-donky game. Yeah, that sounds mean, and probably is to the origional game (though not the Steam port).Graphics were fairly good back when this was new, and are adequate (if dated) now. Art design doesn't stand out, but there's also nothing terrible, so on the whole a plus. The music is excellent, with various well done rearrangements (if not outright remixes) of John Williams also excellent work (eg: the bells in the Duel of the Fates variant in the final mission). Other sounds are generic, but recognizably Star Wars. Voices give reasonablish commentary initially, but if you pay attention, the throaway chatter quickly becomes repetitive and has little to do with the current situation.Controls are good if and only if you have a gamepad. Keyboard and mouse are awkard. A joystick is less awkward, but correctly assigning axes is, uh, interesting. (Google for the roll issues with throttle for details) Get around that, and you still run into a sensitivity that's really aimed at thumbsticks. And of course, there's the fact that you can't remap controls in the game, so if you want to test out setups, you need to edit them in the launcher and then restart the game. The cutscenes in the intro are skippable, but you have to hit a button several times to reach the main menu because :effort:. Which leads into just how awkard navigating the menus is. The 'hints' are too generic to properly list the actual keys for things, and options that ""should"" allow y/n as well as enter/esc do not.Actual gameplay has a (subjectively?) good core, even if some missions squander it. Arcade style shooting is quite fun, though there are times when the restricted environment size gets in the way. The limited targeting options made me wish for the more versatile system in the X-Wing/TIE Fighter games, but are usually adequate. The nature of enemy spawning seems to work well enough in space, though wanders towards annoying when near planets. Occasionally wingmen options or the variety of enemies give you some tactical options, but it's mainly about getting from point A to B fast and hitting hard. You get your choice of difficulty, which seems to mainly make your craft more fragile and not give any additional reward. Keep that in mind if you want to go for something like 100% completion.Back to the missions, you get a moderate seeming amount, but the wall clock time spent is remarkably low. The entire game can be beaten in <5 hours without any attempt at speedrunning! Somewhat more content is available if you poke around with the bonus missions and especially if you replay campaign missions in an attempt to unlock everything, but there's still the risk of getting close enough to 100% completion in less time than it takes to watch both trilogies. Or just one if all that replaying feels grindy. Which it probably will, given the pseudo-cuscene that runs when you attempt to abort a mission, and the repetitive dialog.The plot is unspectacular, with seemingly nonsensical character arcs and overconfident stupid evil villians. The development of the heroes might have worked better in a longer game with more in or between mission development, but again :effort:. Obviously it's an excuse for the shooting, but the attempts at development and gravitas (especially at the end) feel off.Only worth getting if very cheap to free (say, as part of a bundle with several games you actually want), and most likely only worth playing if you have a gamepad are are okay with it lasting about as long as a rental.

												Si eres fan de star wars el juego no deberia hacer falta en tu coleccion.Nos presenta un modo de juego en primera persona, donde solo tienes un puntero, el indicador de escudo y el radar. La trama es sencilla, dispara a todo aquel que tenga la bandera enemiga.Me gustaria decir que es parecido a los grandes juegos Rogue Squadron pero el trabajo que nos presenta Lucas Arts como desarrolladora es muy inferior al que nos trajo una vez Factor 5 para las consolas de nintento (nin 64 y game cube).Cabe destacar que se olvidaron de muchos aspectos del apartado grafico aun para la fecha que salio, se olvidaron de agregarle a la nave una cabina almenos para observas los controles de vuelo.Los controles son faciles, solo juegas con el mouse, w-s para acelerar o frenar asi como la e y la r para virar a la izquierda o derecha.La dificultad, pues venga no es que sea dificil, practicamente los bots de campaña solo tienen 1 objetivo, y tienen una punteria de la ostia 100/100 pero nada que no se pueda superar acelerando c:Si comprastes el paquete de star wars el juego va incluido, pero adquirilo aparte solo para jugar unas cuantas misiones sin valor alguno mas haya de lo que encuentras en wikipedia y las historietas de star wars...Solo si eres fan o si venia en el pack xD			",425,72,2,48,36,1,47

												Fun for about 15 minutes. Control is pretty bad - curves on controls are obviously set up for limited range of analog sticks on a controller - feels bad on a proper joystick. There is no throttle - only fly slow, normal, or fast. Graphics are decent (for when it was released). Two missions are extremely frustrating, but the game's not worth putting the time in to get good at it. At least it's short. Why can't I fly above a canyon? I'm in a space ship. Go play any X-Wing game - they are all far superior to this simple arcade shooter.			",144,32,14,8,18,1,25

												tl;dr - it's fun to play in short bursts but don't expect too much. Also, worst final mission of all Star Wars Games. No recommendation because there are many (Star Wars-) games that are better than thisI'm not sure what most of the other negative reviews are on about because to me the controls were the best part of the game. Flying and shooting using the mouse feels good, if you can adapt to the vertical axis being inverted. It might feel weird at first, but you will get used to it after a while. However, my main problems with this game is how unfair it feels the further you progress in the game. Most enemies are cannon fodder and die very quickly to your laser guns. But whenever you have to fly a ground mission, which is almost 2/3rd of the game, you *will* encounter droid tanks. And for some inexplicable reason, those tanks are perfect at destroying land *and* air units. The sheer amount of tanks and the amount of damage they can do to you is absolutely unbalanced, but whenever you get hit, the screen shakes and you will miss your current target. Apart from this, the final mission, which I won't spoil, is emblematic for the obfuscated mission goals the game throws at you. You never really know where you *should* go, you *can* go pretty much anywhere, but you might get ambushed by sudden enemy spawns right in front of you. When I started the game, I thought it was fun but the more I progressed, the less fun and more frustrating it became. Don't buy this at full price, it isn't worth it.			",297,50,10,33,27,1,50

TL,DR: play Rogue Squadron insteadStar Wars: Starfighter doesn’t hold up well, and is plagued by bad controls. The story is promising at first, but goes by too fast to leave any impact. You get to play as three different pilots who each hate the Trade Federation and decide to help Naboo. The pilots are cool, but, despite their enjoyable banter, and meaningful backstories, the game does not take enough time to develop their relationship, and makes their friendship seem unearned. In 2001 the game must have been impressive, and even now you can see how good it must have looked. This is especially evident in the final mission which has you take down the droid control ship. Unfortunately, that same mission is immensely frustrating because its exiting first part is completely nullified by its second part, where an almost unbeatable boss (who remains invincible until the final stage) gets to pound you repeatedly with high damage missiles, which are hard to dodge. It leaves a very sour taste over what is otherwise a (nowadays) flawed but enjoyable game.Finally, a strange omission for a Starfighter game is a radar, which means you often don’t know where the enemies are, or can’t find the objects to defend. There’s a limited amount of replayability and some bonus missions, though whether it’s worth going through some frustrating levels again to unlock them is something I’ll leave to you.It’s a short and disappointing ride, and makes you long for the Rogue Squadron games.5/10 ",19,4,0,5,7,0,14

IDK.pretty fun for a toy - definitely worth less than £2.looks pretty good for a game so old, but runs at super low resolutions.game has unreasonably high expectations for the challenges (4mins for the first level? christ!

												To be honest, I didn't expect a Star Wars game to be this short.But I've played shorter, and as my father always told me, ""It's never about the length. It's how well you do with what you've got.""That did't save Star Wars Starfighter, though.I'm supposing Starfighter is a spiritual successor to the beloved Rogue Squadron (a game I only casually played as a child), since a lot of the mechanics in the game seem similar. Flying ships, and performing various tasks for your side during a certain period of time in the Star Wars film cannon.I was honestly a little excited to play this. I always say it and Jedi Starfighter at GameStop when I was littler, and always thought that if I had enough money, I'd totally buy it. But when the time came, I ended up spending it on Star Wars Bounty Hunter.A wise decision, in hindsight.In Starfighter, you play through the critically appraised and widely beloved... Phantom Menace... See, this game was made two years after Episode I. The designers must've thought that the hatred for this film would wear off, and people would want to play through their ""favorite"" moments in this ""excellent"" movie.Well, enough with beating around the bush. In Starfighter, you play through 14 missions across the whole Naboo-Blockade crisis, between three characters and play in their three separate ships. And the story linking the battles is incredibly dull. Nothing of any emotional weight happens. It's merely a vehicle for you to shoot mercenaries and pirates from one venue to the next.And for a game about Starfighting, the levels you play in are so... vapid. There's only one decent mission- the canyon mission- which has you progress through very tight canyons to new valleys in order to shoot down more enemies. And it got reused. No changes. Just more enemies, and a night filter. The rest of the levels are you piddling about, waiting for whatever next objective awaits you with little else going on. And it wouldn't be anywhere near as bad, if the flying weren't so damn clunky.To be fair, I did get used to it. But why the hell did the developers think that players wanted the default set to first person? In a flying and shooting game? I had no idea what key triggered the change to third person until 3/4 through, and that was entirely by accident (it's ~, by the way), and when you DO play third person, it's a hell of a lot easier to control. And it's close to fun when you're zooming through the sky- or space- and nailing whatever shots you can through enemy fighters.And then you see another god-awful cutscene, and forget why you enjoyed this game. Seriously, the pre-rendered cutscenes look BAD. Like Just Cause 1 bad. Like it would have been better if they used the in-game graphics, bad. And the voice acting all around ranges from mediocre at best, to flat out ridiculously horrible at worst. Especially Rhys. His voice actor is trying so hard to emote with his voice, and it's so obvious I cringe everytime he speaks.While there are tons of things in Starfighter that I abominate... there are those few things I did enjoy while playing. Again, few things. But I feel like everything kind of averages out in the end, to a nice even 5/10. Unless you're an absolute die-hard Star Wars fan that wants to play every game in the Star Wars library, give this one a pass.			",184,74,0,14,4,0,2

												Okay, so I started this game with high hopes. I was hoping for something that called back to the good old days of X Wing.I was severely disappointed.When I started it up, the first thing that offended my eyes was the resolution. Blurry as hell, and despite my best efforts, I was unable to fix it.After I got to the menu, I navigated to the options, wanting to check the controls before I did anything.To my surprise, there was none to be found.'Well, maybe it's something I can change in game. Or perhaps its perfect as it is.'So I started the first mission.After a barely passable establishing cutscene, I found myself flying in a narrow canyon, with NO tutorial or indication of what did what.The first five minutes of gametime were spent repeatedly crashing into the walls and exploding while I desperately tried to figure out the control scheme.It would have been frustrating had I not been laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off.Eventually I got some semblance of control over my craft, but it did not make the flying any easier. It was nearly impossible to navigate efficiently, and although I got through half of the level (I think) I eventually gave up and closed the game after about 20 minutes of game time.For whatever reason, Steam insists I've played this game for over 25 hours, which I find doubly hilarious.Don't buy this game. Terrible PC port with bad controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, lets start off with this.. i had high hopes for this game. being a fan of rogue squadron i was looking forward to playing this.... let me tell you it is nothing similar. let's start with my first problem: Inverted aim cannot be turned off if you play with a mouse, i had to switch over to my flight stick to play. then theres the ship handling: it feels loose. and not in a good way. the ship is sturdy enough, but the confusion of the first level is exasperating. there's no clear objective. just kind of like ""here's some bad guys, oh no!!!"" then the mission starts... ok... now what? escort? defend? can i get an ETA on when your hyperdrive will be ready? how many of these guys do i take out? also the ""Auto-stabilizer"" (to allow you to reposition your ship) doesnt work in space, THE ONE PLACE I NEED TO MAKE A TRUE UP AND DOWN TO ORIENT MYSELF. wow not to mention that the training mission is in a freaking canyon, with a SPACE craft.. can i train in SPACE please? you know that place where a SPACE CRAFT should be. and even if there is atmospheric combat, why the hell are we using SPACE craft for that? All in all: 4/10 it was a whatever attempt at ripping off an already successful series. play Rogue Squadron instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whoever decided to move this game the PC made a huge mistake. The controls are optimixed for consols and fail completely to include setting of any kind that allow you to change ANYTHING. Pitch and yaw are the E and R buttons and boost is W which is offputting, movement is also inverted and terribly sensative. A great game but not for PC. Its also a classic game meaning no save ability and sporatic savepoints so if you die you'll probably have to start over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a number of the Star Wars games over the years and this is the first one that has truely disappointed me.During the 90's we had X-Wing, TIE Fighter and X-Wing vs TIE Fighter. Then there was X-Wing Alliance. All extremely fun to play and all with good interfaces which really brought Star Wars space combat to life. We also had the Wing Commander series and its Privateer spin-offs. Great games all.Perhaps I'm just spoilt, but Starfighter was a complete letdown. The graphics were disappointing even for its time and the gameplay ridiculously simplistic. It also gives the impression that you're ""boxed in"" whether you're flying in open space or across the surface of a planet.Was I expecting too much because it's a Star Wars title? Perhaps. But considering what we've been graced with previously, I would've honestly expected more from the developers.For any die-hard Star Wars fans I'd say this. It was worse than watching The Phantom Menace. For space-sim fans in general: Taking the Steltek drone on using the Tarsus in Privateer would be more fun.For everyone else: Don't waste your time. This game fails even as a bit of cheap arcade escapism.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It looks terrible and it's stuck at a ridiculously low resolution that you're unable to change as there are no useful settings. I know that's a little harsh (since it is from 2002), but I probably would have forgiven it if it wasn't so bad to play. The levels are boring and the scenery is bland, the controls are floaty and have no feel to them and the field-of-view (that you're unable to change) makes me feel sick. Easily the worst Star Wars game.			",51,4,0,4,7,0,2

												Star Wars Starfighter, although being a cutting edge product when initially released (in terms of licensed Star Wars games), it hasn't aged well. The game offers very little story and explanation for controls. The graphics have aged moderately well but with limited options there isn't much you can do to tweak the setup of this game. After you run a few of the missions you will have explored all this game has to offer. Wouldn't recommend it based on limited value.			",631,155,16,70,57,4,101

The last level is so horrendously hard because there are dang missle launchers everywheres in the last level along with a boss who wont die, you need full health till the very end, hundreds of enemies shooting you half way through the level. and then it has a time limit plus you have 10 limited missles that do a lot of damage to the boss that miss extremely easly. Oh and his missles go through your sheilds but yours dont go through his. By the way, this is only on easy.Screw this game!I rage quit life!10/10			",198,35,4,24,18,0,13

												Horrid controls. Very Arcady. Full of glitches and incredibly short. I beat the game in 3 hours. The Final mission was the worst you spend upwards of 5 minutes traversing inside a trade federation ship flying after a mercenary ship that takes 100000 blaster bolts to kill and is only killed after a certain amount of time passes his death triggered by the event of Anakin skywalker blowing up the vessel from the inside. Then I thought I escaped the Federation ship to discover I had entered another dimension technically still inside the ship. I was half way back to naboo when I realized the mission wasnt going to end and only half of the trade federation construction was behind me with its interior showing. Due to glitches missions like the final mission took multiple tries. Most missions were destroying droid star fighters and tanks before they could do harm to something that was on your side like allied transports and turrets and overall most of the missions were just an utter bore.

												Extreme dissapointment. I remember playing this game on the PS2, man those were some good times.I noticed that it was on sale for $4.99, sweet deal right? I get to relive some nostalgia and play a game that I know aged well.However, the thing that sold me was ""Partial controller support"" That makes sense, there were analog controls on the PS2/Xbox, of course it would support a controller.And it does! Kind of... not really. When you boot the game up you'll find yourself staring at a little configuration screen, like a launcher of sorts. However in this launcher there is an area to configure your gamepads controlls, or in my case a ""Windows controller"" One of the Xbox 360 controllers that has windows drivers built in.The configuration screen isn't very complicated except that the controlls are written in numbers with very little description and no control-map.I messed around with it a little bit, but in the end the left thumb stick does all of the flying.. Up down left and right, while the right joystick handles camera movement, but only X axis, not Y. This makes flying nearly impossible.I attempted to use the keyboard controlls but man were they horrible, the fire key and the boost key are default the same.All in all I give it a big fat 0/10.

												I hate to say it about a Star Wars game, but this is quite possibly the WORST Flight Combat Sim I have ever played in my life.  With no way to invert the mouse, this game was compleatly unplayable.  Not to mention that the training missions is a compleate waste of time since it doesn't even tell you what key to hit to do the things the insturctor is telling you to do.  They just tell you to do it as if the key bindings have some how been downloaded to your brain.  It feels as if this game was pushed out with no beta testing, or was rushed out the door for some reason.  There really should have been a patch or two for this game to fix these major problems.  I couldn't even play past the training mission because of the poor control.			",98,20,2,31,34,2,37

												A flawed space craft shooterStar Wars: Starfighter is a 3D flight simulation game developed by Lucas Arts. Story is forgettable. Set before and during episode 1, you play as Rhys Dallows a new pilot for the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps (NRSFC). After negotiations with the trade federation don't go to plan (no surprise here), you are forced to ally with a mecenary as well as a pirate to take on the seperatist threat. You also play as the mercanary and pilot. The plot is generic and predictable with no plot twists.Gameplay is a mixed bag. Each level in the campaign, you start off playing as one of the three playable characters set in different areas in the star wars universe. You have primary and secondary objectives which include protecting allies and eliminating units and buildings. Failing a primary objective will end the game immediately and you are forced to restart. Secondary objectives aren't as crucial, as failing them doesn't end the game for you. However, accomplishing a certain number of secondary objectives through your playthrough will help you unlock new levels in the 'Bonus' section. You play with three different types of ships including a fighter and bomber. Each ship has different primary and secondary weapons to use. One issue I had was that you couldn't select which aircraft to use (as aircrafts are locked to the character you're playing as), which was a problem as some crafts were good while others were a pain to use (due to weak weapons and handling). Another issue was level design. Some levels were fun to play in while others (especially the last level) feel more like a chore.  Finally, the lack of checkpoints in the game meant that when you fail an objective late in a level you must restart from the beginning of the level again.Graphics are dated. The space ships look alright. However, in most levels the terrain lack detail and features. The cutscenes haven't aged well either.Controls aren't good. If you are using mouse and keyboard (which most will) then you are in trouble. Your aircraft movement is clunky and difficult to turn with. Even after adjusting mouse sensitivity, I found it too difficult to use and was forced to stick with keyboard (which also wasn't good but at least I could fly with it). As such I found it difficult to move my space craft around to hunt down fighters, which hindered my enjoyment of the game. If you have a joystick, I highly recommend you use it.As you can expect fom a star wars game, audio is great. Weapons sounds authentic, like from the movies. The soundtrack is has some familiar tunes from the films as well. Voice acting is a mixed bag unfortunately, with some characters being average while others (especially the protagonist) are lackluster.If you are a dedicated star wars fan or interested in an average space shooter, this game might apease you. Else, find something better. ",420,113,10,57,34,2,84

												Do not buy unless you are installing it on a dedicated Windows XP machine - it will destroy the OS of anything later than Vista by forcibly overwriting core drivers.

												when I first hopped into the game i was faced with inverted controls and high sensitivity making the ships really hard to control.  Upon first controlling the ship I immediatly went into the pause screen to try and fix it and there were no option buttons.  After finding no option buttons on the pause screeen I remembered there was an options button on the starting screen so I went back there and went into there to find nothing to fix the issue.

												I currently can't recommend this. Not only is it a bit glitchy, leading to trouble with the functionality, but it also seems virtually impossible to play with just a keyboard and mouse. It might be at least genuinely playable with a joystick, but as I don't have one, I can't really comment on that. All I know is, if there's no mention of a joystick being required, then I generally expect a computer game to at least be truly playable with the basic keyboard and mouse set-up, even if it might play even better with a different set-up.

												First glance this game doesnt seem to bad, even with dated graphics.  This game starts to show its age the more you play revealing its ugly underbelly the more its played.  There are missions where team mates you need to protect charge off into firing zones and just die.  This happens where your protecting ships and boats, they will hazardly just drive as fast as they can to their doom making it difficult to manage all the enemies.  On other levels the objectives can be unclear, such as destroy a landing pad, great what is that and where is it?  Giving your team commands such as cover me or to protect something seem to have little to no affect on what your fellow squad mates decide to target.  The end of the game is just spam, the enemy spams units, so many with such terrible AI they just crash into you alot.  Worse is when hit your ship shakes making it impossible to target whats hitting you, worse is there is no directional damage telling you what direction to move away from.  The game may be dated meaning that odd squares or other things that look like their just well a square fire and kill you, other parts the graphics are fine which is odd.  Trying to like this game just ends with resentment for even wasting time on it.Rating:  1/10  Value:  $0.99			",2655,1121,101,267,367,29,398

												Starfighter is essentially Rogue Squadron set during Episode 1, with a few less enjoyable aspects. The targeting system can be useful at times, or just plain annoying. It's hard to tell what's your enemy and what's not if you choose to ignore the targeting. It's really a mixed bag when it comes to that. The targeting computer from the Rogue Squadron series is a bit more enjoyable. Otherwise, it's pure mindless arcade style Star Wars shooting action. Almost every Star Wars fan should drop 5 bucks on this game. The fact that it's set during Episode 1 doesn't really hurt the game, unless you just enjoy shooting Tie fighters due to pure nostalgia. There is no Jar Jar, no midichlorians, and no young annoying Anakin. Even when you go after the Droid Control Ship and Anakin blows it up, you don't hear his annoying voice once. Speaking of annoying voices, this chick who's flying with you is always screaming annoying stuff, not unlike the Rebel Marksman from Battlefront 2. The main issues with this game revolve around annoyance, and not actual gameplay issues. Bonus props for adding bonus content and a password system.As a hardcore Star Wars fan, I give it a 7/10, but if you're not a Star Wars fan, the game probably falls more in the 5-6/10 range.

This game provides a different view of the Naboo invasion than what's shown in the movies, which makes the story somewhat interesting.   Normally I don't like flight simulations, but I enjoyed this game... when I wasn't being blown up by missiles or tanks. In the missions where you face swarms of enemy fighters (the last mission in particular) you become immersed in the dog-fighting. Also, the graphics aren't horrible either.  The controls do take a little getting used too, particularly turning/rolling (which uses E and R while A and D switch targets). Once you get the hang of things the game is fun.... until it suddenly ends. The game is short (took me <5 hours on medium) but it's an enjoyable ride nonetheless.  One other negative aspect is the final boss who is a pain with his missiles which go through your shields and his health restarts after each of the first 2 sections of the boss fight. Also, there is a lack of direction of where to go for the fight. I lost the boss in the middle of it and was flying around in a hangar area for a few minutes before seeing a passageway to go through. The boss is tough, even on easy. This boss just seems out of place with the difficulty of the rest of the game.  Overall, this game is good for a few hours of fun and definitely worth the money if you see it on sale. Also, the game is good for making you dizzy and to lose your sense of up and down. All this is achieved by spaceships that seem to be able to halt and turn in an instant with no regard to speed and inertia.			",93,14,0,10,11,0,27

												Glad I have a joystick. It's weird that the throttle, on my joystick, when pushed down, makes the fighter spin, and when i split it, and have on throttle on max and the other halfway, its stabalized. Fun game though			",171,19,3,12,8,2,14
