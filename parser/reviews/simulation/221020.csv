  TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE   The game is broken and unfinished. The game is abandoned by the developers.  They're censoring constructive negative criticism. They essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran. They're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.The GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered ""Finished"" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.MarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.  Eventually articles surfaced stating that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed  ""In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game.""  and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: Towns is very much alive and kicking.	 Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: So so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success. Dictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/or townsgame.com forum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for ""Boycotting"" ""Harassment"" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.ConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were ""burnt out"" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.RefundValve added a refund addition to Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that could potentially allow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.Originally posted by Valve on http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?l=english:You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.FeedbackDon't hesitate responding with any constructive criticism that I could use to improve my reviews. Also note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This highlights the worst part of Steam Greenlight.  The developer posted a ton of ideas, some good-looking screenshots, and pitched a solid concept.Before I even get to the review, I'd like to note that THE DEVELOPER HAS ABANDONED THE GAME.  He took the ""Early Access"" money, cranked out an Alpha-at-best version of the game and left.  He got another developer to theoretically try to finish the game, but the hopes of that actually happening are looking pretty dim.So as for the game itself.  You build a town to attract heroes to explore and clear dungeons.  Sounds good.  The execution is NOT.  It's a buggy mess, with villagers having AI and path-finding so bad that they often get stuck and starve.   You control which heroes arrive, can't tell them what to do, and can't even sell them items.  The crafting system is tedious and the building system feels like it's constantly fighting against you.It's a buggy, barely-playable mess with no endgame, few sounds, and almost no animations.  Avoid like the plague.EDIT: The developers responsible for taking your money and running are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi.  I've been asked a few times to mention them here so if you see any projects from them in the future, you can remember this cash-grab and avoid them.			",202,29,0,36,20,2,50

Of course, they got that way AFTER their game was sold... unfinished. Hope they enjoyed the 2 PLUS Million Dollars they made. I will never again buy from ANYONE who was involved in the making of this ""game"" . Rip-off artists, and scammers. They KNOWINGLY sold this game unfinished. This game was NOT an Early Access Game, but ""realeased as done."" They should refund the cash paid for the game, and remove it from Steam. Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

												This game has been abandoned by the devs over and over again. During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as ""boycott thread"" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums. I have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!Here is why I was supposedly banned...You have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Towns General Discussions"": YetiChow Moderator 3 hours ago Deleted thread ""Don't buy this game"". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.YetiChow ModeratorI was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.Apparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.UPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!After a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:YetiChow ModeratorFor the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the ""second dev"" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.  http://i.imgur.com/Auuyizz.jpgSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND ANYTHING ELSE SMP DEVELOPS!!  They obviously have extremely poor judgement putting a guy like this in charge of their steam forums. ",473,64,23,57,97,17,113

												Original Dev took the $2mil Alpha sales and scarpered. Sold it to a second dev who said, after abandoning it:“I hope you are not too disappointed. And if you are: I’m really sorry. I’m quite new to indie game dev and I couldn’t really see that the game sales were declining that rapidly. I guess if I had more experience I would have seen it comming …,”Abandon ware.It's a real shame - what exists is broken but playable. If they delivered what was initially promised it would be a cracking little indy game.Moral of the story? Don't buy Alpha, Beta or Early Access of anything. Ever.			",197,26,8,45,13,2,25

												So if Moderators or others push you to the demo, its not the best way to understand how the game is or how well it runs. First off, the demo does not give you the greatest feel for the game, just proves that the basic mechanics are working....I'd also like to point this out, HEAVY MODERATION in the forums, see link below. If YETI does not agree with you or finds a reason to delete ""negative"" posts, he will. If you post in the forums, YETI will justify and ""help"" you make sense of the horrible AI and how the game was built as SH***Y as it is but it was all done like this on purpose. He responds to every comment to mask the amount of players who feel the same way about the game. Discussions that become overwhelming negative he will delete because the discussion is going in ""circles"" Check his own delete blog on the link below. This type of moderation in the forums is one attempt to keep the game alive. He HEAVILY defends the game at every chance even with all of the people arguing with him. The only people who agree are Lvl 0 Steam Users with Blocked Profiles.... Enough said. http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/Now for the review:The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted. Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all. To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time. There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then. Development is next to nothing, look at the update history.			",18,6,1,9,22,0,6

												Ok, I have a lot of hours in this game so maybe you could say that I got my money's worth - or maybe I just have a penchant for watching little pixel people go about their business(dying of starvation or eating everything in sight, dry-humping monsters to death or walking straight into a village full of hostiles) .. actually, I also go afk a lot and hang out in the kitchen.. that might be why :pAnyway, I do not recommend buying the game in its current state:- very buggy- rough and unpolished(for example, last time I played the little pixel people had like 2 frames of animation when walking and looked like they were dry-humping monsters upon attacking them). - feels incomplete, as in missing game-play features.- very, very slow updates(if you can even call it an update when one or two little bugs are fixed after several months).- Dishonest developer: this is the biggest reason for me right now as to why you shouldn't waste your money on this game. Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns..

												SEE BELOW FOR AWESONE ALTERNATIVESThis games has a terrible AI. Citizens will walk right into enemy territiory to pick up a random bone. They will refuse to stop working and starve to death. They are worthless at producing food weapons or anything else. Forget the grandoise buildings you see in the screenshots, just building a hut can be a monumental task.The game is otherwise very buggy, terribly balanced and lacks a lot of features. It has been completly abandoned by the developers.I recomend instead;STONEHEARTH; A very similar game that is constantly updated, already has numerous features, great 3D graphics and most importantly a great AI. Has made incredible acess since it first realeased.GNOMORIA; A game that is also very similar to towns, with a similar graphics style and a fourth of the price or less when on sale. ALso has much better AI than townsCOLCKWORK EMPIRES; A game with simialr gameplay to towns but with a steampunk vibe. It is regularly updated and the game has made great progress since its early acess release.In other words all these games will give you very similar gameplay with better AI, and more importantly, a developement team which is on top of updating and talking about their game. Just do not buy towns!DWARF FORTRESS- Probably the orginal game with a town building survival gameplay. It is incredibly deep, and a is practically a cult classic. It is infamous for its difficulty, but you can find it for free at bay12 games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Though I usually type up more in-depth reviews, in this case, I don't think that one is really neccessary.  This game had a lot of potential and I had a blast with it a few years back when keeping in mind that it was Early Access.  However, it was very clearly unfinished.I returned recently to give it a go and I couldn't find any new additions or alterations.  The game is, sadly, abandoned.  I recommend avoiding it in favor of the many other games in the same vein.			",622,155,2,165,79,3,130

												If you want a Dwarf Fortress Clone with graphics, please play Gnomoria. This game is a very low quality and not fit for release. It is a bummer that this was one of the first game to be ever Greenlit. Contrary to the public belief, this game is not and never was Early Access, yet we got an Alpha Version of the game sold. The store page also says that it will be continuously updated, but this does not happen. We get a patch all few months, which tends to break even more things. The visuals are okay, but the menus are just downright amateurish, the tutorials useless and the game absolutely explains nothing. Hello Developers, it is 2013, wake up. You don't need to hold my hand, but if you don't explain how your game works, then there is not fun to be had. Crawling through half the internet to understand how the game works is not something you want. Gnomoria is way more intuitive and has a clear progress line, even if you never played this genre. Don't touch it with a 10 ft pole held by someone else on the other side of the street.Update May 7th, 2014:The devs have now officially abandoned the game. There will be no more updates.http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=11480 ",465,98,9,80,66,5,74

												Held off for so long on writing this.330 hours... Must be a great value right? Nope, nearly all of it was idle in the background while I waited huge amounts of time for the terrible AI to get anything done. This game is a tedious unpolished mess, filled with either insane levels of micro management or giant periods of idle time. The AI is dirt poor and starves to death doing basic tasks. Asking questions about it on the forums will get you told by the moderator how it's not a bug and is really your fault... this is only true because you bought the game.The dev also seems to think it's cool to appoint fanboy's and white knights as moderators. The Steam moderater doesn't moderate, he takes a clear side and bans people who disagree. Do not buy this game, do not support this dev. There are reasons why the reviews are mostly negative.Edit:Be clear anyone reading this that asking about this game on the forums will result in you being lied to by the few fanboys remaining, everyone else who'd give an honest answer has been banned.

												I honestly can't say I'd recommend this game at any price point.  There are quite a few other games out there that fill the same niche and many more currently in development, e.g. Banished and Stonehearth, and sadly actually have active development staff.  Yes that is currently a problem for this game.  If like me you picked up this game back when it was first greenlit only to assume that it would actually get patched and improved over time I feel your pain.  If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.  I can't say I've finished a single session with this game feeling happy about spending the time there.  You want fun, look elsewhere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Development of this game has been cancelled, and no refunds are being given. The game went through Steam Greenlight prior to Early Access existing, which is the only reason it doesn't have an EA tag on the store page.

												The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's ""Greenlight"" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.Towns was billed as a ""Dwarf Fortress""-type game, wherein you build a town atop a ""dungeon"" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The ""tutorial,"" if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.Don't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement.			",51,3,0,3,8,0,4

												I really didn't want to give this a Not Recommended, but due to how things have gone with development i just had to do it... maybe i will be able to recommend it if it can improve or gets a massive price cutDon't get me wrong, the game is very enjoyable, maybe even to a point where I could consider it good, but it is however an unfinished product. A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O However, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended) If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever...			",205,66,8,27,23,3,34

												I liked the game when I first got it. Sure it was buggy but it was in early access and the developers were making progress and updating and making it better. Then they released an unfinished product and gave up all together. I could forgive the game's mistakes when it was early access but now that it's released? No. It's not worth the $15 anymore. Maybe at one point but not now. Go play Dwarf Fortress of Gnomoria if you want to play a game like this.			",258,73,1,72,45,3,44

												This is the game that made me lose faith in Greenlight. I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.I bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.I also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.Now many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.If only I knew then what I know now.TL;DRShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game.

												This is one of the games that make ALL Early Access games suspect. The Dev's took their money and ran without a full game. Why is Steam still selling it? I don't know. There are a lot of issues in the game that will now never be fixed. Spend your money on something else and be wary of anything early access.The sad thing is, there is a lot to like about this game. If they actually had finished it this game would have been a really really good indie game. As it is, I find it embarrasing its in my game list and serves as a warning to me to be careful in the future. ",98,20,3,25,21,2,43

												Don't buy it, it's a scam...  The game is there as advertized, but it's an alpha and it's staying an alpha...  It's charging 15 dollars for a game that never gets updated.  Bugs don't get fixed even after years of development.  Features are still unfinished.  Nothing has polish to it.  This game should not cost what it does, and it should have been finished development years ago.  I wouldn't complain, but I paid 15 dollars for it, so I have a right to.

												It's difficult to recommend this game at the $15 sale price (4/23/2015), while there are so many other (more finished) games on the market.The game was created by 2 people. Steam added the game in 2012. The original creaters stopped working on the game in early 2014, and struck a deal with a single person to take over development. That person discovered there wasn't any financial incentive to continue developing the game, and let the community know that he was stopping all work.(Reference: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/07/towns-called-malice-development-of-city-builder-ends/  )I like the game's concept of town management and plowed ahead with multiple game instances. However, I had to put the game down due to functionality. Sometimes my townies would starve to death instead of stopping a task to eat. They would wonder too deep even though you're supposed to be able to set the max floor depth. etc.TLDR: I can't recommend buying it. If you're still curious, download the demo.

												My children and I play this game. We liked the look and feel of the interface. The game was interesting and fun for a bit but little things kept annoying us. Issues like folk will starve to death instead of dropping the task they are assigned and eating. I guess making that piece of armor was more important that their own survival. The town seems small compared to other games in genre. The depth is limited to about 19 or 20 levels. Some other games in genre go below 100 levels.  For over a year the developer has been releasing rare and tiny updates. The game is not polished, but playable. I gave up on game and went to other games in genre that developers are actively making their product better. I'd recommend game for a few $.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was with this game from the beginning. From the moment I heard about this game in the Royal Indie Bundle, I fell in love with it. I played tens of hours of it through Desura. I desparately wanted this game to succeed because it was like a beautiful growing flower that would blossom with so much potential. I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion. Then Steam Greenlight was launched and when this game was one of the first to be on passed through it, I was absolutely thrilled. And then, it all went south. The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.Don't get this game. It's dead and abandoned. RIP			",89,13,1,18,11,0,6

												So...where to begin. This game I remember seeing back in 2011 on YouTube and I thought it was pretty cool. Found it on Steam when I joined, bought it when it was on sale for like $5. At the time, it was still being worked on, albeit slowly, so I thought ""why the heck not."" Looking back now, this game had potential but was left to rot by the devs and since late 2014 has never received a lick of development. It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state. The A.I. has always had a mind of its own and is hard to deal with when trying to set up runners, farmers, builders, and traders at the same time. Not having even just one person assigned to just one tiny task could end up causing your settlement to crash without enemies even attacking, simply because someone wouldn't go and make flour so you can bake bread so your dedicated farmers could eat and go harvest more wheat to repeat the cycle. It's a challenge, but if you're looking for a basic time waster, this game is good for that. I can't recommend it, however, just because of the state it's been left in without further development. If it's on sale for cheap and you like a nice, casual city builder, you might look into it. But for full price, look elsewhere. This game is going nowhere and will forever be that way.

												Arguably one of the biggest pieces of trash on steam. Bought this when they first introduced the greenlight system. The dev took my 15 bucks and abandoned the game. Thankfully the game sucks so bad that nobody will likely ever need to read this review.			",107,21,3,28,4,0,7

												So what is with Towns? I would rather say it's pretty dead. This game came 2012 to steam greenlight and was a interesting project, where you create a world in which yo have to make andventurers happy and not to be the adventurer.But what did go wrong?It's pretty easy. The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.What's wrong with that?So the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game. I got very disapointed as i have heard that and my money is lost, just because someone did not manage to get their things right and just because he did not have ambitions anymore to work on this project, he stopped! I want to say one thing. I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!I do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game. He earnend about 2 MILLIONS $ with it and left the game just as it is, UNFINISHED!I would rather recommend you ""DwarfFortress"", it's free, developed by only 2 guys and can offer you much more. (PS.: Dwarf Fortress is very hard! and you probably need a texture pack!)			",119,23,2,29,41,2,70

												This game is an early alpha, and has been since release.  There are rarely updates.  Basically, this game's creators were greenlit, made a boatload of money through promising to update their game regularly and telling everyone that it is an early alpha, then walked away with their cash and never looked back.Do not purchase this game.  There are much better games out there, trust me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To my great disappointment, this ""early access alpha""- looks, sounds and plays just about the same as it did over a year ago. Sounds - None of the 4-5 sounds adds any value to the experience, what so ever.Graphics - The graphics are all placeholder at best.Gameplay - Has potential, but the AI will destroy any play beyond the first hour of play.Steam should have pulled this title a long time ago as it feels like the developer made it available only to go on a permanent vaccation right after. If you want a town-building-management experience, pick up Dwarf Fortress and make a donation to Bay12Games instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is nice, well designed and good looking. When you play it you discover how to make tools, how to make farms, and most of all you find all the bad glitches in the game. I think the best thing about the game by far is the feature that crashes the game and shuts itself down without saving. If this doesn't throw you off buying the game look at all the comments for the game which 99.99% is mad rants. If you still have the guts to play this game good luck and I hope you find a way to enjoy it.			",14,1,0,1,4,0,1

												I like this game, but I don't enjoy it as much as I should. It feels incomplete. The tutorials can be done in 5 seconds where it seems pointless to do them and the tutorials don't cover enough. Some pre made towns would be awesome. A news ticker would be great. A lot of this game is tranquil waiting. You send your townies to do something and it starts off being quick, but as the town gets bigger it can take them hours to build a set of small homes. Its a game you can watch TV and come back to while it plays.Oh and to top it off.... I've played one single game around 60 hours and NEVER EVER had any town that looks like the screenshots. NEVER EVER. I might not ever in fact. That's just how the game is. I often have the game playing in the background on another computer virtually unattended.			",1128,324,52,104,96,15,167

Product received for free
												This game was purchased for me a long time ago as a birthday present. Got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of good hours out of this game, but it was abandoned by the developers and left in a painfully unfinished state. It basically went straight from Alpha to ""Finished"". They flip-flopped on actually abandoning it for a while - they hired a new guy to work on it, which failed within weeks of happening...twice. Then they talked about releasing a Towns 2, despite this game being unfinished. The last attempt at saying ""yes, we still care about this"" was in early 2015, when a dev's house was supposedly under construction, so he had no room/time/internet to release a new patch. Finally, they stopped talking altogether. Their forums are a ghost town. This was one of the unfortunate early failures of the Greenlight system.Been a while since I've played it, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥don't buy this"" that is already out there. The game you're getting is not worth a 15 dollar price tag.			",128,67,1,42,21,2,11

												tl;dr: STAY FAR AWAY AND DO NOT BUY___________________________________________________________This game could have been good. But the Dev abandoned the project. The decided to pick it up again. Then abandoned it again (I think). Its pretty infamous for being one of the first games out of Early Access and the first promising Early access game that sold a ton of copies where the dev ""took the money and ran"". This game burned a LOT of people on Early Access, and is still burning people. I cant believe its still for sale. Its a bug ridden incomplete mess taht never got out of Early Access and is being sold as a complete game.Go play Dwarf Fortress instead. ",211,106,1,118,39,0,27

												This game is unintuitive, poorly done, very buggy, bland, and disappointing. I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.The UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.I was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.Update 8/19/2015:Just wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible. I know I wish I had that option when I bought this game.			",198,64,0,57,30,3,54

												I've come back to this game a number of times and sadly I'm unable to recommend it.While the graphics are generally ok, the font used is rather difficult to read - its simply a very poor and quite small bitmap - I've seen much better bitmapped fonts, from java even a pure opengl application its not too dificult to implement true type fonts...If only the text were the only issue, I could get past that and get on with the gameThe real issue comes when you attemt to create a building, it is almost impossible to be sure (even with their ""2.5d"" cursor) if you are building on top of a lower level blocks, and don't even start on a roof I hear its possible but a blavk art indeed.  A simple ghost block above lower blocks might help, but its just really confusing trying to work out whats going on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really loved this game when I first started playing it. Had a ton of potential and it was very fun. If you wanna see a very good lets play and funny letplay of the older game then watch the sips videos on it. That is when this game was definatly at its most fun. Then gnomoria came out and had its fully 3d block system and the devs then decided they wanted to compleatly rewrite the game to have this feature. I guess many in the comunity wanted it but in my honest opinion this was a bad move. It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest. I would have highly recommended this game a few years ago durning its alpha but it seams soon as it hit steam it was pretty much abandoned. Like the other reviewers I no longer can even recommend buying this game. Maybe if it was 3 bucks but definatly not 15 like what its being asked for.			",58,13,0,8,10,1,8

												I honestly can say I enjoyed playing this game.Up until (every single time I might add) all my villagers die.A creature (depending on the terrain) killed one of my villagers (with the guards refusing to come assist due to bad AI) and one at a time, my villagers come to pick up the remains of their deceased comrade.Why is this bad?They cross half the map to get to the remains, fight the exact same creature the previous villager did, and die.Then another person comes to do the exact same thing.Rinse and repeat until my whole village is now dead from trying to pick up a stupid bone pile.This has ruined every single playthrough I have attempted in this game.

												This game hits a couple sweet spots for me, in that you spend your time designing and issuing instructions to virtual ""villagers"" (or dwarves, employees, etc.) and then watching them go about their virtual lives.  I purchased it rather early on in its existance, and enjoyed running through a few plays of the basics that were in place.  It certainly never felt even remotely finished, and I decided to walk away from it and give the devs time to flesh it out. They never did that.  The original developers lost interest, which is a huge risk for people who are paid in advance for the promise of a product to come, and effectively decided to cut and run.  They farmed the work to a new developer who was working solely for a percentage of future sales, and the small improvements that were being made never generated those. This game is not actively being developed and is not worth a third of the asking price in its current state, which is a damned shame, becuase this genre could use more finished games, and fewer abandoned skeletal concepts.

												was a fun game, sadly dev team gave up on the game while still in very basic alpha. denied refunds and just left the game as is.  while the game is ""playable"" it suffers from alot of disabling bugs that makes it hard to enjoy it and more of a chore to play. sadly not open sourced so most likely will be a cobweb covered title in my steam listdo not buy the game as you will receive 0 support from devs only limited community. and it wont be finished ever if you read their offical forums.lots of active games out there like gnomoria and the like which are worth the money over towns.i enjoyed towns but i dont enjoy vaporware			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible game.  Development is slow to the point of almost being non-existant (6+ months between major patches).  The AI is bad, especially the player's Townies (they border on suicidal at times).  Heroes are nothing more than dungeon-clearing mooches that sometimes bring total death to your Townies by bringing a train of mobs when they run away.  Only one music track that continually plays.  Townies cannot tear down already placed structures and items.It's truly an alpha-stage game that is passed off as a release-ready game.  Look elsewhere for a city-building game.  Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria are truly better options.EDIT:  Also, do not listen to a word that YetiChow, the mod of the Towns forums on Steam, as he is a self-professed Troll that has no actual interest in the Steam community except to get rid of people who are critical of Towns and Town's developers.  http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=88t=8032&start=40&p=47838&view=show#p47838Everyone of the users that he's perma-banned on the Towns forums on Steam (listed here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/ ) were speaking only the truth about the history of Towns that included the actions of the Towns' devs and how they falsely advertised this game during the launch on Steam.  YetiChow doesn't want potential buyers to hear the truth because he knows that it will hurt the sales of Towns.  His only job is to be a schill for the devs of Towns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

HOWEVER, I must say this game is still the same POS as it was then... Hardly different.. Potential and My time WASTED!!?!?40/100Pros-potential (aha there was)-Some decent addons (this will make it just slightly more playable)-Not buggy (not seriously buggy, however it would be more enjoyable if you could think of all the problems as just a mistake)-:( still can't think of anything actualy enjoyable after my money was stolen for an unfinished gameCons-game will not be fixed (game is not gonna change now or ever GG)-AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid as hell.. ( they will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off so bad..)-Very boring and repetitive at times! (basic actions are way to simple and click heavy with very little aesthetic or enjoyment as a reward..)-Not replayable (since you cant really ever do much in the first play or second or third or fourth.. you will achieve very little in this game as everything takes forever)Don't BUY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRIDE AND WALLET!!?!!

												I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam. I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.  Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own. The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't....just don't...This is one of those ""indie"" games that was made as a huge cash grab.  The game ""released"" in early access, but few updates of signifigance were made.  Next thing you know, it was just called ""release version"".  Nothing much has ever changed, and it is boring and buggy.  Character pathing is problematic at best, and the UI is generally wothless and confusing.  You would expect that a game with graphics this bad would make up for it in other areas like gameplay.  NOPE!  Just another attempt yo grab your money with little to no concern for you as a consumer.			",77,22,1,16,22,1,19

Maybe there's a great game here if you can figure out what to do and play it for more than an hour or so, but I wasn't able to find it.			",126,22,1,35,52,2,60

I made the mistake of trusting the developers to do a proper game.  I advise not getting this, unless they start actively updating it again. 2 years passed, and I hoped they would do a patch, a fix. Nothing.  The game itself is great for building an empire, its got struggles and its got fun pieces, but as a whole, it lacks in a feel of completeness.			",39,4,0,9,10,0,6

Even the forums haven't had an updated post since August 2015, and that's rare for there to be a post that recent. Also, that post is a complaint from a gamer. The last time the developer actually posted anything was 2014? 2013? The long and short of it is, the game is broken and it's incomplete with no news of it being worked on.			",31,2,0,2,3,0,10

I really liked the ideas and visions for this game but hence the devs, being the lazy procrastinators they are, it is definitely not worth your dollars.Do not buy this game in this current unfinished and abondoned state that it is.

												One of the collective of Greenlight games that has been discontinued in its development.The developers have backed away from it entirely, after having instilled new ones to take their place.Though it has mods to take its replayability and value up a notch, it is not going anywhere beyond the most recent update.The game itself offers an interesting idea, where you are given a group of individuals who've managed to get stranded in the middle of a wilderness where survival is bent upon preparation against attacks from waves native slime blobs, werebears, skeletons, goblin-like creatures, and other manners of mythical beings. Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little ""Townies"" that inhabit the locale.Thus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.After creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.With certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.Other games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.I would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game.

												Edited at version 14d, in which development seemed to have a heartbeat again.The new update brings some cool new features, namely terraforming. This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their♥♥♥♥♥and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.Man, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.---ORIGINAL---I entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.Boy was I wrong.If you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start? The early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck. Lack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.			",458,116,14,66,45,5,61

												This is the infamous game that has gave a bad name to steam's early release program.This was one of the first games to be available to purchase from a new (at the time) steam division which was intended to give funding to games which were partially developed and showed a lot of promise.  Back in 2011ish, this game was seen as having amazing potential. Lots of people bought the game, and we thought the money we gave would be used so that the programmer would work full time on the game.  (There is a big write up on exactly how much money was generated from game sales, I can't remember if it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more). What happenned instead, was that the developer took the money and stopped working on this game.  Disbelief, outrage, and anger from the community ensued.  No refunds were issued. Steam didn't withhold any of the cash.  So many people feel they were burned by this affair, that they swore off purchasing pre-release games ever again. And that's the real loss here.

												Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone. 5. Bugs.6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit. Really disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product. It's made me more cynical about buying into alphas, which isn't a good thing to be, either, I guess. Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.			",50,7,0,13,19,1,9

												Unfinished, buggy, tedious. There's a kernel of fun to be had in the game, even in this pathetic state, but it will be obtained through a terrible UI, broken game mechanics, tedious micromanagement of the most simple of tasks, and poor game design.The developers abanonded the game after they cashed in on early access, and then have the audacity to suggest a sequel to this unfinished game. Remember their names (Xavi Canal, Ben Palgi) and ensure that their reputation follows them on any future games. To the authors: EA Games could use more people like you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I adore Towns. I know it's not the popular opinion here, but I have spent a happy 300+ hours building and exploring and fighting. It was well worth the $10 or so that I spent on it a few years ago. In Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk. The gameplay is heavy in resource management and building but has a satisfying amount of fighting and exploring. Why are the reviews so negative? This game long been public and under development, and that development stalled and then eventually halted. There are lists of features yet to be implemented and bugs to be fixed. Many believe that Towns is an unfinished game and are very angry about this. My interpretation is that the developers were just too ambitious about what to include and ended up with lots of great features that don't all function perfectly. I think it's finished, just not polished.  So despite my positive review, buyer beware. Play a demo if you can. Think about what bugs get under your skin and what you are happy to ignore while exploring the game mechanics. Think about how many hours or what level of gameplay you need to shell out some cash. But I would buy this game again, even in its current state. But do not buy it expecting additional development - that ship has sailed.			",11,45,0,29,57,0,30

												The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try Gnomoria. It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.			",987,514,42,197,143,15,253

												Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.  Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.  Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard.			",849,226,54,90,159,17,114

												As many others have been stating, this game has long since been abandoned. I used to play this quite a while back, and while I did have fun and enjoy it at times, it lacks in quite a few things that could've been improved to be much better. The game has quite a few glitches and issues, and I think it's a shame what happened to it. It could've been a much better game than it is right now. It has some potential, but I'm disappointed that the makers have stopped entirely, and I wish that I hadn't spent the $15 on it that I spent. This game has become one of the only games I regret purchasing.Likely the creators and developers do not have enough support, and things probably got too complicated. While I understand everyone and all developers have their own life and their own needs, I've seen so little effort into updating this game and bringing it back to life that it feels like the entire project is dead to them.It's sad when this happens to games. I've played some wonderful indie games before, but I'm afraid this one is just going to still be dead as it's been for so long. I wouldn't advise purchasing it, and I'm sure there are much better games that could be found of similar gameplay types.			",128,25,6,31,15,0,22

												Towns is now the poster child for Early-Access-Gone-Bad. The devs took the money and ran. All I can say about Towns, is that it was the first (as far as I am aware of) game that mixed a usuable interface with Dwarf Fortress. The graphics were fine, and the music is meh. The game was really fun.I really want to give this a positive review because I got well over 20 hours out of this. I think I paid 15$ so I feel like I got my moneys worth out of this title.

												If you like buying a game where the developer announces they are abandoning it before it's finished and in the same post announces the sequal. This is the game! I don't get how you can announce a sequal in the exact same post of you deciding you'll never finish this game. I hope you realize how stupid that was, I'm sure marketing Towns 2 is going to be great. ""Hey remember Towns, the game we never finished, buy Towns 2!""This game needs to be removed as soon as possible. The gameplay is nowhere near polished to be sold on it's own. At first, it's kinda easy to maintain all the citizens and stop them from going deep underground to get useless items. But, the more citizens you have the harder it is to stop them from going on suicide missions and you'll have citizens dying constantly. It's more fustrating then fun trying to build a decent town.

												The game was rather crude back then. I found myself struggling to enjoy it. Back then, I would've recommended it if you're into sandbox games like this. After all, devs were working on it, slowly making it better.....But I wouldn't recommend it at all anymore. It's abandoned, devs have completely stopped working on this, and it's definitely NOT worth 15 bucks for an unfinished, buggy, crude product. Another game that never makes it out of early access, just like ♥♥♥♥ing Day-Z. Don't bother.			",432,92,18,35,33,4,27

												Great Potential but it failed in the end... ABANDONWARE! Gnomoria looks exactly the same and acts the same so go for that game over this one. Wish Steam would refund me due to it being abandon... Extra Note... There is a fan base doing updates and trying to bring the game back together so if you want to jump on that group enjoy if not go else where.			",227,64,3,55,43,2,57

												Repeat after me people, do not buy this game, do not buy this game, do not buy this game.Developers left this game at a really low stage in develoment, only hosting about 3-7 hours of entertainment, and no animations or anything of the sort.Sometimes when someone gets killed, they turn into a ghost, the ghost gets killed but not after killing a different citizen, thus making another ghost, then another, and another and another and another, which evetually killing EVERYBODY.I would give this game a 5, out of 5 billion.

												I have played this game a lot in early access, before it was available on steam. Recently came back to give it another try. Nothing changed! Except that the game is now called 'Finished'. You can't release a game like this after all the support!!This is exactly the situation where devs ruin things for other devs. These guys made their money and left the game and supporters. People will be less confident in supporting other games and devs with great potential. It is a shame!			",122,11,5,14,16,2,20

												PENDING FUTURE UPDATES: As of now I can't recommend. This is a game that has a lot of promise but ultimately fails to deliver. The tutorials do not explain a whole lot, and are often buggy. (Random shutdowns.) There hasn't been muchwork done on the game. If you're going to sell a product, make it a playable product. One that delivers. The dungeon mentioned that is below the town? Not there. Character AI? Random, buggy to where it doesn't always respond to yourcommands. Everything else plays like someone put it together with a poor copy of RPG maker. I held off reviewing this for a while, because I liked the initial promise...but it has been months and months with nothing of merit added to the game. I can see why the others felt ripped off.Steer clear until the devs get their act together.			",76,23,0,44,36,2,11

Developers such as these are ruining PC gaming as we know it, these kinds of scammers get your money and run away with it and Steam is to blame also for having let through games so easily with no juristictions regarding deadlines and the quality of the games.

												The game has stagnated. I highly suggest not purchasing this game, I would even go as far as to call for its removal from Steam. Its a really good concept, but the game has ceased development, and you're paying full price now for a ""early access game that will never be finished""Perfect example of take the money and run. Yes the game is playable. But its more or less an extrended demo rather than anything close to worth 14.99. Shame. The game had some really good potential... but not now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, little did I know that the 'final product' was so exact to the alpha build that I could have saved my money and just played that! DO NOT buy this rushed, unfinished mess. Save your money.

												Despite the bugs, it had been pretty damned fun to play for quite a while. After hearing that the devs had abandoned ship with this game and there will most likely not be any future updates, I wouldn't recommend any of my friends buy this game.For what it was worth, I did put in some good time managing a city of my own in this game for a while. It was fun while it lasted. Play the demo. Then, if you don't care about any current bugs or future updates, you might consider purchasing this game. It probably wouldn't be worth the full price tag since it lacks any development, but it might be worth it if it went on sale.Edit: Just saw an update for this game in my download queue. Hopefully this game isn't as dead as it was announced to be. Although the update is an extremely minor update, it's still an update.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 10, 2014
												I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale. It's definitely more of a $5 game, not a $15 one. If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. *The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about.			",79,24,0,26,26,1,14

												**** August 2015 Update ****Almost a year after being told the game development was suspended for ""home renovations"", there has been no word from the developers and the forums continue to stay without complaint (due to moderator Yetichow not allowing posts that factually state the game's status or factually state why the game is unfinished/needs improvement/general feedback).So, on that note, please make sure you avoid the game (unless you want to waste your money).  Read the REVIEWS of the game and disregard the forums (since Yetichow had decided to scrub them clean and ban any who disagree).   Congratulations, Towns.  You made it into the Steam group, ""ScamReport"".  You should be proud...(/sarcasm)****March 2015 Update****I wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.We were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014. Make your own judgement call from that...---------------------------------**** Initial Review ****Voted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.  Imagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.According to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!  Please note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not ""understanding"" how these type of games are to played.   That ""if we just gave it time"" we'd figure it all out.Screw that.Even over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)Avoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.  Matter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.  I will be.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game about a year ago thinking I was getting a casual city builder similar to dwarf fortress. I was wrong. What i infact got was a buggy, unfinished mess that needed some serious patching. Yet it was advertised as a finished game. After playing for a few hours i decided to leave it and come back when it's in a better state.And now this happens: http://kotaku.com/unfinished-steam-game-abandoned-after-thousands-bought-1572931721. Thats right. The developers just gave up! Got bored. Couldn't be asked. So they took their money and left. The game did have some potential but the fact that you cant even build a roof on your house without watching extensive youtube videos so that you don't screw it up and break the game is ridiculous.I got scammed and I feel sad about it. So now I'm venting my fustration through a review.Please don't buy this game. Although thinking about it you probably never would of done anway.  (Now I wait for the inevitable abandonment of the other unfinished game I bought Starbound)			",85,21,0,10,5,0,16

												Why the heck is this game still for sale Steam??  Boo on you Steam.  Boo.   We should bring you up on charges of human rights abuses.  The cowards gave up on it nearly 2 years ago, and you still leave it up here for them to get more out of the player community?   Need a downvote on Steam as well as this game!So my review of the game.Well it showed promise for the first 6 months.  Had fun with it and was patched pretty often.  You could see it starting to come together.Then these two cowardly, piece of re-heated dead monkey lice they call Devs gave up.  Their names are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi if you'd like to read more about the story.  So then they give the development over to some poor schmuk named Frankenberger.  He couldn't handle it solo as he was more of a fan than a true dev.  So when he quit in Sept. 2014 that's exactly where this game has been.  Exactly.  18 month ago.So it sold 200K copies for $15-$20.  You do the math.  Someone got paid, and we got the shaft.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Short of it:This game has been abandoned, wait till a sale brings its price down if you want to try it.The long of it:Unfortunatly I can't recomend this game. I bought it when it was still young and worthwhile, full of proimise and hope, sadly it has been abandoned.Don't get me wrong here, I love the concept, I love the style and I love how the game works, but its unfinished, buggy and in need of some serious love. Perhaps the developers would be willing to part with it and hand it to someone who would be better suited to... finishing it off with all the features that I recall seeing on a roadmap... somewhere a long time ago....If theres anything I can say about the game its that its gotten buggier since I stopped playing it, perhaps thats just the age of my computer finally showing, but I don't think so.Its still quite challanging in and of itself, but like most of my towns end up, it is very unfinished, ""Hero"" mode and one other mode not implimented, and a lot of things requiring some much needed... laquer.If you are looking for a game that will play similarly to this one but has a more finished feel try Gnomoria or Banished. Hell even the currently WIP Hearthstone has a more finished and complete feel!Keep an open mind that games are always subject to change, and that, if this game is lucky, it will be worked on again.

												I wanted to like this game when I got it. I really did. I was intimidated by Dwarf Fortress and thought that this would be an equally fun little world builder game.No, it really is not.This is Dwarf Fortress's half cousin he really wishes wasn't kinda in the family. The menus are much less deep that DF, but at the cost of having what feels like very few options. The UI is terrible in general, and I found that after playing this game for 27.6 hours, I still felt lost and slow doing everything. This isn't helped by a TERRIBLE camera angle, and the entire game just feels in general like a poorly made and thought through Dwarf Fortress.If you want this game's experience, just get Dwarf Fortress and find some youtube tutorials. You'll thank me later, I promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now the developers have abandoned the game (and are talking about Town's 2, inexplicably).  I strongly suggest you don't buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Towns is sadly full of wasted potential.  On paper, it had everything going for it: resource gathering, micro management, needs of villagers, crafting, construction and combat. Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a cluster♥♥♥♥, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1. The graphics, well, it looks like it was made in the early 90s,    there were a few games using similar painted-art style, but I can't remember their names. The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not. Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable.   They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?  About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones.   Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are.   On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation.   They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise. Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working?   Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy? OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation:   a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns. Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game.   Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane. Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around.   It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

I have the sense that I threw my money away, but thats a risk with Early Access. But, please, don't waste your money. There are other, better options available, until such a time when this game is actively worked on again.TLDR - great concept, no updates/support; save your money until it's fully developed.

												Don't get me wrong, this game is wonderful. I love pretty much everything about it, even if it is a buggy mess of incompletion. Like most people seem to agree, the one huge flaw is the fact that the developer abandoned it just because sales were declining. A truly passionate game dev wouldn't do that, and it's not excusable (especially considering his funds were quite sustainable, since this game really took off). If the dev didn't abandon it, I'd reccommend this for sure. As of now? Don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was fun for a while, but ultimately it's nothing more than a good concept made into a hideous wreck packed full with frustrating glitches and false promises. This game was abandoned by the developers years ago before the game even hit beta, and people have barely heard of them since.A lack of content, development, and no goals to achieve all add up to make this game nothing more than a frustrating experience. Banished or Gnomoria are far better and will be far more worth your wallet than this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It started out as a nice game in developpement, but the human factor kicked in and the devs seem to have abandoned the game's final developpement stages.Don't buy, it's a scam at this point.If any game is made by Developer: Xavi Canal, Ben Palgi and/or Publisher: SMP, please use extreme caution when pruchasing their products. It seems they like treating their customers like suckers, lying about the game's legetimate value. Unfinished games have little or no value, but it seems that the people mentioned above do not understand this. Don't waste your time with self-entitled greedy people.Make sure their names stick to your memory when you're purchasing games, they have prooven that they have 0 integraty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game managed to slip through right before the WarZ controversy and the implementation of Early Access.The original game description from the end of 2012 pointed out that the game had planned features not yet implemented, listing the features available and those that would be available in the future. The current description has no indication that this is an incomplete (and now, defunct) product. I wish I had a screenshot of the original 'About the Game', as the difference in length alone is staggering. The game had definite promise, and I was able to spend >25 hours playing around with an older version, but it is absolutely unfinished.There is no point in purchasing this and even the developers have abandoned the official forums.Caveat emptor, and such.

												This could have been a great game. Health and other personal problems have seemingly prevented the dev from finishing the game, if we believe the statements on the dev blog. Or maybe he took on more than he could handle. I don't see this product as a scam as some other steam users do, but knowing it will never be updated it's surely too expensive for what it's worth. At least I've had fun with it so for me it has been worth the money. I sometimes replay this unfinished gem and wonder whether a similar game will ever see the light of day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before you read any further: this game has been abandoned. Any flaws, problems or glitches will not be fixed. Towns might have been the first Early Access game I've ever bought and it made me skeptical and wary of all future Early Access titles. It has a great premise that is executed poorly and although you might have a bit of fun with it for a few hours, there is little here to recommend an indepth playthrough.I don't mind isometric, retroish graphics but these are, more often than not, absolutely annoying to look at. Towns has gone for a sort of Populus/Simcity kind of look, all graphical tilesets and while I think some of it works, particularly outside of the Town in the woods and forest, it often just looks totally ugly. There's no definition or clear sense of layering; what lies in front of things and behind other things can be really hard to tell. When you do have a Town, it all runs together and looks like someone who just found out they can download Final Fantasy sprites and has mashed them all together. Certain textures really grate on the eyes, particularly the water texture which you see a lot of.Controlling this game isn't much better as the inteface is awful.  I've played a lot of games with clunky interfaces and struggled my way through them but this might be one of the worst. Absolutely nothing about it works properly; you'll probably have to hit every key on the keyboard to figure out what does what and even then, attempting to divine the systems that control anything in this game is like trying to scry the future or turn lead into gold. Towns had a lot of potential for growth (with a bad launch, but hey, potential?) - I mean, running a town built over a dungeon and attracting heroes, managing the enemies that come out, building the town up with facilities for the adventurers? It sounds like a perfect blend of Recettear, Diablo and Dungeon Keeper. But this is not that; Towns is a shoddy, abandoned game with very little to recommend it. It usually comes on sale for 7.49, discounted down from 14.99. It is not worth playing at either price and the fact they want you to pay $15 dollars for an abandoned game is repulsive. You shouldn't be paying for abandonware - speak with your wallet and say no to Towns.NOTE: Steam shows 0.1 hours on record but I know for a fact I played at least a day of this - it felt longer, honestly, but trust me you don't need a whole day to see the flaws in this one.

After a while you just either get frustrated at all your towns people not doing what you wnat them to, or everyone gets slaughtered by some random monster.

												While Towns clearly had potential as a city builder/simulator with hints of Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, the development of this early access title has officially been abandoned. This means that no further updates will be made, plus it will very likely never reach ""full game status"".While there might be opportunities for talented modders to salvage what is left, paying customers will inevitably feel cheated. Buying the game at this point is a waste of money and time, unfortunately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My little automations are clearing the 3rd dungeon level as I write this.UPDATE: I've got a 60 hour playtime because, back in March at least, you could leave it running in the background at no risk to the well being of your Town. All dungeons were cleared with about 4 hours of play and 56 hours of idle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not complete, even though they it's not listed as Early Access. Basically they just took the cash and ran. I'd like to say some really nasty things about that, but that would be pointless.Lots of playtime pre-Steam. Game still has most the bugs it did when it was alpha. IMO the biggest bug is that your people work themselves to death, literally, they forget to eat and starve. Got one town up to 70 population, only to see them starve to death in the next 2 hours to to 5. After that I deleted it, being that was the upteenth town that did that.One of the patches made all the townies rock climbers, so you only need the first set of stairs. And then you get to watch them all race down into to the depths, to fight and die. Heroes are the ones that are supposed to go fight the monsters, not your townies. Once you've collected all that loot and minerals, you're left thinking, what do I do with it. Since there really isn't much to make, I think there's only 1 item made out of gold. So you have that hero running around with that wooden sword you made because he's too stupid to pick up that magical sword that was found. So usually one of your townies will equip it. You can tell them what to equip, but it's a click fest just to get it done. Your townies are kinda stupid too, they just drop everything on the ground rather then put it into containers that are right next to them (that was also int he alpha).Want to have more fun? Turn on sieges and get wiped out before you even make that the second crafting table your need. Last time I played with siege's on (that's where the monsters can attack you town up top, not counting what the heroes pull to your town), I had just made my first workstation, and here came the spiders, they killed off most of my townies and then the rest of them were wiped out by the next 2 sieges that were 5 minutes apart. Games are supposed to be fun and keep the player active and interested. This game doesn't do that. This is also the only game I know of where the player is penalized for being active. So if you're constanly giving them orders, none will show up. I used to go watch tv so they could have 'idle time. I heard that there was a patch that came out for this. From what I understood of it, it did minor fixes and made it playable on some other OS so they could suck more money from unsuspecting buyers.How strange my original review of this poor game disappeared. Might have been deleted by the devs due to me stating that they have a new game they want you to buy. I forget the name of that one. However I intend to avoid anything these guys work on it the future if I possibly can. They abandoned this  BETA because they got bored and started playing the blame game. Who's to say they won't do it again. One dev even bragged in the Steam forums that he took a months vacation in South America from the profits.  How about finishing the game?So if you want a game that penalizes you, gets boring, frustrating and is incomplete, go ahead and buy this.			",250,82,20,59,93,2,136

												Towns appears to have been inspired by the likes of Dwarf Fortress.  Like Dwarf Fortress, the graphics are rubbish and the interface is very user-unfriendly, though unlike Dwarf Fortress it's not much fun to play, particularly when you watch your villagers launch yet another kamikaze attack against a heavily-armed frogman knowing you can't do a damn thing about it. Oh, and the female villager death scream will probably haunt me for the rest of my life. One to avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very buggy, much alpha, such dissapointment... wow?What sucks is that this game had and still has potential.  This game is the reason I don't back any early access releases.  The dev posted a ton of things that never got implemented and jumped the ship with all that early access cash; leaving the game in an alpha state, full of bugs, and with mediocre gameplay.  If this were stable and had half the features and functions promised, I'd give it a solid recommendation; however, being in it's current state don't waste your time or money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While I sure got my monies worth out of this game (some 60 hours clocked) the fact remains that the dev ran off without finishing the game, and this after several youtubers had been praising the game (and funnily enough getting their names in the game). hmm.. Not saying anything.The premise of the game is solid just it still lacks so much that would make it a good game, is it playable sure and you could probably have more then a few fun hours but the fact remains we shouldn't be rewarding devs who just dash off with our money like that. Was the first and last time I put any money on an early access game. Shame, as I said I like the idea behind the game, the graphics are cute but in the end.. there isn't enough there.Oh and did I mention the dev just ran off without a word?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to like this game. I really, really did. I played this for days, almost obsessively. It almost seemed like it was starting to get better, after many hours of having it constantly crash on me, I got into the habit of saving compulsively. After losing progress, hours upon hours of progress I'd start anew, stronger, faster, better prepared. But I don't think it was ever as fun as it seemed at the time. It was horribly tedious. I often had another game going on another system at the same time, as I waited for things to happen in the background. That's not a game. That's a simulation. And if I wanted to play a simulation, I'd run one with more polish and more things that were interesting to watch. This has neither. I'm certain there's something similar, better, out there. Find it. Play that instead. Don't waste your time like I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FREEZE! Before you even think about buying this game, let me ask you a few questions. Do you like unfinished games that try to pass themselves off as ""finished""? Hopefully not.Do you like extremely buggy and unplayable games that make vanilla Bethesda games pale in comparison? You really shouldn't!And finally, do you like wasting money on a game that promised continual updates? Of course not!""Towns"" is the epitome of unrealized potential. Lazy developers took what would have been a decent time-wasting game and somehow managed to turn it into a mess. This pile of slop caused a backlash worthy of a Penny Arcade article.http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-perils-of-greenlight-how-towns-enraged-a-community-by-selling-a-game-th It was published in 2012 and still rings true over a year later.In short, please DO NOT buy this game ever.

The UI is not user-friendly and looks like it was designed by a time travelling programmer from 1992. The 'tutorial' does not really teach you things you need to know. Your townsfolk get killed at random by some monsters roaming around the map. The AI goes wonky and does not do what you ask.So, do I recommend this game?No.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												really want to love this game sooo much, sadly it was abandoned by the developers. This game had soo much promise. I do still enjoying playing the game but again cant really enjoy it as much Id like to. I hope and pray that some one suffers with a change of heart as to where the game is concerned as this could have been one heck of a game. Purchase at your own risk... personally since the developement has been abandoned the game should not cost £9.99 if anything it should be £1.99. why pay full retail in to the pockets of some one that cant even be bothered to finish.. again really wishsome one could pick up where the original lazy butts left off.I like the game, sadly because its not finished I wouldnt recommend this game.

												The game has some cool concepts but they were very poorly executed. It should be noted that this is not a completed game and will never be finished. Classic case of a early access that that you shouldnt buy and its not even early access...I really wanted to like the game but in the end i just feel robbed and mislead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Cautionary tale of how easy it is to get duped in todays global community. People want to believe in indy developers, because some incredibly unique and interesting experiences sometimes come from unexpected places. Unfortunately, right from the start of this games release, you could tell it was not where it should be, despite peoples support and the developers initial passion. All of that interest trailed off into nothingness very quickly, and now all of the initial supporters are left with a scar in their libraries.Dead project. Read other reviews for much better and complete alternatives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy this.  Don't even consider it.I made the mistake of thinking this was a near-finished product that would be a bit easier to play than Gnome Fortress.  Not as complex but you know- a town simulator of SOME degree.  So I bought it more than a year ago.  The ""tutorial"" was garbage, as was the interface, the gameplay- basically everything was atrocious to one degree or another.  I promised to never touch it again until it was released in a finished state.News: IT WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.  Seriously.  Look at http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=11402.  They're done ""updating it.""Basically, this was a Greenlight product that was released before it should have been.  This is the one game that made me completely cautious of ever supporting any Early Access title whatsoever- AND THIS WASN'T EVEN EARLY ACCESS.  IT WAS RELEASED AS A FINISHED PRODUCT.  FOR 15 DOLLARS.This is a perfect example of what developers have the potential to do with your money.  Promise to make finished products and then back off and reap the rewards without any reprimand.  Sure, it sucks that the developer got burned out but he should have realized what he was doing before he was able to put this on Steam as a completed game.

												I hate to give bad reviews, but this game deserves it.  I was one of the many who jumped in early when this game was first released, mainly on the promise of what the devs said it would become.  I played the game a lot back in late 2012 and early 2013 and enjoyed it for the most part, but there were lots of things that still needed to be fixed, most notably the AI and the way it would handle performing tasks with your villagers.Reinstalled and played the game again a few months ago.....and found that nothing had changed in almost 2 years!  Reading about how the original dev abandoned the game and ""sold"" the rights to someone else is almost heartbreaking.  Indie games have a bad name with a lot of casual gamers because of behavior like this, and I'm ashamed that I contributed to this jerk walking away with more than $2 million in sales.

Apparently, the developers thought it was a good idea to take the money from the approximate 200,000 purchases and run, with the game abandoned and the devs claiming to make another game with all the claimed features of Towns.DON'T BUY IT.

												I would only recomend this game if you thought building in minecraft was to easy and quick.  In this game, you will spend hours building a single house for 6 people to live in.  When you start, you are sometimes surrounded by enemies and lose half your villagers right away.  After playing for many hours, I felt ready to explore dungeons.  I cleared the first floor and when I opened the second floor of the dungeon, the heros left and my city got overrun.  If you like frustration, this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game back when it was in alpha, back when there was still active development and a very active community. A friend of mine did a Let's Play of it and I enjoyed what I saw and played. Sadly, the last developer has finally called it quits, and I personally doubt this game will ever leave its alpha/beta state. It is fun micromanaging your town, trying to get immigrants to come to it and attract heroes to it as well, but the food system seriously needs to be reworked. My villagers can go all the way down to the bottom of my mine before needing to come back up again to eat, and since your town can experience hunger lock (Where you don't have any food at all and all villagers can't do anything due to starvation), expect a massive kill off if your food supply ever dwindles to an incredibly low number.There was a lot of potential behind this game, enough potential that I threw my money behind it back in 2011. Sadly, that potential will never be truly realized since its own developers and the last man working on this game gave up on it. If there ever is a Towns 2, I will not buy it due to the lack of interest the developers had in the first game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There are tons of ""little things"" that if fixed would make this an amazing game. However the devs have abandoned the game, and don't seem to have any intention on fixing it. It should be one of the best games of all time, but instead it's large number of tiny, small, problems renders the game tedious to play. If they would just fix that...  But they wont.

												Was a very promising game and I enjoyed it for a while.... But the game still has problems and was never finished. It feels abandoned and I lost all my save files after the game left early access but the game still feels like it is still in early access. It was fun but there is better games out there that are completed or shown more love. It was a unique game and I am sad I am writing this review.			",116,12,0,14,6,0,12

												The idea of this game would be absolutely genius. As a fan of the dungeon crawler genre, I kinda always asked myself how cities at these brinks of hell (diablo, sacred, baldurs gate) could even exist and this game was meant to really allow me to experience it first hand - mixed with my true favorite genre which is city building and management.Unluckily the game has been abandoned or its developed has slowed down to the point where it is basically dead, which is a very sad thing as the game is one of the most unique twists and experiences I had in a long time and I would have loved to see it getting finished or at least polished to the point where you don't get frustated with no end due to bugs ...

												This is a game I would turly like to love. It's got a great concept, and really is quite fun. That said, the developers ruined the community. There are tons of ""little things"" that if fixed would make this an amazing game. However the devs have abandoned the game, and don't seem to have any intention on fixing it. It should be one of the best games of all time, but instead it's large number of tiny, small, problems renders the game tedious to play. If they would just fix that...  But they wont. Save your money. Don't buy the game. It's sad, I really want to like it, but your time and money is better spent in other games of this genere.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game used to be really good. But then the devs changed one little thing, that ruined it for me entirely.To get a higher population you used to need happiness. Happiness was achieved due to idleness (no work).This made somehow sense and was somewhat easy to achieve (the rest of the game is time consuming enough, so that was fine). But now they changed that. Being overworked and being idle is decreasing happiness now... To maintain a mix between idleness and workload you have to insanely manage and switch work groups of citizens in a tedious, time consuming, boring and annoying way.The game was fine, but now I can't recommend it anymore.

I had a couple of extended playthroughs even though it was buggy and clunky, but it was fun nevertheless and showed heaps of promise.However, it was never completed, there's no signs that it ever will be, and so it joins the growing ranks of unfinished early access games :/If it was priced at a couple of bucks, I'd say get it and you'll get a bit of fun out of it.  But not at the current price for an unfinished game, with no sign it will ever be completed..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incomplete game, being sold as a finished product.Dev team has fallen apart and/or walked away multiple times.Every once in a while a meaningless patch is applied so that the founder can say ""See! not abandoned!""It had potential, they did not get there before the game stopped advancing.It's a game where you do not directly control the units, you say what you would like done and the AI gets around to it, sorta like dwarf fortress..... but wait, that only works if the AI is functional. The AI is this game is more brainless than the original AI in Master of Orion 3.Run away, don't read about the game, if you see what it was supposed to be you will just be sad that it never made it to that point.

And now development has stopped.I hope the developers dont make this move again, however any positive standing the creators had is gone, so i'm sure they've probably changed their name.

												I played hours on this game and had a LOT of fun, but over all I have to say ""no""What I liked:- heroes live in the town to help battle monsters- variety of structures, weapons, armor, materials- the room requirements helped make a more sensible layout for a town- sandbox, building fun:)What I did not like:- AI issues (people would get stuck and starve sometimes, workers would queue up waiting for one guy sleeping to put down the first block)- They stopped updating it:(- Clunky UI with too many menus, had to go too deep into menus to find what you wanted			",56,23,0,22,35,0,4

												While I really enjoyed this game, even in its unfinished state, I was constantly aware that it needed a tremendous amount of work and that work was NOT getting done. I kept up with it in community and reviews around the net. It has, unfortunately, been abandoned, screwing a lot of hopeful players out of lots of money.  Do not pour money down a rathole. Go somewhere else for your city building needs. This game is defunct.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												By far the worst thing that could have happened to the opening days of Valve's (now beloved) Greenlight system. It was a game with so much promise--but which fizzled under poor care and lousy management from devs who (seemingly) simply had no interest in their community beyond the potential for money making. Despite valiant efforts by some few out there, this game is a dud, a broken piece of potential doomed to forever drift the landscape of Steam on the backs of the dollars many hopeful fans (myself included) spent toward its grand debut.This is no Terraria, no Gnomoria, no Dwarf Fortress or Minecraft.

This game had great potential but it was ruined by the fact that no one is working on it the bugs are annoying and it just is not worth the amount of money that it is advertised for. I hope that a dev picks this up and works on it again and making the game better and more playable but I just can not see anyone picking it up.Please do not buy it youwill just end up being disappointed. If the production is picked back up and updates are made to the game once again I will change my review but until then this game is broken and needs someone to fix it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now they just stop working on it?  If you want what this is advertising, go get Dwarf Fortress(don't even have to pay, and the amount of content is incredible...if you aren't big on the graphics get a tileset and you'll be good to go) or Gnomoria.

												The idea behind the game has merit, but in actually play I found it very boring and repetative with few moments that felt like something had been achieved or completed. There are better games for town building and better games for dungeon adventures. While this game mixes them both, it does so it a very lack luster way. If later on down the road there are some sort of objectives, quests, goals, or really anything to help give the game some momentum it may be worth revisting. For now however, I cannot reccomend this game. 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excitedly coaxed into buying Towns by a friend I was incredbily dissapointed. Towns is nothing but a reskin of Dwarf Fortress (A FREE game with graphics mod already available and better also for free) with no intresting mechanics, a poor tutorial that will frustrate those not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, among techinical issues I experienced (frame drops galore on Mac). Towns is also infamous for being one of the first projects taken off of Steam Early Access. That basically means the dev, knowing it was unfinished, decided to take his project off leaving the current version available with no future updates. An unfinished project that sets a terrible, unfortunate precident for furture projects in the Early Access program.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest i enjoy the game although I suck at it. That being said I can not recommend this game to anyone it is unfinished and the devs are not updating any more. This game had great potential but it was ruined by the fact that no one is working on it the bugs are annoying and it just is not worth the amount of money that it is advertised for. I hope that a dev picks this up and works on it again and making the game better and more playable but I just can not see anyone picking it up.Please do not buy it youwill just end up being disappointed. If the production is picked back up and updates are made to the game once again I will change my review but until then this game is broken and needs someone to fix it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And now development has stopped.I hope the developers dont make this move again, however any positive standing the creators had is gone, so i'm sure they've probably changed their name. Beware.The game itself was good but has been left unfinished and buggy.Thumbs down so that others dont buy it, not becuase the game isnt / would have turned into- a good game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a nut shell, Towns didn't make any sense. The game was extremely boring and quite dull. There are many better town builder games out there which are very similar, but better, then Towns. At first glance the game seemed interesting and new, but it turned out to be buggy and unpleasant. It being the one of the first few games to get Greenlighted, Town had a lot of potential. Some of the blame for the flop of Towns goes to the developers. I feel like these Devs almost completely ignore there game and get out around 2 patches per year. For a game that is still this buggy the devs should be working harder. The upside to Towns was it gave me a hour of mediocre fun. Overall, don't buy Towns.3.9/10 Sloanster Score			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a lot of hope for this game throughout its development. Always giving the developers the benefit of the doubt. Sadly I have to agree with the rest. This game HAD massive potential but the developers flubbed it. Dont spend the kind of money they are asking for on this game. IF it was 5 dollars it'd be worth it, just to test out their idea. You'd need to accept the challenge that it'd be and work things out on your own for the most part but when you do, its fun.I lasted 13 hours before I got tired of it and the minor bugs i had run into at that point. All the same, I cant recommend it, especially at the ridiculous price they are asking. I got it for like 8 bucks near the beginning of development so saying 5 bucks is worth it still applies.

												Unfinished game that somehow jumped from ""alpha"" to a finished game in the span of a week. At launch day, the game had such devastating bugs that made it mostly unplayable, and only some of those fatal bugs have been fixed in the year after the launch. There isn't really much actual gameplay involved, that portion of the game is out of balance and broken. Most of the things in-game don't actually do anything, they're just decoration and ""make believe"". Once you get food production running (and half of that is broken due to new patches implementing flawed animal feeding system etc), there's no longer anything interesting to see. Unless you like wasting your time building pointless things. I suppose some people do like that, but I don't. I would've actually liked to see some of that ""city management"" in the game instead.

												The game has an interesting concept and was the first Greenlight title.  Take a typical RPG setting and control the town instead of the heroes.  Your job is to build up sufficient infrastructure to attract and keep heroes happy for...some reason.  Who knows.Most of the 36 hours I spent playing were staring at the game in frustration trying to get it to work.  It has some similarities to Dwarf Fortress but it felt like I didn't have as much control.As others have said, get Gnomoria instead.  Cannot recommend this game to anyone.However I must give Towns at least a 1/10.  Due to its incredibly broken and frustrating nature, I had to look up help on YouTube and that led me to discovering Sips for the first time.  So thank you Towns for helping me find one of my favorite YouTubers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In a word, Unfinished.In many -- Towns is a promising, but rough experience. Nothing seems to work quite as intended, the UI is a little finicky, mouse clicks don't always register in the right place (if at all), and digging is a nightmare. The further down you dig, the more erratic the mouse behavior becomes.At 15$, I'd say the price is steep -- comparing to Minecraft, which released at a similar price, the level of functionality is far less. Though then again, the requisite functionality is far greater in the case of Towns. However, this game is flawed for a far simpler reason, it was released onto steam with no notice that it was an unfinished, alpha game -- I'm an alpha-player, I love to play and watch as a game evolves, and I am _more likely_ to purchase an alpha game than many non-alpha games. I know many of my friends feel the same way, but  this game released to steam (via Greenlight) purporting to be a fully-ready 1.0 release, and that's just not what it is.I say wait. Maybe get it if the price drops to the 2-5$ range. It has potential to be quite good, if the development continues, but everything about the more general practice smells of a smash and grab on my wallet, and I don't much care for it.Weak accept on potential, Strong Reject on Honesty.

												I'll keep this short, This game has a learning curve thats quite steep, and it will be about 3 games before you figure out the basics. By the time you have a thriving town that can sustain itself you'll feel very acomplished. Soon though, things stop being so rewarding. Your townies are irritating at best, they can die from starvation because they straded themself 2 blocks high wile building, or drown because their path took them into water. Your buildings will very quickly trade estetics for fuctionality, possibaly a gribe for someone only as perfectionist as myself. There is nothing really to do after you figured everything out, because besides for a stray orge or something random like that the challenge is gone.I'm not saying not to buy this game, if its on sale by all means buy it, the learning curve wile give you enough entirtainment at least. But, this game is buggy and unpolished, and updates are nearly non existant, so it is a risk.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought Towns on sale just over a year ago...in that time it has received a few updates and undergone some changes.  However, this does not change the fact that this game left an utterly appalling impression upon me not only with the game but with the people working on it.  The tutorials were shamefully unhelpful, the gameplay was unintuitive, and the art style was unique but lead to an overall crude feel due to the games clunky play.As time has passed I'd expected this game to get refined some and updated to assauge some of the issues I had...but to this date the progress has been glacially slow and it remains the same lump of an overcomplicated mess that it always was.  Perhaps I'm being overly spiteful given my own impressions, but I can't for the life of me find any redeeming features about this game after it has remained the same awful product for so long.It's possible that you might enjoy this game, but I would heartily advise in-depth research about it, if not choosing a different product outright.

												When I first bought Towns from their website I thought I was getting into an early production of a great game. Even though promised updates kept me optimistic I have since fallen from that high for this game. Now it is full of bugs, new stuff that causes more bugs, and absolutely no community updates on how or where the game is going next. If developers are going to give up on a game because it isnt worth it anymore, then drop it and stop ""earning"" profit from broken software.*shorter review*This game is a great example of lazy developers			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There were no refunds.There was no time.Only fire.And then nothing.These two devs had a chance to make something really truly cool and wasted it with petty nonsense, if you cruise the forums for even a minute you can see what I mean. No matter what they do at this point it will be too little too late, the worst of the ideas they have is to start working on a sequel because it would be easier to cut and run then actually fix things.

												In the current state, I would not recommend this game to anybody.When I got the game in the end of December 2012, the devs were updating it relatively frequently. It wasn't like they were releasing weekly or monthly updates. The game worked well for what it was. Then the updates dropped off.I realize this was a greenlight game. I view that similar to a kickstarter game that fails to deliver what was promised. This stuff happens. I got the $4.99 i paid for out of it. I don't know how much it costed to buy it when it was originally greenlit, but it was fair for what I paid. I've bought worse games for more money.Instead, check out Gnomoria.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Died in infancy, a failed product of Early Access.  What killed it?  Literally Steam Early Access.  This game sold pretty solidly for a bit before that, but when it was dubbed as being ""garbage"" by a majority of steam, it seems the devs lost interst in further developing it, and moved on.Sad, but true.  Other games seem to be following in it's foot-steps however, though less in the ""Failed and Abandoned"" way.  Stonehearth looks promising, as does Timber and Stone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally bought this with the thought of ""Woah cool, a town simulator!"" in my mind.  After all, the screenshots showed some very epic looking towns, and the game wasn't in the Early Access category. (meaning it wasn't an alpha/beta, but rather a full release)Boy was I in for a surprise.. and not the good kind.I can sum up this game in one single word - Awful.  There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.  I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away.  Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them.The game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs.  They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage.  There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears.  Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.Don't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.  These developers don't deserve any of your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But later it turns into more of a settlement sim. Building ok but i wish they woulden't of done the layer thing like DF it gets very tedious. UI is pretty hard to control too. AI is bad as well. this game needs a lot of updating but the team seams to be dead and not working on this any more. So yeah thats pretty much why i thumbed this one down.. :/ Had potential too.

I wanted it to be great, but between bugs, long periods with no updates or news from the developers, and a dying community (for good reason) I have to give up hope.This game was a great idea that was poorly done and evenly more poorly managed. At this point the game is unplayable for me and many others I talked to. The last update was months ago, and it was more broken than anything to date.Remember, this is still an alpha game, it can be fixed and I would love to change my review, however I don't want others on the steam community buying into a game that seems so hopeless.

												This game is not very good. It has lots of bugs and was never finished to a level that is worth playing for any extended period of time. I knew it wasn't finished when I got it and got it fairly cheap, because I wanted to try it and see where the developers would take the game, but I had hoped they would have add a few more features or improved the UI at least a bit more than this before completely abandoning it.

												I've mainly played this game in its 0.40a alpha build, 3 years ago.I can't lie this was a good game I enjoyed it a lot, updates were frequent and pretty good, until it went on Steam...The devs were probably working hard on this to build a good game at first, but once released on Steam, those massive cash flows probably corrupted their minds. Too bad for us, but also for the indie game community, it's a shame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really loved this game to start. I wanted it to be great, but between bugs, long periods with no updates or news from the developers, and a dying community (for good reason) I have to give up hope.This game was a great idea that was poorly done and evenly more poorly managed. At this point the game is unplayable for me and many others I talked to. The last update was months ago, and it was more broken than anything to date.Remember, this is still an alpha game, it can be fixed and I would love to change my review, however I don't want others on the steam community buying into a game that seems so hopeless.

												I like many i'm sure, bought this game because Sips played it. I'm not blaming Sips for anything here, i got enough fun out of it for the price i paid but that does not excuse the devs abandoning the game. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If it appears to be ""ok"" to put up a game on Early Access then abandon it because it's not selling as well as expected it will start happening a lot more. Lets tell them that this is NOT OK to do and WILL NOT be tolerated. Also, its really buggy and not at all worth 15 dollars or any of your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm extremely livid that they chose to walk away from this project. The idea was really cool, and I hadn't heard of anything like it, so I decided to buy it. The menus were pretty bad, and it was annoying to build anything. The tutorials were terrible as well. I stopped playing it because I was hoping that it would eventually become finished with a nice and polished menu to build your town. I hadn't seen an update in so long that I forgot I even had the game. I do not wish to ever do business with the developers after this, and I will be very careful with which games I choose to buy and greenlight from now on. Hopefully Valve will help their customers avoid situations like this in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a patron of Minecraft, I very much enjoyed musing the idea of having multiple people placing the blocks, especially in the form of a functioning town rather than a purely aesthetic one. Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not. Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.In conclusion this game was greenlit with the hopes of it being grown, expanded and ultiamtely polished. Here is how it looks. Greenlit - September 11th, 2012Last Monthly Update - September 21th, 2013Date of Review - June 24th, 2014It has been nearly a year to the date of this review since anything signficant was changed and it will be a surprise to see another.

												Game was disappointing and unfinished when I bought it, but there was a promise of ""will be further updated later"". Apparently the developer has now abandoned the game, leaving it half finished. Complete rip-off; there is no way this should be on sale without an ""Early Access"" tag, and seeing as it will now likely never be finished it is difficult to see how even that would be fair advertising. Buggy, unbalanced, and with many obvious missing features; it compares badly with many games currently available in the same genre, many cheaper and some free.Current price is £9.99, which is insane- almost twice the current price of Gnomoria. Might be worth 10% of that as a brief diversion, but frankly anything more than ""free"" is probably a waste.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly, if you're reading this and are into games like this, go, right now, and buy Gnomoria.Towns is interesting and fun, but the support from devs isn't there anymore and if you're going to spend your money, you should put it towards people who actually stick with their games.

												This game was a lot better in older versions. Now the game is confusing and  a lot more complicated. I can't understand it at all for I am used to different gameplay for it. It was worth buying in older versions, but now buying it is just like throwing money into a fire.			",31,13,0,6,19,2,5

												By general standard this is not a ""complete game""Graphic of this game is....let's say retro.AI in this game is poor.Last update v14 was released in September, 2013. V13 was released in May, 2013. The changes that was implemeneted in these patches contains very few contents and minimun bug fixes. It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""Heroes don't need jack. All it takes to attract heroes is to boost your population and have an area set up as ""tavern"". The ""tavern"" area doesn't have to be enclosed. Meaning that heores will be perfectly fine sleeping on the ground looking at stars just because you painted a 3x3 block purple and called it ""inn"".There is no intereaction between your townsfolk and heroes at all. They have very poor AI and die very easily if you are new to the game. Gearing up these heroes is not an easy process and sometimes random. You need to put the items on their path or ""hangout"" area and hope that they pick up the gear you want them to wear. ""Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.""The only RPG elements involved in the dungeons is ""there are mobs, they drop loot"". The only strategic aspect of the game is ""pray to the gods that when you dig down, you don't dig directly into a group of mobs because your townsfolk are dumb and they will not flee"" and ""dig open dungeon walls bit by bit and hope your townsfolk don't try to engage the mobs""There is minimun strategy and minimun RPG elements in this game. Townsfolk has a hunger bar, a sleep bar and a happiness bar and that's it. There is no ""leveling"" for your townsfolk and leveling for heores is meaningless.""Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!""Like stated above, there is no interactions between you and the heroes. About the loots, here's the funny part. Once you clear a dungeon, it's best not to collect loot from the dungeon because there's a billion of trash loot lying on the ground. Heroes will pick up gears when they feel like it. It's best to leave those in the dungeon.The best loot is often not dropped in the dungeon. Once you have a market set up, travelling merchants will come and they will randomly sell you the best gear in the game. So in order to get the best loot in game, you priorites a market over anything else. Regardless your progression in the game, you will be able to buy best gears purely based on luck.""Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!""Mobs in the dungeon will come to your town only when a hero engages them with low health and decides to run away. Those mobs will not stop chasing the fleeing hero until one of them is dead. This normally leads to a few townies dying because of the poorly designed AI. There is nothing unique about the weapon and item designs. They are very generic items. I wouldn't describe loots to be ""randomized"". 90% of them are trash loots and 99% of them are just junk on the ground waiting to be sold when a merchant arrives (if that merchant has enough money and willing to buy these crap. normally they just don't want them at all).In summary, this game is not worth its asking price. Yes, it's about the price of a very fancy subway sandwitch in Canada but I assure you that you will get more satisfaction out of that sandwitch than this game. If you are desprately looking for a game like this, wait for it to go on sale and do not expect any updates because it's not very likely. There is a modding scene for this game. It's small and I suggest you to go to their forum and check out more information there. Simply google ""towns"" and you'll be able to access their website and forum. Thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: May 12, 2014
												The game is broken.  Bottem line.Its hard to describe because the game WAS (the devs gave up once they got the $) getting patched so broken things were removed... and then new broken things were added in but here is a list of what I found the most broken.1. Building is not fun.  There is no easy copy and paste for buildings.  And if there is, then it is hidden under the games terrible interface.  It can take a lot of effort of placing certain building blocks in certain orders to build a house with the clunky building controls.  But then if you have to do it at least 20 more times if you want to get townies.  It can take a while.2.  The interface is horrible.  The labels are off.  It just felt clunky.  First you have to click one menu button, then you have to click a sub menu button and find what you want.  Then if its something like wheat and you want it to be bread you have to go into more menus and submenus to find what you want.  The bread making tools and blocks should all be on the same page not scattered around.3.  Your villagers are idiots.  They have no clue how to do anything without dieing.  Horrible monsters attacking?  Don't worry, your villagers will just stand there and die instead of running.  Sometimes they run indoors but most of the time go around doing what they normally do.  Their are even some maps with randomly wandering enemys, I dont have a problem with that but they do it so poorly in Towns.  In the snow maps one stray yeti can just wander on over and kill EVERYONE.  Also they will run though hell and back...to get stone.  I have seen them go on some brave runs just to get a basic resource.  You got to give them credit.  They will stop are nothing to drag that junk back to the stockpile... even if they all die in the process.4.  The monsters that attack your village come out of THIN AIR.  You would think they would come from any dungeon entrances you have but they seem to pop out of midair at times.  5.  Monsters are either really OP or really easy.  I watched a guard kill five slimes once.  Then I watched three guards with iron gear just get massacred by ONE wearpig. (Which is actually a common enemy.  Any normal pig could be a wearpig.)  6.  Hero's are broken.  I must have done EVERYTHING I could think of to attract a hero.  They never come.  They are broken.  That or the system is terrible.  Either way the game dosen't explain things and after browsering the web for a while I still can't get damn Heros.  Worst part is.  You need heros to clear dungeons, but you can never get them it seems.7  The way you make your townies happy is stupid.  They mainly get happy from eating.  Problem is, if you have food that fills them up a lot and dosen't make them eat as often.  YOU GET PUNISHED.  I actally tested this at one point by making bread fill 1500%.  Sure enouth happyness dropped to zero because they were not eating.   You can do a few other things like have badger fights (which seem broken) and put decorations but it seems food is what they want the most.  So remember, just spam cakes.  Anything that actually fills their stomachs is bad.  They don't want to be full.  THey want to be hungry.  Makes zero sense.    8.  Last thing I am going to mention is the dungeons...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It seems I can't dig down at all without hititng a dungeon on most map.s  I just wan't some stone but the game shoves the dungeons everywhere.  They cover the whole map when they should be deep underground and have SMALL entrances.    Now things may have changed since I wrote this but this is what I encountered when I played the game.  And maybe some of the issues I mentioned have easy fixes but there is a problem...THE GAME SHOULD EXPLAIN IT THEN.  There is no tutorial.  Well there claims to be one but it just starts you off on fixed map without telling you much.  You have to find the message log and it tells you to do basic stuff.  Nice they have one at all but it never explains the fine details of the game.  Just the basic crude that I could probably figure out just by expermenting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Check the Official Forums, keep an eye out for developments or any news pertaining to this and if you see nothing new in the coming months (development with the new programmer starts in March, and this guy seems to really want to take the game forward), then I'd turn away and never look back.Then again, there is a good possibility that should things not go according to plan with this new programmer, that this game will go Open Source anyway, at which point you'll be paying £10 for some DRM and an older version of the game :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a patron of Minecraft, I very much enjoyed musing the idea of having multiple people placing the blocks, especially in the form of a functioning town rather than a purely aesthetic one. Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not. Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.In conclusion this game was greenlit with the hopes of it being grown, expanded and ultiamtely polished. Here is how it looks. Greenlit - September 11th, 2012Last Monthly Update - September 21th, 2013Date of Review - June 24th, 2014It has been nearly a year to the date of this review since anything signficant was changed and it will be a surprise to see another.

												I don't have much to say about the gameplay of this game since I gave up on it a couple of months earlier, for it's buggy, controls are tedious, often gives you literally instant death starts, and the graphics are just outright horrendous, reminiscent of cheap point-and-click adventure games. And most importantly - the developers gave up too. It has been at least five full months since the latest update. When you flood the market with thousands of greenlit indie, early access games, there're bound to be duds. I understand that this game was still early in development when I got it and things indeed might turn sour since life is so unpredictable, but it's still so frustrating that what you bought at a real game's price suddenly went silent with updates without giving any real explanation beforehand.For all intents and purposes we could say that this game is effectively dead now. Consider getting Gnomoria if you liked this game's concept, it's currently in active development and even though the dev ""team"" seems to be just one man, he (or she?) at least gives consistent weekly updates with real content and interacts with players regularly.

												The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.  Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.You start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.One good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder.

												This game had so much potential. I put a lot of hours into building several towns. While I would not necessarily call this 'abandonware' just yet as there have been updates, the feeling is that it's been put so far on the backburner that we will never see a completed product or, by the time we do, what will be the point? Something better or newer will come out to take it's place.The developer insisted that the product is playable upon time of release, after Early Access was terminated. While the game was playable, the words were decieiving. A playable game should not be released if there are still countless bugs to be fixed and several key features that have not been added to the game.It's such a shame, because the game had great potential and an idea for a somewhat unique mechanic. But I can't recommend this game to anyone, unless you are looking for examples of how a good concept can go bad, learn the idea, and take time to figure out how to improve upon it with your own game. Even if the developer would fix the bugs and implement all originally discussed and intended features as described, I just have no faith in the developer and this game anymore.R.I.P. Towns.

												The idea of this game is kind of cool.  Unfortunatly that is all this game really is, an idea.  There are a lot of unfinished game-play mechancis. you know, interesting ideas, that just do not go anywhere.For the most part, you start a town, get your food production going and then you need to attract heros to clear out the gaint dungeon undernearth your town.  So what do you end up doing with most of your time once you get past the startup phase?You just watch the heroes bumble around and try and clear out one level of the dungeon.  And when they are done with that?  You just get to watch them do the same thing on the next level.  Thats all you do. Oh sure, you can build stuff for the sake of building stuff, like a garden or place decortave statues, but something really useful?  No.My reccomendation is to NOT buy this game.  Maybe in a few years the game-play will be fleshed out more, but right now, there isn't much, if any, of a game here.			",173,37,0,73,40,0,75

												I really loved this game and got it way back before it was on steam or even greenlight. I was excited by all the updates and look forward to them fixing the AI with the towny's (cuz they could be just dumb sometimes).  I haven't played in a long time and came back hoping for new development only to find out it was abandoned b/c of burnout in May2014. What a shame, I paid my money to support the project and  it's sad that it will not even get to beta. The main Towns website and forums are down now. I would have given this a hearty thumbs up but must vote no. Tired of getting taken from developers promising something great, showing the potential but never coming through aka Cubeworld and many others.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I so wanted to see this game finished. As it stands, there are far too many bugs in it and the AI periodically commits suicide doing dumb stuff forcing you to repetitively micro manage everything. Imagine the old sims games where you had to tell your sims to go to the bathroom or they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants, now imagine the old sims games where you had to micro manage 50 sims spreadout in a ridiculously huge area trying to click on them to each tell them to go take a♥♥♥♥♥♥before they♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants.I dunno where I am going with this, all I know is that the devs have abandoned the game and are treating all the paying customers like absolutely garbage. The game's AI is god awful and lots of seemingly simple things have repetitive and/or unnecessarily time-consuming or drawn-out ways of doing things and you will spend majority of your time making sure your AI don't kill themselves by being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The micro management doesn't only involve the AI, just controlling your resources is a massive headache. As a person who has programmed several Unity games, one of them ended up with 2 million plays, I have absolutely no idea what possessed the developer to take this game in such a sensely complex direction. I can understand that not all game programmers are 'game designers' and are incapable of seeing the flaws in their design, but♥♥♥♥♥♥at least run it by a friend who can give you honest feedback. This game went horribly wrong at the beginning and the dev likely abandoned it due to needing to spend too much work redoing 90% of the game to make it actually make sense.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tons of promise, but painfully unfinished. Missing key mechanics and what is there is so buggy as to make the game frustrating. Towns was also abandoned by its developers in the beginning of May, so the game will never be fixed. BEWARE AND DO NOT BUY.			",339,124,5,53,41,5,80

												If Gabe were as awesome as we'd like to believe, he'd give us a $15 voucher for another game. The best analogy I can come up with:Gaben is a wealthy pharmacist. He knows his job is to acquire new prescriptions for his large community. Now, there are so many new drugs coming out every day, that Gaben has to ask his community, ""What new drugs should we offer at the pharmacy?""The community heard some neat things about this Townsicol, a do-everything drug. Gaben can only assume that his community knows what they want, even though they don't often know how to get the information about the pharmaceutical companies that made the drug, at least not as profieciently as Gaben. The people assure Gaben that yes, we want Townsicol in the pharmacy!So Gaben orders Townsicol, even though it hasn't gone through proper FDA qualifications.The people buy up their prescriptions of their new drug and GOSH! IT TASTES AWFUL! OH GOD! IT'S GIVEN ME DYSENTERY! WHY GA-BGLALARBGB-BEN WHY-ARHGBLARBL?!But Gaben, watching his customers launch projectile vomit at one another, is distressed. He feels bad for his customers, but THEY ASKED FOR THIS. He brought it in as a special order and the man that sold it to him has completely disappeared like some peddler pushing snake oil! Worse, there are those, like yours truly, that watched everyone throw up, walked through that lake of vomit, waded to the counter in all the puke they had expelled, and bought a bottle of Townsicol for themselves.TL;DR game's bad; developers ran with the money; don't buy it, ♥♥♥♥♥.

Ok, let's be clear here, I did love this game... only because it had this mechanic you can abuse to get more villagers in towns in the before time, I think this game could be better if it WASN'T SO ♥♥♥♥ING HARD AND REPETITIVE I mean, seriously, all you ♥♥♥♥ing doing is watching you people gather♥♥♥♥♥♥ and watching them die, I did love this game... and some, SOME enjoyment is credible... but is highly unlikely, being no objective, which... is most indie games... I can't really hate on that point... but I CAN HATE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE GAME. Ok... lemme... press enter and see what I should hate about first... hmm...Ok, if you ever played, watched gameplay, or... idk, ♥♥♥♥ing heard the sound track you've noticed that it ♥♥♥♥ing loops, and it's soooooo uninteresting, I mean, seriously, you have a annoying and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ track that ♥♥♥♥ING LOOPS, and no, that's not the worst part.The worst part is the A.I, it's like ""Oh, I'm low on health, I should just keep fighting the monster"" instead of just running away, Oh, and you wanna know the funny thing? THE HEROS FLEE, NOT THE CIVILIANS! the heros have apprently honored in Flight or fight class... The one thing that is super dumb that I find is... why did the remove that mechanic? I mean... ugh...

												This game is addictive and has so much potential to be great, but right when you start asking yourself where this game has been all your life, something bugs, or glitches, or you can't do something in the game that seems obvious.  I bought this game in beta and was excited to see how it would come out.  I guess I bought it on the last update, because there have been no more and now I hear that this game has been dropped from production.  I am dissapointed in the devs for throwing out what could be a potential classic, and I'm mad at steam for selling me a game that is still being made, then allowing the game to stop.  I had fun with it and if anything I think the modding community will pick up where the devs left off and give this game the polish it deserves.  I had fun with it and I tend to play it for days straight then don't play it for months then give it a few days again.  I would only reccomend this game if you are into modding, otherwise save your money because it is far from perfect, yet close, but at some times it's not even good, if that makes any sense.

												Pending an Edit, I might change this in the future.This game has great potential, but it all fades after about 20hrs of gameplay.The early learning curve of the game is very steep. Infact, since there is no ingame help of any kind, you will be going to the internet to figure out some mechanics of this game.Villager path finding is always shortest route, regardless of danger. Hostile NPC's do have random and specific spawns, but more often then not I feel they are hunting me down.Building is somewhat confusing till you get the hang of it. The only drawback is, if you don't build in small sections the game seems to hang on larger designs. The same goes for most the resource managment. Even after giving out specific jobs, and setting priority's all my villagers do is eat and sleep.Fact is, this game has loads of pontential. But fails to deliver. At best this feels like an Alpha Version of a game.I do not recommend this game.			",57,4,3,8,15,0,8

												Interesting. Where did all the reviews go? Wow. Starting on a blank slate here, maybe?Let's be honest: The premise of Towns is as quirky as it is unique: You build a fantasy town OVER a monster-filled dungeon, so that heroes will come and explore said dungeon- and with your town being endared by the monsters but at the same time able to provide important services to the heroes the game clearly has a tongue-in-cheek approach to both town-building and fantasy tropes in general.Let's be honest: This is an early access game. So you can expect it isn't done yet. It allows you to build a diverse range of buildings and services, and heroes do occasionally pop up and do their thing, and yes, there are monsters.And that is the catch, the premise is really interesting but at this stage, the features that are in don't make for a very interesting game.

												This is a game that, as of yet, still has great potential. I worry, however, about the direction things are heading, based on the previous few updates adding some fluff (buried towns?) rather than refining core gameplay. I definitely enjoyed Towns at first. However, there are still other games doing the things that Towns tries to do, and doing them better. At the end of the day I think that I got my money's worth. It doesn't have any huge complications in further development from what I know (Unlike Godus's need to scrap in-game purchases) and I think that this game can still improve.-=-=-=-=-REVIEW EDIT: Not too long after I wrote this the game imploded. Don't buy it.			",23,5,0,10,15,0,4

												This game is so painful to play, there's nothing enjoyable about it - except for the minute amount of space it takes up on my computer. The tutorials are terrible, the game is buggier than a hobo's mattress and you'll only learn to 'play' this 'game' through the agonising trial and error. Not RECOMMENDED in the slightest. Luckily I bought it when it was 66% off..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was one of the first games picked by the Greelight community, and it seemed to have a lot of potential. But 2 years later, every hope i had for this game is now dead and buried, since the developer first abandoned it, then sold it to a third-party-dev, who abandoned it again. Playing it feels like playing an Early-Access game, and a lot of important fetures are either incomplete or missing. If you really have 12€ to spare and want to weep over the games former bright future, don't buy it. Support some other developer who will use the money to finish their game, instead of trying to sell the unfinished first part to develop a second part (which you will be charged for a second time).

												I really wanted to like this game, i purchased it relatively early during the greenlight craze. It was sold then as early alpha with frequent updates and continued improvement. That has not been the case. I would be very surprised if all the impressive pictures you see in the screen shots arent staged. Other games on steam do this genre much better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have lost all hope for this game.  I won’t argue anything about the initial release.  This game, overall, feels like a never ending chore of keeping villagers alive without the meaningful ability to micromanage functions of the game.  If it were not for modding, I would declare this game as being unworthy of disk space.  If you are unsure about purchasing this game simply look at some objective reviews on this game, and its forums.In short, ""Would not recommend"". ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is fun and simple. With a Minecraft feel town, you mine resources to build, feed, and dig. The thing that really hurts this game is the lack of udates from the devs. The base game will hold you for awhile, but then the frustration due to the lack of variety will settle in, and the game will get dull.

Alpha?... Kind/try of Beta?... version of the game.That said, the actual devs are still trying to fix the MESS of the game´s code, what is taking an entire human age. Specially because they are getting negative profits and this is more a charge than a work for them (and I could say they are doing this only because they are mad, or they truely love the game).Don´t expect an update soon...

												Oh how I wish I didn't have to give this game a negative review. I can tell, that this game, if it were to be finished, would be a game I'd cherish. The aspect of this game, the functionality, the rpg/sandbox/strategy elements of this game are all my cup of tea when it comes to PC games. Unfortunately, I cannot give this ""would be"" game the approval for others to invest their time and money into. Every feature this game has to offer is unfinished and unpolished. Perhaps because there was a lot of tweaking and additional content planned for this game that have yet to be implemented. I really hope this game isn't dead for good, but it has dug itself into a rut with its massive amounts of negative reviews. I cannot disagree with them.

												The game, as is, isn't a very good game. It hasn't received an update since last year and I'm very doubtful it will receive another. The gameplay as of current is unneccesary complicated and boring. The game suffers from a couple of shortcomings the players has to avoid and build around.When I bought it years ago I thought it was a pretty cool idea for a game - but that's what it'll remain! A cool idea.			",116,37,2,41,38,0,49

												This game was one of the first games picked by the Greelight community, and it seemed to have a lot of potential. But 2 years later, every hope i had for this game is now dead and buried, since the developer first abandoned it, then sold it to a third-party-dev, who abandoned it again. Playing it feels like playing an Early-Access game, and a lot of important fetures are either incomplete or missing. If you really have 12€ to spare and want to weep over the games former bright future, don't buy it. Support some other developer who will use the money to finish their game, instead of trying to sell the unfinished first part to develop a second part (which you will be charged for a second time).

												As it is this is not a game you want to spend more than $5 or less on. If you are looking to spend a long time building and making slow or no progress this is it. There are a few tricks to pick up that allows you to actually achieve some progress but due to the programming allowing your townies to starve because they have traveled to far, or gotten themselves stuck its still a slow and frustrating game. I keep hoping that the developers will adress some of these issues and still nothing. The food issue is the worst as you can do nothing to adjust for it, once you go into the ground mining and exploring your townies will die and fast. The values for food and sleep run down to swiftly, and outside of stopping your townies from digging completely you can not keep them from entering the depths where once you go ten levels down they die from starvation. Some of the tools are intriguing, and fun to play with as long as you refrain from going past -10 in digging. Once you come to terms with these drawbacks its a fun little game. Oh yea to clear out the monsters in the dungeons you do get heros yet they are completely random and you must account for them as being three population wise thats how hard they hit your food supply. There is so much potential in this game and it is sad to see it left so broken. If given an overall score for entertainment, novelty, and playability at best its a 3 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game was supposed to be in development. sold 200K times and there where some updates. There are still allot of bugs and there is functionality missing. AI can be a big stupid and walk around for minutes before finding the way.The game can be fun for a couple of hours but its not worth it. The developer has stopped developed because he finds he did enough work for the millions of dollars he has made....1/10 wont recommend			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BUYER BEWAREThis game is not a finished product, although all patching and further development has been completely abandoned. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE. There are far better titles out there (See: Gnomoria and/or Banished) That are still being improved.The Tutorial explains next to nothing aside from the VERY basics, the UI feels odd at best and at times needlessly tedious. Many players have expressed practically being FORCED to go through online guide after online guide just to understand how this or that works. There is also currently a petition on the forums for this game demanding a refund.			",242,57,4,68,94,4,87

												Short story. What began as a cute little game with a bright future ended in tragedy when the developers gave us a brief 'fu*k you' ceased work. The game now lies, broken, forgotten, in the depths of my library.NB** Yes, this game is in fact, quite broken. That said, if you happen to see it on sale for $5 or less, perhaps grab it for a few hours of entertainment. Otherwise, steer clear.			",65,19,0,28,17,0,24

												Pros: Building your town one block at a time is good fun, and exploring the random environments is enjoyable,Cons: It contains a ""happiness"" mechanic that rewards you for not playing and -- annoyingly -- forces you to leave the game running on its own for long periods in order to advance well.Certainly worth a look, but lacks the long-term appeal of Terraria.

												I´ve voted ""No, i do not recommend this game"" but i really would like to say: ""Yes!""Why? This game really gave me some good time, cause i like the freedom in which you're able to build up a town, the retroish graphics and the possibility to alter the game due editing some xml files. Unfortunately the problems start right there: Since the engine limits the world to a 64*64 cube, you have to choose between dungeon roaming and building high up in the air, when altering the world generation (only a change in values). Last one is my favorite playstyle... or: would be, if the engine would not getting annoyingly laggy with more than 12 surface leves. There seem to be too many transparent blocks which affects the game as soon as you are giving more than two orders to your Townies. So, i am just not able to build high buildings without having a second lag, a second none, a second lag, a sec.. you get it. And that ""really grinds my gears"".Also, the menu is crap and the tutorial basically only explains how to move your mouse from left to right and bottom to top. Furthermore, there are some serious bugs, which are a total pain in the a**. Check out the Community Hub's discussion to get an idea of them, it is a long list.And yes, the devs spoofed those who bought this game, cause updates came in irregularily, were minor and the communication to us customers is worth mentioning.At the moment rumors say the devs are looking for someone new to heritage this project. We´ll see.After all Towns is a perfect example for everything which could go wrong with Steam's Greenlight/Early Access policy (or which mechanism else failed).I recommend to keep this game in mind, check for updates and buy it when the ♥♥♥♥♥torm moves on.

												This game is full of bugs, its been out for awhile and its obvious that it will never be fixed and it is not promising in anyway. if the gameplay wasnt buggy it still would be a grind looking up tutorials on wiki because the tutorials in game just give you basic instructions that you dont know how to do. It is unfinished overpriced and should be free to play at this point. dont buy this game it is a waste of money and trying to actually get a town running will result in bugs crashes and a grind just to get 1 building in your world. if you do buy it you wasted your money like I did.

												Bought this game with the hopes of a decent more visual version of a Dwarf Fortress style game. Instead it's a fairly unplayable, boring mess. The main focus, settlement building, controls horribly and is far from enjoyable. This game is a chore rather than a joy. Now that development has stopped and it will forever remain an unfinished mess I feel cheated out of my money, although since it wasn't sold as officially being early access I suppose I share the blame there. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.			",117,26,0,15,16,0,36

												I followed Towns before it ever came to Steam. Back then, the two guys working on it were releasing updates pretty regularly, and the basic gameplay evolved on a monthly basis. Then they broke up or had a falling out, or perhaps just got bored of working on this project, and quit rather suddenly. There wasn't any official word this was happening: the updates just sort of stopped coming out. This game is dead for no better reason than they didn't want to work on it anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												(Game has been abandoned by the developers at what feels like late alpha / early beta)I haven't really read any of the other reviews, except a quick glance at some of the positives, as I don't want mine to be influenced by them in any way. I will note that many of the positive reviews seem to be accidental recommendations, and Steam needs to remove that as the default option :PSo.. Towns. Well it's a decent base for a game, and I generally enjoyed the parts of it which worked properly, but that's really where it ends. If you try, you can perhaps push 20 hours or so out of the game, but ultimately the bugs and complete lack of content and polish will leave you despairing at the developers, who have abandoned this game.The screenshots paint a pretty picture of flourishing towns and wonderful defenses, but it doesn't really apply to a real game, and you'll find yourself becoming frustrated at how fiddly everything is and how face-palmingly unintelligent the AI is, being almost unable to self regulate their most basic requirements. They almost seem suicidal.. but given the state of the game, I won't hold it against them.Ultimately what you see in the screenshots is pretty much everything, and at it's unlikely best (visually). I strongly resent paying full price for games being brought to market which are late alpha/early beta, especially when the developers dump them and run off with the money because they don't really feel like doing it anymore. That's theft where I come from. I don't think the game was officially an 'Early Access' game? Just Greenlight perhaps, but either way I won't be buying a game until it's fully released from now on, and I wish Steam would pull this game off the store and stop putting it on sale. It's a skeleton of a game and will never be more than that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really wanted to like this game, but I just can't.The concepts were sound, but the graphics/interface/interaction just aren't there. I played for a while, but felt unfulfilled by progress.   I know it's a sandbox game, but maybe a bit of a story would have been nice, or perhaps some rewards for reaching certain achievements, or...?Going to put this on the proverbial shelf, perhaps it'll get better in time.

												Hey guys, i'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥like you are about this and I for one will not stand for it. this game was sold promising updates until a final release version that embodied their vision was delivered. Steam is not liable for the developers actions. the devs are responcible and should be held accountable. I prepose a petition to the Devs for ether a reasonalbe completion of their product fullfilling their promises, or a full refund. we all have recipts from steam for our purchase.https://www.facebook.com/xavicanal This is the devs Facebook page. I recomend we all send him our recipts asking for a refund or to fullfil his promise. if enough people do it we can't be ignored. we should react accordingly to his response of our demands.

YetiChow, the moderator on the forum deletes all forms of critique against the game (For that matter he also mods the steam forum).The devs are quiet, they have spoken more of the game on other forums during the last years. A lot of news regarding the game has come in the form of posts dropped on these other forums. the list goes on. They even tried to trick a poor dev into quitting his job and working full time on the game (which I think he actually did), but as the hut was already burning, he got in big financial problems and had to quit.I give it a NO			",105,46,1,31,22,1,11

												First off, this game is the embodiment of early access games gone wrong. It's terrible when developers don't deliver on every promise, because this game had a lot of potential.That said, the game you see now is complete and wont see any future updates. It is very difficult and takes a long time to progress, which is good. There is definitely replay value as well. The one thing I hate most about this game is how the levels work when you're trying to build everything.Tl;dr- It's good as-is,  but the developer is terrible, so buy it at a discount when you can.

												I would not recommend this game to the ones who burned my village and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my family. The tale of this game tells of crimes bigger than those committed during the genocide of Rwanda. YetiChow, the moderator on the forum deletes all forms of critique against the game (For that matter he also mods the steam forum).The devs are quiet, they have spoken more of the game on other forums during the last years. A lot of news regarding the game has come in the form of posts dropped on these other forums. the list goes on. They even tried to trick a poor dev into quitting his job and working full time on the game (which I think he actually did), but as the hut was already burning, he got in big financial problems and had to quit.I give it a NO			",105,46,1,31,22,1,11

												Towns is one of my favorite settlement building games, and I  have played over 200 hrs.  It's in depth and challenging but sadly ragged around the edges. The developer abandoned the game a couple of years ago so it will never get finished, but it is still playable, as long as you don't mind not having an end game. It's hard to pick up, difficult to master, but still very satisfying to build a working, living settlement.			",40,12,1,7,27,0,3

												This game was supposed to be the second coming of Minecraft and Dwarf Fortress combined. Some kinda chosen one child that was suppose to become the next big thing. The developer has done nothing.It's noteable for being one of the first greenlit games ever and I suppose in a history context of steam that's interesting.

												tl;dr - Game is abandoned and overpriced, but if you pick it up for $5 you get your money's worth and have a new game to spend some weekend afternoons playing.Years ago, this game was fun. Nothing in this game hadn't been done before, but it brought a lot of things together in an enjoyable package, and new content was being brought out that added facets to the idea of managing a town catering to adventurers and trying to survive the dangers of a D&D world. Now, the game is exactly the same. That's the problem; the end of Towns' beta came purely because the dev wanted more sales for less work.It's really too bad that the development of this game became something of a hot potato due to fewer sales than the original developer wanted. Towns was developing in an interesting direction, and at the end of the updates had started introducing some enjoyably complicated ways to use basic water channels to make tasks easier. However, it never got to a fully mature stage, instead slowly petering out with updates being smaller and much less often. Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most. Something to stick on the wishlist and pick up during a steam sale.

The game is unfinished and he has no plans to even attempt to finish it. Instead he added more to the tutorial instead of fixing the horribly broken AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												From initial release the dev team of this game has mislead customers on Steam.  Initally it was released as a complete and playable version.  However, it hadn't hit it's full version number in beta yet.  The UI was terribly implemented, the pathing, AI, inclusion of god hand mechanics to work around lazy coding problems, and a plethora of truly unproffessional issues plagued the game.  To top it all off, there wasn't a patch for almost 4 months after release.  Last December the Dev threatened to quit the game and then quickly changed his mind during the holiday sale.  Since that initial release there has only been 5 patches of minimal consequence to ongoing issues of the game - in fact trying to add features to an already broken game has caused even more problems than before.Even though now that the Store Page has been updated to read, ""Towns is continually being developed and updated to bring you the best experience possible,"" it simply isn't.  You can go months with zero dev updates on their work.  Patches are released up to 5 months period in between patches.  None of the prior mechanics implementations have been fixed.  And now the dev is saying he is trying to hire another coder.....The owner of this game is a self admitted full time employee of another company.  He has said on more than one occasion that they can't keep up with updates cause they have to work their jobs.  Don't support a game where the devs are not committed to it.  Let it die, and perhaps some of the more fanatic fans can take the code and do something legitimate with it.			",344,125,6,75,45,5,86

												Towns has a wonderful idea but the devs abandoned it. Here are two games that are pretty much better versions of towns (Not Copies, just better)1. Timber and Stone: The lesser of the two but still a good game with a better combat system for those people who want to fight more enemies >:D2. Stonehearth: Stonehearth is (In my opinion) the gem with good graphics and a nice city building style. You will still be harrased but less so than in Timber and Stone but they will be changing that soon.			",54,6,0,15,12,0,12

												First of all, I have to say that the game has been abandoned leaving a lot of things unfinished, missing objects, UI and gameplay important changes that we'll never see... It's a pity since it was a very promising project. Despite of this, I've been playing enough hours to say that the game is playable, especially if you watch some gameplay videos before, as the game has no tutorials. You should know this before spending money, as you won't get a finished game with no bugs. For me, the 12$ I payed for the game gave me a lot of hours of fun, being worthy in terms of entertainment. Said all this, I recommend to try it if you see a nice discount, as it's only a game in development.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, Towns, as the game is no longer in development. Yes it is a hefty price to pay. But, i have played the ggame for around 111 hours, and still have not gotten close to finishing a game. I Self tought myself from my failures, and still love this game. Learning about the game from Old Sips playthroughs, i could still recommend Towns, because its still fun. Sure its not going to be updated any further. But its a nice break from the more advanced Prison Arch. and Rimworld, etc. etc.. It adds the difficulty that  like. Now thi coming from somebodys thats been with the game for years, and particurly likes the genre, and feel. If you love these types of games, you can still get some fun out of it. Though if your deciding between this game or one thats still updating, and can only choose one. Well thats obvious. But hey spare money. Do it.			",26,7,0,4,13,0,9

												This game was Super fun, Addicting, and Great for a graphical version of Dwarven Fortress Lite. However I can NOT reccomend this game no matter how many hours I've put into it. In fact I will be requesting a refund from steam after this review. This is a green lit alpha game. Most of us bought it before even then. It had LOADS of potential. Sadly here is why I say don't buy it. THE DEV'S HAVE ABANDONED THIS GAME! After making loads of money off the prospect of a finished title. The programer has gone off to ""Work on another title they are making."" Well thanks for telling me not to buy that one either. Finish what you start. That is the mantra that should be followed. There are Many other games that are better. However this game had soul... until it was abandoned. They aren't going to release it a freeware either. ""Because he may come back to it."" Sorry I don't think people would have supported NOTCH if he stopped in the  middle of minecraft.  Currently they are looking for another ""Java Programmer"" but they've been looking for 3 months now. No telling how long before they told us. No I WILL NOT support a game that is abandoned half way through production.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, I have to say that the game has been abandoned leaving a lot of things unfinished, missing objects, UI and gameplay important changes that we'll never see... It's a pity since it was a very promising project. Despite of this, I've been playing enough hours to say that the game is playable, especially if you watch some gameplay videos before, as the game has no tutorials. You should know this before spending money, as you won't get a finished game with no bugs. For me, the 12$ I payed for the game gave me a lot of hours of fun, being worthy in terms of entertainment. Said all this, I recommend to try it if you see a nice discount, as it's only a game in development.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, Towns, as the game is no longer in development. Yes it is a hefty price to pay. But, i have played the ggame for around 111 hours, and still have not gotten close to finishing a game. I Self tought myself from my failures, and still love this game. Learning about the game from Old Sips playthroughs, i could still recommend Towns, because its still fun. Sure its not going to be updated any further. But its a nice break from the more advanced Prison Arch. and Rimworld, etc. etc.. It adds the difficulty that  like. Now thi coming from somebodys thats been with the game for years, and particurly likes the genre, and feel. If you love these types of games, you can still get some fun out of it. Though if your deciding between this game or one thats still updating, and can only choose one. Well thats obvious. But hey spare money. Do it.			",26,7,0,4,13,0,9

												Got this game back when it was still alpha, for very cheap. Knowing it was alpha, and browsing the forums, the game was a very fun experience. There were contests, and a bunch of good spirited discussion, etc. I definitely had my moneys worth of enjoyment from this game. Sadly, devs started delaying new updates, kept cutting out parts of the game that were promised, and eventually ""settled"" that the game was finished in the current state, which let me tell you, is not even close to what it should be. From that point the game left its ""alpha status"", apparently went through a very short beta period, and it released here on Steam (I only have little time with the game here on steam, because I played a lot of the standalone version). Like it was a full game or something...The rest is history now, but in case you don't know, it goes something like this: The general public in steam find that the game is really lackluster for a full game, and complain. Devs promise to improve, despite insisting that the game is complete. At some point one of the devs simply disappears without warning. After some time, the guy reappears, saying that he had problems and he couldn't deal with the pressure the players put on him, or something of the sort... and promises to try and get back on the game again. Never heard of him since then...The game as it stands still has a ton of balance issues, incomplete features, and despite that I really enjoyed my time with the game, I doubt anyone can really enjoy it as it is today. The promise of future improvements and the community is what made the game fun, other than that I admit that it was pretty mediocre. I advise that noone buys this game, if anything to keep their moral integrity and not fund half-baked abandoned projects. If you still wanna buy it, at least be aware of what it is.Thanks for reading,Jon_jon13, self proclaimed ""watergineer"".			",131,42,0,28,26,2,42

Yes there are bugs and missing mechanics but it is still very fun. I dont regret getting it a bit. I wish they had finished it or released the code but for what it is, it is still worth it.

												The game had so much potential, it was going great and was really popular. Towns was on the buggy side, mind you, but it didn't stop the game itself from being fun. Then the devs slowed down to a crawl, then announced it was done. They made quite a bit of money as this game sold pretty damn well for how early-development it was. Then they tried to hire a programmer and basically refused to pay him a living wage and the game ended.Game was considered ""Finished"" half-way into Alpha, is a great concpet but no longer developed, and the developers had the balls to suggest they'd make a sequel.Dwarf Fortress with graphic packs is your only hope.

												I've been playing this game for several years. I don't find it to be particularly buggy, but I'm really disappointed that the developer abandoned it. It really did have so much potential. I'd buy it again, on sale, if I didn't own it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else who doesn't like janky city. I'm known for collecting and loving misfit games.If you're looking for polished graphics or decent progression, this is not the game for you. If you're looking for a city builder that allows you to play in dungeons as well, this might be a decent bet if you can get it on sale.If you just like city builders that are well-supported by the community, go for Banished or something instead.

												So it's not an easy game to master, at times it seems buggy until you realize you're clicking the wrong block level since the camera can be difficult to manage at lower levels. However, I have played towns on and off again for almost 2 years. Many people have complained about the difficulty and 'lack of updates' but I have enjoyed this simple but addictive game. The hero system and village management is very enjoyable. Building with idiot villagers is actually a lot of fun.			",6,1,0,2,1,1,1

We could barely afford to make clothing for everyone. What clothing we had was made of dead spiders and assorted bones.

												Note: I posted a previous review but I want to elaborate on it now.Overall SummaryThis game is having tough times. Sure the devs have took the money and, almost entirly stopped development (They release fixes, and such). But this is because at this point I can say this game is done! It has many features to explore with alot of replayability in it, the Alpha may aswell be finished. I can say if the community would lighten up and, maybe release a few mods this game would be even better!Though I admit you can say ""They took the money and, ran!"" you cant blame them after what they have given to us. It is a finished game that I beleive is worth 15$. If you dont beleive me, please try the demo and, see whether it is your cup of tea. Gameplay reviewThe game is highly replayable with diffrent challanges rising, and some just repeating. Your successes may be minor at first but they get bigger and, bigger, and even bigger as you continue through the game! Once you mastered one floor, suprise there is another full of harder, and newer enemies. You can send your soldiers down, but do you want to risk a seige assualting your town when it is ungaurded? ""Oh no! Robert Died!"", these all arise in your game, and I assure you it is a intresting game when on hard difficulty.RatingsCommunity: 7/10Gameplay: 9.5/10Replayability: 9.5/10Major Update Frequency: 2/10Minor Update Frequency: 7/10Features: 9/10StyleStoryline: GeneratedCharacters: RandomizedArt: BlocksMobs: FictionalWeapons: VariedArmors: VariesCrafting: YesRTS (Total War): NoRTS (City-Builder): YesSimilar Game: Geomoria, Tropico (Similar in the way you build the town, and buildings but not directly control the people's choices.)Recommended?: Yes!

Posted: September 9, 2014
												Ok, first off, I just want to say that this review should be taken with a pinch of salt. This game has had an intense history for the time it's been around, and after witnessing a fair bit of it first-hand, I can say it wasn't pretty. I'll explain further on, as it does actually have a small amount to do with this review, but for now, let's get to it: Is the game good, and what's it about?What is Towns?: Towns is a top-down isometric strategy-RPG-simulation thingymabob. Most easily compared to Dwarf Fortress, it contains similar mechanics but without as much complexity. You control a small group of townies which require food, shelter, and equipment to survive. The world contains many dangers that will constantly threaten your civilization as you explore the underground dungeon for sweet loot, and farm the terrain to create vast fields of food. Everything can be controlled with your mouse with ease, from planting and building to digging and fighting. Of course, if you want to use those hotkeys to be a bit faster, then I don't blame you. You'll probably need them. While the art style may not be to everyone's taste, it's easy on the eyes and makes the world interesting to look at, providing you with plenty of colors to play with and enjoy.Reasons it's good: I've personally been a big fan of games like these since I found dwarf fortress a while back. So, I decided to pick this game up on sale and give it a bash. And I can honestly say I had fun. The overall simplicity of it made it easy for me to jump into it and understand most of what was going on right off the bat (though that may be in-part from having played similar games before-hand). The game looks pretty good most of the time, the blocks you can use to build have a lot of variation and color to them, so you can create some really nice looking builds. The A.I. has been a bit derpy sometimes, and I found myself often needing to fiddle with what my townies were doing regularly, but that's kinda what you'd expect to put up with when going into a game like this. When it boils down to it, I don't think towns is a game meant to be played with a hardcore mindset like one would play Dwarf Fortress with. The game is a lot simpler, and I found it to be a good game to play on my laptop in bed before going to sleep.Reasons it's bad: Now, some of the things that were good about it, worked kind of liked a double-edged sword. Yes, I had to fiddle with my little civilization, but it wasn't on things I wanted to do. Usually I had to deal with occasionally derpy A.I. that did silly things like leave items laying around that needed to be stored, or not building things correctly. Granted, these were problems I had some time ago. I haven't played much of the game recently (which I'll explain why in a moment), so I do believe some of those A.I. issues may have been resolved. The art style, while nice and simple, is maybe too simple, and could've used something to make it feel a bit more... energetic maybe? I guess beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder, but I think most people would agree that it's not a fabulous looking game. Good, but not fabulous. The simplicity, while nice for this game, could've used a few more things. Maybe a quest system, or thirst. Perhaps bigger maps would've even helped. Just some stuff to make it feel a bit meatier is all. Now, if you haven't figured it out yet, you should be wary of the game's history. If you want to dig deeper into it, go read the game's forums or discussions in the community hub. A VERY small summary of it could be boiled down to: The dev's got burnt out, people got upset, game slowed to a near-death crawl, and hasn't really recovered. The updates are few and far between, mostly consisting of bug fixes and patches. So don't be too hopeful about new content for the game, since in all likelihood, this is about as close as it'll get to a final product. Final Thoughts: I really, really can't hate too much on this game. I had fun with it for the time I played it, and I got my money's worth. But I can't whole heartedly recommend it either (at least at full price), so if it's on sale for a few bucks, then by all means, pick it up and give it a shot. I really only lost ~5$ on the deal, so I'm not too sour about it. For 5$, it was a nice, relatively relaxing game. There is the issue of the game's future though. Honestly, I'm not going to be the optimist, because from what I've seen and heard, optimism won't change much, if anything. I will say though, that I don't believe calling the game dead or abandoned is suitable either. Perhaps we can say that the game has become a husk, an empty shell of sorts. Or perhaps even more correct, would be to say it's a game that's suffered grievous wounds. The game has a chance to recover, and to stand back on its own two feet. Will it ever be what people hoped for? I doubt it. Will the community ever fully recover? Probably not. But, sometimes these things happen. Being too optimistic for something that very well may end up as a dead game is just as harmful as calling it dead outright. I'd love to see this game get built upon, and see amazing thigns happen. But after the toxicity I've witnessed, I'm not sure it's realistic to expect this game to be any more than a game you play in bed for an hour or two to chill to with some music in the background and a nice beverage. So if the game's ever on sale, and you need a nice game to fall asleep to (Warning: do not fall asleep to this game. Shut it off, and THEN go to sleep, lest your town become a graveyard), then pick it up for a few bucks and maybe buy a new CD from your favorite band with the money you saved. Like I said earlier though, take this review with a pinch of salt. While it is much simpler than Dwarf Fortress, it still has those FUN* mechanics in there under the layers of color, loot, and vast quantities of skootenbeeten. If you're not into the idea of watching everything you build up die from rogue werepigs, then buy with caution.Side Note: As it is somewhat important, it should be noted that the lead developer has been the focus of a lot of the controversy surrounding this title. While this should not be a major factor in your decision of buying/not buying this game, I do recommend at least making yourself aware of the situation with the developers. The details can be found by hunting around in the forums and whatnot, but here's a small summary to at least give you an idea: The toxicity of the community can really be traced back to the almost non-existant PR of the developers. After tensions rose, the lead developer was accused of basically taking the money and running, leaving behind a game that to most people (myself included) seemed like little more than an early access title. After minimal updates, and a new Dev that didn't stick around, things weren't looking good for the game, and still aren't. So if you have problems with supporting a company that made some mistakes from day 1, and ended up making themselves look untrustworthy, then take an extra pinch of salt with your final decision. I do believe though that the game should be viewed as it is, which at this point is something more closely relatable to a game you'd play in bed as I said earlier, without believing that it's a horrible piece of abandonware. 'Cus really it's not. It's a small game, not meant to be played on a bigger, more hardcore scale. It's got enough depth to keep you busy for a few hours at least, but not enough to really justify spending elongated hours on it. Regardless of what the developers did, or what the community says, it's a nice little pick up to add to your library for a couple bucks on sale.			",44,6,0,20,6,0,0

												I think this game is overall not too bad. My main complaint is about how to A.I. for the Townies works. I just feel like it is very lacking compared to some similar games I've played. A smaller complaint is a lack of features, but I haven't tried modding it yet, so it might not be as lacking as I feel it is.Overall, not a bad game. You should get at least 10 hours of gameplay out of it before the lack of content will become a problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Towns could be a great game. It has a lot going for it. From the unique perspective to pleasing graphics it has the base to be a enjoyable time sink. Unfortunately the execution leaves a bit to be offered.The game itself is quite good. You control a group of townspeople who have started a town that happens to be on top of an active dungeon system. You go through the usual gathering and building phases, but are also tasked with dealing with monsters. As you begin to dig into the earth looking for resources you find caverns and tunnels populated by the genres classic baddies. Everything from spiders to ogres await you hapless townsfolk as they dig deeper. You have to build up a guard force to keep you town safe from these creatures, and at a certain point you can even attract ""adventurers"" that are much more powerful and able to really beat down some baddies. It's a fun mix of dungeon discovery and building and offers quite a bit of content as is.The bad part of it is that you can only pretty much count on it ""as is"" the ""early access"" part of this game is seriously slow. There have been exceptionally long gaps between developments, at some points even rumors development had stopped. Issues between developer and publisher have not helped things. So if you're willing to shell out for the game as it is now you will get quite a bit of content, just don't rest any solid hopes on it advancing. The chances of it ever actually being finished and brough inline with the initial goal of  the game is even less. Because of the issues I simply cannot recommend this game to someone. If there were regular updates and some progress towards completion I would completely back this game, but as I can't recommend a game I don't think is ever going to be completed for someone to buy.

												Do NOT, under any circumstances, buy this game. It is STILL unfinished, nowhere near completion, and will most likely never be done. The developers haven't been active for months and sent the alpha out to die. Early Access was introduced partially due to the bloody mess of this game's ""launch"", and yet it never actually received the Early Access tag, and instead is being sold disguised as a finished product.Not much has happened since then, and it is unlikely that this is going to change in the near future. Yes, it has its charme, yes it had potential, but this potential has not yet been touched by the developers - and this game launched on Steam A YEAR AGO!If you are a fan of this type of game, I wholeheartedly recommend Gnomoria, which is not only cheaper, but also well underway to being a finished game. It wears its Early Access tag with pride, and releases patches very frequently. Just this week they released version 0.9.2, which tweaks, rebalances and fixes a LOT of combat mechanics, and the game itself works and looks charming. While not done yet, it is very much playable without the level of frustration Towns will give you.Stay away from Towns.			",1415,562,26,220,174,14,267

I am conflicted on recommending it but ultimately I had fun with it for 80+ hours so I can't just rate it down in good faithIT IS ABANDONED but again with bluesteels mod its relatively fun, quirky in a way I ended up enjoying, and on sale its like 5 bucks.

												Yes play this game it is very fun and maybe you will enjoy it as much as I. I have played a couple hundred hours on a few maps and never finished the dungeon or building a town. I played today and will be playing tomorrow also if all goes well. There are some recent videos of the game that may help you decide. Here is a You Tube link

			Towns is a super fun game on Steam. I am not super skilled at it but it makes me very happy and I hope some of that will be contagious.

												Overall the game is very fun at first but doesn't really have any long term replayability.  I bought it because I enjoyed similar games (mostly Gnomoria) and wanted to see what else was out there.  If you enjoy that style of game you'll get a few good play throughs on this (maybe 10-20 hours, even though I got 43 out of it) and they you will run out of things to do.  If that is enough entertainment for you to be worth the cost then you should buy it.There are a lot of negative reviews about the game being broken.  It isn't.  There is a big difference between broken and not nearly as good as it could have been.  I don't usually review games but I didn't feel like this game deserved most of the comments being made in the negative reviews so I wanted to provide another point of view.			",79,19,0,43,40,3,54

												Great game! It can be a bit slow in the beginning, and I'm sad they abandoned it.

												Definitely worth 5 bucks and under. As a dickey little town game its pretty solid, just could have been waaaay better.Dont think it quite deserves the panning people are giving it, but its pretty frustrating that there isnt regular updates, especialy considering it just needs content, content and more content. Serioulsy, just more content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright folks, the game doesn't deserve all the hate. Well, ummm, actually it does, but not to this extent. I originally bought the game at version 8 (now it's version 14e), so yeah, I'm amongst those who were ""cheated"" by early promises, and I will still give this game a thump up.Why it does deserve the hate? Because it's clearly unfinished.-Several in-game features are clunky, for example ordering your troops around: you can't simply say ""go there"", you can only place patrol points. So exploring the dungeons beneath the surface is like: right-click somewhere, place waypoint, wait until they get there, right-click on waypoint, remove waypoint, right-click somewhere else, place waypoint, wait until they get there, etc. Since there's no other option I can live with it, but I'm not lovin' it.-Poor pathfinding. The townies may just ignore the roads, although they walk parallel with them only one square away.-AI is lacking. The haulers tend to choose stuff to pick up far, far away, instead of that exact same thing they are standing on. And, please, don't go to sleep or eat when several dozens of spiders are besieging the town. Also, don't try to gather loot in the middle of the battlefield, because it's dangerous to your health.-The variety of stuff to build is a bit underwhelming, although not always. For example you can build one type of wooden chair (not counting that one which needs gold besides wood), but at the same time there are like twenty stone wall styles. So building homes is not on Sims level.I think these are the negatives worth mentioning, may update if I encounter something I haven't written here yet. Umm, okay, others may say the music is repetitive, but I don't mind, it's not horrible.Why it does not deserve this much hate:- Contrary to a lot of other reviews, I have not encountered _any_ bugs, at least not apparent ones. No memory leaks. No hangups, no slowdowns, no CTDs. I don't really get what others mean when they describe this game as ""buggy as ****"". There were a lot of them in earlier versions, but right now this is one of the most bug-free games I ever played.I will not make a list about other pros, because they are subjective. I just leave here this: I still prefer Towns way over Gnomoria, and if it was a terrible game I wouldn't have come close to play it for 270 hours. Not many of my games can boast that much playtime.Thus, I dare to say, if you like building towns from blocks, and if Towns is on sale, try it.			",234,57,3,44,63,1,55

												Pro:Finished and relatively bug free.Ability to give units tasks (and thereby automate your ""Town"")Dungeon crawling in addition to town/city buildingLots of crafting / buildingResource managementCon:Devs abandoned the game14.99 price tag is a bit steep (get it on sale)Can be rough for beginners / learning curveBecause the game has been abandoned doesn't mean the game is horrible just no additional patches, content, etc for this game.Personally, I enjoy this game.  It took a bit to figure out but there's a wiki because what game doesn't have a wiki these days ( http://towns.gamepedia.com/Towns_Wiki ).  You can get most/all the information you need to be able to play the game here as well as access to mods or where to get mods.I like how you're able to relocate/make resource areas to where you want them.  In a lot of these games, generally they just regrow in an area that you've already harvested or you have to craft a special/specific building to harvest any additional resources.  In this game, you can take saplings/seeds/fruit/etc and create an area where you'd like them to grow.  Flowers, trees, etc will still grow in other areas but this allows you to have say 5x5 of trees (for lumber) that will continually regrow in that exact same plot (after being chopped down, a sapling will begin to grow in it's place and after a few minutes you'll have a fully grown tree... this applies to wheat, fruit, etc.).  This makes your villagers much more efficient at gathering and better for your resource management.  It is also significantly safer than traversing the area filled with random monsters like brownies, goblins, ghosts, etc.The big downside of the game is that a lot of people feel it isn't ""finished"" or ""unpolished"" and the lack of further development.  However, the game is fully functional and the balance may be a little off but that's easily adjustable via the xml files or mods.  Also, game can be pretty brutal at times such as when you expand a bit too early or get raided by monsters and your villagers have no armor nor weapons at their disposal in addition to their piddly health pool.If you like these kinds of games (city building/resource management) and don't mind that there won't be able more updates then buy the game but I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale.  Even if development has stopped, there's a lot of mods for the game which add content or change texture packs, etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Now this game is nowhere near perfect, and maybe it 15 dollars isn't the best price. That being said, this game is very entertaining and had my attention for a few hours at the least. There may be games better than this, and maybe the dev's did give up on it, but I think it was a nice try which would have been amazing in the past.			",315,51,9,36,35,6,46

												You will find a lot of critiscism about how the game is broken and abondened. It's still a fun game and the fact that things are ""broken"" makes it more fun and harder. Nowadays games tend to be too easy but having to deal with broken AI and weirdness actually brings the fun to the game. For me atleast. People say that they played 200hours of this game and it was very broken bla bla.. The fact that you wanted to play the game for 200 hours says it all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am not one to write lengthy, detailed reviews, but I must say that this game is definitely misunderstood by many.If you are looking for a game in which every detail is given to you, where there is nothing to be learned and no difficulty in creating things, then continue no further.If you are someone who likes unique, one of a kind games that contain many interesting elements native to that game alone, then I do suggest Towns. It is a somewhat addicting city-builder with both rpg and survival aspects. Building is complicated at first, even for simulation and survival vets like myself. Even after the horribly furstrating first attempts at creating a town, I find myself coming back. It's definitely a challenge at first, but as you slowly get a grip on the isometric perspective and somewhat aggravating UI, you begin to discover new things and gain new knowledge, and that is part of what makes this game so golden.The game isn't broken, it is just difficult at first. It definitely is not for everyone, but if you want a unique, expansive, and nostalgic city-builder, please buy this game. You will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Another downside is that the villagers will crawl up through the ceiling if there is a hole instead of using the front door. ",16,4,0,2,8,1,13

												The difficulty of this game is making your townies happy. You have to make a lot of things to make them happy, but they have to build/make it and work makes them unhappy! It's a very slow game, and if you want to, as long as you have things being made constaintly without you telling them to on your own using the auto-craft, then you can have the game run all night. Carefull about autosaves when you do this. It may not work out like you want and you'll end up with a town of ghosts! Dispite all that, I find that it's not too daunting to take on this challenge and there are now tutorials up to get you started on your way to create the best town you can. Don't forget, you can turn some townies into soldiers to protect them at the cost of them not acutally crafting things, but at least you can protect them. They can also protect themselves you outfit them  properly as well. Just try it out and have fun with it. If the game you are working on doesn't work out, you can always make another, thankfully.

												researched the history of Towns after i bought it. yes i should've read what others said about this game and i see a lot of negatives.i can see why while playing Towns as there are some missing feature as i'm tring to find out how to make stone hammer to make anvil. during the research, like what other mention on the forum the guy/s abandon Towns game and left it as it is,The reason they gave up and left the game is because they released the game too soon and incomplete, too many complaints piling up, been recieving too many abused messangers about where the money gone, why the problems isn't resolved quick.It an old saying 'people make mastakes' 'nothing is perfect' as far as i'm aware they did tried their best to get back into track and sort Towns out as soon as possible without anymore stress.I know ALL the players who bought Towns (which is more then 200,000 in the research) are very demanding to get the game working again and fill in the gaps which are incomplete, i understand we players want a full working game but hey why not play other games while waiting for them to fix it rather ranting at them to push them around to get it done asap.I hope they do get back in track and recreate Towns from scratch, since it mainly possible to try fix the first Towns to get it back up and complete or start from scratch for better version and replace the old Towns which would be easy but if it still left the Early Game Access.i want to click as maybe instead of grenn yes button or red no button, but i would give it a thumbs up to give them hope to get Towns going.Happy Gaming players :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I do find myself playing this again from time to time, and I never actually been able to reach the deep levels yet. The game is not easy for newcomers and a lot of people will die most likely, but with practice and some tricks eventually you can get a decent town running.			",165,30,4,22,39,1,27

												As one of a million ""build a world"" style games I enjoyed this one a lot based on the semi-automated NPC stuff. I found that the game made it really difficult to start actually staging in the deeper levels of the dungeon. You couldn't build much sustainable food underground, and otherwise had to manually have people go drop food for your NPCs to eat. Made the later game a little annoying.But the building system worked really well, and I enjoyed being able to set up an entire economic supply chain for your NPCs to follow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bought this over a year ago, and I loved it then (83 hrs). I've read about the new updates, and I can't wait to play it again.Towns can be difficult to learn at the beginning of the game. It has a deep level of complexity due to how flexible it is for player building. You do not get complete control over your villagers. Rather, you place a series of instruction for your villagers to follow. As is typical for town building games, your villagers can be pretty dumb sometimes, but that is all part of the fun. You think that you are safe to leave your people to work on the things that you assign them, and sometimes, things go horribly wrong. I've had several cities that have failed horribly, but I have no problems restarting. It just gives me more delivery and more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
