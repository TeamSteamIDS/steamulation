												I have a hard time recommending this game right now, and I will explain why....At least here on steam, I don’t have to worry about being bullied by Gaijin for writing a critical review. I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. If you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will show you just how long I have been around flying the cyber skies. I can’t help but be amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. Listen up kidos, you can learn something from your elders. Warthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. I have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. Often you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. Recently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…So what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?I take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. They make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.Any objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. The Planes and TanksWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? The P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. The bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. ALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. The P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. The bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. Wanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. There is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. Then, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandalThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”. Hmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! Team Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. There is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. As of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. In the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. I have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. Warthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. Sadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.

												Just to give you an insight of the company that runs this game, Gaijin Entertainment:Some months ago the incredibly unsuccessful E100 tournament took place.Players where hyped like ****, A FREAKING E100 IS BEING ADDEDWhat people didnt know was that the E100 would only be available to less than 1200 people that won these tournaments, for which you needed to pay to get tickets to play.The tournament was badly set up and full of hackers (Shhh Gaijin doesnt want us to know there are hackers)Of course thousands of people complained in the forums, including myself.Most of my comments where removed on the context of ''flaming'', some of those comments complained about the removals.Shortly after this, they introduced a rule that didnt allow people to post in the forums, unless they had played a certain number of battles prior to posting.After receiving a warning for challenging moderation (lol) I got a message from a fellow forum user:''The rule came about shortly after they removed Simulator Battles from the game.  It wasn't to keep the trolls at a minimum, it was to reduce the workload of the moderators after such a poor decision.Scarper and Pacifica (two senior mods) are megalomaniacs.   Their egos get in the way of moderation.  Their extra comments on closed threads are often insulting and almost always condescending.  They show the community no respect at all and I believe it is only a symptom of Gaijin policy.  This was evident in the Youtube incident (if you are familiar I won't elaborate, but if you want to know more I'll elucidate)''More into this:http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/290640-community-relations-or-why-i-have-to-post-in-off-topic-discussions/http://ritastatusreport.blogspot.com/2015/07/gaijin-shuts-down-youtubers-channel.htmlhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/7/30/9068059/rogue-employee-holds-independent-youtube-channel-hostage-war-thunderMods from all around the globe are likely to downvote this, and I doubt this review will ever be viewed by many, but please, stay away from this toxic company while you can.

												I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.			",72,9,1,13,10,0,24

												War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. 1.57- This might be a fiarly good patch. Tons of new maps, planes, tanks, EC changes, and increased bomb damage(?). The only thing that I dont like is the complete kills on a tanks crew. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pen a tanks hull, which means you will not get the kill if the last crew member switches to the drivers seat. I could see the mechanic being usefull for a tank with two crew, but have the guts and brains of your 6 friends splattered all over the tank would prevent me from freely moving around the cabin. It doesnt impact me much though, I only really play in the air war.Edit- Alright, I think Gaijin finally did it. They have completely killed my desire to play ground forces. Complete kills are almost as worthless as the crew locks and spawn camping. At least I can still fly my planes as long as I take off within 30 seconds...-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.   -We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.  -For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.   -They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog♥♥♥♥♥♥we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has  to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.

												Don't be fooled by the high ratings of this game. As soon as you play for a longer time you will see the massive racism of the developers and sheer cheek of their pay2win greed.+The game is prettyThis is it.. it looks good and runs well. The only + in this review.-Russian biasIt's real, its totally real. Russian planes outright outperform lots of other planes and russian tanks downright deflect shells with magic armor. No surprise the developers are russian. Their response to the bias is that they have ""Secret documents"" about WW2, probably saying Russia had magic infused armor made from Stalin's bumsweat and nosehair.Time and time again the community has provided declassified documents themselves, disproving the armor effectiveness and certain nerfs on especially germans, from MANY countries, even CCCP but devs/mods just ignore it/delete it.I would also like to add that Steam moderators have CONFIRMED that russian bias exists about a month ago from writing this review.-Pay2WinCertain vehicles are behind a paywall going up to 60 euro a vehicle sometimes. These are blatantly better than their free counterparts on the same rating. Special armor, non-exploding fueltanks, the list goes on.But most irritating are the rocketlaunching tanks. The Callioppe for instance has 60 rockets mounted ontop of a Sherman, each rocket is DEVASTATING for other tanks downright riddling the crew with shrapnel. Add to that a insanely high RoF and a 10 second reload speed. Also the rockets cannot be taken out by shooting the canisters. No surprise its a 50 euro tank.-Map DesignPartially to blame for the russian bias is the map design. Most maps are made specifically for close range brawler tanks ( russian ) and aircombat always at a low enough altitude to ""justify"" the russian superiority as russian planes were best at low altitudes ( below 5 km ).Spawn camping is easily done as you only need to do a small drive of about 30 seconds on certain maps to be in enemy spawn. You have a brief spawnprotection but thats void as soon as you're alive for a few seconds. You drive out of spawn then and boom, someone shot you in your side who was hiding in a bush/behind a rock next to your spawn.-Battle RatingThe most agrivating and full on bias thing to exist in War Thunder.Vehicles are classed by a Battle Rating ( BR ) as to balance the matches so a lategame heavy tanks wont face 1920's tanks. This is broken, there is no way around it. Russian vehicles have favorable BR's to their opponents. Purposely classed lower than what theyre actually worth so they decimate other countries. ( Also outperforming specialised turnfighters with a flying russian brick and magic armor )How it is supposed to work is your highest vehicle will be chosen and put into a match with +/-1 BR or 1.3 in planes. Seeing as i fight BR 3.3 tanks in my 1.3 tanks, I cannot kill anything.-DevelopersAs said earlier they are racist towards anything what isn't russian. Disregarding anyone not speaking russian as less important. Deleting and banning alot of feedback on their own forum and having Steammods delete any negative feedback. Steammods also actively downvote negative reviews reportedly.Also I think Gaijin spies on what you say via bots as I myself have been banned from chat while ONLY talking in Squadchat with my friends, badmouthing Gaijin. 15 day chatban for hate messages. Only hate against Gaijin though.Giving russian vehicles magic abilities, nerfing all other countries to oblivion (mostly germans), banning and deleting community for feedback and having a MASSIVE P2W mentality with 50 euro blatantly overpowered vehicles.Edit: Gaijin forced a youtuber to delete a video he made with footage showing a hacker. They do not want the world to see they cannot handle hackers.Shame Gaijin, shame. We complain to you because we want to see a good WW2 game but all you do is hide behind your nationalism and hate on us.Also alot of members of the community are toxic.			",90,13,2,9,3,0,8

												Played the game for months, unlocked tier V planes for every nation and reached the mid-ranks with some tanks.Then Gaijin sent me a message claiming I had used the Steam refund system to refund money on a 5000 Golden Eagles purchase MONTHS after they claim the refund had happened.  However, I have never used the Steam refund system before. I couldn't find any record of it on my bank account and had to spent €25.- in the Gaijin shop for War Thunder in order to get my account back after it got frozen.After that I' am no longer interested in playing this game. Not after the Devs showed a poor ability in communcation and made accusations which I couldn't even defend rightfully. Don't spent any money on this game, Gaijin might ask you for more after you do ;)			",61,3,1,10,6,0,12

Please read before making consideration:I am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. If you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.All that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. Thanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).Update: After the latest updates I can no longer support this game. Can't change review though.			",71,20,1,11,17,0,27

												Tanks are okay until Rank 4, when the serious grind starts. Planes are easy to grind and you can get to rank 5 with sanity intact. If gameplay is all that matters then by all means play it, but if you care about how corrupt the company can be then beware.List of some things they did off the top of my head:- Sued an individual for using the domain name ""Gaijin.net"" even though the original gaijin.net predated the company by seven years.- Threatened to ruin part of the game if players didn't help them abuse youtube's DMCA strikes against youtubers that showed bad things about the game.- Completely ignores community balance suggestions, acts like their game is 100% balanced and that anyone who suggests changes is wrong.- Gaijin support is not worth contacting, they find ways to circumvent their own policies.Not that any of this affects gameplay, just thought people should know what kind company is getting the money.BONUS STORY: Started an air realistic match and as soon as it started I saw a captured P47 teamkill 3 players (one due to fire after he got kicked) then J out. I messaged him after the battle, apparently that's all he does. I said he should be perma-banned and he responded telling me to look at his stats and that he'd been TKing every match for months and received countless complaints but yet wasn't banned or even warned.

												War Thunder is fun, well-developed, and addicting. I hardly have any complaints about the game itself, which makes it a shame that I can no longer even stand it. The moderators of this game are the WORST I've ever encountered ANYWHERE, and that's against every website, forum, or game I've had an account on since the age of Dial-Up. The false sense of superiority and lack of basic respect that these Mods exhibit is as angering as the amount of hours I've sunk into a game that I am no longer able to play. I am still in disbelief that EVERY moderator has blown me off, with the exception of the one that replied just so he could call me a Nazi. His empty accusation isn't just offensive, but it's pathetic. I am not a Nazi and I never represented myself to be in any fashion, the mod simply formed an opinion based on my German username and refuses to believe anything different. I have been nothing but pleasant to every moderator, even offering an explanation and a solution to the man who insulted me. Unfortunately, I have received nothing but disrespect in return from the people who are refusing to reinstate my account.The bottom line is that Gaijin needs to increase their standards of who they accept as moderators before they lose even more players. You can have a perfect game, but no one will play if the people representing the game are rude and demeaning.			",121,18,2,12,19,1,10

												Well 800+ hours in as a Realstic Battles player and I think I can say it's 800 hours wasted. To start out with most people will love the game, then as you slowly progress through the tech trees (unless you buy premium which is what they want, don't do it) you start to realise something is a little off. When you are in your Tiger 2 H at 6.7 BR, just minding your own business trying not to be one shot killed by a 122mm shell from an IS-2, then you see it. A little green♥♥♥♥♥♥driving towards you head on, it's a T-54, yes a tank from AFTER the war fighting WW2 tanks. And well tough luck because you are at his mercy and can't do♥♥♥♥♥♥to him. Why Gaijin think it's fine to stick post WW2 tanks against WW2 tanks I will never know. You look at this T-54 drivers stats and he has a 90% win rate and a 3.00 K/D ratio. And this isn't just with the T-54 , it's with the majority of Russian tanks. I've noticed a pattern of Russian T5 tanks having 60 and 70% win rates and 2.00 K/D ratios almost always compared to German and American tanks who tend to have 40-50% win rates and just barely over a 1.00 K/D ratio. ""There's no Russian bias!"" the Gaijin apologist fanboys cry out.... yea ♥♥♥♥ing right. If you are like me and you follow what Gaijin are up to with the development of the game, you will see that  they are completely ♥♥♥♥ing inept corrupt snow monkeys looking to get enough Rubels from their playerbase through premium currency so they can buy potatos and vodka and listen to some Russian hard bass while dancing in circles rubbing their hands together like the Jews they are. Every update is them adding a new PREMIUM vehicle that is completely broken and overpowered such as the plethora of tanks they plan to add with rockets on them. And the current rocket tank (the Calliopie) which is ridiculously priced costing £40-50 worth of premium currency and that is completely broken and overpowered. And you know what? No one asked for these, no one. And alas this brings me to my next point. Gaijin do not listen, ever. You ask for more balanced BRs on T5 tanks and they respond by giving some random T2 Russian tank some more bullets for the coaxial machine gun... They just don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ If I were to pit Konami and Gaijin off in a contest to see who was the worse company it would be too close to call. Many veterans of this game have left it, many big YouTube channels (such as Jingles, Bismarck, RamJB) have stopped covering it. But yet the ♥♥♥♥s given by Gaijin are still 0. They are slowly suffocating this game to death with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. This used to be a good game, I mean there is no other like it. It's damage model, looks and large variety of vehicles are really un challenged. War Thunder takes a completely different approach to tanks than what World of Tanks does and In my opinion this is the better approach, the realistic damage models and logical spotting system are just so much better (meaning if you look where a tank is it's there and not invisble because of some BS ""camo system""). Gaijin are like children, in fact I am pretty sure it's run by a bunch of chilldren, they cannot take critiscism, if you try to build a logical complaint about the game it will be dismissed on the forums by the moderators because they too are immature children indoctrinated to see only good in the game and nothing else. If I was to describe the forums I would say they are like a Russian Gulag, you really do get that impression with the much BS and censorship that goes on there. The hoards of loyal fagboys defending every broken aspect of the game regardless of what logic and reason you try to use on them. You would think a veteran player who has been playing the game from the very start would have some form of influenece on Gaijin and what they choose to do to the game? Nope. They are treated even worse than brand new players coming to the game because Gaijin realise they have lost the veteran players to the actual truth and would rather focus on brainwashing more noob players into think this is a ""good game"".Overall this game was something unique and still kind of is, I really can't play World of Tanks or any other WW2 flight game as a substitute because War Thunder sits perfectly in between the extreme hardcore flight sims and extremely arcadey flight games. Likewise with the ground combat. But this game is dying, slowly but surely. Not too long ago there were 100,000 players online during a new patch, that number dropped to 60,000 a few days later and has not gone past 60,000 since. Most days it sits around 40-45,000 players. Just goes to show how many people actually see this company for what they actually are, a money grabbing disgrace who have 0 regards for their community.TLDR - Take it from me, stay away. Gaijin will make you sick to your stomach in disgust with how they treat the community and the game.			",45,1,0,9,1,0,10

 Let me start by saying this This game had potential. There was a time I was a diehard fan of this game. I had been playing since 1.27. AIR: T5 US; T5 GER; T4 UK; T5 USSR; T5 JAPGROUND: T5 US; T5 GER; T2 UK; T5 USSR; T3 JAPThis game used to be so fun. It had beautiful graphics, sounds were amazing, and the whole package was there. But as time passed, the Devs for this game have become more and more like a Russian propaganda booth. There IS a Russian Bias in this game and I’m not talking a minor one like you see in American games with American companies.  Russian Bias Russian Bias? Where is the proof?Let us start with the T-34, the BR for all the T-34’s are way too low in any and all game modes. Look at the win/loss ratio for T-34’s and its apparent across all accounts of how under-tiered this thing is. While tanks like the Tiger I sit at 5.7 (Ausf. H) and 6.0 (Ausf. E). That is one example of the whole BR skew. The BR in this game is skewed with Russia being favored more than any other country. Ok is that it? Lets move on to the inaccurate models. The T-34 utilized the Christie Suspension. This made it mobile for its time but it lacked  SHOCK ABSORBERS  which gave it horrible stability on the move and when trying to stop. This means it takes longer to line up a straight shot after moving making it either inaccurate or exposed for a few seconds before having a lined up shot. The Tiger one utilized shock absorbers but for some reason the T-34 can stabilize and line up a shot long before a Tiger I can. In-fact, the Tiger I wobbles like crazy upon trying to stop making it the exposed target upon trying to stabilize. Next lets look at the KV-2 utilizing the M-10 152MM howitzer. “KV-2 (334) – A heavy assault tank with the M-10 152 mm howitzer, the KV-2 was produced at the same time as the KV-1. Due to the size of its heavy turret and gun, the KV-2 was slower and had a much higher profile than the KV-1. Those captured and used by the German Army were known as (Sturm)Panzer kampfwagen KV-II 754(r) and often used for artillery observation due to its height. Few were produced due to its  combat ineffectiveness,  mainly the  decreased speed  due to the weight of the new gun and turret. The enlarged turret also offered a much bigger target, resulting in it being easier to hit and destroy than other KV tanks. Due to the increased turret weight due to expanded dimensions and a heavier gun, the turret traverse mechanism could work only on level ground”Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliment_Voroshilov_tank#KV_and_other_heavy_Soviet_tanks_comparedYet for some reason, this thing charges faster than an IS-1. Next is the M-10 cannons ammunition.“The G-530 could not be fired with a ""full"" charge without putting the crew at risk of having the shell explode in the barrel. A special version of the shell, the G-530Sh, was developed to allow use with the full charge.”They will not model this but they have no problem modeling in “poor quality German steel [at the end of the war]” that has an effective thickness of 95mm instead of the actual 100mm listed. I don’t count Wikipedia as a source.  <--good for you buddy, moving on. The devs. The lovely, lovely devs. Do you know what you get for voicing a genuine concern on the forums about the BR or Match Maker? You get the Internet KGB locking and removing your post as well as a warning. You know what you get for posting a video online showing hacks and the weakness of Gaijins anti-cheat software? A whole battle mode being held hostage with the price of full censorship in the game (look into phlydaily’s thing with that). This company is the same company that has had issues with censorship and blackmailing in the past. Anton Yudintsev, CEO of Gaijin Entertainment and Russian KGB is the devil of gaming himself. The whole of War Thunder is the USSR and Anton and the rest of the Devs there are the KGB. If you voice anything of concern genuine or sh*tpost, the mods come down hard on you as per “orders” from the admins and Devs. Let me say this to avoid rambling; they only care for themselves and your money. As long as you pay, and don’t bash Russia, your fine. I could stack more examples of their Behavior (unethical or otherwise) but if you really want to find out more, just google it, you won’t have a hard time finding more about it. Historical flight & tank models/accuracy and balanced gaming Most of Historical accuracy can be seen in the first section, but when your game has to keep adding end game stuff and constantly buff and nerf things on a monthly basis, is it really accurate or is balance the name priority. They have buffed and nerfed the Sabre, Mig and other end game jets like crazy. I will grant then the fact that end game jets is all around balance but at the same time, it feels more skewed the Russia. I wish I could pull up some facts but I don’t care for jets so I never bothered looking into it. The F4U, and the F6F are horribly underpowered (in engine strength) though. When the famed Hellcat with its 19:1 K/D ratio and its legendary BnZ capability, in the Pacific Theater, only outdone by the Corsair and its Pratt and Whitney engine, can be kept up too by a A6M2 Zero for the most part, there is a serious problem. For the longest while, all the F4U’s and the one F6F have had crap engine output that puts them to shame compared to their real life counterpart. The Skyraider is in the same boat being able to outperform the F8F Bearcat in real life; yet the in-game version is a brick and a half for a flight model and a toaster oven for an engine. Oh and while we’re on the topic of that, let’s not forget the TU-4 which was added in update 1.59. The engines on the stolen B-29 design were outfitted to have 200 additional HP output per engine, but the counterweight of the extra bombs and the engine itself made it almost identical to the B-29. Yet the thing might as well be flying like it had 2000HP extra. I won’t judge the TU-4 too harshly since it just came out but I would not be surprise if they didn’t change it at all. One last detail on this is the inaccurate modeling of the Maus tank turret. The front cheeks are supposed to be 240mm-250mm according to multiple sources. In-game it is only 220MM, just enough to let IS-2 tanks that  have been given post war ammunition  to penetrate the front cheeks when 100 meters of closer. This list goes on of inaccuracies that benefit Russian tech and inaccuracies that hurt everyone else’s tech. ATGM’s ATGM’s are a thing now…enough said. Conclusion I can write for days on the inaccuracies about this game that Gaijin has let pile up since the day I started playing. Don’t get me wrong, I loved this game with a burning passion but that has long since died out. I’m not a wehraboo who will try to oversell an 88MM as the spear of Longinus, and I’m all stars and stripes for kicking an axis member in the D*ck but to butcher all the nations, even the axis ones, and raise the nation of the USSR up and above is a too much for me.  The worst though is to watch my favorite game burn like it has over these past few years. It is just…depressing. It’s also why I took all this time to write this review as a warning to you, just turn back even if you came from WoT. I’ve only played a little bit of Wargaming’s stuff but I can tell you I had more fun with that then I did playing War thunder. TL;DR:  Russian bias, KGB Devs, broken models, ATGM’s. Put together make a horrible game.			",141,7,0,15,26,0,31

												Update to my review at the bottom.VR support: they think the Vive is not 'gamer friendly', but they'll support it 'eventually'. Rift support still doesn't work properly. If you want a flightgame for VR look elsewhere.I'll admit, I'm hooked on this game. But I just can't recommend anyone waste money on this game in the sorry state it is in now. Any player feedback talking about bad things in the game is met with passive aggressive responses from Mods, or just downright hostility. This is just one of the reasons there is no way for player intervention to fix the biggest issues currently with the game. I'm not here to explain the basic concept of the game, just the complete trainwreck this game is becoming. I'll start with my gripes with Simulator, the biggest problem:They refuse to admit that its unfair to have third person view available for Bombers, none of the heavy bombers have cockpits at all to speak off, they basically get this virtual cockpit that makes you feel like you're flying a drone than a WWII bomber. They said they would implement bomber cockpits over 2 years ago, they started with the Pe-2/3 series aircraft, with nothing to show for it since then. Bombers in Simulator also get manual gunner control, with the same accuracy and visual awareness they get in Arcade and Simulator, while fighters in those modes also have the same accuracy and visual awareness as bombers, its not an imbalance problem per se. While back in Simulator fighters have no such luxuries, you're confined to a modeled cockpit, with no view besides what the pilot himself would see.Even today they've admitted that bomber cockpits are a 'long term goal' and that there are more important things to implement, such as more tanks post Korean War. British Tanks, Italian tech tree, More end tier jet aircraft, such as the Vampire, more bombers like the Do-17 series(With no modeled cockpit either mind you) They instead want to implement more vehicles as if that's a more pressing matter than finishing the actual vehicles already in the game. They also have no intention of changing the way bomber gunners work at all, so you'll still have that amazing third person view even with implemented cockpits. The Simulator community used to be a pretty good size when I started playing this game, most people left because they just don't do anything to improve Simulator, player counts keep dropping. They use this as an excuse to not not do anything for Simulator, because the player count is complete rubbish compared to Arcade. Like no wonder man.Talking about post Korean War stuff. They've had the issue where nobody is playing high tiers 5, the way the game is anything jet powered is in tier 5, regardless of its performance. Anything propeller driven is tier 4 or below, regardless of its performance. For a long time the Me 262, the worlds first introduced Jet fighter 1944, was facing Korean War sabres from the 1950's, it even became its own joke on the net: http://wiki.warthunder.com/images/f/f4/Me_2OP62_-_Back_to_the_Future.jpeg The War Thunder Player Council, WTPC, was made up mostly as a PR stunt with voted player representatives, designed for improving communications between Gaijin(the game developer) and the player base. They managed to do a few things, like get the overtiered Me 262 to stop facing the best Korean War vehicles out there such as the Sabre and the Mig-15bis. But everything they've done is pretty much moot following Gaijin's ""Quantatitive Restrictions"" matchmaker just in the last week, the intention being that if you have a team of weak planes, against the other team of weak planes, with 4 or so really really advanced planes on each team, that they'll end up getting all the kills and the rest are dead meat. They've basically destroyed everything the WTPC had done to fix the 'end game' as they call it. The complaints from players has always been that there was overcompression with the high tiers. But instead they just overcompress it even more, so everything from the Korean war and post is now facing WWII Jets and props. The performance devide is so big you can't get it anywhere else in the game. They've done the same with tanks too so you have what was arguably the best tank in the game, the T-10M, a Cold War tank from the Russians, facing German WWII tanks from 1944. This was all done to lower the queue times, they thought it was such an problem that people only queued in the T-10M and IS-4M, so they decide to bring the lower tiers into their games. It should have been obvious from the get go that everyone spam queued the IS-4M before they introduced the T-10M, introducing that tank was such a huge mistake. When no other nation has anything close to it.That isn't even the best part, they've even given tanks such as the tier 4; IS-2 1944, ammunition that was developed years later, the BR-412D, only ever used on the IS-3 and IS-4M, but they give the IS-2 it in the name of ""balance"", its got a similar penetration as the APCR shell the Germans in the same tiers get, APCR has no explosive filler, but this shell the Russians got has even more explosive filler than the normal shells the Germans get. Insane.All this has brown up on the forums, months ago any discussion on the ""ABuse"" of bombers in Simulator was met with a swift warning from a specific Senior Moderator and the threads locked. Guy thought he was 'helping' us by silencing our arguments, as if they didn't exist. As if enemy bombers landing on your airfieild and killing you on spawn with no way to stop it, over and over, is not abusive in any way at all. Here are youtube videos of exactly what I'm talking about: Unconventional AAA, No such thing as ABuse, Spawn Camping,all this is 100% okay according to them.The term ""ABuse"" and ""ABuser"" originates from how easy it is to do good with bombers in Simulator, where you openly have people admit on the forums and elsewhere on the internet, those that mostly play Arcade, ""Arcade Battles user"" play bombers in simulator only because its easier than in Arcade or Realistic, in order to be able to grind jets faster, and only because its easier, its much harder for fighters to take down bombers in Sim than it is in Realistic, where bad bomber pilots would be toast, while in sim even the worst pilot ever, as long as he can keep the plane in the air, can be the best player on the team.For as long as you have such incompetent 12 year olds moderating their forums who can't even punctuate properly in any form. There will be no way to even get this message across to the developers because those 12 year old moderators will outright prevent your message from reaching them. But its not just them, even the top guys doing the decisions for the game have no clue what's going on, its as if nobody at Gaijin even plays Simulator at all, or the game in general when it comes to how they're handling tier 5 stuff.I will only stick with this game for now because I'm a co-leader of a squadron in-game, and I'm not going to abandon them because the game is falling apart.EDIT: The game still advertises its self as being an MMO, its the same 32 player limit you see in TF2. is TF2 an MMO? No? Then War Thunder isn't either.Update March/April 2016: Most prominent moderator I mentioned is still a Senior Moderator. But hasn't shown his/her face in the Simulator Battles Discussion part of the forum in a long time. WTPC is non existent. They just introduced the P-61 heavy fighter, without a cockpit. Its currently the most devastating aircraft to face in Simulator. Now you get 'captured' when you land on enemy airfields. Simulator is still treated like it's just DLC.The following video explains more because I'm reaching the character limit for reviews:

												I bet you're wondering what a person who has this much time spent playing the game is doing by not recommending it.  Well, in short, it goes a little like this:Pre-patch 1.37, the game was making incremental, but still positive steps forward.  In general, the game's biggest downfall back then was simply lack of proper flight models for a lot of the aircraft.  The economy woes from patch 1.29 had mostly been completely fixed by 1.33-1.35, and the game was just a pleasure to play and I couldn't get enough of it.  I even decided to devote my semi-successful YouTube channel completely to War Thunder.  A mistake that I'm now regretting.After patch 1.37, the game simply went to♥♥♥♥♥♥  While the game's flight models are now in probably their best state yet (but still not even anywhere close to perfect), nearly every other aspect of the game is has gotten 10 times worse.  The issues that I have with the game in its current state can be a bit hard to count, but I'll give it a try:Non-existant in-game economyNearly impossible grind (mostly the top two tiers, 4 and 5) for both unlocking aircraft/tanks and the aircraft/tank modules.  Forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account, and even with a premium account, tier 5 vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game.  This ""grindy"" element adds a pay to win mechanic.Horribly F'd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics.  For a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity, it's a bit odd to me that it doesn't even take history into account when creating matchups for the vehicles.  This in addition to the fact that Gaijin's system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchups, so we now have a game that's  neither historical, nor is it balanced .A completely broken and unfinished ground forces.  It wasn't ready to be released in open beta, and none of the closed beta testers were pushing for a release.  Yet they did it anyway, and now we have this broken bug-fest filled with wonky damage models, invisible tanks, tiny maps, and useless terrain.The horrible damage models is not unique to the tanks.  War Thunder now has heavy bombers flying around and taking damage as if they were the Starship Enterprise.  Not to mention the flight models of these bombers also resemble the Enterprise as well.The development team is prioritizing prototype and failure aircraft over some of the real iconic workhorse aircraft of WW2.  In addition to this, development has now made it clear that they have plans to add certain paper planes (aka blueprint planes - Stuff that was never even built).A development team that often lies to their customer base and doesn't take constructive critisism from those customers seriously.  They have a very ""The customer is always wrong"" kind of attitude, one could say.The community management team in general does a bad job of running the forums.  A lot of them are truly passionate about the game and what they do, but they don't understand the roles of a moderator/administrator.  Then again, a lot of them are just immature children (some of them literally are children) that will delete your post, put you on a mod queue, or ban you simply because they feel like it.Alright, I know those last two weren't necessesarily complaints about the actual game, but I still feel like they needed mentioning.  The consumer has to know what they're getting into before downloading a game and cetainly before spending money on that game.  That being said, I've finally thrown in the towel with this game.  I can't recommend playing it in its current state, and I would definitly advise against spending any money on it.  People come for the pretty graphics, but they stay for good gameplay.As of now, War Thunder only has one of those two.  I wish Gaijin luck in the long run, as they'll truly need it.Thanks for reading.			",46,0,0,10,3,0,5

												Don't bother with this one.  Over my extensive play time, I have watched Gaijin take a promising, fun game and turn it in to something that is directly opposed to the wishes of their player base, from balance concerns to gameplay changes.  While the core gameplay is still solid and the graphics are honestly quite beautiful, the company behind this game is one of the most dishonest I've seen.  They actively censor any discussion of their game that paints it in a negative light, even going so far as to create a poll asking forum members to choose between changing core mechanics of a game mode, or issuing copyright strikes against any video that discusses hacking in War Thunder.  Add to that their absurdly draconian chat rules and the e-thug moderators that gleefully ban anyone who has the nerve to disagree with them, and you have an environment that is extremely hostile to free speech.  There are better flight games and better tank games out there.  Do not give Gaijin your money or your time.  They don't deserve it.			",171,19,1,39,10,0,25

												I played this game a lot and I had a lot of fun... but I fell out of love with it the last few months. I attributed it to burn-out, uninstalled it, and had no intention of leaving a review.But then I went to open Steam Friends in the taskbar. And I saw that snail icon. Gaijin has decided to make the War Thunder launcher actual, textbook malware. If you install this game, you will not get it off without manually scrubbing every file it touches off your system. Uninstall from Steam > Still ThereUninstall from Windows > Still ThereThird-Party Uninstaller > Still ThereThis wouldn't be so bad if it didn't rob your bandwidth by auto-updating whenever it pleases. Gaijin says ""this is an option, just turn it off"". But trust me, you can't. It will re-enable itself the next time you reboot. It refuses to die.Do not install this malware. Please use the flag button on the Store page to report this product, malware is completely unacceptable to be hosted by Steam and I would be surprised if defying the Steam uninstall isn't against their ToS.

												First of all, the good;This game has amazing graphics, and is incredibly optimized. I'm barely kidding when I say this thing could probably run on a toaster.This game has a huge variety of aircraft from all of the major players of ww2.For the most part, airplane flight models are accurate and well balanced based on real life statistics.There is a gamemode for everyone, want to play a highly realistic flight simulator mimicking real life? Simulator batles for you. Want an easier time but still a challenge, realistic flight models and mouse aim? Historical/realistic (the name changed). Just want to spam the cannons and mess around while pulling top gun maneuvers with flight models being only suggestions? Arcade has you covered.There is a decent variety of maps, varying across the world.Want to drive tanks and other vehicles? Go ahead and play ground forces.Beautifully detailed aircraft exteriors and interiors.But wait, with all of this great stuff, mostly gameplay and mechanics, why don't you recommend this?And here we get to the bad;Gaijin is very slow to implement updates to their game, and have consistently ignored player feedback/ suggestionz to make the game better, for absolutely no reason.Gaijin has consistently made game decisions with the intent of making money, to the detriment of players by;      Creating a system that limits progression by forcing players to purchase six aircraft in each of the five tiers in order to      progress on to the next tier.    Adding a research system as well as the purchasing system to force players to spend more time unlocking aircraft.    Reducing the money and research points earned for each kill and assist in game.    Create an upgrade system for each aircraft requiring you to spend time researching parts for your aircraft just to get it up to the stat characteristics it historically had    Gaijin have locked country flags behind a paywall to ""prevent insults by disrespecting flags"". However these flags are easily purchasable for real money.      For all of these there is a way to speed up the progression by spending real money. Gaijin have slowed down   progression to such a degree that you are almost forced to pay real money in order to progress in a decent fashion.  There is much that needs to be improved, for instance better flight models, a vast improvement to the leveling system and tiering system. Cockpit view for bombers and other heavy aircraft. What is not needed, and what is contantly added, is more premium (and expensive) aircraft., for the past couple of years during sales gaijin will raise the base price of a game and then discount it to such a degree that the final price will be the original price before the sale. This is a shady and unethical buisness practice.The endgame for war thunder (jet aircraft) is lackluster and unfinished, providing no motivation to stay once money has been given to gaijin.Finally, the tiering system, by which players are matched up against each other, is horribly inefficient and compressed, meaning players will be competing against far superior planes, and altogether making it unenjoyable for beginners.For these reasons, I cannot recommend war thunder to players for purchase. If you can play this game without paying any money, then by all means go ahead, but it has become harder and harder to justify paying for this game.This game has so much promise, and I desperately hope that all of these problems can be solved, however on the current path, it cannot reach it's full potential.

												Do not play this game. Do not give these Con men money.The only thing this game simulates is that Gaijin does not give 2 F**ks about its community. The patch today (23/09/15) proves this as a patch that was added, that was widely criticized by old and new plays was put into effect with a massive middle finger from Gaijin.3 Years I have wasted on this game, I loved this game with 2500 hours in all (played before it was added to steam) I just cannot support them anymore this was the final nail in the coffin.

												I have been playing War Thunder since patch 1.27, well before it was on steam and I can safely say War Thunder is a great game, it has many things to offer, but I could never recommend it. The reasons I would never recommend it are simple. The Grind is too harsh in the later game unless you pay for a premium account, something I used to do but no longer will ever again. The matchmaking took a turn for the worst many patches back now and Gaijin refuse to admit their failings (the matchmaking makes the late game -tier 4-5- excrusiatingly bad). The bugs, many of which have been around as long as I have played it, are prevelant and will, I assume, never be addressed. But the be all and end all reason I could never recommend War Thunder to anyone is that Gaijin don't care about their community, they couldnt care less about anyone playing the game unless they come from Russia and lets never get in to the horrible pains of dealing with customer support (it doesnt exist). At the very least if you do play War Thunder, don't ever give the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s your money.			",408,268,4,68,36,4,51

												After hundreds of hours on this, I can honestly say I cannot reccomend this game. The real issue is how ♥♥♥♥ed the battle rating system Gaijin implemented is. You may not notice it at first... but eventually it will drive you crazy. Because it will never be fixed, never. This is the second problem, the developer is actively hostile to player feedback. On the forums people's posts concerning negative aspects of the game are deleted by the moderating staff with no reason given. It's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company... The payment model, while fair, is horrendously overpriced, and never on sale. The grind for this game is absolutely insane. It takes soooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to grind out anything past tier 3 in aircraft that you will quickly grow sick of it. (Edit: By the way trolls, I'm saying this because I'm grinding out tier 5, not because I haven't gotten to tier 3... morons.)I wish I could reccomend this game, because at its core warthunder is one of the best flight sims out there (and when the match maker isn't being♥♥♥♥♥♥ games can be incredibly fun) but for the reasons stated above, I simply cannot. There are developers that treat their customers with a million times the respect that gaijin shows for its playerbase. Games like Warframe really show how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gaijin is about rewarding their playerbase and how bad their free to play model actually is.Save you time, save your money, play something else. Go outside, work out, you will feel a million times better about yourself than if you waste your time on this.Edit 1: To the commenters that say ""KEKEKEK Yall just suck at this game, git gud"" You will be deleted. That is not a valid criticism, and even if it were true it doesn't make any negative critique of the game invalid. I have seen frankly amazing players making the same criticisms of this game. I've been playing this game for years and have finally gotten fed up, if you are still enjoying the game I have no intention of taking that from you, I am only warning you that the things that annoy you about the game now are likely to be there for quite some time.Edit 2: I have had some time to cool down away from the game, and have even tried getting back into it for the 1.51 update. While I can say that I still have fun in this game from time to time I still cannot really reccomend it. Not yet anyway. They made some neat additions and added some cool planes, but really it's still the massive, frustrating time sink I remember. If you've only just started this game you can be forgiven for thinking that it's awesome. It is!... Until you try to be serious about progressing, then it turns from fun into literally pulling your hair out. I would reccomend trying this game, and then maybe playing for an hour or two every week but no more than that... It's hard to find a game to get your WWII flight sim fix these days, especially for free. So unfortunately it doesn't really have much in the way of competition. Once again, I wish I could reccomend this game but my opinion hasn't changed, spend your time and money on a game/developer that respects its players.			",105,22,1,19,9,0,10

												I'm a professional pilot with more warthunder hours then I have real flight hours and after all these almost 800 hours of warthunder I cannot recommend this game. Don't get me wrong I've had fun in this game in the past playing with friends and so on. But I have now reached the higher tiers of this game and I can tell you one thing. IT IS NOT WORTH IT. The devs went full retard and they will end up destroying what could've been an awesome game. I have 3 huge problems with the devs of this game and I will outline them below:1 - LACK OF BALANCE: Yes I like realism in games but to a certain extent.. games need to be fun.. and to be fun they need to be balanced. If you love playing with russian tanks and airplanes you will have a great time playing this game. If you prefer German or American and british units go ahead and buy yourself a lot of lube because they will sodomize THE LIVING S!""# OUT OF YOU.2 - RIDICULOUS MATCHMAKING: ""IN SOVIET RUSSIA YOU DO NOT CHOOSE MATCH... MATCH CHOOSES YOU"" that's right folks the matchmaking on this game is ridiculous. You can not choose which map you wanna play in. You don't even get to choose which theater of war you play in so if you take for example the TBF-AVENGER medium bomber used in the pacific 95% of the time matchmaking takes you to the battle of the bulge. And that's after you select REALISTIC battles on the matchmaking. And that's when you're lucky and they don't put you on a REALISTIC MIXED Battle against overpowered russians.3- BOMBERS: I've had a lot of fun with bombing missions in the lower tiers. So once I got around tier 3 with the brits I decided I wanted to unlock one of my fav bombers. The lancaster. So after like 700 hours of playing this game without putting money into it I decided it was maybe time to spend some money and save some time so I spent about 30 euros on golden eagles and insta-unlocked the Lancaster. What I can tell you now is that next time I'll just go outside and hand the 30 euros to someone and tell them to spit in my face and laugh out loud and call me stupid in russian because this is what Gaijin did to me. The lancaster (and any other high-tier bomber for that matter) is a great choice if you like to pleasure men. Thats what I've done on any mission I've flown with these bombers.. You spend like 10 minutes flying to a bomb target only to get intercepted by a jet fighter with enough armament that it prematurely ejaculates 1000 pounds of lead on you before your gunners even smell him cumming. 13/10 ""If you didn't hate russians before playing this game you will now ;)""			",88,1,1,2,8,0,9

												So, I just feel like this needs to go on record, and to actually say something about it. Now... I like WarThunder. It's probably one of the best online, WWII multiplayer flight-sims out there. American, Russian, British, German, and Japanese aircraft all make an appearance, so you can fly anything from the P-51 Mustang, to a Bf-109, and feel like you're actually in the cockpit. Heck, they've even recently added in tank combat, and are even going to be adding in naval warfare in the near future! That said, this game has gone completely down the toilets within the past several months.Lemme explain a bit of the history of the game. Awhile ago, there were ten tiers, and you used to have a level with all of the different factions (American, Russian, British, etcetera), that determined what aircraft you could buy, due to their tier. Lets say you managed to get up to tier 4 in American aircraft, right? Well, that means you could buy any aircraft that's from tier one, to tier four, but if you're only tier 2 in Germany, you can only buy up to tier 2 German aircraft. Get the idea? Right, good. Recently, they completely revamped their level up and tier system, making it so there are only five tiers (which condenses it by quite a bit), but instead of unlocking the next tier of aircraft, you could only unlock one aircraft at a time. This isn't really a bad idea... but the problem is, this also nearly quadrupled the amount of time it will take to unlock every aircraft of a certain faction. What's worse, is they lowered (by a *lot*) the amount of experience you earn per assist or kill, forcing you to slow down your leveling even further, and enhancing the amount of free exp you get per match, which just entices you to buy their premium currency so you can use said free experience. It has turned this game into a slog of a grind that makes progression rediculously slow and boring.The method of experience is by far one of my biggest gripes, I'll admit. It's a sickeningly underhanded method of encouraging players to spend money on the game, to buy the premium currency so you can spend your free experience. I don't usually mind ""pay to progress"" games, they're usually not too terrible, but this one is rediculous. It makes World of Tanks' progression seem like a breeze.On to the next hit against this game: balancing. With the aforementioned condensing of the tier system into only five tiers, Gaijin thought it would be clever to introduce a Battle Rating system, to compensate, and to avoid having biplanes going up against end-of-war aircraft. This isn't really so bad, and it probably could have even been a good idea, had they implemented it correctly. You'd expect the Battle Rating system to be based off of the aircraft (or tank's) stats, and understanding that something like say... a P-40 Kittyhawk, or an F6F Hellcat would be a fair match against an A6M3 Zero, as they fought against one another in the actual war. Right? Well... that's a nice thought, but it's not how it works. See, their battle rating system is based entirely on the performance of the aircraft in player hands. The better someone does with an aircraft, the higher its battle rating within its own tier. This is inherently flawed; while someone might do well in an aircraft, that does not necessarily mean that it is able to go against something better than it, and still win. An A6M3 Zero can see fights against aircraft that were built several *years* after their initial development, because their battle ratings are similar. This is horribly wrong, and does not do anything to make a game fun, or balanced.And, on to the last topic of my complaints. This is actually a rather common one amongst most of the player base, and - while I'm normally not one to base something on unfounded theories and accusations, you'd think that since the majority of WarThunder's player base seems to agree on this fact, it must be true to some degree. Russian aircraft, and tanks, are given unfair advantages, and handicaps. Bet you thought I was going to say overpowered, huh? Well... I won't, because most of their aircraft did function to the specs given in WarThunder. However. This does not mean that their questionable damage models, unrealistic flight models and characteristics, and their absolutely rediculously favoritism'd battle ratings, are fair. To elaborate: Russian aircraft have damage models that seem to soak up a lot of damage without the plane actually registering said hits (players coin this term as the aircraft being made of ""Stalinium""). Russian aircraft also have very... generous climb and turn rates, and this weird ability to dive faster, accelerate faster, and keep their momentum longer, than almost every aircraft, even those that were historically faster and better in a dive, a turn, or a climb (An Ishak monoplane from 1934 diving faster than an F4U Corsair, for example). And lastly, they seem to have this... preferential treatment when it comes to their battle rating (LA-5Fn having a battle rating of 4.0 even though it's a 1944 aircraft, whereas the P-51D-30 Mustang has a battle rating of 4.7, with worse stats, armament, and durability).Despite all these bad things I said, WarThunder is still fun every now and then. Personally, I think it would be even better if they fixed all of the balancing issues and horribly slooooow progression they have going. It's gone from an interesting and exciting game, to a boring, slogfest of a grind that just isn't fun anymore. But who knows, maybe it's just me? Give it a try for yourself. Its worth the download. Just don't be surprised if it takes you several *weeks* to get out of the starting planes and/or tanks.			",155,14,2,21,17,0,20

												after 500+ hours on this game i can honestly say that i dont reccomend it. As much as it pains me to say that, in the current state the game is absolutely broken, especially german tanks and planes. The german planes are broken, and the german tanks are underpowered and completely outmatched by their american and russian counterparts, and the recent update to the BR system means that uptiered rank III and IV tanks get to fight russian T-10M's and IS-4's with 120mm of armor on all sides and literally unpennable from the front. all while the starting german tier V tanks arent even that good, starting tanks on that tier are the 10.5cm Tiger II (a Tiger II (H) with a slightly bigger gun), Panther II (Panther F with a slightly bigger gun), Coelion (SPAA so useless against most tanks anyways) and the Jagdtiger (Tiger II without a rotating turret and a bigger gun) which are literally no different from their tier IV counterparts besides the armament, meaning that you can be detonated with the force of a thousand suns from any direction, while you cant pen anything from the front unless its a light tank. The planes are also unbearable because of how slow the german planes turn, it takes close to 25 seconds to make a full 360 degree turn in the fockewolf, while the BF is better its still slow, you simply cant keep up with the meanuverability of other planes and as a result you are always killed. Russian planes are overpowered, shooting gigantic rounds that detonate your plane instantaniously if it hits your plane. As much as i want this game to be good it just isnt anymore, untill the devs get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together I cant reccomend this game.			",72,5,7,4,9,0,3

												Why I liked and played this game: 1) I mostly played Ground Forces. Tanks look bad♥♥♥♥♥ The noise of the tracks, the sound of the engine, the force of the gun. The dirt that would pile on the tank when shots landed nearby. It was awesome. 2) No health points. Your tank died once the crewmen inside it died. Either through the tank getting shot and shrapnel spraying inside the tank, or a fire/explosion caused by your ammo/fuel taking a hit.3) Disabling tanks depending on where you shot them. Depending on where you hit/or get hit, different things would happen. If the driver or engine is hit the tank can't move. If the gunner is hit the tank can't shoot. If the loader is hit the tank can't load another round. If the turret is hit you can't shoot or move it.  4)Driving around in what seemed like realistic tanks. The terrain you're driving around also looks amazing. Great graphics.What made me uninstall:Realising how horribly unbalnced the game really is and that it's never getting better. Only worse with every patch that comes out. Russian bias. Developer is a Russian company and they provide unhistorical advantages to russian vehicles. 1.Russian ammo is coded to cause more fires than american/german ammo. 2.Russian ammo is coded to have more explosions than american/german ammo. 3.Russian tanks are coded to have a less chance to explode/catch on fire than american/german tanks. 4.Russian tanks are coded to bounce more shells. 5.Other tanks will wobble and screw your aim when moving or coming to a hard stop. Not russian tanks. 6.I saw a friend go from 3-4 average tanks destroyed per match to 8-10 when he switched to Russian tanks.All of this I ignored. The cards are stacked against you if not playing Russian tanks, but It was possible to make up for it with skill, tactics, and picking the right tanks to fight them. The last few patches just proved they won't stop stacking the cards. The highest tier is unbalanced and avoided due to Russian OP tanks. Instead of fixing the problem, they patched the game and changed the matchmaking to force players from the second highest tier to fight against them. WW2 tanks forced to fight post WW2 cold war tanks. Russian WW2 tanks allowed access to post WW2 cold war ammo. And now with the latest patch they introduced a new spotting/cammo system which makes a tank practically invisible unless you spend money to buy points to spot them. Every tank has a rating that determines their chance to be spotted.  Guess who it favors more? Russian tanks have a 40% advantage compared to American/German tanks. And if that wasn't enough, they wen't and nerfed the distance at which you could aim for everyone. The way I survived and did well vs the Russian Bias was to snipe them from long distances. Now they took that away. Well that's it. I'm done with this. One of the most stupidly unbalanced/unfair games I have ever played. This game will never have a competitive scene and it's player base is declining. Don't waste your time on it.			",10,0,0,2,0,0,0

												Been playing this game for 2 years and after patch 1.35, the devs have been making idiotic, game breaking decisions one after the other. Whats worse is that when you try to tell them about it, they either ignore you or ban you. The recent patch completely killed it for me, despite the fact that this game was the go to thing for me on a computer for the past 24 months. I actually have two and a half months of play time because I started playing it before it went on steam. It still looks great but if you use maximum visual settings ,you will be at a disadvantage in both air and especially ground battles. And if that won't kill it for you, the awful lack of balance will.			",60,1,2,1,1,0,15

Because developers say the Soviets were literally too OP back at WW2 and theres nothing they can do about it.And just so you know, I took out a Kingtiger with my T-34.. Now I believe(!) that the propaganda video on youtube about T-34 destroying 25 Tigers is actually real... <<This, my friend is the proof of what this game turns you into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We thought ok... its time to give back to us for being so helpful and devoted in providing everything and anything requested (even if it had nothing to do with the request) we provided it. For months we tried to help WarThunder to help us, patient, super nice people that just got screwed worse than a hooker at a five and dime. Could not believe the HUGE loads (check my hands) of money we have spent, and sadly... and then the comprehensible (HOLY F*ck we what a word!)Back to the story... while away for a week with my son being born (truly freaking exciting past the point of pee!!! ), we returned as many do after many missed updates (9 to be exact in 2 weeks) We return to find all our money(gold and coin) items(planes and tanks) gone, along with all experience and funds.. just a blank account. Now to be fair, there was a post saying some updates had data dumps ect... just send us a screenshot and proof and we will do this and that.... ok... so we did.Account not compromised, black and white proof of purchases, no acitivity on my end and they did nothing! Did not even bother to read the complaint, responded with requesting this and that and then redundantly doing it over and over.. with nothing to resolve in the complaint. So what was a legit complaint now has 8 more things piled on... but now they expected us to go away... so we asked and pleaded. Stated we had proof and sent it more times over than you see boobies on TV!We received a reply that was... for the lack of a better word(s)... MOTHER EXPLATIVE EXPLATIVE... after ALL THE pateince AND respect, fulfilling request after request, for over a 3 months while unable to play!! (Listen people, you can dress a turd and call it chocolate, but its still SH*T!)It was their (WarExplative) turn to do for us! Three months enough, I believe it is reasonable not to ask any more repititious questions and cater to them. We said ""there is nothing more we can send you that we havent already."" A week later we were returned to an email bearing the surreal.... ""we dont care if you leave, your a bumb♥♥♥♥♥american and we have a million users that spend money, goodbye dumb American."" from SERGI. So now we research and got attorneys looking into things because of the email. They reached dead end after dead end with the same name coming up as the sole person responsible located in Russia.Explative, few more dirty words and gestures, and then sad face...!There is no need for that! Unprovoked... bah.... oh I hope Mr. Karma checks this many times over and pays SERGI and the team behind him dearly.We wont even focus much on the statement of ignorance, even if anyone does not like us for being from the USA, but hey, spread more racism and hate! Who's stopping you SERGI right? You sure like our/anyones hard earned  money tho.It proved what we read from others and didnt believe for over a year, being fair like we always are.Always two sides to the coin... but in this case and thousands of others, the complaints just keep mounting and are legit. So we call all the numbers we could find to discover one person... SERGEI... (Stupid Mother F*cker for short) handles all their USA complaints as the big man.Ok so nothing I can do, or say, but sorry I was born in a country you dont like. (Here's a gun, use it as a toothpick you racist pig.)In Closing;You would think on the business side... here is a great repeat customer, legit to our requests, patient, and proved they had all securities in place, proven NO activity on the account from anyplace on the globe, and provided what we had and spent over the past year from their (WTF) own records... so lets give these items back to him and figure out where they went... but NO... not one reply had anything to do with our request. But because he from the USA... wow... just no words.While they have the ""loose one wont break the company"" mentality, those who supported their game and company for a year and still giving them a chance... with one complaint with legit backing and proof provided... and what did we get... A HUGE D*C* in the AS* with a side order of HUGE (Plenty of follow thru) SLAP then BEATING in our face! So after this for just a polite simple request that even had humor in it, and a proven complaint with legit screenshots and purchase information, there is nothing they can do or say to justifiy it as training as more than one CS agent in all our tickets repeated the same thing.No excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people with proven legitimate complaints that were poilite, respectful and gave them everything and then some to their requests.  Sad it took us a year for our first problem to discover such terrible abuse! Dont find out what we did, it may not happen in a month or a year but if you have anything you need for your account, simple or extensive... good luck.. go talk into a fan and have someone pour acid thru the other side... it would at least give back! (ok.... dont really do it, no one should hurt themselves over these terrible people who f*ck people over daily man or woman)World of Tanks or World of War Planes or World of Warships is where your money is appreciated and respected we have also supported for years as well... at least they are fair, read the complaints, share and compare facts and still even if you are found to be somewhat incorrect or interpret something incorrect, they take care of you, no issue, no hassle in my two prior problems in six years.Discalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

												I have played this game for.. Well, an almost embarrassingly long time. Even prior to its release on steam I played this game nonstop for a number of months. It has only been in the last six or so months that the game has soured entirely. The developers, a delightful company based in Russia called Gaijin, used to put the highest focus on gameplay and balance. They listened to the community and actually handled feed back rather well. Yet, oddly, in the last several months they seem to have put their focus on more features, more glitter in their game. They have gotten rid of the community involvement in many of the groups that have formed around the game, most noteably Reddit. (The community manager with Gaijin was removed) The community as a whole has made countless attempts to bring issues with the game to the dev's attention and have repeatedly and consistently been ignored and in some cases players were banned for voicing their concerns. Game play wise, is this game fun? The answer to that question is, ""It can be."" Every once in a while you might get that golden blue moon match where you're not being completely stomped by some fellow in a KV-2 and any of the heavy Russian tanks. It could be fun depending on what you drive/fly. If you prefer US tanks or planes, I wouldn't recommend trying. The Russian and German trees are a bit more enticing if you don't want to be clubbed. The main issue with the game right now is balance, or lack thereof. Shermans against Tiger IIs, 262s against Sabres, short barreled tanks being put on maps that consist of an open field with a hill in the middle trying to play against a team of long barreled snipers. Stuff of this nature is common and expected in this game and I can't bring myself to put up with it any more. (Why I'm finally writing this review.)			",157,15,3,13,29,0,40

Product received for free
												I started playing the Game back in 2013 (Patch 1.27) and it was great. Since then the Game gradually went downhill. The Introduction of an excruciating, unnessecary Vehicle/Module Grind (especially at High Era Vehicles) and the outright broken Battle Rating System. Combined with the sheer amount of broken Features and the dismissal behaviour of Gaijin to Community Feedback, in addition to their Soviet-/Cold War Mentality made me stop Playing the Game a long Time ago.The GrindBarely noticeable at low Level Vehicles it will soon begin to get ridiciulous at Mid to High Era Planes where some unlockable Modules will cost more RP than most of the Era 3-4 Planes.Starting with Patch 1.31, Gaijin continiously reduced the Credit/RP income which forces you at some point to buy a Premium Account and/or overpriced Premium Vehicles. Btw: Don´t bother to convert your Free RP via Gold as the Conversion Rate isn´t worth your Money (1:45 Ratio)Battle RatingsThe Battle Rating System was originally designed to replace the Static 20-Tier System but made the Gameplay with every new major Patch procedural worse as more and more Vehicles are compressing the BR Brackets, resulting in Mid-WW2 Planes sealclubbing Pre-WW2 Biplanes or Korean War Jets clubbing late WW2 Prop Planes. Since its introduction Gaijin claims that the BR System is working as designed which simply isn´t true.GaijinGaijin went from an open, transparent Company to ignorant, nationalistic Bigots who don´t give a damn about their European/American Playerbase, effectively shielded by their Forum Mods/Community Managers from any constructive Criticism and have an openly sycophancy attitude towards Gaijin. Many of those Mods often resort to trolling and outright abusing their Powers against regular Players. Even Youtuber/Streamer are affected.Historical Accuracy and BalanceTo give them Credit, Gaijin manages to recreate Aircraft/Tank Models with great Details but that´s it. On multiple occasions many Tanks and Planes were ""corrected"" via ""Secret Documents"" from unverified Russian/Soviet Sources and were thus stripped from certain Equipment Modules and/or recieved inferior Performance Characteristics compared to their Real-World Counterparts. Most of these were applied to Non-Russian Vehicles. At the same time, many Russian Vehicles recieved considerable buffs (the Best example being Post-War Ammunition added to T-34/T-44/IS-2 Tanks).This Russian Bias - which is constantly being denied by Gaijin - killed the Game for many of the Players.tl;dr - I can´t recommend this Game anymore			",92,6,3,14,17,0,28

												P͇r͇o͇s͇:+ Game looks awesome even on low settings+ Planes are somewhat fun+ Few last patches made even ground forces fun+ You can pretty much choose type of game depending on your skills and preferable gamestyle:You like madness, fast action and easy kills without the need of strategical thinking? Then just jump right into action and have fun in AB (Arcade battles). Gametype you want to start with to learn weakneses of enemy planes/tanks and how to do basic stuff.Are you little more experienced or you don't like arcadey experience you get in AB? Do you want to actually hide and wait for enemy without red marker over your or your enemies head, forcing you to actually look for enemy? Do you like to play more strategically depending on your vehicle, waiting for your enemy to make a mistake, so you can make your move? then RB (Realistic battles) is just for you. Vehicles in this game mode have more realistic controlls and performace.And for the most experienced players there is SB (Simulator battles). This is the most hardcore experience you can get...no markers even for your allies, so you need to be carefull what you shoot at because it can be your allie. No 3rd person view of tank/plane, only tank commader/pilot view. Realistic aiming for tanks, where you need to count with guns offset relative to the sights.

(you want to play this awesome premium tank we just put in game? No problem! You just need to buy this awesome bundle containing 2 virtual tanks and 2 virtual planes with price of the new AAA game!)- Slowly becoming ""World of prototypes"" with all the experimental and testing purpose tanks lately getting into game.- They are not focusing on adding WW2 vehicles and armored cars like they said they will after finishing Brit tank tree (almost a year now and not a single new armored car added) #PrayforPumaWith50mm- Top tier tank battles = ATGM spam now. Not a fun to play currently. - Low tier Brit tanks with APDS ruining your day no matter the armor you have. (yeah poor Ferdi with its good armor, low speed and maneuverability is so rare nowaday just thanks to brit tanks with APDS making a swiss cheeze out of it or getting ATGMed by Strv81)6/10 best game ever -IGNPs: don't forget that soviets now have cold war tank boat capable of killing almost every german tank with its post war UFO 200mm pen ammo and 7s reload at BR 5.7 which is same as Tiger I. Much wow gaijinPss: So you want to enjoy match with leopard 1? Yeah thats enemy team full of scrubs spawing in ZSU 57-2. Have fun comrade			",103,6,2,10,10,0,2

												I used to love this game but I have reached my limit. I have watched the company become gradually more and more opressive but managed to convince myself that it was just a phase. The change came when I discovered that in response to a video showing a major hack the CEO (yes, the person who runs the company) posted a poll asking us to choose between making the hack a permenant feature of the game or issuing copyright strikes agains ALL people who bring up such issues on youtube or other social media.NO MORE. I will not tolerate such blatantly (and I tried really hard to find an alternative phrasing here) Stalinist methods.Never again will I play this game. Never again will I knowingly give this company any money.For the sake of all that is right and good, DO NOT play this gameEDIT: at the request of some friends I have started playing the game again, but rest assured. I will NEVER give them any of my money.			",71,9,0,16,27,0,27

												I really loved the WT while it was in open beta. It really was historically accurate with real plane statistics and I welcomed the WT as modernized IL-2 1946. However in the last few years this game went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Somehow russian planes have the best engines, best aerodynamics and weapons. While in reality these were one of the worst flying planes out there. Same goes for tanks. I mostly play US tanks and the fact that M36 can't penetrate T34 up front is just simply BS. Also the magical power of T34 grants you immortality since you can bounce off 128mm german shells that ripped this piece of technological disaster to pieces. No. Just no Gaijin. Stop it. You're killing your own game because some idiot in the management decided russia to be the best nation of WW2 while in reality it was one of the worst, looking both from political or technological view.The change of matchmaking makes you go with US starter tank go against T34 1942 which is balanced af. Same goes for planes and everything in the game. Once they said that there won't be any prototypes, yet Germany and Russia got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of prototypes including E-100 (Wasn't even fully constructed ever) and Maus. I don't really get why are devs sh**tingng into their own mouths with all this.Another problem is the historical accuracy at all since US planes have weak engines, UK weapons are innefective and the glorious Russian planes have best stats at everything. The fact that russian vehicles overall had many problems, for example the transmittion on T34 lasted for 30-50km after being completely damaged. The fact that T34 goes for about 30km/h on a terrain is just simple BS. it couldn't go above 15 km/h in terrain due to crappy transmittion. And to shift to 4.th gear you would need some sort of superhuman power. The fact that every russian plane can catch up to US plane is BS aswell. Most of the russian planes had problems with weak engines followed by overheating. Just play some IL-2 1946 and you'll see what I'm talking about.In overall, due to russian bias in first place, terrible matchmaking on the second place and the great responsivity of the devs I really don't reccomend this piece of WW2 russian biased BS.

												I have way more hours than Steam says, simply because I started playing before it was even on Steam. But thats not my point really.I have probably put 2 thousand hours and several hundred dollars into this game, and if you had asked me a year or 2 ago if I recommneded it, I wouldve said yes, all the way. But now, the game is a broken mess that infuriates me more than it entertains me. Where do I even begin?Country bias is strong, being a Russian game, the Russian planes are incredibly overpowered, and dont even think about getting within a kilometer of a Russian tank. The customer support base is terrible. Instead of rolling out tweaks and fixes that players have been asking for for over a year, they simply add more planes to the Russian tree and maybe a few to the others and further mess up the system that is so badly in need of balancing.To do anything above tier 3 in anything short of a human life time you will need to pay for a premium account, and even then, you better play realistic battles (which in my opinion are not nearly as fun as Arcade), AND EVEN THEN you better have paid $20+ for a Premium Aircraft.  No, this game has just become too much of a ""Pay to Win"" cash cow for Gaijin, rather than focusing on making it a fun experience for everyone, no matter what country or game type someone wants to play.I think the best line I've seen that descibes this game now is, ""Grind 'till you die...or pay up.""*EDIT*This may be a petty gripe, but I think it sums up how little the developers care about their user base.  Most online games give stuff away for the Holiday season, right?  Gaijin begs to differ. You can earn 2 very low tier vehicles.... if you complete 19 challanges that are released over 19 days. NINETEEN. And they are shoot down 30 planes in ""inset plane here"" and destroy 40 tanks in ""insert tank here.""Not only are the rewards crap, the amount of work required and amount of time you have to grind is insane. No discounts on the overpriced planes, overpriced premium accounts, or overpriced premium currency have been offered either.So Gaijin's ""Merry Christmas"" to their user base is basically a giant, grindy middle finger. A rather apt comparison to what the entire game has become over the last year.*EDIT 10/12/2015*New Matchmaking system put into tier 4.Somehow, SOMEHOW, they have found an even more unbalanced and infuriating system.On paper it sounds great, having teams put together so that they have an entire BR covrage, with a few higher BR people, middle of the rodd BR people, and lower BR people all on one team, instead of an entire team of Tigers.Theoretically it should be great, but in game it is the worst thing to happen since the implementation of the Battle Rating system.I played a total of 9 games as a 6.7 on US and USSR, and in every single game I was going up against 8.0s, and would get one shotted.What this new system means, in basic terms, is that it is garunteed that every game there will be a handful of players who will completely dominate because they have a BR advantage over almost every single other person in the game.And while that person might be you one game, I played 9 games and was always, always, ALWAYS, at the bottom of the BR list.It is terrible, no other word for it, completely and utterly terrible.I have an idea, how about games where there is 0 - 0.5 BR spread, instead of 1 BR spread, because the 1 BR spread now is completely unfair (more so than it was before, even).And of course, 90% of people in game are complaining about it, no one likes it, but the forums have an absence of this overwhelming opinion.Why? Because Gaijin is cracking down harder than ever and deleteing, locking, and banning players and posts that show any kind of displeasure with any new game additions.When Britt tanks are released I might try again.*EDIT 4/11/16So I'm still not giving War Thunder a Recommendation. Why? Because it is Crack.I hate it, and I hate what it does to me and my bank account, but I can't stop playing it, even if I play it far less than I used to I still play it several times a week.But under no circumstances would I recommend it to a friend, still.There have been some improvements, but not nearly enough to return it to its former glory.Save yourselves, don't get sucked in.

												Edit/Update: As of late 2014 and early 2015, there has been some considerable improvements on the part of the developers to adress the issues that me and many other reviewers have outlined in the past. The representatives are more involved with the English speaking community and most of the balance issues are being corrected, albeit slowly. With the addition of the US Army land forces faction as well as considerable efforts, I am not so certain of the not recommended review, the game itself has huge potential and will only get better as more content is created for it. I will leave the review as it is however do take a chance and try the game out since it is free, purchasing something is your decision of course.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------By now most of the reviews at the Store Page of this game are negative, this alone probably communicates what the community feels accurately enough. However most of the highest voted reviews were written as an outrage towards a previous patch which had changed the unlocking method for new vehicles in game. This review will hopefully touch on a different more important issue with this game.I have played and enjoyed War-thunder for more than a year now, but stopped a while a back due to bad design decisions and overall negative behaviour from the devs. I still followed the forums and various communities however in the hopes that things might get better. At it's core it is truly an incredible game. Even with many difficult issues with the developers, I still find myself missing the thrill of flying or driving well rendered WWII machines.The most glaring flaw with this could-be-incredible game is the crew behind it. On multiple occasions the team behind the game have shown that they do not respect their player base, ridiculing and mocking them at every opportunity.Recently after more than two years of outcry and demands from the players, the devs finally agreed to implement a 'Player Council' type of system, we have seen such initiatives from other devs in other games so this was a welcome change. However soon it became apparent that this was yet another PR move that ultimately ended up with an arrogant fit towards the players.The community council representative that would have been chosen by the community is required (by the devs) to play the game at minium consecutively for 90 days, every day (rumours of 7 hours per week requirement) to simply keep his position. The unacceptable demands and restrictions had began. Also as a response for the currently broken system of balancing vehicles a community manager argued (with terrible unintelligible English I might add) that the community council representative can not simply relay problems of the players, no that's not enough, instead what he has to do is to provide thousand page analysis for all the 350+ Planes in the game and their real life performance to the devs FREE OF CHARGE.That's right, the developer expects a member of the community to do their job for them free of charge to be able to simply PROPOSE changes to the inherently deeply flawed balancing system. After all that work and effort the devs reserve the right to simply ignore the proposed changes (which is their default behaviour by now)It is easy to see past their deception. They simply answer like a bully to challenge the community to come up with a better system. “Read more then come back” Funnily enough people did write long essays about certain planes being unrealistic in game, providing photographic evidence. They got mocked in their own threads which then got locked and deleted when they started to be posted around. Devs lock and delete any and all criticism from their forums to provide a 'perfect' atmosphere for new comers, instead of working on the issues that are present in this 'Open Beta' game.Another salt in the wound is that whenever a huge issues comes up and draws backlash from the players, everyone that complains gets the rough treatment, for months they are mocked and insulted by the team only for them to implement a change in line with the complaints months after, with the undertone that they came up with the idea themselves, or did it out of the kindness of their hearths.This show of arrogance bordering insulting behaviour is common place today with this game. So as much as I like what the core game represents in terms of potential, such scummy behaviour is unacceptable.  As a long time fan of this game (one that was waiting impatiently for the Navy side) and as a customer that spent money on this game; I hope this game fails, not out of spite but to demolish such a negative possible influence on future developers. No matter how good your game is, or how entitled the devs see themselves, it is completely unacceptable to insult, mock and belittle dedicated fans.Thank you for reading.			",47,4,0,9,11,0,33

												Pre Patch 1.37 Rating - 8/10 GreatPost Patch 1.37 Rating - 1/10 Absolutely Horrible (Bad business ethics delevoper Gaijin)I have to give this game two ratings. One for pre-patch 1.37 and one for post-patch 1.37 which was introduced mid-Dec'13.My opinion of this game (and the Russian developer Gaijin) basically went from a full positive thumbs up to an absolute full thumbs down rating since the release of the latest patch 1.37 mainly due to the way the developer has handled it by misleading, lying and cheating their existing customer base.I have basically stopped playing what was one of my favorite games since they have released the last patch.Part of this decision is based on the in-game changes they made to the game in the patch but even more reason was the horrible way that Gaijin handled this and treated their customers and player base. To summarize, the most significant changes in latest patch 1.37 introduced some new aircraft, changed the tiering system, progression system and matchmaking for battles.While there were some positives in 1.37 like new aircraft and flight models, the negatives far outweigh the positives.They have condensed the previous aircraft tiering system from 20 levels into 5 tiers which is far less transparent in terms of leveling and has caused terrible matchmaking where you are now often flying against aircraft which are either far inferior or superior to you.The worst and most underhanded change however has been the progression system whereby you advance to unlock new aircraft. The developer Gaijin falsely advertised prior to releasing 1.37 that this new progression system would be quicker but it has been proven by many players thru posting of clear calculations and spreadsheets that it is in fact the exact opposite and much slower.Previously you leveled each country from 1 to 20 and unlocked multiple aircraft per country each level.Under the new 5 tier system, you are forced to unlock one aircraft at a time and funneled into having to use the previous aircraft in the research tree to unlock the next. As a result  the new progression system has proven to be 4-5 x slower than it was previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft in the higher levels.The result of all of this is that the developer has essentially covertly thru this patch increased the price and devalued their in-game currency (GE-Golden Eagles) by 4-5 times what it was pre-patch!!!Since it is a F2P game, it essentially means that if you decide to buy a monthly subscription it will now take you probably 4-5 months longer you need to subscribe than previously to unlock the same amount of aircraft.And I am not talking about a just a few hours here....it will now take you literaly hundreds of hours more to unlock the higher level aircraft.For newcomers who are joining after patch 1.37 you will of course not notice any of this as you have nothing to compare the current pricing and progression but just be warned that this could happen again. I would not trust this developer again!As a customer who bought a steam pack with a subscription and a lot of GE in-game currency before the new patch I feel totally ripped off!Gaijin of course has the right to change their prices post-patch. It is their own risk or reward decision. When it comes however to devaluing the in-game GE currency for people who purchased prior to the patch at an advertised rate it is downright unethical what they have done. I have stopped playing this game as a result and I guess will never use my GE left on my account unless Gaijin makes a total turnaround and admits thier very questionable business ethics and turning their backs on previous customer base.I have lost total respect for this developer Gaijin for this and also after many people complained on their website forums about these changes and posting proof of  that the new progression system was falsely advertised and the currency de-valued, they simply deleted and ignored posts.  The WT moderators here on Steam also delete any posts which are in any way critical of these very questionable business ethics of Gaijin. I've never seen such kind of crazy censorship towards their own customers as I've seen on both the Gaijin and Steam War Thunder forums in my life.I really feel this developer should be blacklisted from selling any further products on Steam unless they offer some compensation to their customers who were caught up in this scam of suddenly overnight de-valuing their in-game currency that was bought previous to the patch.UPDATE: May 14th ->I AM CLOSING THIS REVIEW FOR ANY FURTHER COMMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEW PATCH 1.39.MY REVIEW WAS BASED ON 1.37 AND DISPLEASURE WITH THE WAY GAIJIN HANDLED THAT IN TERMS OF THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND BASICALLY DE-VALUING CUSTOMERS PURCHASED GE's AND IN-GAME CURRENCY WITHOUT NOTICE OR COMPENSATION.I PERSONALLY HAVE DELETED THE GAME FROM MY PC in JANUARY AFTER 1.37 AND HAVE NO INTENTION TO RETURN AND SUPPORT THIS COMPANY EVEN IF THEY MAY HAVE FINALLY MADE IMPROVEMENTS. WISH YOU ALL GOOD GAMING!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, after 1500 hours in this game I can't play anymore, not because there is nothing new on the game but because the developers of this game are killing it. Changing and changing game modes carrying the game to the hell, and refusing to listen to the players. Play it if you want, but you must quit right after you fall in love with it.

												At first it is fun but then the horrible and unbalanced gameplay shows, as in:1. I haz anti aircraft unit in battle? Me gonna wipe out entire enemy tank company with ma anti aicraft unit armed with a death ray.2. Description will be available soon.3. Random number chances in a game about realism? They got wot!?!?! A Tiger 1 Tank? Don't worry Comrade, chances are every shot that Tiger tank does (even at historically deadly ranges of up to 2000 yards) will deflect on my T34 tank even if it is a shot at the rear of said T34 tank.4. If you still want to play the game or are relatively new to the game avoid the hours when people who play this in a near religious zeal come out to play (they all seem to come from the one time zone and their tanks majority of which in tier 2 and 3 battles are the T34 tank, they are also pimped up, in fact each tank resembles a Communist parade float and not a freaking machine of war), you will quickly find out what I am talking about.5. A Soviet T34 tank can somehow survive a close proximity shot from a Stug III F variant+, you know the vehicle designed by the Axis during the war to provide close fire support to infantry that was also used primarily to knock out pill boxes and other entrenched positions, then later it was used as a tank destroyer in combined arms Panzer divisions.6. The Pz 38t Aus F is a tier 1 tank that is well protected and you would think ""wtf is this talk about the Soviet tank bias?"" but then you quickly find out as you advance in the tiers and unlock and play with new tanks that the majority of the German Panzer tanks have the exact same armor config as the Pz38T Aus F tank and in battles consisting of tier 2 tanks (yes the very next tier), 50 by 30 by 30 armor config is not going to protect you from instant death especially against Soviet tanks that for the majority of them have deadly HE (high explosive) ammunition, said ammo can kill your entire crew (and knock your tank out) if the shell hits (keep in mind historically the Soviets up until 1942 had many different types of ammo for their tanks and for the most part they were all ineffective against German armor, this changed with the introduction of the improved T34 which also led to the rise of the MBT concept).7. There is no penalty in tank battles when someone jumps into an aircraft and does a kamikazi run on you, considering that this act is a deliberate death in an attempt to knock your unit out, also the fact that in air battle gameplay modes the killing of your own team mates deducts end game credits really begs why such a similar act in tank battles is not further frowned upon (there is in the form of bonus credits an incentive to try and make your aircraft survive until the timer runs out but the incentive is too small for most people to even bother about it). 8. Axis units progressively get worse in actual gameplay performance vs Allied nations units, an example is the paper thin armor on Japanese aircraft vs the nearly indestructible Soviet aircraft (same tier). ""Son that aint a ""heavy fighter"" at all"". Also see points 4 and 5.9. As a free 2 play game it is obvious that grinding will be included yet what does not make sense is that when you unlock a new tier of vehicles you cannot purchase (you can still research it, no problems there) a tank that you really wanted unless you have purchased the tank in the previous tier that preceded it, for example say you wanted the infamous Tiger 1 tank (tier 3) but don't like the look and bulky feel of the Panzer III M (tier 2), well bad luck then as you are forced to purchase the Panzer III M before you are allowed to purchase the Tiger 1 (the next tank in the chain).10. Victory day celebrations did not have discounts on German tanks.11. Not sure if hackers or just the weirdness of lag but sometimes you get shot at through solid rock (I have the replay to prove it).12. All the above could become moot if they would rework the matchmaking, since as it stands currently it is now only about matching similar tiers of tanks to each other, nothing is considered in regards to individual player skill (the game keeps track of your ""service record"" so why not go further and match players with like ""service records""). The game will eventually (if not already) become unfriendly to new players.13. Not really the fault of the developer but base campers ruin the game, only willing to advance forward when more experienced players are willing to do the majority of the dirty work (this could also be made moot if the dev reworked the matchmaking (see point 12)).14. This is not a net issue as I have a fiber optic connection but sudden and massive drops in FPS from sub 60 to around the ~15 frames per second mark, this happens rarely but always at the most inconvenient rage inducing times.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In conclusion, the game is visually impressive it also has (at least early on in tier 1) that ""one more game"" feel however once you advance beyond tier 1 you quickly learn just how unbalanced the game is and how some included underlying mechanics and design decisions ruin the game, Keep in mind that I have been playing video games since the late Atari 2600 days and the first ever tank game that I played was 'Conqueror' by Ocean Software (a 1988 PC game designed for 286 computers with CGA/EGA or VGA monitors), War Thunder is very similar to that game in that it is also an external camera view 3D (but with real basic low poly 3D graphics) game, however it was single player only and I must say 'Conqueror' makes much more sense then this, since in 'Conqueror' a Kv1 tank going up against a Panther or Tiger tank is 9 out of 10 times going to get wasted while in this, it is more about is the random number generator in my favor and also is the damn Soviet tank equipped with HE rounds or not?Edit: Reworked for clarification some of the points listed in the review.

												I'm going to split this review into sections so it's clearer and not just one long rant. I'm going to cover the Air combat but alot of this applies to ground combat aswell.TL;DR at the bottomCommunity++++++++If I could go back to old Warthunder (Pre 5 tier system) I would still play this game daily. This started as a great game but the dev team is just so STUPID. They constantly implement pointless and unwanted features. They don't listen to their community at all and if you so much as hint at it not being good on there website you will be instantly and permenantly banned from their forums and the moderaters for the English forums barely even speak English. (Probally with a few exceptions). This game is mostly made of new players because the devs drove away all of the vets with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Now the game just feels like a pub stomp even in the ""realistic"" game mode. All of the youtubers that play this game except for a few big ones have quit because the money grabbing devs.The Never Ending Grind++++++++++++++++It was pretty obvious that they were slowing starting to move to P2W/Progress when they added the 5 tier system. The 20 tier system allowed you to actually progress in the game instead of grinding for what seems like years for a single plane. Well if it was so much better then why did they get rid of it? So you actually have a reason to give them money duh!! In the 20 tier system every time you leveled up you would get the planes for each level so if your level 5 you get all of the planes at level 5,level 6 you get the level 6 planes, ect. Well now not only to you have to grind exp for each level but you also have to grind exp for each plane ON TOP OF HAVING TO GRIND CREDITS TO BUY THE PLANE. this makes it so depending on how much you play you may need to grind for A MONTH TO GET 1 PLANE. The only way to speed up the grind is to either: buy a premium plane, buy premium time, buy credits or buy gold to convert ""Free xp"" WHICH YOU HAVE TO GRIND BY PLAYING THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE. I thought it was called ""free xp"" not ""pay me money so you can use the xp you ground out already :^)"". I have around 2 Million ""free xp"" that  I could easily get a jet for but it would probally cost me anywhere from $75-150 to convert it and I refuse to give this company any money.Balancing+++++++The 5 tier system was doomed from the start. Cramming houndreds of planes into 5 different tiers of equalness makes no sense. Which is why they brilliantly implemented ""battle tiers"" /sarcasm. Basically the battle tier system takes how well a plane is performing in the average players hand and appropriately places it in a 20 level battle scale. Before I even address how flawed this system is, WHY DID THEY EVEN REMOVE THE 20 TIER SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IF THEY ARE JUST GOING TO DO THIS??? Anways this battle tier system is just so flawed, like come on. Wasn't it obvious what was going to happen Gajin? When terrible players are put in good planes and perform terrible they are placed at a lower level, then good players get in the same plane and absolutely stomp. Also the nations that are played less (lets use the Japs for example) are placed very wrong on the battle tier system. Most players start off using the Americans or Russian planes. When they learn the basics of the game from getting higher levels in these nations they gravitate to the nations that are used less. So when they do good in that nation there are not enough bad players to balance out the battle tier and the planes get placed at a higher battle rating and get put against unfair opponents. This is especially true for the Japanese in realistic battles. With planes from 1939 against planes from 1942.Every Nation is the Same+++++++++++++++++Every single nation ends with the same planes. Even the ♥♥♥♥ing Japs have a F86 Saber. Almost every nation has an iconic premium vehicle from another nation. Americans have a Spitfire, Brits have a Mustang, ect. This makes the entire game feel pointless and cheesy, when you want to play realistic battle and try to use your light and agile Zero to out perform and out turn a clunky heavy Mustang only to be greated by the 20mms of a Premium Spitfire that some 8 year old begged his mom to buy for him.Economy++++++The economy for this game makes about as much sense as Russian ww1 wave charging tactics. It's pretty similiar to the battle rating system actually. Basically it takes planes that are popular and makes the prices to rearm and repair them more exspensive. Which means that the limited planes at lower levels are ridiculously pricy and make it harder to grind past. Playing the harder game modes used to pay out a much larger reward for making the player challenge themselves, now you are just barely making more than arcade mode. It is way more rewarding to just sit in a bomber at 20000 feet and drops bombs for 10 minutes wait for a fighter to spend 5 minutes to climb up to you and then suicide in the ground and respawn then to fly around and have fun in a fighter plane.Summary++++++I spent about an hour writing this review and could easilly spend days on it because this game is just so god damn bad now. I mean yeah its fun to jump in a biplane and shoot at stuff for an hour or two but when you put some serious time into it like I have you will realize that it is just one big marble block of disapointment that could have been a grand scultpure of a great game. I have put way more hours into theis game before it was even added to steam and every time I see how much time I put into this game it makes me want to kill myself. I left out a bunch of stuff because im lazy and am sick of thinking about this game.Pro's+++-Flying is fun-Shooting is funCon's+++-Literally everything else about this game			",116,14,4,11,18,2,26

												This game is a mixed bag of epic fighter combat and poorly mismanaged company ethics.[HISTORY/GAMEPLAY] -The game itelf can be quite fun and realistic depending on the different modes to choose from. In the beginning the game had organized matches the ranged from level 1 planes to level 20, but that was thrown out the window for a poorly implemented 1-5 tier system. The effects of fighter combat is still relatively good, you can take hits in your landing gear,chip a wing, lose a flap or propeller and ""possibly"" still land it to be repaired. Aside from that it is a total clusterf**k of unorganized and biased combat.The new leveling system was implemented to ""so called"" make leveling faster, but fans pooring in data proved the latter. Leveling has become a loong grind compared to the false imformation Gaijin provided. They pretty much want you to go Premium just so you can level at the old ""normal"" speed.[ GRAPHICS ] The engine behind it is quite beautiful, almost any pc can run this game and the graphic settings can be tweaked so you can either have an intense and beautiful battle, or an optimized battle that still has decent graphics and details. So even your ""lawnmower taped to a powersupply and running off gas computer"" should be able to run it with ease given some tweaks.[ ISSUES THAT PLAGUE, AND WILL TURN AWAY LONG TIME PLAYERS ] The real issue is the constant problems with unbalanced matches, unrealistic plane mechanics, and pro russian biased company. -The 1-5 tier matching is complete garbage, You will often face planes that should not be in that tier/ or glitched using squad jumping( 4 players, 1 in a tier 2 setup, other players using tier 3).People use this method to use a higher ranked tier plane to literally slaughter underpowered tier planes in a lower tier match. The match making system is broken and has been unaddressed for months.- The plane mechanics themselves though looking beautiful dont match up to the real statistics of how that plane performed during the war.Players have made spreadsheets upon spreadsheets of data comparing both real world war data against the game and find it very off. So many planes either underperform or overperform there real world possibilities.- Finally, as an unwritten and talked about problem of WT, is how Gaijin: a russian game development company has been biased towards the russian nation in the game. As sad as it is, it has been proven by the fans of the game how badly biased the company has become. Almost ALL Russian planes throughout all tiers outperform in every aspect of combat. Russian planes can outturn, out climb, out run, and out gun every single nation aside from the japanese.Again when comparing real world plane statistics/data to the games counterpart it was far off in comparison. Not even the fire rate of the guns was even close to the real thing. So this is why I give it a thumbs down. The game is fun for a week or two but becomes quite old after being slaughtered by higher tiered planes in a lower tier match and being out performed all the time by russian biased planes.

												An excellent and unique game that gets worse and worse as time goes. Gaijin's lust and greed for $$$ has driven this game into an unenjoyable grindfest. After tier two, it's like running into a brickwall to progress. At this point, spending money is almost necessary to unlock planes/tanks sanely. Since Patch 1.37 in Dec 2013, Gaijin completely overhauled the research system for the sole purpose to make more money off players. Since then, everything has increased in price, and reward amounts have dropped. Tanks, aircrafts, modifications, and crew proficiencies prices have all gone up, while RP points, silver lions, and crew points are capped and less abundant. Balance is utter crap too. A 5.0 battle rating prop plane can meet a 6.3 post-war jet fighter. There are numerous planes under and over-tiered with discrepancies in battle rating. The game is in a terrible state at the moment, and I don't see Gaijin turning anything around anytime soon. The whopping drop in playerbase over the last year (or even months) says a lot.

												This is the game that had it all. It had great graphics, fun gameplay, a brilliant free-to-play system with only modest rewards for those willing to pay, and an easy recipe for success.Unfortunately, the Russian-based Gaijin apparently decided they no longer needed any of that in their game, and have been working tirelessly to remove any inkling of fun the game might have once had.Since the 1.37 Patch was released, the player population of the game has stagnated to the point where the only players you'll encounter are either the Die-Hard Russian fanatics or the ""too stupid to quit playing"" crowd. Up until today, I was in that latter category. No more. I've had it.The planes are ridiculous in every game mode - almost none of them bearing any sort of truthful resemblence to their real-life counterparts. The weapons are comical at best - with machine guns that literally do no damage and bombs that make you pull your hair out and wonder why the citizens of Dresden were so upset. The maps are extremely tired and repeat themselves so often that you begin to quit matches before they even load, because you know exactly what Pacific Hidden Base is going to be. The game types sound wonderful on paper, but in practice are so amazingly bad that once the honeymoon phase wears off and you begin to earnestly focus on the gameplay, you realize that these guys (the programmers) have absolutely no clue what's fun and what isn't.They're falling the way of Blizzard - where every patch removes another desperately needed piece of the ""fun"" equation. Yet unlike Blizzard, who calmly acknowledge that they're ruining their games with words like ""casual"" and ""approachability,"" these dumb Ruskies instead completely ignore their playerbase. Totally. Even mentioning a gripe with the game on their official forums will warrant you a ban - almost immediately. Have a problem with a player in game? Report them! But beware - if you report one player multiple times (for example, you notice them cheating, so you report it, then they use a racist term towards you, so you report them again) you'll be the one banned. Notice a group of players cheating? Don't even bother - the moment you start reporting multiple people in one round, you're getting banned.Do you see where I'm going with this?Couple that with the unending stream of new cheats and hacks that are coming out almost daily, and it's plain to see why the popularity of this game has rapidly decreased. Do yourself a favor and wait for something better to come along.			",49,6,1,8,24,0,10

												Played this for several years, had some fun.  In game bias exists, but that is to be expected.  How they treat their community contributors however is unforgivable.  Uninstalled, and closed/canceled my account with them.   In doing so I left behind all the planes and tanks I'd earned whether they were bought with lions, eagles, or earned in events.  Any time I think of starting a new account I just look back to when they practically ordered their forum members to put copyright strikes against any contributor who reports and proves that hacking is going on in their games.  Speaking as a player who has been pilot sniped from 7km away and through a mountain, I find what they've done to be reprehensible.  Lying afterwards and saying they didn't mean it like that is just plain hilarious.  Do I recommend this game?  No, I really can't bring my self to do that, if only because of how they treat people who support them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst buffing Russians, putting their higher tier vehicles with lower tiers from the other factions. The Russians already steamroll everything in this game. Now the devs just made sure it's a cakewalk.Save yourselves the 13,3 GB of pure Dogsh*t and go play something that isn't made by a bunch of self-gloating communists.Update 2: My review is apparently hidden.

												DISCLAIMER Played WT via the launcher +300 hours, just downloaded it here to write reviewI also solemnly swear to be as unbiased as I can and will try to see the good in every humanEnd of disclaimerGeneral:I will start with this. I love WW2 themed simulator games. When i first joined up War thunder almost 3 years ago, it looked very promising. This was the first ♥♥♥♥♥you Wowp) decent flight-sim/arcade that looked decent in a long time. War thunder is certainly a pleasure for the eye, worthy of the latest graphical standards set to date.Progression:Do you want to fly the most epic post war jets?Do you want to know what it is like to fly an me262, hunter of the late war skies?Do you want to drive those legendary king tigers and Pershings?WELL TOO BAD!! (or pay up)Progression is nonexistent. The grind is SO terrible that it if WW2 had Gajin mechanics we would still be flying biplanes to this day. The first tiers are okay i guess. But starting from mid tier 3 , things get grindy fast.  An average match in planes gets you about 1400 rp and with tanks even lower than that (excluding boosters). When you need to research this plane/tank you want and its 75k rp or more, you are about to pull your hair out. Things get worse as you progress, as you are grinding your way through 5464 of the same planes with almost no real difference between them. Really, do we need to have 20 types of bf109, 25 types of yak and 57 types of spitfire? god please. Yeeeyy i just grinded a 89k spit for 3 months only to find out that the stock version of that plane is ten times worse that your spaded spit you used to get it. THE STOCK GRIND IS♥♥♥♥♥WRECKING. You have to be a masochist to enjoy this. If you like wasting your time and effort, like playing for weeks/months for minimal reward, you will be thrilled by this game. Unless you pay...Yes i do realize there is alot of difference between an bf109 F2 and a G2...Balancing:The BR system was invented by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platypus. You face plane/tanks that are + 1.3 - 1.3 compared to you. However, most of the time its + - 2.3... For example: If I used a plane of BR 3.3, you are constantly matched by planes up to 5.3 or more. Happened 5 times this week alone. I suppose the gajin-lovers among  you think this is impossible and will whine to try to prove their point.The BR system is broken as f***. Unless you pay...BR distribution is foul as well. Certain german tanks/planes and japanese planes face things they should not.. which brings us flawlessly to the next point.Bias:Gajin has said there is no bias countless times. However, there just is.Tanks: The T34 and to extend the T34-85, is the single most OP tank in Gajin history, able to block shells from Tigers, Panthers and occasional King tiger. Deflection shells can happen of course, but when A T34-85 block 5 shells of a Tiger to the rear with no damage, uses his supersonic turret traverse speed to turn to you and one-shot you through the thickest part of your armor (NOT IN A WEAK SPOT) at a 30° angle, I just call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. KV's and Su's have this too, but not to the UBER-MOTHERLAND-PRIDELY way of the T34. Conclusion, don't play tanks unless you use a russian tank. Preferably a T34 or variants. If you really do have to play another nation, which isn't recommended for your mental sanity, use 50 - 60 ducks premium pay wall tanks of the Germans or Americans. Planes: Not as bad as the bias in tanks. The real problem with planes (RB) is the over-preforming UFO's like the I185. Also the big spread on the BR causes poor lower tier germans to face higher Pay to win russian premium P63 noobs.Pro's: - Swordfish          - Exit button          - AFK climbing          - Low intelligence level players, being easily offended or fooled.         - 1 byte/sec download speed gives you time to do the chores of the houseCONCLUSION: I would write down a lot more, but please refer to Crabman's review for additional information. Only three ways to fully enjoy this game:- be a pro russian rebel, with a secret shrine to Gajin and Stalin in his cellar, while doing ritual sacrifice    on innocent germans. Preferably well spoken, as you need to carry out Gajin's orders on how to mute the critics of this game. Be prepared to crush the dreams of others. One day, Gajin might send you a hair of Stalins moustache as a reward.- Be a millionaire and spend over 500 bucks on this game to get every single premium plane, soviets preferred, and buy 10 years of premium time.- be mentally unstable, and enjoy to cause pain to yourself and are ready to face depression.

Product received for free
												So I come from an era of War Thunder when it was not yet on Steam. I think this was around version 1.21The game was extremely fun. Ofcourse, since it was Beta it contained a lot of bugs and imbalanced planes (it was only planes back then), some of which were fixed within the week or month, others that are still not fixed today. But all was okay and the community was very relaxed so to speak.Now you got to understand one thing, War Thunder at the time had around 20 tiers, that was perfectly balanced for every plane out there and matchmaking could very much handle it the way it should but all of a sudden within a few patches they changed the Tier 20 system to a ridiculous Tier 5 system, a system that even up till today takes way more hours of grinding to get the next plane than it was ever before. Now that they hightened the grinding levels was understandable in a way because some people could grind to the latest Tiers within a few days/weeks, so they had to level it out for the whole game and paid players.But oh boy, that is also where the poo hitted the fan, because their matchmaking system, which used to be somewhat flawless now was utter crap that used ""BR ratings"" to set you up with others and even up till today people find ways to abuse this system and get with extremely good vehicles in games agains people with extremely bad vehicles. It just doesnt make any sense.Oh yeah and up untill today, they still have not fixed a lot of bugs. One of which that is very bad for a game like this, hit detection. If you fire up to 20 bullets from a plane, the connection can make it so that you only hit the other plane with 5 or 10 of them, while on your screen it can look like you hitted it with 15 or even all 20 bullets.Please stay clear of this game, but if you really want to play it, do not give/pay any money untill they do something about all the bad things.

												If you want competitive playingIf you look for developers that work with/for their communityIf you like teamplay and winningWell then, warthunder is NOT for you.Gaijin is starting to ""Milk the Cow"" now.It is obviously how they re following a completly new economics strategy these days.Whilst the Prices for Planes /premium Time e.g. where acceptable 2 years ago, the prices have increased untill today up to 5 times than before. (example: in 2013 - 2,000 Golden Eagles for an Premium Aircraft was a very high price - yesterdays Release (aka 2015) introduced a Calliope Tank for 10,000 G.Eagles ~50.00€)Sure a lot of people spent their unemployment-money they never have worked for, on such things, so Gaijin makes a lot of money. The course tho is clear - Milking a Cow with prices as they already got with ""Star Conflict"". It is NOT p2win, but it s a slap in longterms customers faces to sell ONE tank at a price, one can get a FULL retail Game forNot to forget...Gaijin does not allow criticism. Every person who dislikes anything about them / their policies get simply silenced. There is no cooperation between developer and community			",25,0,0,8,1,0,18

												Let me start off by saying War Thunder is a wonderful game.  Unlike WoT, which I have played an estimated 2000 hours of,  War Thunder's tanks and airplanes actually fight like airplanes.  Hit the engine?  The tank might burst into flames but probably won't.  Hit the commander's hatch?  The tank isn't going to magically burst into flames like in WoT.  I love War Thunder, and I am so glad it exists.  The developers are nice and like to involve the community and the gameplay is significantly more interesting overall.However, they have some of the very worst business practices of any F2P I've ever known.  If you buy ""premium time"", the game will ask if you want to buy more incessantly the moment it expires.  They've doubled their prices on packs before the Summer Sale for the second year in a row (which is completely illegal).  They even made non-steam packs on their website to get around giving Steam a portion of the proceeds.When the business side of War Thunder becomes this cash-grab, no matter how much money I want to give them for making a solid game, I just can't justify it.  I can't justify giving them more money just so they can program more ways to take it away.  While this is the best tank game on the market...save your wallet.  Despite the developers wanting to make a quality game, Gaijin Entertainment has shown time and time again that their sole interest is taking as much money as possible from the consumer by any means necessary.

												Many people have said this in below reviews, but i'll make this short and brief on a critical issue. Honestly i'm writing this because the War Thunder forums are run by a very strict set of rules that don't really allow much actual discussion outside of vicious attacks against a dissatisfied playerbase by elitist, relatively new players, so I cant even post a mild suggestion that something is wrong with the staff as there is nowhere to put it within the rules.The game's moderators, forum and community suck♥♥♥♥♥ It takes a very Russian view on the rights of the consumer when it comes to moderating.This is the reason why so many of the old guard, players who have been around since 2012, have left. People who play the game for a long time usually like to participate in the community to help the game grow. But often they are sensible people, and in Gaijin's view those people can ""disrupt new players experience"" with vile topics like ""Gaijin, can you please fix the netcode?"" (locked and hidden, 3/14/2014) and ""Beta is not an excuse"" (locked and hidden 9/08/2014).  But who are the people that protect us from these disruptive and evil comments?http://puu.sh/g5NqW/5c217d7d6d.jpg25 Year old, foreign-speaking Brony moderators. Let's elaborate on these issues using this single puush image as a base.It does not show it but this moderator, and in fact nearly ALL of them, do not speak English very well if at all. That applies to much of this game. Many patch notes and information released by moderators is written in commie and myself and other dedicated players are forced to try and decipher them with Google translate to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ they broke this time. Often the reasons given for doing something so ahistorical that it's insulting (when the game claims to try and be historically authentic) is that they found, and I kid you not, ""Secret documents in a forgotten Soviet bunker."" This is a real thing. It's even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ meme! This lack of English and information also applies to many other trivial things like ban messages and explanations. A friend of mine was banned by this very moderator for having the name ""AllahIsGreat"" and we could not figure out why this was offensive when the friend in question is actually a Muslim. Appeals are usually met with garbled, confused English that roughly translate into ""You're toxic to new players"" 90% of the time.The biggest issue with this game's hilariously strict moderation, though, is the fact that topics with criticism that the brony lords don't like can be shut down and hidden because they ""hurt new players.""This will not affect many of you, who simply wish to casually play this game and try to participate as little as possible in the mess that is the War Thunder Community. If you do, in between the bans and thread locking, you will find quite a few nice people as the European/American playerbase is wonderful. But even in the chat of public games there are Russian NKVD mods who watch intently what you say.This is not a comprehensive or even gameplay-focused review, nor a tired ""10/10 it was gud ign"" review, but you can find that in every single other review above or below me. I simply wanted to post this here considering the hilarity of permabanning a friend of mine for having an Islamic name when he is, in fact, Muslim. I do play this game a lot and enjoy it, and that is because I joined before♥♥♥♥♥♥hit the fan and the decade-long grind (bypassable by large sums of money) was introduced, and had all my stuff before things went bad. Seriously, you better quit your dayjob if you intend to progress in any meaningful way in this game.Thanks for reading, and hopefully I can talk more about these issues that plague War Thunder in the future.EDIT: They just made the grind even longer by removing daily bonuses and making us use this random drop system, which will most likely give you a ""Research Point Boost"" rather than an experience/currency boost which the daily bonuses gave. Other than modifications Research Points are only usable using real money.http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2xgo4v/psa_boosters_dont_multiply_missionreward_premium/ Showing how Gaijin once again screws over their players with lies and inflation.Additional Reading:http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2x8i1a/147_is_a_failure_of_a_patch_wts_failings_found/Clarification:Russian patchnotes are much larger and more detailed than the English ones.The English patchnotes only explain generalities (I.E. ""Tempest Mk II has been tuned according to data sheet"").Russian patchnotes will explain details (I.E. ""Tempest Mk II speed changed from <bad> to <worse>).And, yes, English moderators exist, but they are a staggering minority.			",78,17,0,22,16,1,58

												It's with a heavy heart I lay this game to rest in the bin of uninstalled steam games. When I first began playing this game, it was a plucky contender in the air warfare scene, brought something new to it, and Gaijin Entertainment seemed to be listening and working with the community. It had its problems, but it was fun. Over time, however.... Things change.The state of the game now is... Alright. Mechanically, it's very good, aside from certian nations air rounds having more proclivity to ""spark"" (indicate a hit but do no damage) than others. However, balancing issues, along with a few bugs, remain present, and affect the game experience greatly. This alone wouldn't be enough for me to permanantly condemn the game, but Gaijin itself has also changed. Its stance towards the community has gone from acceptance, to outright ignorance, and seemingly insane greed. If you -do- get this game, never buy Golden Eagles. Their value is minimal at best these days.I could list the iunnumerable balance issues Gaijin has forced upon the game to further increase the time it takes to progress, and squeeze as much money out of you as possible, but there are plenty of people that do it much better than I can on a review. Just a suggestion, however; avoid any source that is attached to Gaijin itself. They do thier best to censor criticisms. And this is the main reason I cannot at all reccomend this game. If the company controlling it cannot bare to own up to thier own mistakes, I simply cannot see it progressing further than it has, let alone getting any better.It's a shame, really... I quite loved how the game played. Still do, in a sense. I just can't put up with the environment I'm in when I play it.			",95,7,0,7,8,1,5

												I hate to play the same tune as so many others, but unlike them I am taking my review and going a step further.I'm a lover of history, from as ancient as Mayan and Aztec cultures to as modern as it can get when talking current news. I love to know why things happened, the reasons, the causes, the impacts upon how we see things today, and what it can mean for those who care to enjoy their history.So, as I write this review, keep the words ""Historical"", ""Accurate"", and ""Fair"" in mind. Cause they'll be mentioned a lot.Historical planes, tanks and ships, all clashing upon one battlefield that allows players to simultaneous and fairly enjoy how these various war machines of history would have performed under the accurate scrutiny of Gaijin's developers who no doubt have the best interest of this game at heart, right? But what game are we playing, if not War Thunder? A game advertised as historically accurate and fair to all countries in how they are represented historically to players? Knowing they're targetting both a large audience who -wants- a fun combat flight simulator game which boasts accuracy; and simultaneously knowing they're targetting the history buffs and adamant learners who want to gleefully roar through the skies as a P-47 Thunderbolt over 1940's Germany. Surely! They would want to represent the lives lost, the battles won, and the ingenuity of men and women of this war accurately, right?Now, take every mention of those words I told you to notice before, and answer them with ""No"". This game was praised as the champion against other games like World of Tanks, where World of Tanks and it's corporate model is to force all players into mediocrity and a 50% win/loss range than to be fair (look up Greedy Goblin's World of Tanks article, then you will agree). Even I came in when War Thunder had almost one-quarter the number of planes is has now, and was boasted as being historically accurate.Those days are long gone, I've put in well over 300 hours of my life trying to enjoy this game. The only times I authentically enjoyed this game is when I broke down and submitted to the mentality of my close friends who call this game by it's true name: ""GLORIOUS SOVIET UNION COMRADE VICTORY SIMULATOR""*. By this, I mean, I started playing nothing but Soviet Russian planes, I watched in initial glee as my scores skyrocketted. I went from being the bottom 5 players to the top 5. Then the horror hit me. I was indoctrinated. I had spent cash to turn around from the planes I -wanted- to -desperately- enjoy, yet I can't due to the GSUCVS* and it's portrayal of Russian warplanes as nigh-unstoppable machines of complete devestation.I spent cash to enjoy the best of the United States circa 1940's era planes I always wanted to fly; I spent cash and time to work up the German Luftwaffe planes, where I finally hit my peak into indoctrination. That is when I spent cash to play Soviet Russian planes like everyone else, just so my above-average flight skills aren't being held back because a single Russian plane can endure over 1000 rounds of .50 caliber anti-air machinegun fire. So my enjoyment and money spent on my ""dud planes"" with other factions was turned around and then I learned the ""glory"" of the GSUCVS*. It's taken me some time, it really has. But I can finally say, without the shadow of any doubt...This game as made for Russians, by Russians, and most likely at gunpoint by Joseph Stalin himself, or at least by the specter of Stalin. The only hope to redeem this game would be to overhaul it, cut out the busywork of all the ""prototype"" and ""testbed"" planes that keep you from enjoying the plane you really want. Cut out the horribly overpowered and unbalaned and unfair Russian cheat engine for Russian planes. And lasty, to apologize to every player for their grievous wounds inflicted upon trying to represent ""accurate"" history.Until then, I will not recommend this game unless you understand that it is NOT an accurate game, that it is a game made to pander towards old Soviet diehards who can't see Mother Russia as anything but completely indomitable and constantly producing instant-win scenarios. Play it, but do NOT spend your cash. Play it, but do NOT bother commenting on their EU/USA forums. They will simply mock you with sock puppets while they ban your forum account.

												this game... was good. at one point the game was mostly balenced and playable, mostly. it was one of my most loved games and now its just horrible, grindy, repetetive and all round boring gaming experiance, even at low tiers it is obvious what planes dominate the sky *cough* russians *cough* . and you cant really argue with planes such as the Yak 9 T/K exsisting, which have really only been made more overpowered after ""nerf"". The problem is that it appears that they have made the grind to long to keep interest in playing, and they have made it clear that they have a biased towards planes and nations. i do no t recomend playing this game untill one of either things happen.1: Matchmaker redesigned2:they listen to the players who are PLAYING the game and giving CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM to help move the game forward, but i highly doubt that this will happen...update 2-08-16Yup...

												This game has great potential, yet the Russian makers are extremely bias for their own country. Before 1.53, it was okay, but afterwards, the power of the German tanks has utterly been demolished. the German 88 mm gun has virtually no affect on the Russian tanks, bouncing off T-34's front slope if not placed correctly. The Russian tanks however, seem to dominate the game, with one-shots on nearly every single tank they come accross.A few years ago (before War Thunder groundforces) the American faction was experiencing the same problems. The American planes had extremely low max speeds such as the Hellcat having a max speed of 200 km/h. This was made note of many of War Thunder's fans and eventurely, (although not completely) War Thunder made American planes somewhat more operable.Hopefully by next update War Thunder won't make such another mistake, although it is unlikely.

Its laughable more than anything else, and I've yet to play since becuase I havent been able too. This was the straw that broke the camels back. I probably won't spend another dollar in this game just becuase of this nusiance. And as for my recconmenation, I will not change it as long as Gajin keeps up this complete communist regieme. If you even so dare go on the forum to give some constructive critisizem, you are insta-perma-band and completley disespected by the community. I have way more than 800 hours though, I switched to linux and I have about 1000 hours that you cant even see. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It deserves to bleed out just like every other game made by Gajin. They clearly dont understand how a free community should be run, as they make the Soviets look like good people.			",19,0,0,1,3,0,5

												Hoo boy...where do I begin with this?As a bit of a fair warning, I am 100% NOT against the core of this game. This game is quite a solid platform, everything performs, mostly, as it should, and we're getting British Tanks soon. That's bound to appeal to more than one might imagine. The updates, for the most part? Reasonable. The amount of ridiculousness from those Yak-9s going through the roof? Yes, but this is why you get either a plane that can reasonably ensnare the little sky devils or go AAA if possible. Simulation is quite nice (Despite me sucking at them to an absolute degree), Realistic plays fine, and if you're not keen on either, Arcade will likely hold what you want. None of these are faulty.It's the moderation base and the lack of caring that make me hit ""No"" on the recommendations panel. The worst bit? They'll silence you if you speak up against them about it. For God's sake, we're trying to help you, and you shoot us down like we're nothing but scrubs? And by the way, that is even if you pay. They don't care who you are, you'll get shut up, one way or another.Another key problem is the graphics. ...what, you were expecting me to say Battle Rating? Find another review, they'll explain it. I personally find it hilarious when I gun down a plane with a BR higher than mine.Let's get this out of the way. Like the core gameplay, the core graphics are not an issue. Heck, they're some of the most beautiful to date. For those who play Realistic, I'm sure you'll agree with me on this if you play Ground Forces in Realistic or Simulator: There is an option within the game settings to turn the bushes OFF. Yeah, not down to a minimum, outright OFF. This is a huge problem that Gaijin refuses to fix, and it's impacting Realistic Ground Battles to this day. (And Simulator, but Realistic at the least) It's understandable for low-end PCs, but this is straight up an advantage for players who want to shoot you while you're not even able to see them if you have your bushes on.This, and especially the lack of a caring development base, are what make me not recommend this game. If what it takes for me to change my mind is an administrative reform at Gaijin Entertainment, then so help me Arceus, do it....on the flip side though, if you're just someone who just enjoys a good tank and plane game, once all this settles down, it's a good game. Just...don't go talking negative within the game if you expect to stay there. And hope you have fun out there.			",126,17,2,25,7,1,11

												So, this is a tough one for me. I've played War Thunder for a few years now, and it has finally reached the point that I can no longer play the game in its current state. I'm going to say now that I am a JET PILOT and some of these points only apply to JET COMBAT. I'm also going to try and list the points I still like, and that I find noteworthy.Pros:-A good arcade flight experience.-A nice variety of vehicles to drive.-Fairly realistic physics.Cons:-The community moderators censor feedback, and even youtubers like MagzTv and PhlyDaily have been hit with claims, though these claims were rescinded. Simply put, only positive feedback is allowed.-Jet combat is hopelessly unbalanced for new jet pilots. If you have a MiG-15, F-86 or Hunter F1, you'll be fine. If you're just getting into jet combat, be prepared for a horrible grind, or prepare to open your wallet.-The company treats its playerbase like idiots. They refuse to share any information on the statistics they use to balance the battle ratings, claiming we won't be able to understand them. -The instructor system in realistic prevents players from gettoing out of flatspins, which can happen in midair rams. Its not a bad system, but the inability to turn it off completely without using a joystick in infuriating.-The company moderators also have the devil's own job of trying to defend the companys actions. This can lead to problems with historical accuracy. This is a quote from a community manager:""The actual performance of the Meteor and Venom in fact exceed the performace of all F-86 series aircraft""This is once again referencing the statistics that we are not allowed to see, making sweeping generalisations and in general rebuffing the requests of the community for a rebalance in battle ratings.All in all, I can't recommend this game to anyone, I have lost my faith in Gaijin entertainment, and I hope in future they fix these issues so I can give them a more positive review. Will I keep playing it? Yeah, until my premium time runs out, then it can sit in my steam library til its fixed.			",83,1,0,11,18,0,15

												Ok so this is my second review for this game and propably my last. The game is now out of the open beta state so i can critisize it. So when i started playing War Thunder (about 2 years ago) i had a blast. The game was fun. The progress actually felt like you were getting somewhere and realistic battles were not ♥♥♥♥ed. But now the game is utter garbage. I have tier IV tanks of almost all nations and i can clearly say that USSR is the best one, but its the best one because it has unfair advantages with their penetrations and their magical sloped armor. For example, T34-85 has boosted penetration and sloped armor that can bounce a shell from a ♥♥♥♥ing Jagdtiger. The game is such a grind that i would have to play about 100 battles to unlock the T25 but every battle i would have to get about 1500 xp. I mean that is ♥♥♥♥ing ridicilous for one tank. To make matters worse, Gaijin likes to censore anything bad about the game on their forums with exuses like ""indicent language"". So i would recommend WT if it was in  a state when i started playing, but now.....no. War Thunder is a waste of your time and i would want those 1035 hours back every single day.			",42,1,0,1,1,0,4

												Gaijin is brilliant. Straight up, no questions about it. they have created a game that is so awesome, that even when they throw historical facts out the window, thousands flock to sing its praises. This game is like no other, it has no real competitors, and therefore, Gaijin gets to do whatever the heck they want to, and we will still play. This game has a ridiculous bias, it can be overcome, but it shoudn't have to be. The fact is, if I fly a Fw190 D9, one of my best planes, I will be on par with a totally unexperienced Yak-3P pilot. There is something wrong with that. I don't mind unbalanced combat, but I sure as hell want historically accurate combat. I wouldn't mind if match making put 15 Russian players on each russian team, and 5 on the german team, but they should have those german tanks/planes historically accurate, and therefore vastly superior to their Russian counterparts.

												The latest patch 1.37 has effectively ruined the game overnight. Obviously the devs were seeing dollar signs and thought now was the perferct time to bend over the large and loyal player base that they have built up since release. The game now appears to be one gigantic grind fest, unless you are prepared to invest large sums of cash, and I do mean large sums.On top of this the new teir system has removed any fun that you may have been expecting in arcade mode. Expect to fly your 1930's era biplane against fighters from the late 40's and 50's. Kinda like taking a knife to a gun fight.It's absolutey astounding how they have managed to take what was an addictive, innovative, fun to play game and totally destroy it.Glad I didn't spend in more money on this ♥♥♥♥♥tain in the steam sale.

												EDIT: Updated for patch 1.39Patch 1.39 has changed several things. For one, all aircraft are 25% less reserch points. It still takes a long time to unloack all aircraft, but at least they're making some effort to balance the progression curve.1.39 has also massively dropped the price of aircraft (and slightly dropped the price of repairs), in some cases aircraft are 1/3 of the lion price they were. Again, a step in the right direction. Original review content is below, most of the bullet points are the same.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As much as I want to, I can't reccomend this game. Gajin seems to have turned it into a money farm. Progression was always a problem in the game. pre patch 1.37 money was a problem. If you wanted to buy all the aircraft of a rank you had to either grind hard or buy premium currency. It was a constant complaint on the forums. Did Gajin listen? nope!Post patch 1.37 the problem is even worse. Money is still an issue, only now you have to research aircraft individually. Other members have done the math on this showing that it slows progression and devalues premium currency by 4-5x. The progression curve is broken. So broken that it's kind of pointless to switch between countries. if you want a jet before your 60th birthday, you grind the hell out of one country until your brain melts.This saddens me. The game itself is wonderfully fun. The way the devs have handled it makes me want to puke. If you do play, play for free. Don't give them your money like I did.			",146,9,26,19,22,2,58

												I'll just get straight to the point.Pros:- Decent game mechanics- Isn't ""Pay-to-Win"" if you can actually play well- Dev team is always adding new vehicles- Game is pretty fair game-play wise- Factions are actually pretty balanced despite the ""Russian bias"" mantra- Most players are actually very helpful and theres many beginner squadrons that players can joinCons (prepare your diddly hole):- Game mechanics can be just as buggy sometimes (i.e. SPAAs making shots that shouldn't be possible but do because their RoF overloads the server)- Golden Eagles are pretty expensive and you can't trade boosters or other things for them- Speaking of boosters, use them or lose them- The constant flow of new vehicles makes balancing the game a nightmare, and further clogs up the present grind- Speaking of the Gaijin team, they need to hire some new community moderators that won't let their SJW agendas dictate their actions- You're not allowed to speak your mind about anything in the main chat, even what you dislike about the game- Community moderators (the newer ones) take their job too seriously, chat-banning anyone for things like making harmless fun of others or stating your own opinion about a game mechanic that's inherently needing of some work- Game has one of the steepest learning curves known to man and can be easily manipulated by ""experienced"" players- Outside of vehicle balancing, there is no real balance to the game (read: map balancing is absolutely horredous at times)- Event Tournaments are just slapped together and not thoroughly tested before release, causing some major headaches for some players- Lack of Player-versus-Environment content outside of bombing static targets/tank columns (there was one event last month that was decently fun, but could have REALLY used some balancing and testing beforehand)- There's actually some bias to the Russian faction, but that's because the game mechanics play in favor of the Russian vehicles' strengths: sloped armor, speed, fragmentation, overpenetration, ""invincible"" modules, damage models, flight models- Players have seem to grown more toxic over the years, some going as far as to show their disparity in team chat with some colorful wording- Squadrons have also grown more toxic thanks to Gaijin's snatch and grab that is its ""e-sports"" tournaments- The only helpful players have either left the game entirely or rarely play anymore because there are better games out there, even if War Thunder is the only one of its kind (which it really isn't because it's slowly becoming a Wargaming.net clone)- The game is literally becoming a ""World of [Insert All Military Vehicles Here]"" clone- Did I mention the moderation team already?- Gaijin rarely listens to its players when they provide constructive feedback about all aspects of the game and will even lie about certain changes they're making- The game is not what it used to beSorry for subjecting your eyes to this, but I think it needed to be said.

												I have a very love-hate realtionship with War Thunder. Before I had a decent computer, this was the game that I looked forward to getting most. Hands down. When I got the game at last, I was very pleased.The game looks fantastic. It performs incredibly well, especially considering the graphical quality and size of the maps. Additionally, outside of a few premium vehicles, there is very little pay-to-win. Unlike World of Tanks, you cannot buy special ammunition or consumables. I cannot think of a single aspect of the gameplay itself that is bad. In fact, I can think of little in that respect that is even mediocre.So why not recommend it? 2 main things, that, between the two, ruin the game for me.The matchmaking. Basically the balancing entirely. The recent introduction of mouse-guided ATGMs on  (Surprise!) a Soviet tank broke late tier tank balancing. Similarly, there are age-old and unadressed issues with certain armor models, unrealistic shell performance, etc. that just make the game a nightmare for certain vehicles. Throw on top the bush camos that are just way too good. Even air forces has major problems. The addition of a (Surprise!) Soviet bomber that is basically the Death Star completely ruin my desire to keep grinding to the high tiers.Along with balancing is the age-old issue of Russian (aka Soviet) bias on the part of the devs. Certain vehicles are and always have been completely overperforming. This transcends modes, but it is the worst in Ground Forces. Vehicles have balancing that just makes no sense, or have unrealistic performance that is not fixed by the devs. And I don't even know what they thought with some of the early Soviet planes. Do they obey physics? I con't tell, but I'm not entirely sure.Throw on top of that the fact that, to account for shrinking player numbers, they compress the MM (which in turn means fewer players. No one saw that coming!) means that some battles are cases of give up, go back to the garage, and try again.The second gripe is Gaijin Entertainment themselves. Not only do they make decisions that seem baffling (see ""mouse-guided ATGMs"") but they behave in an almost authoritarian way. I seriously wonder if they know that this is the 21st century. They silence criticizm, they ban players, they have forum moderators that behave like kings on a self-built throne, it's atrocious. Never use their forums. Just don't. You'll be banned or your thread blocked if you do as much as fromn at Gaijin.I would say get the game for Naval Forces. I still will give it a second chance. However, my optimism is running out. In Naval Forces, I thought, was a place where the Japanese could be exceptional at something (they have no tanks yet and few aircraft), where the Soviets would not be as much of a problem. Where we could finally have land, air AND sea.Instead we get boats. I am preparing for Russian Bias as stong as the rest of their game, possibly worse. Broken machines, broken mechanics, terrible MM, and even more opportunities for these developers to pretend Gorbachev is still in power.Maybe if they sell the game to someone else, it could be fixed. It still has some of the INCREDIBLE potential that this game had in the beginning.P.S. I thought I already made a review, but it is possible Gaijin had it removed. If so I rest my case, and take that ""Mostly Positive"" as nothing more that a Gaijin advertisement.			",32,1,0,3,5,0,6

												I'm very much split when it comes to WarThunder now and it's management.  I was a late player to the scene.  I didn't start playing War Thunder until a couple of months ago.  It was such a fun experience and I would play constantly.  At first things didn't seem so bad, but then I got a glimpse of what the veteran WT players were so upset about.  The system that they use for research is DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU SPEND ALL YOUR  MONEY!  At first I was unlocking things at a pretty decent rate.  Now, It's like I hit a brick wall and the only way to get past it, is to pay REAL MONEY to use the experience that I have already earned.Look gajian, I'm not a game programmer or some sort of buisness man, but you guys are really dropping the ball.  Want to know how to bring people back to your game?  Here are 3 ways.1.  Hire moderators and curators who actually have respect for both new and old players.  Based on some of the evidence brought forth by other people, your moderators are incredibly rude and drunk with the power of the banhammer.2.  I understand that free to play games need to be set up in a way so that it is still profitable, but that doesn't mean charging premium currency for as much as you can get away.  500 golden eagles to buy a national flag for your tank/plane is beyond the realm of reasonable.3. I really shouldn't have to even say this but, LISTEN TO YOUR PLAYERS!  Constructive critisism sucks, but it is better to learn from it, then to ignore the advice, do what you guys want, and say screw you to the plebs and to your own game!In conclusion:War Thunder is a terrific game.  It has features and gameplay that no other game has been able to repeat.  The problem with that, is if a company knows there is no real competition (Gajian), they are free to charge what they want, for whatever they want.  Don't get me wrong, I will still play WarThunder from time to time, but I won't be dropping another cent on this game.  When it comes to scuzzy business tactics, I don't have much empathy for a company.If you plan on playing this here and there, then disregard my review.  If however, you are someone who really wants to get into this game, be warned that you WILL BE REQUIRED to spend money unless you're cool playing 3000+ hours to unlock things naturally and don't mind having only a few crew  slots.

												This is an amazing game. Really! You will not find another game similar to this one. It is one based more on skill than anything else. No stupid reaction shots or super quick decision making. With one good shot, someone(Including you) can be killed. If not, it may take minutes to destroy a wing or light them on fire. But, then the downsides come in. Recently, they completely overhalled the matchmaking system. Maybe you've heard. They collapsed the 20 teir system into 5 teirs. And if that weren't bad enough, they changed the way of getting planes as well. Instead of leveling up a teir, which may give you 2-3 planes at once, they made  it so that you ""research"" each plane at a time. This makes it unbelievably grindy. in the end, it seems like a cheap way to get more people to buy in game ""golden eagles"" to boost research. WIth true FTP, you will be spending hours and hours just to get a planes in low teir. If you love to grind for hours with the same planes and no real sign of progression, this is the perfect game for you. I continue to play just in hopes they change it. But as for 10-19-2014, they haven't.Update on 12-21-2014As of the new update...I am speechless. Gaijin realy, really hates this game. They, for some reason, feel so pressured to release American tanks that they have not a care in the world for anything else. They put in an under-teired plane here, another OP plane over there... You get the point. The banshee...No comment. They feel that a plane that has a rediculous energy retention and almost a thousand kph top speed belongs in the lowest teir of jets. Flown correctly(not that hard) a person can defeat a whole team of German jets. The new British jet doesn't even have a finished flight model. And obviously the worst of all, they have delayed the implication of the proposed ""fix"" to the battle rating system. That would have made the game half decent again...maybe. But it doesn't matter if they keep the current cash cow of a system they currently have. I rarely...RARELY play this game anymore. It just isn't fun. I have tried realistic battles, and those are better, but seeing planes on my team that are 2 teirs under me when playing just... just isn't fair for them. Arcade, which i presume most players will spend most of their time in, just feels like a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥. All in all, I don't recomment even downloading this game at it's current state. Don't fall for the huge money trap that is War Thunder.			",61,7,1,11,20,0,19

												This game is really fun at first, then you hit the unbearable grind.  So then you buy premium and a premium plane to help get tier 4 and 5.  You finally get your first jet, or your first tier 4 or 5 tank.  But guess what, you have to grind modules to make your plane or tank even worth using.  Tanks are especially the worst.  God help you if you get a tier 5 tank.  You will need to grind parts to even repair your tank, after that you need to grind again to unlock fire extinguishers.  The developers just outright ignore the community and the forums are comparable to, if not worse than early 1940's Germany.  The CEO of the game practically called all the player base ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s"".  Please don't waste your time on this game.  If you read other reviews, most people with less than 500 hours like this game.  Most with over 500 don't like it.  There is a bump you hit, from the game being fun, to being horrible.			",193,39,4,15,23,3,10

												Gaijin really don't know what they're doing at all. I started playing 2-3 years ago, and even back then they didn't know what they were doing, but at least they seemed like they were trying. They listened to the community sometimes, but now... too many bad changes and patches that don't seem to be letting up any time soon. Now they refuse to listen to the community. The first 6 months are fun for some due to ignorance of the grand scheme of things in terms of issues, plus the early tier planes are the most fun, but after that it spirals quickly out of control and becomes not fun anymore. Even going back and playing the old planes isn't fun for me. The matchmaking changes have been horrible, and (as much as its overstated sometimes), there's a debatable Russian bias and they straight up retcon history sometimes.I love the game to death, it has so much potential, and there's nothing more that I would love to see than this game to become what it could be, but as long as its in the hands of such an unorganized and dysfunctional development team, that won't be happening any time soon. This game is the epitome of one of those FPS's that seem promising for the first few months, and then you realize how much of a grind it really is.It's not even just the fact that it's a grind, it's not about taking forever to unlock planes, it's not about the fact that it will take the average user about a year to get their first jet, because it's possible to have fun in this game without jets. In fact, jets are one of the most unbalanced and un-fun parts of this game, besides ground forces. The early tiers are some of the most fun, in fact. That's why you so often see players with about 100 hours or less giving WarThunder positive reviews, yet as you go up through the hours, most of those players start giving negative reviews.The real issues lie in the dev team's unwillingness to listen to the community, their horrid, horrid, HORRID mod team who watch over their forums like hawks and strike down almost all criticisms of the game with impunity, it lies in the fact that they've made some painfully obvious cash grabs in the game, like making it so you have to pay for country flags because ""teamkilling was an issue."" Most of the community, if not all, wants the game to succeed. We offer criticisms and ways to fix the issues, they give us bans, longer grinds, and horrible BRs.The dev team's unwillingness to not only fix the FM issues, but even their complete failure to acknowledge them, means that the game is doomed if it continues on the path it's currently on. BRs are complete trash, if you aren't flying the flavor of the month plane then you might as well not be flying. If you're not driving a Russian tank, you might as well not be driving.Now, because of Gaijin's failures, hundreds of veterans like me, and others with even more time in the game than me, are jumping ship. Not because we don't care about the game anymore, but because Gaijin doesn't. Its sad because most  bad review of this game is from a player who has played for a long time, and most of the good ones are from complete new users who are still able to enjoy the game before they realize how truly bad the situation is.The nation balance is garbage. Japan gets screwed over soooooo much. Germany has been getting pounded on, or at least was last time I played, Russia has always had curbstomping abilities over the other nations, and the US flip flops depending on the tier. British are just everywhere. I personally stopped playing consistently about the time when ground forces started having the issue with the foliage, where you would be at a severe disadvantage (and I'm talking gamebreaking severe) if you kept your grass/foliage on. I have logged on a handful of times since, but only for 2-3 rounds and then I just get tired and sad. I want the game to be good. The sad thing is, though I have been playing for 2-3 even back then and through the years, I can never truly say the game has felt completely good. There have always been a number of broken FMs, the economy has gone through various levels of♥♥♥♥♥♥ one nation is always curbstomping another, etc. About the time they removed the 2x bonus, that's when the crashing spiral downward in quality started.Gaijin's PR is horrible, especially with their whole ""guys, don't judge, we're still in beta"" excuse which has been a lie ever since you've been able to pay to get ahead in the game. It's been a lie ever since they started using it as an excuse to disregard their personal flaws and using it as a way to completely shift the blame from them over to the community. It's been a lie because most games in beta survey the userbase, asking for feedback, while Gaijin denies feedback at every opportunity. Ever since their PR team straight up quit the subreddit, calling it a ""toxic environment"", most likely due to the fact that they were unable to control what was said (unlike their forums, where they have total control and use that control freely), there was no hope for their PR team. A development team that will readily call their community, who offers criticisms and only wants to help the game get better (though I do concede that a lot of the players will get pissy after a bad patch, but who can really blame them?) isn't fit to run a game.I really do want this game to be good. But as long as it continues on the path it's currently treading on, I will not recommend it, or play it.			",125,5,2,9,7,1,14

												Such a shame. It was a great game with alot of potential. The game itself is great, but the issue is Gaijin. They're destorying their own game. They never listen to the community and deliberately make ♥♥♥♥ ups. The newest ♥♥♥♥ up is the new mm.......... they seem to think that queue times are a big deal, when really if they'd listen to their playerbase they would know that is not what we care about. Gaijin have to be hands down the worst devs! Don't waste your time on this game, the game is going to♥♥♥♥♥♥and the devs don't care, enough said.			",61,3,4,3,8,1,12

												There were times when I was just lyrical about this game. Somehow, I fitted right in, getting a lot of kills, unlocking plane after plane. The game was extremely friendly to it's players, I never had the feeling that I was underpowered or anything. It was just awesome, especially cooping with friends. The game breathed the love for military aviation, it was a dream come true for me. The gameplay was just heartpounding fun as you twisted and turned to get behind your opponents. The historical battles were fun too. Moreover, you had an easy custom single player mode to brush up on your flying skills offline, which was very useful, since I wanted to make the jump to Simulator difficulty. You just had so much content in this game. Had.Then along came patch 1.37. The sky is now filled with nearly invincible ME-109's and La-7's, stuffed with cannons. Arcade dogfights have lost all appeal to me. Now it is just 'fly at each other with all guns blazing'. No tactics, no teamplay, no interesting dogfights. Any one-on-one dogfights are a thing of the past, the battlefield is just a frantic swirl of flying cannonballs without logic. It has nothing to do with flying or dogfighting anymore. In fact, the more I learned about fighter-tactics, the worse I became on this game. Unlocking planes is a thing of the past as well. Researching ANY plane takes ridicilously much time. The only way to speed up the process is -of course- by paying lots of money. Oh, and should you eventually manage to research and buy a game, it will have reduced speed, agility, armor, everything, just to make sure you have to pay again to unf*** your brand new plane. Moreover, this upgrade-system makes all historical accuracy obsolete, since a plane that historically is lower in turn-rate for example, can now outturn a not upgraded airplane that should have superior turning abilities. The easy customizable missions from the single player have dissappeared altogether. Now you get to chose between flying missions with a scenario fully controlled by the game, and not the player, or flying practice missions against biplanes and real life players. The latter are usually beginners, or dudes who want to test their brand new jet on easy prey. Not much practice there. And you need it to overcome the immensely steep learning curve to Simulator battles. Because of this, almost no-one plays this mode anymore. Gaijin scared away their first fans: the flight-sim boys. Luckily, the historial battles remain, together with the events-mode. This is an oasis of relief in an ever deteriorating game. Matchmaking is seemingly more fair here, teamplay is more important, and historical accuracy is restored a little. However, there are not much players on this mode, the learning curve is very steep, the waiting time for a match is quite high, and the absence of room for mistakes makes this game mode very difficult for new players.In sum, a charm of a game has turned into a mean money-making machine, discarding it's fans of the first hour in favor of the arcade-shooter public with big wallets. The player-friendly environment has turned into a frustrating grind and totally uninteresting gameplay (in arcade mode), focused only on making money. My sad conclusion: if you like planes and dogfighting, look somewhere else. It may seem cool if this is your first time on this game, but believe me, it is nothing compared to what it once was.

Bad game design and developers who do not care what you want.Arcade Battle Air   Not too much to complain about as this part of the game they designed the least of. Generally you'll have a good time unless you fly Japan. Russo-Japanese War must have hit the devs hard because Japan has the worst BRs and repair prices of any other nation ground or air. You'll rarely get competitive aircraft and if you do get something competitive it's a broken UFO flight model they didn't bother to pass on to anyone with a bit of sense. I'd like to add the final bit of bull the devs like to pass on Japanese is putting horrible fantasy ammo belts filled with practice shells. This ammo problem has not been fixed since the introduction of ammo selection.Realistic Battle Air   Again not much to complain about. BRs are a problem for many aircraft. You'll have much more fun here but it's not worth it time wise in my opinion. Japanese problems persist here like horrible BR but usually allied pilots are not very smart and they'll turn with an overtiered A6M5. If they ever add Enduring Conflict RB that will be your go to for planes.Arcade Battle Ground   I could write a novel on the cons to AB tanks but what really makes it unplayable is the constant bombardment of CoD killstreaks that instantly kill any one tank they choose. To continue on that, the Maus is one of the worst tanks at its BR and yet it's still missing historical turret armor and it has an insane repair price. The one tank that can't avoid a suicide run from an attacker and it is one of the most expensive. Getting killed out of the spawn is not fun for anyone and whenever I use the bombing run I want to put ""Sorry"" in chat because of how unfun and unavoidable the mechanic is. Transmission fires. Remove them. You should not have to unlock FPE or parts and you should not have to unlock flat camos.Realistic Battle Ground   Battle Ratings are a major problem. We do not have historical match making. We do not have match making by year. What we have is match making ""based on player performance"". This is a lie. There is little rhyme or reason to some of the BRs, not to mention the spread is too high. It's already pretty hard to get a game so reducing spread really wouldn't increase queue times. You have tanks that are outright better than some with lower BRs and repair costs. Not good. Spawn killing is terrible on many maps. Russians are great at close quarters knife fights which is fine except for that fact that every capture zone required to win is placed in dense cities forcing german teams to venture into their weak zone.The Problem   The real issue with all of this is simple. It's been this way for years and it's not getting fixed. From disastrous decisions like ATGMs and the Tu-4 they really don't care. The only recent instance I can recall of a good fix would be the restriction of four bombers per team but even that isn't working correctly. Don't take my word for it. Take every top player's word for it. Countless youtube channels stopping with War Thunder content. Japanese belts will not be fixed. High tier tank and aircraft gameplay will not improve. The mods act like children and players are mostly in a bad mood. Japanese players beg tooth and nail for the H8K2 to return to the regular tree and we get a slap in the face with an insane research requirment and a FANTASY UNPAINTED CAMO.The GoodIt looks good.

												Update 4th April 2016: new pay2win elements were added to the game. Branches and leaves can now be mounted on tanks as camouflage. This addition makes tanks with sloped armor and small weak spots much stronger. Here's one example of a camouflaged tank (guess the tank): https://i.gyazo.com/e7b1d7871120928db64ba983c93c7dff.png---------I honestly can't recommend the game to new players.Here's my summary (mainly Ground Forces):- Gaijin (the developer) has no idea about game balancing.- some mechanics are completely broken, e.g. ricochets. (Gaijin doesn't care)- matchmaking is not balanced. (Gaijin doesn't care and made it even worse a few months ago)- proved bias towards a certain faction. (Gaijin doesn't care)- some premium vehicles are pay2win. (Gaijin doesn't care)- most maps suck, especially for Realistic and Simulator Battle players (Gaijin doesn't care)- experience and money gain lowered over the last few years. (Gaijin doesn't care)- Simulator Battle game mode was replaced by a bad event system. (Gaijin doesn't care)- paywall for certain things got bigger and a lottery system was introduced.- customer support is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ (you can't even change your e-mail address) - broken promises and constant lies- official forum = dictatorship- censorship is real (copyright strikes on YouTube videos; forum)- Gaijin does not listen to the player base. The only thing they care about are high player numbers and money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Time to post my review I guess.I used to play WT non stop, I loved it. But something happened in 2016. It just became unplayable for me. I was up tiered constantly fighting tanks and planes I had no hope of dealing with. The grind became so bad I just gave up on tier 4. And the ♥♥♥♥ing russian bias was so apparent it was almost funny.WT is nothing short of the prime example of a love/hate relationship. I love the gameplay and what is strived to be. But all its underlying issues and Gaijin not giving a damn to fix them makes me hate it.The community is the worst I have seen, balance doesnt exist, grind is unbearable and dont get me started on Gaijin.net.In its current state I give it a 3/10. It used to be a 5, but then malware happened and that WT isnt off Steam for Gaijin.net is incredible.DO NOT get WT, Its not worth your time in its current state and probably will never be worth your time ever again.

												The game as of 25th Sep 2015 is totally borked. - The developers ruin game balance and economy at every chance and never go back, no matter how bad the decision. - The developers boast historical accuracy yet give Cold War ammo to WW2 Era Tanks (e.g. B471D Ammo for the IS-2).- Premiums introduced this year have costed ridiculous amounts of money compared to previous vehicles.Great game, terrible developers;  Do not invest in this game as you would only reward them for their terrible behaviour.

												(I paid way too much money on this thing so I keep playing in vain and suffering, save yourselves)Update, 21/04/2017:Japanese Ground Forces CBT has finished, more vehicles have been added and more on the way. Some historical corrections are being made and we are to see more in distant future. Naval Forces CBT also look like as if it is around the corner.Tank decorations and branches/bushes added for costumization to ground forces. Bushes/Branches makes you tank less visible or almost invisible if well placed, giving both advantage and disadvantage. Advantage-->Being be able to ambush enemies. Stay stealthy.Disadvantage-->It costs Golden Eagles (In-Game Premium Currency), so prepare to say goodbye to bucks if you want to get them. Also only one side can be hidden completely.Pros:-Great Graphics.-Big variety of Aircraft,Tanks from Spanish Civil War to Cold War.-Still updating mechanics such as AI Naval Vessel turret horizontal & vertical targeting.-Only skill and knowledge matters in Realistic(Merely) and Simulator Battles.-Soviet tank players are provided with Stalinium armour.-You can learn a bit russian thanks to Russians on every server as if they are making a landing to servers.-You can learn many things about armament, flight characteristics of aircrafts, components of tanks and military operations and use knowledge to your advantage.-You can make friends around the world and have fun with them.Cons:-Still going on lack of WWII's historical accuracy in the game despite corrections being made this year. Will be fixed at some point.-A matchmaking & battle rating system that screwed up in the past 3 years.-Most of the vehicles that are being added or are planned to be added are generally unnecessary.-AI Tanks & Naval Vessels do not have inner structure (i.e: When you try to bomb naval vessels, they can simply go through them even with HE bombs and deal no damage)-Field AAA is dangerous so much that you can't fly with ease when AAA is firing at you, even at 5.000 meters high because they can snipe you when you do not expect them to do.-Dev Team is unlikely to listen to the community and decisions are generally unsatisfying.-Sadly, WWII vehicles can get matchmaked with post-WWII vehicles and this breaks the balance sometimes. Especially when you hit Tier IV and Tier V.-Most of the players play Arcade Battles in general, almost 80% of them.-You hardly see more than 1-2 vehicles being added to Axis while Allies get almost 3-4 or more. Especially Soviets get minimum of 2 while Japan gets nothing but premium ones mostly.-Most of vehicles that are being added every update are mostly never wanted or never brought up ones. Such as T-44-122 premium that no one ever mentioned or Do 17's Z-2 variant.-You won't ever notice that you keep paying money.-Gaijin will always come up with many ideas to keep leeching money, don't get affected by those and save your wallet.-Most of U.S.A & Soviet players don't know how to play in every mode, so does around %40 percentage of Japan & Germany players and half of Britain players.

												Update 1.37 turned this once-good game into a steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get ready for even more Soviet bias, German planes made of paper, jets in low tier battles. The new research system has set the architecture for an extreme grindfest thet is obviously intended to get players to pay to unlock planes within any reasonable amount of time. Only a single plane can be researched at a time per nation, meaning the fun of unlocking several planes when leveling up a nation is gone. If you don't have a lot of planes unlocked already in this game from before patch 1.37, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.			",143,6,1,13,11,0,13

												Steam prevented me to post the full sized review, so here's the SNIP. I actually have 10 days pvp time (just moved into steam). You can check my in-game profile under the same nickname.Long story short: - great engine, controls and graphics- Matchmaking is frustrating and unfair due to the +/- 1.0/1.6 spread which probably favours Premium accounts. Population can allow for better.- Ratings can be improved. But they mostly won't be.- Russian bias is a fact, anyone denying there is one is being dishonest, deal with it. It has been multiple times uncovered by able players in game data, with bloated coefficient favoring russian models and ammo. Gaijin sometimes buffs foreign units to momentary overpower just to say ""that's stronk, there no russian bias, see? )))) "" but that's not balance, it's a poor excuse for one. Meanwhile, T34s dominate with 10x the kills of other tanks and Yaks/Lavochkins are UFOs firing turbolasers. They were very good designs, severely damaged by inexperience and industrial faults, but the models that made their way into the game are just silly.Bias leads to outright nationalist cheating as it extends to filtering historical sources and crew manuals until we have discarded ""nazi propaganda"" and unshared ""sikrit dokumentz, comrade"". If Gaijin keeps on their tracks, we'll soon have articles telling the tale of the glorious motherland who singlehandedly defeated the krauts with flying tanks and absolutely no help from the cowardly allies.You can read plenty of stuff about this on the forums.- Speaking of which, the dev team NEVER answers the pesky questions and instead players face the incredibly arrogant and downright jerks composing the moderating team who ban players posting perfectly legit questions or inconvenient historical sources. This is ridiculous customer care.It could be an awesome game. It is not. Not because the devs can't fix it but because they don't want to.6/10 would NOT be forced into playing soviets again.

Posted: January 3, 2014
												I'll start listing the issues in a moment...When a developer deliberately lengthens in-game progression with the intent of encouraging people to buy their way through the roadblocks, I think twice about whether or not I should support their product. I think thrice when the game is still in beta and the micro-transactions store, allowing character progression, premium features, and premium aircraft, is fully implemented.War Thunder is not alone in this practise and does not go to the lengths that other games do, but this is not a valid excuse. Now, because the developer is doing all of this whilst the rest of the game is unfinished, no criticism should be reigned because it is still in beta. Following that logic, I’ll give a summary list of my gripes discovered through the 200+ hours I’ve had in the beta.The replay system is horribly unfinished. The UI for it is almost entirely missing, along with the entire in-game chat. Bomber turrets do not animate, and sounds are frequently absent. The in-game UI is poor, is often hard to see against the terrain or background, and does not do enough to convey information to the player. Useful details such as the fuel timer are inexplicably disabled by default.The game menus are an improvement, but once again, certain pieces of information are hard to see at first glance, or obscured in another menu. For example, you cannot view the historical data on your selected plane unless you enter the customisation hangar.The matchmaking system is incredibly frustrating, badly designed, and made even worse than before due to recent changes. Matchmaking will never be perfect in any game, but in War Thunder, I have nothing positive to say about this atrocious system. Games should never punish players for doing well, being skilled, or playing with their friends, yet that is exactly what this system does.The spread of planes across nations is strange, with firepower and battlefield roles varying greatly. Not every nation has access to a fighter-bomber or bomber early-on (particularly Germany), some nations have a wider variety of fighters (Russia, for example), and some fighters are too well-armed and too manoeuvrable for their level (again, a game balance issue). Some planes, such as the Swordfish, a British torpedo bi-plane, are rendered useless due to a complete absence of naval targets for their level. Some planes are the opposite - the I-153 Soviet bi-plane has unique access to rockets and bombs, which all other bi-planes do not have.Most plane names are given as easy-to-confuse number & letter designations, despite the fact that all planes had names. Even after 200+ hours, I could not remember that the Ju-87 is a Stuka! I can remember Blenheim, Swordfish, Spitfire etc, but the others? I had to correct this review because I got the Ki-53 mixed-up with the I-153, so in most matches I had no idea what I was fighting!The currency system is completely and utterly irrelevant to the game. Ammunition and repair purchasing is trivial; the currency system exists as a lever through which the developer can push their micro-transactions and progression-purchasing. The progression system, as mentioned, is deliberately slow to encourage purchasing. This is compounded by experience for each plane crew, for each nation, being different. This actively discourages players from trying other nations, and does nothing beneficial for the experience.Worthy of note is the Ace qualification. This is a plane crew upgrade which cannot be earned through the in-game currency and normal play. It is an upgrade which can only be purchased with real money and adds a significant amount of power to your plane and stacks with the other crew qualifications. Here, more than anywhere else in War Thunder, is the definition of ‘pay-to-win’, and there should be no argument. This is a purchase of power, with real money, which has a direct impact on game balance and cannot be earned through in-game progression.The patching system through the launcher is atrocious, CPU intensive, and has twice prevented me from playing for over a week. The launcher uses their own custom torrenting system which is vastly inferior to any freely-available torrent software. Because it refused to function correctly, I was unable to play War Thunder for two months since the last big patch. I had to get a copy of the game files (all in Russian) through BitTorrent in order to get it working. The fact that this system remains unchanged is beyond ridiculous.There are added problems in Historic and Full-Real Battles (or whatever they’re called now). I have encountered issues with the in-game Instructor fighting me for control of the plane. This was particularly evident during the first few attempts of Historic mode, when I would crash uncontrollably on the runway or slowly drop out of the sky. Even when disabled, the game Instructor regularly fights the player for control of the plane during a sharp but controllable turn. This causes the plane to wobble alarmingly during a turn, forcing it to turn even slower than usual.The above problem does not exist in Arcade mode, because the problem comes as part of the ‘realism’ package that makes the plane handling sluggish. There are also issues with fuel tank sizes being too small for some lower-level planes, and maps being too big (the two problems are linked, by the way).To briefly mention the Meta problems . . .I have noticed an alarming attitude with regards to the three game modes, particularly from moderators. The opinion of the invested is to snub arcade mode and those who play it as being sub-par, with the prevailing defence for complaints being: ‘you do not have a right to complain about game balance if you play arcade mode’. Frankly this is a rather disgusting attitude to have, which I suppose could be akin to some sort of elitism. I have played many hours on Historic mode and if you put the choice to me I would choose Arcade in a heartbeat. If Historic / Full-Real are “the way it’s meant to be played”, then it should actually be fun to fly the bally planes! And finally, Gaijin Entertainment is also notable for the trademark abuse and legal bullying of Brandon Harris which started in May 2013 and is STILL ongoing (I can’t link here, but I recommend you search for that). Couple this with allegations of censorship of criticism on forums they control, and you have further relevant information for anyone considering a purchase of War Thunder.So how can I conclude this?The sad part is that there is a terrific warplane simulator here, which feels great to fly, has a reliable physics engine, and has realistic damage models that put rival titles to shame. But all of this is buried under bad design decisions, micro-transactions, and a company of dubious integrity which I do not trust to fix War Thunder’s problems before launch.			",38,8,0,3,2,0,13

												At the time i'm writing this review, I have about 302 hours into the game.I mained the German nation (Going on Tier 5 Planes, Going on Tier 3-4 Ground).As everyone has mentioned a russian bias in one form or another, it is real.I know 302 hours isn't much compared to other plays, but I think its a valid amount to make a comment with.Russian Bias in Application (AIR):- ALL Russian aircraft are almost impossible to shoot down even with direct hits from cannons   (E.x. I was once flying my Tier 4 Me410 U1/A4 and I hit a Tier 2 Yak with a 50mm Air Target round... The Yak survived... This has happened more than once. And for scale, a 50mm Air Target round can one shot a heavy american bomber...)- Russian aircraft, notably the Yak line, have exaggerated climb rates that arent shown on stat profiles, but are very clear in game- Russian aircraft maintain speed a lot better than others- Russian BOMBERS have incredible AI Gunner Accuracy compared to other nations- The US has a P-51 Mustang, which was also given to Russia as a premium, the exact same plane... but with a lower BR- Russian machine guns are OP as ****Russian Bias in Application (GROUND):- If you fight a russian tank in the same Tier as you, you might as well ditch your tank, theres no point in fighting, as you need at least a tier higher tank to destroy a lower tier russian tank, unless you get a good shot.- Russians will always pen your armor- Russians are more likely to set your tank on fire- Russians deflect shots that shouldn't be possible (If you can pen 200+mm of armor, why can't you pen russian 80mm effective thickness at 90 degress WITH A TIGER!Honestly and factually speaking, each nation has their own benefits and drawbacks:- USA: Very balanced play style | Just as weak as they are strong- Germany: High speed, High Climb, strong ammo, metal armored planes | Crappy turning- Brits: Good turn fighting, Climbing, Accurate guns | Crappy armor- Japanese: AMAZING turn fighting | Crappy armor (""paper armor"")- Russia.... Amazing turn fighting, Amazing Climb Rate, Amazing Armor, Accurate Guns, Amazing Ammo... everything of which is boosted and not historically accurate, as oppose to other nations which more or less are.Every patch in a NutShell:- If Germany gets new plane -> Nerf German Air- If Russa gets new plane -> Nerf German Air- If Any Nation gets buffed -> Buff RussiaI know this review seems very bias against Russia, but honestly, you WILL notice a bias towards the Russian nation if you play this game.Overall the game is very fun and interesting, but its a BIG BIG turn off when you get killed by a Russian vehicle that was shotting in the opposite direction with a gun that can't pen your armor from any angle or spot.

												Since patch 1.37 I can't recommend.Prior to 1.37 I put up with the following: A toxic 'community' that includes some of the most fanatically deceptive fanboys i've ever encountered, very heavy handed censorship of criticism on Steam & official forum, bugs that don't get fixed, highly suspect flight & damage models (particularly for Soviet planes), badly implemented game mechanics like ramming/constant 1 shot kills if you don't pay to buff crews/terrible AI crew performance even with maximum (paid) buffing, and the list could go on. Developers put no emphasis on tactics or team play which lead to games where you had entire teams chasing a single plane, just comical. Since the game has zero facility to allow for team work, games are a total free-for-all.After 1.37 all the above problems remain with MORE added: Game design punishes successful players, Tiny rewards and incentive to progress means an incredibly long grind (we are talking YEARS to reach jets), High repair costs and high purchasing costs for planes with in game currency push players to pay to advance, Developers and English speaking forum helpers actively LIE claiming 1.37 changes make grinding easier & shorter, Developers ignore customer & tester feedback, Games as short as 120 seconds thanks to base rushing, Newbies are now treated like fodder at the bottom of the pyramid with paying & long term players able to pub stomp at whim. TLDR: Avoid. Patch 1.37 turned a fun shooter into a Ponzi scheme. Its never been a good flight/historical sim, now its not even an enjoyable shooter. For newbies the initial sandbox games can be deceptively balanced with a low grind, then they get thrown to the wolves and introduced to a grind of epic proportions. Ignore those who say its not Pay 2 Win, you either pay hundreds of dollars or suffer continual stomping. Developer response? Working as intended, No refunds, Quit Whining sucker..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros: - Fun to play in the beginning run for each tier- Graphics are beautiful- Detail on battlegrounds and tanks look and feel in place along with many tanks and planes to choose from- Occassionally you get to see great teamwork and feel like you're accomplishing something for onceCons:- Once you get to higher tiers you start to notice the horrific balancing issues of always being up-tiered by things your tank cannot even penetrate- When reach the 6.0 Battle Rating vehicles, it can take up to literal weeks to research a single tank or plane unless you wish to spend real money buying your way to it instead to skip the grind (basically 'buy our stuff or be stuck forever' ordeal)- Ever see a t-34 Go 0-60kmh in 5 seconds with a turret speed that can triple any other tank at it's rank? (Oblivious Russian Bias post)- Always that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teammate in spawn who kills half your crew in realism- When playing with friends who have other faction tanks than yours, the average que time can span up to 15 minutes across US and EU for a realism match, only to drive for 5 minutes, 1 shot killed, and not have enough points to respawn so you have to angrily tuck tail back to the main menu and wait for your friends to die as well for another good 30 minutes before you start the whole process over again. - As for the tank arcade, the war thunder definition of arcade is to show everyone's location precisely on the map and play hide and peek with 30 other♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in a waiting game to see who will have the balls enough to cap somethingI like the game yeah.

Its been 2 years since i staretd playing this game, and i never wished i had to say this.But i can't take this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t anymore.War thunder, is/has become a pay 2 win simulator.In all the 2 years i have played, i have watched the game go downhill step by step. Adding unecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like planes no one likes or knows, forcing you to buy and research planes to get the next one, and this applies to ALL planes. Unlike before, you could skip the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ planes you didn't want. You even have to pay for putting your country's flag on your plane. A F****** FLAG. You know those Plane camos you like? Pretty cool right? You have a choice of paying about a dollar or grind the F*** out of it. AND I MEAN GRIND YOUR F******♥♥♥♥♥OFF. JUST FOR A PLANE CAMO. If that isn't enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, Gaijin(The devs) have the BALLS to go and announce that the game is balanced.IT. IS. NOT.The Russian planes are so F****** undertiered, That you can't actually face the REAL planes they faced in WW2. The LAGG-3 variants were so♥♥♥♥♥♥IRL, should be the same here right? (Pardon me) ♥♥♥♥. NO.They are the most overpowered piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥you will ♥♥♥♥ing see at tier 1. You have a 20mm and 2 12,7s. Sounds not too bad right? Well, the only problem is, the closest thing that comes to that is The American F2F-3 Buffalo. WHICH HAS 4 12.7s. Now here's the thing.Your cannon is so ♥♥♥♥ing op. you can actually take down a plane in 1 hit. WITHOUT HITTING ANY VITAL PARTS OR AIMING AT ANY. I am not ♥♥♥♥ing joking. And those MGs? i actually took out a pilot 800 meters away by shooting twice(6 shots that last less than a second) I am not kidding you.But that's just the start. And if i were to rant about that, you would get an essay from me.Anyway, one more thing you should note. THERE IS NO TEAMWORK IN THIS GAME. NONE. ZERO. NADA. NIL. You got a zero on your♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ that, i'm gonna chase this near dead Wellington with 4 other planes on him. WT servers without friends in a nutshell. You want teamwork? You gonna need friends.

GAIJIN.I'm sorry, but the absolute last straw came in when i saw this rocket system implemented into the game. I was happy at first , then i saw:Starting with the premium Sherman Tank.You know, don't bother supporting this game which has become from a WOT saviour(Put more than 400 hours into that, quit about a year ago) to what WOT actually is like.♥♥♥♥♥♥ devs, Don't bother listening to their fans, favour the Russians so ♥♥♥♥ing badly, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ING COMMUNITY.Kinda ironic, isn't it?I've said enough.

												Why negative:1) Reload time is being changed by developers they way they want, completely independently from real conditions. I am not sure if its still like this now, but 1 year ago m18 hellcat had 8 sec reload and Sherman with the same cannon had 5 seconds reload, for example.2) Ammoracks are just broken, and broken intentionally. On many tanks ammorack is blowing up realistically in most of cases when its hit by a shell, like it should. But A LOT of tanks with very high caliber guns (like Maus, IS-2/3/4, KV-2, etc) for some stupid reasons have nearly unexplodable ammoracks. You penetrate them and hit ammorack directly, several times in different places, result? it just becomes black.3) Finally, absolutely utterly destroyed and annihilated balance on 5.7-8.0 Battle Rating.Before, like 1-2 years ago, War thunder had a lot lower historical limit on vehicles, the most late vehicles that were in the game (and had the highest BR - 7.7 or 8.0) were IS-4m, King tiger 105mm, panther 2, Early T-54 (it didnt have all the best late shells) and so on. Basically the latest vehicles in the game were designed in late 1940s or early 50s, and battle rating did make sense. However time was going and developer decided to add later vehicles with more advanced technologies, they started adding later T-54, T-10m, M60, Leopard 1, these tanks had HEAT shells with up to 400mm pen and sabot shells with a bit lower. And it would be COMPLETELY NORMAL, if ONLY they would give them PROPER BR, BR that would be way beyond 8.0. But guess what? there is still not even a single ground vehicle with BR higher than 8.0,  even though they have jets with BR 9.0. Probably the guy who defines ground veh balance cant count more than 8 just like gaben cant count more than 2. This becomes even worse now since they are adding more late vehicles like T-62 and ATGM vehicle for every side (controllable anti tank missiles). This entire mess is happening while there are such tanks as IS-2 and King Tiger on BR 6.7. Just think about it, regular late ww2 tanks are fighting with 60s vehicles with ATGMs, sabots and HEAT shells. 20 focking years difference. They even put one premium tank with ATGMs on br 6.7. As result of this completely idiotic balancing, many vehicles became completely unplayable, or barely playable in only some of situations. Adding tanks from 60s on BRs 7.7 and 8.0 caused lowering down BRs of some earlier vehicles like IS-3 and IS-4. Now we have vehicles that absolutely suck  against vehicles with just a bit higher BR they can meet in battle, but at the same time they are annihilating vehicles that are having a bit lower BR than they.

												Used to be a really good game with good progression system before 1.37 update. Now it's not even worth it, you have to work at least 2000% (estimated) more if you want to unlock a plane you want, including all previous planes along with new restriction to unlock 3 planes from previous tier.  Want to advance research on speicific plane? You can with free research points, there's a cost for it... required to use your own eagles to ""convert"" specific plane's research progress.Thanks a lot Gaijin for this bad progression system... * uninstalled *P.S. I would say it's fine for weapons' progression system, just don't do the plane's progression system.EDIT: This is OLD review, I have heard the update in January (2014) fixed the new progression system problems.EDIT2: By OLD review, I meant histroical review. I will NOT update this review. Please do not post, both positive and negative, here as it will be delete every time except for 3 posted in Feburary 2014. Thank you!			",91,13,0,3,3,0,1

Final review, after I rewrite this countless times and keep the ""quit-join again"" cycle going, now I finally broke the cycle. So, one last time, last review on War Thunder based on my experience in the latest patch 1.65 ""Way of the Samurai"".Still not recommended.Still I'm the OG Udonge who joined back in 2013.Still, multiple sections.Air battle:Now to be fair, gameplay is kinda sorta solid, hell, low rank battles are fun, so fun I actually enjoy it. It's probably the best part of this game, in the Realistic Battle mode, your plane performs in a more realistic way, while the simple control is still there. While in Arcade Battle you get to enjoy fast-paced dogfight action. After all this game is all about air combat when it was first released.However, old problem is still there, sparking, some planes over/underperforming, but to be honest, this isn't the worst part.Ground battle:In short, the fun ends here. Long story below.Despite its ""more realistic"" damage mechanics, ground battle overall is, well, I'll be straight, bad.It could've been fun, it has lots of potential. Oh no, Russian bias. And sometimes, Wehraboo's wet dream, though in my opinion these are minor issues. Spawnkilling would be a larger problem in my eyes.In a real war, it makes sense that the troops have to suppress the enemies, prevent them from getting into combat, but this is a video game, a losing team has to be given a chance to fight back, the most basic mechanic would be anti-spawnkilling mechanics, which War Thunder does not have. If you played old Battlefield like BF2 you'll know the pain of being killed just after spawning.Finally, the cutoff time(27 July, 1953, the day when Korean Armistice Agreement was signed) is now actually nonexistent, instead, it's now something called ""technological cutoff"". Now we got things from 60s, if not 70s, there'll be a vehicle from 80s too. Some armored vehicles on rank 5 are vehicles that're still in active service, such as the Japanese Type 74 Main Battle Tank, or the M163 VADS which seen combat in the Gulf War. Also the Type 87 ""Guntank"". Which I actually have no opinions on. Thing is, weapons like these lead to a problem, which I will explain later.Gameplay in general, balancing, etc.:First off, balancing. This isn't a problem for low rank battles, planes or tanks, as the performance of these low rank weapons are rather similar, and they're from the same era, more or less. However, the problem starts to be more severe as the rank goes up. And later you can see battles between weapons during WW2 and post-WW2. Assuming players of both side have the same skills, the person using post-war weapon will have a higher advantage, as their weapons are more advanced, especially the ATGM which is capable of destroying any and all WW2 tanks. For aircraft, it's pretty much the same.Second, research of the next vehicle/aircraft, and the rewards. It'll become more and more frustrating as the requirements become much higher, while the reward doesn't increase. Without premium membership, it may take you months, even a whole year to get a rank 5. Not to mention you'll need a certain number of vehicles to unlock the next rank, as well as the parts research, which is also demanding as the rank becoming higher. The old researching mechanic is obviously better, as you don't unlock a single plane, but a whole rank of different weapons, fighters, bombers, everything ready be put into your lineup. And you don't have to unlock lots of upgrade parts for your weapon in order to see 100% of the weapon's performance. In other words, there was no such thing called stock syndrome back then.Community:It's basically circle jerk right now, as the moderators hate anything negative, you see only positive things on the forum now. One word, ""censorship"".Also, it seems the playerbase is getting smaller, some experienced players I know already left the game as developers turning this game into pile of junk. Devs are putting more and more stuff into this game, maybe they can bring in new players, but vets won't come back if the devs don't listen to the players.Conclusion:There was always a choice. You just ♥♥♥♥ed it up.Also, this game basically a tobacco product, if you have never played this game, don't. Otherwise it'll be nearly impossible to get rid of the habit. You know it's bad, but you just can't stop.			",76,7,2,4,10,0,5

												I would of recommended this BEFORE 1.37, but since 1.37 changed everything, It is now ruined for what it was. I would wait for Gaijin to realize the mistake of the Tier I-V system that they have implemented to replace the Tier 1-20 system. They broke the HB which is now known as RB by introducing mixed nations to historical battles just like arcade which is a HUGE disappointment but this is way too far. If this is an attempt to compete or be 'better' than World of War Planes then this is a HUGE mistake. You were already blowing them out of the water! You may or may not have just sank to their level. Congrats. There is a possibility that you have have ruined a game that I loved, I just hope that you realise what you have done and fix this mess. I'll have to say that I don't recommend this game post 1.37 patch.			",144,11,0,10,8,5,6

												Well the game is turning quickly into a money sink scam. They are even banning anyone who points this out on their forums and here in steam forums. Ive been a steam member since the early days and never seen this behavior before. Don't kid yourselves, this game is turning into a massive P2W game. The game is fun in AB, but the biases are so obvious its almost shameful. The new patch was nothing more than a massive attempt to get people to spend more cash or you will have to grind forever and ever. If you don't have hundreds of dollars to throw away to be competitive, then get used to the idea that you will be fodder for the rest. Overall the game is good, but the company running it are on par with hedge fund managers. Buyer beware.			",14,2,0,5,7,0,16

												The Devs are a bunch of lazy inbred russians who have no feasible grasp of game making, or logic in general. They money grub off of the community and don't listen to us. I would not reccomend spending money on this game or treating it  as anything more than a space ship arcade simulator with so much bias towards your home country, that if playing correctly, you can never lose. Also, not to mention that the game pushes all kinds of scumbag actions like kill stealing, and rewards those who are greedy and don't even try to put effort into the game or teamwork. Also, if you're mad at someone just push the report button and write a BS story. Guaranteed chatban.			",42,0,0,4,5,0,11

												You know, I put quite a few hours into this game and REALLY had a hard time doing this, but this game is too frustrating to recommend. It's F2P, so you probably know what you are getting into (grinding, paying for bonus xp, etc.). This is mainly concerning the tank portion of the game, but I feel the planes are similar.The topic du jour with WT is russian bias. Now, when I first heard this, I was skeptical as there are whiners in every game. There is definitely some questionably statted russian tanks, but the problem to me is the matchmaking. The matchmaking is terrible, you are often matched against overtiered tanks that you have no hope of penning. I get that there are game balancing issues vs. historical accuracy, but when you are in your Tiger I or Panther staring down a Tiger 2 or some cold war russian behemoth with futuristic ammo, you literally can't destroy the other tank without some heroic flanking maneuvers. That guy gets 10 kills and you are stuck trying to find the poor schmuck who got over-tiered in his tank before you get one-shotted. Repeat that 100 times and you'll realize you have better things to do wqith your life.			",188,36,1,26,6,2,42

												The game was fun in the beginning. You stop playing because your computer cant hack ( not able to play - not literally meaning hacking of the game,) it with updates done by game maker. So you stop playing for a yr or so. Sign in after making a api validator only to find out you have been banned for crap you did while you had the game uninstalled. Then you contact customer support (is a joke) only not to receive even an acknowledgement that you submitted anything, from GMs that clearly left the dev team. Then when you find one that is active they dont even respond. So 3 weels later you come on their store page and rip them on a review! Priceless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know you've been playing too much War Thunder when...You have a panic attack while driving over bridges. You assume other drivers are going to push you off at any moment.While looking at cars you picture them in x-ray mode, noting where the critical modules are.While looking at planes in real life, you picture a target in front of them, guessing how much you would have to lead the target.You get frustrated with your car mechanic when he can't fix your car in under one minute.You can only hold your breath underwater for five seconds before you drown.You suddenly can pronounce German and Russian.While watching the news you see an airliner attempt a landing with one wing. ""No big deal"" you think.You get nervous when you hear a plane above you.You know more about flying planes than some pilots and you have never flown a plane.When you see two kids' kites get tied up together, you mutter to yourself, ""damn team killers...""You freak out every time someone tailgates you.You constantly beg your optometrist for ""keen vision,"" even though your vision is 20/20.You don't have to use an alarm clock anymore. You sit bolt upright after nightmares of ""YOUR LEFT WING!""You drive a car that has two fire extinguishers inside, a set of tracks instead of a spare tire, and a hatchet and a shovel on the side.When the car dealership asks what color you want, you insist on bicolor summer camouflage.When a cop pulls you over and asks why your steering wheel has been replaced with a joystick, you tell him ""simulator mode.""You get fired from your towing job because you towed a car upside down while the driver was still inside.You drive right through Road Closed and Flood warning signs into 4 feet of water. Only after you car is completely submerged do you get nervous.			",21,4,0,2,0,0,1

												Welcome to ""Glorious Soviet Victory Simulator,"" comrade, Glorious Leader Putin's counter to ""America's Army"" is now available to whole world.  Allow me to explain how game works:This is war game, there are two sides: Russia and Losers.  Choose wisely, comrade.As is formula for all pay-to-win games, units you give us American dollars for will not only be more powerful but also undervalued in BR, so that you can sneak them into games where everyone will be even more below you in power and you can feel like a Real Man.  The kind of Real Man who beats his wife for laughs after too much vodka, Glory to the Motherland!Like every other online war game out there, there are people who use hacks to cheat & win.  Unlike every other game, however, our method of dealing with them is not to defeat hackers but rather simply try to ban their videos on YouTube and censor anyone from talking about them.  This is because we have managed to create the only collection of Russian programmers in the world where no one knows anything about hacking.We will claim that you do not really have to pay us American dollars to win, because everything can be unlocked with enough grinding, except, of course, all the things that cannot be unlocked except through giving us American dollars.  Things like super units, top crew skill levels, and more hanger space to screw the BR system with.  You know, those things used by our whales, er, we mean ""top players"" to ""gain a competetive edge"" (read: win with no effort).  This is good example to remember whenever we make claims about anything, comrade.Maybe if game was made by someone else we could fix these problems, but that would mean handing creative control over to people who didn't live in fear of being sent to Siberia if any actual realism slipped in or if they couldn't make their protection money payments to Glorious Leader Putin.  Why would we allow that to happen, comrade?  We have good system here.  We get you stupid Americans to give us money just to show you why Russan everything is always better.  Why would we change anything?			",62,5,1,22,28,0,26

												The worst part about this game is that it has the potential to be something great. It is a game based around what is essentially a fight with physics, but has some of the worst coding when it comes to physics in any game out there. You'll see fighters prop hang while shooting their 20mm cannons sub 50kph, T-34s bounce a 17pdr shell at a 20 degree angle, and so much more.A positive for the game is that it is updated regularly, however those updates rarely address any of the crippling flaws the game has. RB air hasn't seen a new map in years, and tanks suffer from a horrible matchmaking/balancing system. The patches are mere bandaids that never address the real issues. Prepare to roll out with your team comprised of 76 Shermans against a team full of Tigers and Panthers. While not impossible to win, it is horribly skewed in their favor. And that is just one of many possible scenarios.The game can be exceptionally fun. However, if you're looking for a balanced gaming experience that rewards a well placed shot or well executed maneuver, you're better off looking elsewhere. This game requires an even temperment and the ability to shrug off the mass of inconsistencies that the game will throw at you on a game by game basis. You've been warned.			",130,6,1,16,4,1,19

Sometimes you get uptiered as hell. So you have to fight a T-10M in your Tiger II P. (Sekrit documints.) Also, the devs are keep making the game worse and worse with each and every update. I've been in-game for almost 3 years now. I know what I'm talking about. I've also spent a decent amount of dosh in the game. Pls Gaijin fix the game. I might check the game out from time to time but for now it's just bad. Also they don't even know how to host a tournament. For example: the E-100 tournamet. It was bugged for so many ppl.

												Prior to patch 1.37 I had fun with the game. It was fun, easy to learn, and though it took a while to find a match in anything other than arcade mode, the matchmaking was actually balanced.They recently dropped the ball, however, and released a patch that the vast majority of the community agree was a mistake.The ""Research"" system is pointless, and only serves to lock you out of planes. If you do manage to get a plane, good luck affording it if you've been buying modifications for your existing planes, since you have to buy it after 'unlocking' it.The game balance has been screwed over too. Bombers are pointless now, despite the objectives in most game mades being to destroy ground targets.  If you're not in a plane with a 30mm cannon, well, sucks to be you. New to the game? Lucky you. You get to fly against spitfires and Laggs, they'll one hit you. Good luck.For now, I strongly caution anyone against spending money on this game. Hopefully the devs will sort this out, because I can't reccomend it in its current state. It's sad, because I really loved this game just a few days ago.			",79,7,0,4,4,0,16

												(TL;DR at the bottom) As you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this game.The fact that I've been playing it for so long only makes me sadder writing this review, because I simply can't recommend it (as much as I want to). Heres why:The devs just don't care.The gameplay itself is great and I've had such a blast playing this game over the past few years, but the devs just don't care about the game or the players, even though they pretend to. They never listen to the community; ignoring balancing issues and not even slightly punishing players who should be (constant team killing etc.). They also have done a few shady things in the past:- Sued an individual for using the domain name ""Gaijin.net"" even though the original gaijin.net predated the company by seven years.- Threatened to ruin part of the game if players didn't help them abuse youtube's DMCA strikes against youtubers that showed bad things about the game.Their complete lack of concern for the playerbase and the game itself also means that there are much less people playing, so if you want to do realistic battles good luck because there are few people playing, and gueueing for simulator battles can take up to 20 mins.Oh, and don't even get me started on their ""customer support"". TL;DR: This game had great potential, but due to gaijin being such a terrible developer team they ran it into the ground, which really is a shame.			",143,12,2,7,17,0,17

Posted: September 10, 2016
												Not that I anticipate this review to be seen very much, but having been with the game since 2012 I feel compelled to make one. I have played the predecessor games (Wings/Birds of Prey and Birds of Steel) as well as put about 3000+ hours of time into WT, not all on the Steam version, but before steam link and including a previous account, and I just want to offer my perspective on the game.War Thunder has undergone a large amount of changes in 4 years, which is to be expected. There was never a physical, celebratory  release of the game from Open Beta into an actual game. That being said, it's not for the worse for it. The game used to have some very unbalanced features (Some may remember the horrors of 2 minute games with Yer Thunder, or the B-17 bomber aces with laser gunners, or farther back the scourge of the D-13 dominating the game). Recently, the ATGM tanks (which just require some changing of tactics) have been put down as 'bias' and 'unfair'. The game is much more balanced than many other vehicle-based combat games.Also, trying to compare War Thunder to other games (World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, etc.) is not an apt comparison, the games are set up very differently, and WT is really a game all it's own.As time has passed, most of the larger, more game-breaking imbalances have been corrected and despite what people may tell you, the cries of Russian/US/British/German/Japanese Bias are all unfounded. In the vast majority of places it's simply someone not knowing how to counter any specific group of planes (for example shooting a Lagg-3's wooden wings). There are some widely considered to be undertiered/overtiered tanks and aircraft. This is always in flux as the BRs for some vehicles change nearly patch to patch. Additionally things like damage and flight models for vehicles are being tweaked and adjusted on a constant basis.Things that may be present in more intense simulators (things like unreliable engines, imperfect manufacturing, crew shellshock, etc.) aren't modeled into War Thunder. The vehicles in the game perform as close to they can while also maintaining easier control schemes for different game modes. For example, if you play simulator, you may be able to get better performance out of your plane than realistic mode due to being able to have a more complex control setup.In terms of business-wise and staff-wise, Gaijin leaves some things to be desired. Some of the staff can be abrasive at times, but for the most part they are all pretty well-informed community aides. I, personally, have never had a bad experience with game moderators, forum moderators, or support members. Some say they have, but I can't offer insight into those cases. Every issue that I have gone to support with I have received help with and been able to resolve the issue. As a business, Gaijin has really been using the F2P model with microtransactions for in-game currency (called Golden Eagles). GE can be used for premium time, premium vehicles (they earn more research and silver lion currency then non-premium vehicles), and decals and camos to adorn your vehicles with (most of these can be unlocked for free with playtime). Again, you will see a lot of cries of Pay-to-Win here, but that isn't the case. The model that it is is really Pay-to-Advance, as the increased rewards just help with research times and working your way up the grinding ladder.If you're looking for realism, War Thunder may not be the best game, simply because play is simplified for a wider playerbase, which is something people mark as a bad thing, but it's just a business move. The game has always been that way, and will continue to be more simple-focused, which isn't to bash on people playing in these modes, there are just more people in those modes.Gameplay is fairly easy to catch on to, but does take some time, patience, and practice to master. Knowing what your plane or tank can do, what strengths/weaknesses it has, and other attributes of your vehicle as well as the same of the enemy vehicles that you face is needed. The game is a time investment, you won't be able to hop right into it and get to top-tier in a week or two, it'll take longer than that.Edit: On hacking/cheating. Gaijin regularly (every month or so) announces how many accounts were determined to be using 'external modifications. and bans those accounts permanently. Most of the time, you will encounter no cheats, people can make vehicles do some pretty smooth tricks with gameplay mechanics, or are just better-than-average and players will look for an excuse as to why they lost. Not saying it to be elitist, but that's just honesty.Edit: Playerbase. To be honest the playerbase much anymore is filled with a lot of people who are all too happy to rage and vent anger in any way they can (cries of bias, teamkilling, spamming caps). These players are in the minority, most players are quiet and occasionally will say something or two. I cannot fault the game for actions of the people playing it. And there are a lot of good people out there in the game (the majority of players). I recommend playing alone or with people that you know you communicate well with. A squad of 4 people can clean house in any given game if they know each other and what they're doing.There are frustrating moments. Mainly for me, game updates are blocked on most of the networks I play on, as they do outside network security and Peer-to-Peer downloading is blocked. (Colleges, a lot of libraries, the like). I have not had much at all in the way of game bugs or glitches, crashes, or anything of that sort. You will come across some limitations, especially on older machines, but don't be deterred. I played on a potatotop for a year on minimum settings at 30fps, the game was still enjoyable.TL;DR- War Thunder has some realistic attributes, but also some simplified attributes. Don't listen to people crying wolf with bias, use your own patience and know-how to play and it is fun and rewarding. Be prepared to invest your time into the game, not for a quick rush to the 'end'. Play the game, if you find it fun or entertaining, stick around, just go along with the ride.PS- If anyone is looking to play, or discuss the game, feel free to find me in-game and I would be happy to join!

												The game is very fun if you ignore all historical value this game once promised. While in Closed beta the devs were very clear that the historical timelines would be the building blocks for this game. For example a very common aircraft like the 109 G6 or P51 would be more common because the repair cost and xp reward would be greater then aircraft that would be considered over powered for the year it flew. So in 1945 when 262 would be seen. The 262's cost of repair, ammo, and xp would give you no reward that would make it worth running it too much. Now the devs only see the money, not the historical value. If anyone opened a history book on the P63 and the P36 you'd see they had a habit to flat spin. I understand there is a Simulation mode, but that still doesn't adjust the year differences. An F6F has no buisness seeing HE112s! A late 1930s plane versus a mid 1940s plane.... I either will say the devs really just don't care about their older fans, or that most pilots of the US planes are so bad and complain so much that they need to be matched with planes from pre and early stages of the war. The Devs don't like the Japanese, they get a plane every 4 or 5 patches. The Russians are armed to the teeth with 1950s clubbing seals on 1945 German planes (execpt the Mig and F86)... Again my biggest gripe with this game is the Devs changing the one promise that made them stand out. For those who don't care about historical value you'll love this game. For those who are fanatacis about WWII aviation and armor you will be disappointed by the following(assuming you don't buy your way up the tree); Airforces (teir/nation) Russian:5 Japan:3 US:5 German:4 Britiain:4 ground forces German:4 Russian:5. I've played all the nations and grinded every tank and plane with out buying my way up the tree and with out using only premium planes. In WoT yeah I milked the Type 59 for every xp and credit it would let me take. Crap off topic, again not historical and will please the biggest spenders... the Americans and Russians.Oh and the reason they keep the 262 at tier 5 with a battle rating to meet the F86s and Mig 15s.... it's 30s! The HE162 was hit with the nerf club, so grinding the German Mig 15 is impossible and will take a life time to grind with out the 130% gain from the HE162. It's been said before and I will say it here. The other major killer of this game is the teams... I have been on some teams that just know what they are doing! They can aim, they know how to use altitude, BnZ, and stall fighting.... but that is rare 70% your team will be stuck on the deck killing AI and shooting AAA with a high altitude fighter. Also high altitude fighters like the TA 152, FW 190Ds, P51s, ect never really see the best of thier abilities because the fights again never make it above 5km. The Yak fighters historally were great on the deck and at low altitudes. With out a doubt there! WoT vs WT ground forces.... at least WoT is less grindy. The one BIG plus to WT groundforces, none of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t lower plate weak♥♥♥♥♥♥for the German armor! More importantly when the US tanks are launched none of that weak hull crap either. The M103 was a beast in real life and I expect to see it tear IS4s and T54s apart. The KT 105 is less leathel then the KT in tier 4. Don't grind for German tier 5 it's not worth it. Get Tier 4..... if the grind doesn't kill you. When GF first came out the Simulator game mode was amazing! The experience was AMAZING! and the credits poured in! Then the Devs demanded more money and longer grinds and beat the crap out of GF. I literally made it to Tier 4 in about two days from the initial release of GF. Both Russian and German trees.... now... pffft I still am not close to getting my Tier 5 tank because it's too painful to play this arcade crap!			",43,5,0,9,11,0,11

												This game once was a very nice and good developed game, But slowly patch after patch it gets worse and worse, almost reaching WoWP level.Worse is even that you get banned for speaking out on the forum, guess russians didnt forget the CCCP that quickly, free opinion not allowed.Its a nice enough game if you start and know a bit about flying. if you dont, leave it be. Low tiers (which dont count as battle rating dictates match making) are hopelessly outclassed by professianal sealclubbers. up to high tiers which are a grindfest which make World of Tanks look like a breeze in the park...see for yourself and you probably quit after a couple of weeks...

												I would of recommended this BEFORE 1.37, but since 1.37 changed everything, It is now ruined for what it was. I would wait for Gaijin to realize the mistake of the Tier I-V system that they have implemented to replace the Tier 1-20 system.  Also they broke the HB which is now known as RB by introducing mixed nations just like arcade which is a HUGE disappointment.  I loved this game so much because of the Historical Battles, but this is way too far.  If this is an attempt to compete with WoWP, you didn't need to change anything, because you were already blowing them out of the water.  Now you sank to their level, goodjob.			",83,11,1,10,19,0,25

												619 hours as of this review.... I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to play as the Americans. If you want to munch on American tanks and planes, then by all means give it a try. Pros- graphics- realistic tank/plane models- solid maps- good gameplay mechanics- free (kinda)Cons- absolutely no balance between nations (Germans and Russians are clearly superior in almost every way)- the grind for new vehicles is insane once you reach mid tiers- People who pay for premium vehicles have a massive advantage over the people who actually do the grinding- Can make you want to break your keyboard in halfAt first, War Thunder is an extremely fun game, looks great, plays great. I play primarily as the Americans (both Air and Ground), although i have spent a good bit of time playing as British planes, and German tanks. After spending a lot of time on this game, and getting past the first couple tiers of vehicles, you start realizing that Russian aircraft are performing physic defying manuevers, and German and Russian tanks are massively superior to their American and British counterparts. I had a load of fun with this game at first, but after putting a lot of time and effort (and a little of my money, because the grind was way too difficult without it) I have to say that I am deeply dissapointed with where this game led me. Basically, if you want to play as German or Soviet's, you will have a blast munching on the squishy American and British tanks, and sluggish American planes. I would love to give this a Thumbs up, because I have put so many hours into it and had a some fun for awhile, but due to the imbalance of the rosters, I cannot say that I am currently happy with this game.

												+ Looks awesome across the board.+ Great performence and lots of options to configure this game to your liking.+ Almost no blue print/prototype planes.+ Sound effects are very nice.+ polished (pretty much no bugs, match UI is good though there is slight mouse lag inside the menus which is rather annoying).+ Easy controls for people without a fly stick.+ 3 game modes, something for everyone.+ It's free to play.+ It is currently not pay to win (except the 'reserve plane' and premium hangar slots which only affects Arcade mode).- In Mid to High tiers this turns into a huge grindfest.- Broken flight and damage models on certain planes that have been added several major patches ago and they keep putting more unfinished planes with placeholder physics in - instead of finishing what is already there.- There have been extremely OP premium ('flavour of the patch') planes with each patch who got nerfed some patches later. I suspect powercreep.- Stock planes to ""upgraded"" planes have a huge performence delta making the level grind painful and hard.- There has been a lot of ""remove content to make it pay2get/unlock with grind"", skins, decals, unlocks etc.- Bombers are having a hard time getting properly balanced, in low tier they are Bullet Sponges while they die like♥♥♥♥♥♥in Mid/High tier games.- If you put 5 Nations into the game support them all equally or don't bother adding them in the first place .- Power of Stalinwood and Leninium - If you know what I mean. (This is pretty open to debate though and it's not the case with every plane)- The whole Jet/High tier stuff seems fairly unfinished right now in terms of content and balance.If you want a real ""simulator"" that is equal to RL don't bother, sim battles is a nice mode but it still lacks realism and complexity. I recommend IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad for WW2 sim nuts and DCS (modular free2play too) world if you want to play with modern Jets.If you want some ""quick"" action without a huge learning curve, realism and arcade mode should be good modes for you.TL;DRI don't recommend buying anything for this game atm due to the amount of big changes especially to premium content but it is worth getting to have some fun :) ",76,8,1,8,17,0,31

												As of update 1.53, Gaijin is not even trying to hide the russian bias in ground forces(tank battles). Combined with a completely broken matchmaking system, penetration mechanics that rely on RNG, and a total disregard to the communities opinion makes this game not worth hard drive space. Which is sad considering the game itself has so much potential but is operated buy a bunch of money hungry russians that will do anything to make a quick buck.Overall communism/10 now have irrational hate for russia.

												The game is slowly dying and mostly used by the dev as a cash cow. This review was updated to summerize the growing list of problems.- constant pop ups on log in urging you to buy premium- After battle reports displaying what you 'could have earned' if you had premium- Premium items being incredibly overpriced, up to $60 for one tank in some cases- incredibly slow lifetime long grind to get anywhere in the game, no doubt a method to push premium- free experience (you must use credit to unlock this) generated at a rate far too high in relation to unit experience- challenges that reward free tanks but basically require the purchase of premium xp bonuses- did i mention they push premium? - constant recycling of units by the devs, they stick a swastika on a churchill and expect you to pay for it- very thin unit trees, they have a large number of T-34 variants but zero japanese tanks- that roll mechanic...- poor map designs that are quite boring- spawn camping (although we have all done it in our time)- hackers- Gaijins method (or lack there of) for combating hackers, which origionally was to remove realistic mode, but now they really stepped it up a notch by having the grand strategy of doing nothing- Number 1 rule of War Thunder club: dont talk about hacking*feel free to add to this listBut the most telling issue with the games future is the upcoming War Thunder Coast Guard, and no im not here to complain about ship size (as we all know its not the size of the boat, its the motion of the ocean). The thing i wish to point out is that Gaijin is not even capable of hosting a non-pixelated stream showing off its latest offering.When the list of issues is nearly unending before boats are even released and gaijin couldnt even manage a stream let alone this steaming turd, it dosnt surprise me they are losing the player base. When a dev takes such little pride in its product i take such little pride in playing it.			",78,10,4,8,29,1,31

By deliberately collecting all the worst design choices from similar games (most notably those of Wargaming), Gaijin are shining a light on these terrible practices and acting out an exemplary cautionary tale.The developers are actually performance artists, who cause us to question the trend of soft launches, and ask 'wouldn't it be terrible if a real game was run by a team as deluded, incompetent and deceitful as the one we are portraying?'.Their most recent installation piece, entitled ""1.37, or how I learned to stop worrying and♥♥♥♥♥♥off my entire playerbase"" attempts to find the quickest way to sabotage a successful game, and manages it with aplomb.A satirical tour-de-force.

												Are you looking for a game that accurately portrays WWII warfare? Then look somewhere else because that is not this game. The balancing is terrible and not up to historical records. There are multiple instances of russian biases (they get double payload for standard shells, tu-4, flame retardence across ALL planes, etc.). It is a timesink. I cannot reccomend putting the time into getting RP for tiering up when the developers literally just copy paste vehicles across tiers. If you play free expect to grind across an eternity.DO NOT PLAY.			",64,4,1,8,15,0,10

I've got probably triple the hours Steam shows as I don't usually play through SteamIt has a ton of potential, but it's wasted by those Russians. They say there isn't a Russian bias as my 17pdr shells bounce off the side of a T-34 who is perpindicular to me. They say it as the Russian tanks get undertiered. And they say it as the Russian planes do that Red Tails manuever.The shell mechanics are equally frustrating and awe inspiring as your SU-100Y rips a Leopard I to pieces, or your Panzer IV F2 blows through a M4 Sherman at over a km away.I really really want to love this game, and I most certainly used to, but ATGMs broke high tier matches, German SPAA dominates low tier matches (usually) and a host of other features including your shells stopping to exist if you die, so you can't ""kill from beyond the grave"" anymore. The graphics are beautiful, and the playerbase, matchmaker, forums(so I hear, I don't go there myself), and obvious bias are massive steaming piles of bull. There's also features if you're a good player, like always getting completely out tiered, bomb and rocket near misses killing you every time, artillery killing you with the opening shell, your shells being extra bouncy and your guns inaccurate, and so on and so forth. What people say about the game that is good is usually true, but what they say is bad is almost never false. If you can find some people to play custom battles with I'm sure it could be loads of fun. My clan (5D) played our own simulator battles actually based off historical events (Stalingrad, Normandy, etc) and unlike the Gaijin sponsored ones, actually were historically accurate.Maybe the upcoming ""World War"" mode will save the game, but sadly, this doesn't seem likely. I really wish this game could be fun, but after you play long enough, all you see are the problems in it, and the fact that your team is literally less than useless.			",196,26,2,16,27,0,20

												While playing this game it occured to me that the more time i spent partaking in the tedium, and the grind, the less fun i had. Initially, tank fights were very fun to play - an experience (one of few) i was able to take away from this game that was positive. It was simple - you shoot them and they shoot you. As i ascended in the ranks of both russia and US tanks (3.0-5.0), that same ideal stayed relativley intact; some tanks became more armoured than others but it wasn't impossible to kill them and a miracle shot wasn't something unheard of. There were clear trade offs with the tanks - Some offered more speed with a better gun, but less armour as a whole. Some were more armoured with decent speed but a crappier gun, and it goes on. No tank was without weakness in major areas, and the areas were very clear. This added a bit of interesting gameplay and it helped me learn how to turn my tanks in certain ways to block shots, or where to shoot tanks to get the maximum amount of damage and i reveled in that. It was interesting gamplay, and it was very immersive. I had spent a large portion of my time playing War Thunder at this metaphorical 'sweet spot'. Then i got my first 5.7 tank and i started to get matched with 6.0 and 6.3. An occasional 6.7 would appear, as well.  I would position myself no different than before and die instantly. I would fire away at tanks shot after shot, trying so desperatley to find a place to hit but die quickly after i was spotted after causing minimal damage. Most times, i would find fair matches but it was also the unfair matches i remember most vividly. I kept telling myself that once I was on equal ground, it would be more fun again. It kept me going to repeat that. Then i got my first 6.0 tank. Long gone were the times where i could just shoot at other tanks and cause damage. I was finding myself dying over and over even though i had been doing nothing different than before. Constanty dying to a single shot even though my shots never got the chance to even penetrate. When i did get a kill, it wasn't satisfying. It felt owed to me - and after spending the better part of 10-15 minutes driving my slow tank, i felt that it should've too.After some research on why my performance has suffered so badly, i learned that the game completley changes at 6.0+ with no warning to it's players. Instead of having huge killzones, tanks now had tiny weak spots to shoot and you were damned if you couldn't hit them. Some tanks were still thinly armored with guns equal to those of the slow cumbersome variety. There was no way to win for me but to sit and ambush or invest in these tanks that demanded tedium to drive. If i managed to get to a shooting zone that was profitable for me, I ended up getting bombed.The game was stale. It wasn't fun to play anymore. The tanks - they were wildly cool. As an enthusiast, i was thrilled at the idea of getting to drive them. It's unfortunate that the game becomes so unbearable at the higher tiers becuase i was really looking forward to playing a simple tank game like it was when i started. I wanted more than World of Tanks... but i also wanted less than the complexity this offered. I only hope that in the future they make a balancing pass at the game. And i sure hope that the ships don't come out like this did. I havent even started on the grinding process of this game. You will not get far without premium or a tank that costs money.

												As it stands right now, I would say no to recommending this game to anyone who doesn't already play it. The game is slowly going down hill. Everything from broken patches to 3/4 of the current player base for the aviation section complaining about problems that should have been addressed to the customer standards a while ago and nothing was ever done. Until Gaijin dev's take their heads out of their asses and actually put forth the effort to cator to the majority of their clients, I feel this game is doomed. Which saddens me, because the game has so much potential to be an awesome game.			",119,17,5,16,28,2,14

												The game has been going down hill at a constant rate for about a year now. The Russian bias is growing more and more with each patch they send out. The game used to be ballanced and fun, now its ""oh look I'm in a tank from 1944 fighting tanks from the mids 60's"" Driving a German heavy is like riding around ina car with a gas tank thats painted with the words ""please shoot me"" They have no armor as far as I can tell. If you try to fight a Russian tank one on one you will lose 9 out of 10 times. Also as far as I can tell Russian players seem to have some sort of buff when they play, their armor gets thicker and their guns hit harder. One last thing, the Russian pay for tanks are massively overpowered, they out class every tank they fight by a huge gap. This was a good game but not any more, thumbs down.			",53,4,0,5,14,0,12

												I got this game 1 day before the latest patch... (1.37)The first day was fun... everything were smooth... even matches... good controls... all and all it seemed a well done game...The day after... it suddenly turned into an obvious money sink... astonishingly uneven matches (sooo much fun to go up against FW-190s or Spitfires in my biplane)on top of that i started to get horrendous lag... whatever plane i get into (even bombers) i get miraculously one shotted by tracer rounds flying 100 yards beside me... mouse stuttering making the gameplay futile struggle...Progression is a lot slower now and if you just start  the game like me you are at a huge disadvantage, especially constantly facing opponents several tiers/ranks above you...Very unfortunate... that first day i thought i found a really good game... amazing how it turned out to be a money trap with technical failures overnight...

												Another edit and this time i'll make it short.The game is officially dying.Gaijin never bothered about the players , it was just about the money.People will say that there's no ""russian bias"" nor ""RNG bias"". They're just blind fanboys. Its Russian biased and most of all. Luck biased. Skills barely rewards. Speaking of balance, there is NONE, its gone. Forever. Forget about this game. If you want a realistic multiplayer game , Aces high 2 , or DCS world. Done. Forget about this heresy gaijin pulled it out of vodka bottle.			",44,7,1,6,3,0,4

												Bottom Line Up Front: The only reasons to play this game are A) Because it's the only one of its kind (slightly more realistic than World of Tanks) and B) You suffer from crippling deppresion.In either case the grind will make you wish for the sweet release of death. I can't properly explain how bad the grind is because no matter what I say you'll fly through the first few tiers thinking I'm a liar. By the time you've realized your mistake you'll have invested so much time into the game that you'll continue on regardless. Once you reach the King Tiger/M26/IS-2 it will take approximately 90 games to research a fire extinguisher. I don't know how many it would take to research spare parts (to repair a thrown track/damaged gun etc.) though it will be significantly less. The grind gets worse than that but I haven't made it any farther.Anyone who's already played this game will be thinking about the fact that I haven't mentioned aircraft in War Thunder, which is significantly kinder on the grind portion of things. The reason for this is because of rudder wobble, and issue that exsists only with joysticks (google warthunder rudder wobble and take note of the age/frequency of posts). For reference imagine pushing the nose to the right, releasing pressure and having the nose go to the left in an equal and opposite fashion. Note that from an input point of view I've effectively gone from +100 to 0. The supposed solution to this is to reduce your sensitvity to as near 0 as possible and to reiterate this isn't an issue mouse/keyboard users suffer from.In closing I'll desperately ask you, the reader to avoid this game for the safety of your mind. Regardless, as I mentioned this is the only game on the market to reward so heavily careful and well through out aim via it's damage model. Even so it's attempt at realism is hampered by terrible hit registration and lack of important concepts such as spalling/smoke/overmatching.P.S. It was found once that (at a coding level) Russian shells were better than any other nation at the same caliber. Shocker.			",133,27,4,31,14,1,39

												This game is just....bad. Let's see with the new update you basically have to WASTE your life to get another plane. Or if you are a rich player, you can use your golden crowns and just get the plane right then.  The gameplay isn't intense, as you will spend most of your fights spinning in circles trying to shoot down your opponent, and getting rammed by noobs who cannot fight to save their life. I was excited about this game at first, but I just realize it's another Pay-to-win game.What a waste of my time and computer memory.			",35,0,0,0,2,0,2

												The latest patch has completely destroyed the game. Now you can fly for Nazi Germany in a British plane, and other crap. You want a good flying game? Download Rise of Flight. The non-Steam version is free, and you get two of the best planes without having to pay a single cent. War Thunder started out as promising, but now it's just turned into a money mnaking machine, with no regard for historical accuracy or immersion. I'll be waiting for IL2 Sturmovik - Battle of Stalingrad, rather than playing this turd.			",37,1,0,1,6,0,11

												Edit: Yes I'm still playing this because my only other option is MWO and I've already touched that stove (I'll always miss my 9AL pre-Ghost Heat). Had a match in Berlin, spawned north side. Thought I'd flank around wide in my M18 Hellcat, sticking to the back roads for the time being. Ideal conditions for the thing. Oh, they've hit my speed again, welp. Pan camera around checking for any enemies, it's realistic and I'm pretty far forward, don't want any surprises in my glorified armored car. Why... is an Allied T-34-85 able to keep up with me while I'm going full tilt on a long stretch of road. In an M18. Seems legit and in no way pants on head. The average thought processes behind someone who actually loves tanks and did their homework:War Thunder 'Realistic Mode'. Where we took out the Russian ammo's inaccuracy, nerfed American mobility and gun depression, didn't bother fixing their ammo to behave like it's real world counterpart, still haven't nerfed Russian HE ammo hitting up to 2 tiers higher than it's supposed to. Still haven't modeled German armor correctly to represent how weird the Tiger's front armor was, cool. Still haven't fixed American APHE actually not having HE filler, awesome. Oh and the German round velocity still blows, check check. Oh they hit the American mobility yet again, still haven't fixed their armor. And now their biggest strength, air power has to deal with Assault Fuses. On a plane you wouldn't bother dive bombing in. Secret documents showing this is how the real war went? Huh, that's interesting. Why doesn't the T34's engine explode as often and why does it take multiple HE direct hits to track tanks? Well.. alright we'll roll with that. Huh, that crew hatch deflected an AP shell at 70 meters, that's new...tl;dr - World of Tanks more accurately modeled the guns in their arcade game than Gaijin did in Realistic. Go play Aces High II if you want a realistic game and go play World of Tanks if you want a better tank arcade game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even though I am strongly addicted to the game, it's ridiculous the amount of time and efort, maybe even money you have to put in before you actually start having fun. The devs don't care about you, or the game. They want money. Don't buy premium. OVERPRICED BS. Reasearching one tank that might require 6,000 RP (research points) will take you about 7-8 games. Even if you do really well in a game, say like 8 kills, you'll barely get 1,000 RP. The game is way too damn grindy. It's annoying. It's so ♥♥♥♥ing unbalanced. Russians dominate tanks. 3 things that would change this review: 1. A balanced update. Not making eveything equal, but not making everything so damn Op and everything else with paper armour. 2. The RP system and researching tanks needs to buffed like hell. It is way too slow and frustrating especially for German tanks. 3. Primium is way too over priced. Want a year subscription? $120. F THAT. $5 a month. $50-$60 a year. I WILL BUY IT and so will many others. Also don't make it where you need to buy premium currency to buy a premium account. That's ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. This game has so much potential and is probably one of the best WWII game sout right now, but the people behind it are money cows and wasting that potential. The game is slowly dying. All that's gonna be left are the rich people that have everything unlocked and will just demolish you, therefore leaving the game unplayable. Fix it, or in 2 years there will be no War Thunder.

												Every single update, Gaijin breaks the game more and more. Ask anyone with many hours in the game, and that's what they'll tell you. Every once in a great while, I come back to the game to see its current state, and oh boy, to no surprise, they ruin it up every single time. It's always something. It's always a broken flight model or damage model that stays broken for years, but conveniently, the developer's country of origin will always have the most cutting edge, despite having garbage heaps in WWII. Their newest system, their blackout system from excessive geforce, likes to black your pilot out by just flying in a straight line. Hit detection is garbage, you cannot select the game mode, PS4 players are in the mix with their horrid network cards, so you'll have B-25s teleporting behind fighters and killing them, and it's very pay-to-win. You can buy foliage to camouflage yourself with, you can outright buy planes and tanks, and often times, those pay-to-win tanks and planes will have a lower battle rating than their legitimate counterparts.If you want a game like this, sadly, everything else fails to come close. Even more unfortunate is that this very game fails to compare to what it used to be in 2013. Every single update ends up doing something wrong.UPDATE: Now nominated for The ""Most Disappointing Developers"" Award.			",170,18,0,18,13,2,15

												Almost 400 hours on record and I've been in this thing since the beta for ground forces. Warthunder used to be my favorite game. It was a refreshing battle system that favored the skilled tanker over the one in the better tank. I've killed T-34s and T-28s with a PzII. If you know where to shoot you'd usually be fine. If you get killed it's genuinely because the other guy was better. Or you weren't careful enough.That's what I said three years ago. Today? It...looks nice. Some of the most meticulously detailed vehicles I've ever seen in a WWII game. They sound fantastic. The way the treads move. The recoil of the guns kicking up dirt and dust. That's all I have to say that's positive though. It's become clear that the devs want Russian tanks and planes to be the best. To the point they're giving the IS2 rounds it never had to fight a tank it's already a match for. Russian shells having increased chances to set fires, detonate ammo racks and increased fragments compared to their British, American and German counterparts. Shermans having a higher probability of catching fire and having ammo rack detonations despite wet stowage and historically low burn rates. T-34s shrugging off 50mm cannons and 75mm's at ranges where it historically would have killed them frontally. This isn't a WWII tank game. This is a bunch of idiot children screaming in the sandbox that  NUH UH. WE'RE TOTALLY BETTER THAN YOU...J-JUST COZ! WE SAY SO. Used to be balanced. Used to be fair. Used to be an accurate representation. But not anymore. Don't play it. You'll get a better historical representation out of World of Tanks than this game.			",191,20,0,11,8,1,19

												after writing a couple of reviews about this game i wanna write a last one, without hatred this time.the game CAN be amazing, if you dont experience armor bugs (or bugs in general) and if you play in fair teams (which means that the playerskills are balanced between teams AND your tank/plane is not extremely underpowered compared to the enemies ones [tiger 1 vs tiger 2 for example, which just simply sucks big time]). some 1944 jagdtiger fighting tanks with up to 400mm pen and rockettanks from the cold war is also SO MUCH FUN. BUT, it does barely happen.. which leads to frustrating matches. the game was almost always awesome back in the days when there were only german and russian tanks available and no planes available in the groundforces. tiger 1 vs kv85, is1, t34/85 was just AMAZING. sadly its gone forever. now you are often plagued with stupid tank designs, prototypes and the worst thing: horrible matchmaking OR: if you are doing well, even if you get outnumbered a lot and you still manage to surive, you may get hit by some stupid bomber - GG. graphics got actually worse (surprisingly) which is another big let-down. (look at my response in the comments)i almost forgot it: this game has the worst forum mods ever. post some jokes about italians and feel the ban)))overall i cant, and dont even want to, give this game a positive rating. fix your crap, gayjin.i actually returned to bug thunder since this mod is simply amazing and it makes the game much better: http://www.moddb.com/mods/b0riss-sound-modin this video you can see the bugs and stupid things usually appearing in every single game:

As of update 1.37, the progression system is as grindy as it is going to be, and even if you did pay, you would have to pay an absolutely ridiculous amount of money to even get close to being competitive. It is an abomination of pay to win at the moment.Otherwise, if you can get over these things, the gameplay core is amazing, it has a really good flight-model and damage-model, making it possible to accurately slice and dice enemy planes.

												                    I hate you Gaijin.. you greedy b******.  Imgaine this game for $40-80 dollars and the grind is much.. much less. I like this game a lot not because its good but because there is NO other game like this, its a monopoly honestly, I want a WW2 tank game that looks and runs well, there is no other games like it, so you have to deal with Gaijin.                    Its sad that the gaming library is turning into a bunch of greedy ""money only"" companies.. I would pay 100 dollars for this game to just make the game a game and not f2p garrbage. Now if you want to pay your way through and pass the grind, by the way the grind will take monthS to go through, you will be paying hundred and hundred of dollars were talking 1000 dollars worth of F2P microtransactions...                    But some people like the grind and others don't, I bet if you made two war thunders: One just like this one, a free to play HEAVY grinding game and then you made another that was like battlefield 3 grinding but cost 60 dollars, I bet you people would like the battfield 3 grinding and 60 dollar version better.             Listen if your a game dev and you wanna make some money make a WW2 Tank game, if you make it good people will come, right now Gaijin rules this game market for this type of genre, I promise you if you just clone this game and make the grind less and fix a few things and put a 40-60 price tag on it, no one would play war thunder for the tanks at least.

												WHEN WAS WAR THUNDER FUN AND PLAYABLEI have played this game for nearly 3 years and i am done with it. I started playing when tanks didnt exist and planes were only feature of this game. It was fun, we had 20 tier system, no stupid BR system, yes German planes were OP in that time, but havent met them every battle. Game was balanced except German planes were overperforming as i wrote. Then came BR system which worked in first few monts even in CBT of Tanks, but then when tanks came out strange things started to happen, but it wasnt that bad as its now. In first year the russian tanks was heavily underpower. Then came patch that make game playable on both sides for nearly half of the year. US tanks beta was full of new things, mainly US tanks offcourse, Shermans were amazing, they wasnt OP as many players cried because they aimed for turret and not for hull. FALL OF THE GAMEAnd now begins my critic: Gaijin nerfed US 76 mm and 90 cannons to ground, WTF is that you cant kill Panther to hull with 90 mm APBC? Russian tanks began to be massively overperfoming only in cannons, and not in armor, you could kill them easily. And now am I in year 2015 and MASSIVELY STUPID APCR NERF AND SCLOPED ARMOR BUFF. After this STUPID PATCH soviet tanks began to be massively OP in arnament and bull..... armor. T34 once bounced my KWK 36 APCR, really? I dont need to write about useless British tanks, their repair cost and their useless ammo. And i cant forget about MASSIVELY TOXIC COMMUNITY ON FORUMS, which are brainwashed and they dont take any arguments, even if there are true. I got ban by nearly nazi moderator because i very bravely saying true about the game.I understand that Gaijin cant make everybody happy, but clearly Russian Bias is stupid, it seems like Gaijin has Putin´s pistol near head and they cant nerf russian tanks. Gaijin is trying to make players happy by making premium tanks, thats STUPID and it will make many players to leave, not to come. CONCLUSIONDont start to play this game, its NOT WORTH IT in its currect state, maybe it will be fun in first tier, but you will very fast see how is game broken.			",51,2,0,4,5,1,16

												Took a long break from warthunder after playing non-stop for a fair amount of time since the game went from fun to ""i hate myself"" after a while. So i decided to give some of the games compeitiors a go (wows, wot ect). I played alot of that before returning to warthunder to try again and was greeted with a new line of tanks. I gave these a go but i couldnt shake that nagging feeling of discontent with the game. It was mostly small things such as the really buggy tank physics which havent changed at all in the 5-6 months i was away, the fact that players with lower settings were at an advantage ect. I would recomed staying away, especially the tank side of things.TL/DR; took a break from game to come back and remember why i took a break.			",180,9,5,17,20,0,17

												This game back in the day was an amazing simulator and arcade combat experience. However after a year and a half of gameplay from their original launcher (2009-1010) i began to notice a trend of ""small"" patches, which seemed unusual, but i pushed them aside.... I switched over to Steam to track how long i played the game (downloaded it from here about 2 years ago), and i've noticed my times on the game per day have been steadily decreasing from the lack of ability to deal with the crap they continue to shovel down our throat as players.Pro-... no, i'm not going to bother with this. There are no pros anymore. The first thing i can't stand is their way of ""sales""... i'm sorry, i bought the Ace pack when it was 39.99  (flat, no sale) and then they INCREASED the base price 3 weeks later to do a 40% sale, so now instead of it being 40 bucks it's 50 without a sale. That's NOT a sale, that's inflation. I'm sorry but you don't Con your players like that. That's flat out rude no matter what your explination is to doing it.Second, the nation bias is absolutely appalling! I've NEVER heard of biplanes carrying late-war era Shvak cannons all because ""They'd be underpowered against the other nations"" yet you have the audacity to nerf bomber strength (armor and gun accuracy/gunner count and this is being linked to all of them not just one before you proclaim i'm saying something out of context) for the Wellington, Mitchell, Flying Fortress and the Super Fortress, give the Ishaks and Yaks insane handling ability and ramming survival and make the early-game completely lopsided to the russian airforce! Which, mind you, was KNOWN for having several crippling errors such as weak frames, crap peashooters that broke down at the slightest jerking of the aerilons and were known to stall at low altitudes due to how the fuel intake was situated within the frame.Thirdly: The german and american tanks were instantly smashed for their armor ratings both realistic and arcade (arcade is understandable), while the Russians get armored MBT'S from the late stages of the 60's into the early stages of the 90's!? (T-54 models) You're literally making this game so difficult to grind other vehicles that you're pushing people TOWARDS other games.Fourth: speaking of 1960-1990, now you're bringing in new planes which is awesome, however, the planes your bringing in have nothing to do with the era of planes from the other nations. If you're so intent on bringing in RUSSIAN early 20th century jets, where the hell is the 1990's prototype Warthog attacker for the American side? Instead what do we see? Some snazzy one-shot P-51 remakes and a twin fuselage german prop plane that is a flying matchbox. GG gaijin.Fifth, and most important: Your communication with the public is TERRIBLE. You speak like you own the world, then toss us, your customers and players, aside to support the kiddies who have their parents' credit cards while many of us put forward suggestions that can support the growth of this game as a whole. (such as support for using ALL your tanks in arcade, the removal of planes in arcade tank battles which would make spawn killing less detrimental and the increase of tank map size so that people aren't able to shoot from one spawn to the other for an instant kill. This is just Arcade issues. I can go into much worse conversation about the hell of the ""magic armor"" of the T-34 in realistic battles surviving multiple BLACK impact shots from Tigers and Tiger II's of various models (8,8, 10,5, 7,5, 105mm derp on the M4, short 8,8 on the PZ IV and so forth) yet they're able to pen the top front plate of practically all tanks it faces and igniting a fire or ammo rack when it turns YELLOW, leaving you completely wrecked compared to a tank that in historical records *struggled for months* against those tanks when facing headon due to their out dated ammo types and low velocity guns.Your chat mods are also extremely one-sided. They let slip the slander upon America involving russian chatter but the MOMENT someone speaks ill of Russia they get chat banned! The moment they complain about the russian tech being biased, or the moment they are approached with fixes to failed coding that didn't get updated in nearly 7 years, REAL CODERS TRYING TO HELP YOU! They ban them! like they're the plague!You don't read tickets with thoughtful support, and if you do you only nit-pick problems that are given to you so you can blame the customer's computer (no matter how fancy it may or may not be) And if the computer checks out you blame the internet provider! YOU REFUSE TO ACCEPT ANY BROKEN FORM OF YOUR GAME EXISTISTING.But i digress, You intentions are clear, you're not here for your customers, you're not here for your players. you're here for Russia. And for the ability to slander ALL countries out-right to give you that ""we reign supreme"" nationalistic pride that you would no doubt rip into ANY company not associated with russian communication/historical ""records"" (and have on Armored Warfare already from the look of their forums when i see russian chatter on there and in-game)In otherwords? I HIGHLY SUGGEST to all new players thinking of this game, AVOID IT AT ALL COST. The only reason i even look at this game once every 4-5 weeks is because i spent money on this game i refuse to let go without being used  to the best of my ability. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR SANITY.			",38,1,0,6,7,0,4

												I had to write a review about this game because I have noticed the amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥this game has been getting lately, and with over 1,000 hours, I feel as if I am more than qualified to do so.Yes, War Thunder is not a perfect game *gasp*, and I too have had my fair share of frustration at times. But when I sit back after a match and think about what I did wrong after being completely♥♥♥♥♥♥on, nine times out of ten it was my fault. Not angling my armor properly, being impatient and pushing so far up I get surrounded, etc. Thats what I love about this game. When you screw up, it's on you.People are quick to cry wolf on the russian bias. Those people are also the ones who don't angle, flank, and mindlessly take on a heavy tank from the front. This game requires a plethora of skill which you will eventually require through practice and perserverance. Learn your tank/plane! Know your weaknesses and your strengths! This will help you tramendously in any situation. If instant gratification is something you are looking for, there's always COD.Gaijin does a wonderful job updating the game fairly fast, and you can see they really do care about their community. They keep us updated and add new content almost every other month. They also do an excellent job hyping the following updates, giving players something to look forward to in the near future *COUGH COUGH BOATS*Basically if you want me to cut the♥♥♥♥♥♥and get straight to the point of this review...*Do not play this game if you are easily angered or impatient. YOU WILL NOT SURVIVE.*If you are new to WT, give it a try for yourself instead of looking at the comments. This community really likes to whine. Don't let the comments plague your experience.Most importantly, have fun, try not to think too much, and I'll see you in the skies!! o7			",47,0,0,1,4,0,8

												War Thunder. War Thunder never changes.On august 15th, 2013, someones great great grandfather, who served in the army, wondered when he'd get to go home to his wife and brand new PC which he had never seen to play a WW2 sim. He got his wish when Gaijin released War Thunder, by dropping a download into a non translated Russian page.The gaming community awaited Armageddon, instead, something terrible happened. Gaijin began to make the game not as an accurate sim, but as a source of nearly limitless propaganda. Russians enjoyed luxuries once thought the realm of Soviet WW2 fan fiction. T-34's, LaGG-3s, Mig-17s outclassing whatever they faced. But then, in 2015, people awoke from the euphoria induced dream.Years of imbalance lead to shortages of nearly every major resource. The entire community unraveled. Fun became a distant memory.It is now the year 2016. The community stands on the brink of total annihilation, and i am afraid for myself, my bank account, for my time wasted grinding.Because if my time in the game taught me one thing: it's that War Thunder, War Thunder never changes.

												First question you have to ask yourself: Is this game fun? Can I recommend it for new players? And both questions painfully have to be answered with a big NO!Cancerous piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Treating paying customers with disrespect. Optimizing the game to fit their supererior russian nationalism worldview while having the most obnoxious and gangster capitalism price policy on steam. You pay gold and you get a stinking pile of crap in return.Playerbase is shrinking.[steamcharts.com] Dont make the mistake to put it on your Hard Drive or even spend one Dime on this blackhole. 7 years of development and the most obnoxious bugs are not fixed. Stop braking german planes damage models so that steel giants now can burn out like paper planes. LMG does nothing to enemy fighters even with the ""best"" icendiary ammo belts. Leveling your gunners does nothing. Matchmaking is so hamfisted its not funny. Nothing is historical nothing is balanced properly. No matter if you play Historical or ""Realistic"" Battles or Arcade Battles. The game modes are sickening bad. The Map design is sickening worse. And the game mechanics are utterly broken. Its a simulator , right a simulator of how much a game company can abuse its playerbase and customers and laugh at history and realism and moste of all the core of a game fun and great teamwork. Everything is designed to ♥♥♥♥ you over. I wish there was a refund option for Golden Eagles and Bundles bought on gaijin page. The player base is cancerous and the program itself is just a frustrating pile of bits occupying your precious hard drive space.Its a grind fest and they publish a new tank or plane model almost everyday to sell to your for your virtual glas cabinet. If I had know that before. Id rather invested my time into buying and making/building real models in real life. As I did with my small Star Wars Lego Collection.			",104,17,0,7,12,0,14

												One of the best games out there - 2 years ago.Unfortunately, the development company (Gaijin Entertainment) have made some poor decisions over the past couple of years, and the game is now an awkward mish-mash of parts that don't quite work properly, leaving the overall game to be frustrating and unenjoyable to play.Instead of taking simple, effective action against these problems, Gaijin come up with these needlessly overcomplicated ideas, which when implemented into the game fix one problem but cause two more.If you start playing it now, you may have some fun, but you'll quickly become bored and frustrated. Maybe in the future the game will be fun again, but with each passing month that hope grows smaller.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah.. War Thunder Review time I guess.Let me go ahead and state, if your a fanboy, I dont care. Your opinion means nothing to me, simply because your opinion is tainted because it could be your ""favorite"" or you really ""enjoy"" this game, therefore keep it too yourself or do a review yourself.This game is not fun in the long run, compared to World of Tanks, the only thing this one has that World of Tanks doesnt, is it isnt a silly tank shooter. I dont care for the planes, simply because, I found it boring to fly around, press M1 over and over or hold it down, until finally your shots actually do something of use other then sparking on the person, or shooting the center gear leg or fuel tanks causing a fuel leak. I had tons of funs in Ground Forces though, Until you start playing every single faction there is, and start to see the reason why you see more of some factions and some of others. This game has no actual form of Balance, and in its attempt to try and keep things balance, and adding realistic stuff too it, they made some things completely unfun to play, while others are so brain dead you can just just toward people, bouncing shells off left and right as people try to pen you.Now, I enjoyed this game. I managed to get a good friend to play, he however left because the game was unfair for him, I ignored it and thought it was just him actting up. I regret not listening too him, after the whole ""cool factor"" of the game wears off, you start to see the problems. Lets start off with Gameplay first.Gameplay: Though it is fun, has a ton of problems, the game doesnt prepare you for anything, because of how the game Progresses, at first you start off as Reserves vs Reserves, which is the starting tanks. This is completely pointless to talk about, because its the most basic of the game, point and shoot, you will most likely kill anything you just shot at, or badly damage them, BUT even at this Tier, yous tart to see the real problems, Because of how the game BR system works, even though you only have 2 tanks, their both 1.0 and require a bit of knowledge to beat higher BR tanks, the game is completely fine with putting you up against these tanks, Often. This is called Uptiered, and its the most annoying thing to happen too you, at any point in the game, because you are fighting against tanks who are actaully better then yours, in any way possible, this of course only if the tank driver can use the tank, but they still get a advantage wtih either, better gun, or better armor, or faster etc etc. Im not even going to talk about Downtiered, because its just basically swinging a club at baby seals at this point. The game shooting Machinics are simple, aim at a spot on a tank, and shoot, if it pens, it hits something, if it doesnt, well it doesnt, too kill a tank in this game, you either kill all their crew, or blow up thier ammo, which requires aimming (For some tanks, ill get too that later), and this is where you start killing the Major problems of this game. Four out of the now Five factions to play Ground Forces, are easy to play. each one giving you HE filler AP rounds, made to pen the tank then blow up and kill damn near anything in the tank, these tanks are what will kill you the most often, because their the easiest to play. Russians have slopped armor with fast moving tanks, allowing even their thin armored tanks to just put themselves into a Angle and bounce shells. Germans have ""Nuke-Rounds"" even at lower tierss, alot of the German tanks, just instantly kill anything you can pentrate, Same with Americans. now Japanese and British is where alot of suffering of the game happens. British tanks Feature fast reloading gun, fast tanks, good moblity (not when backing up) and their guns are extramely good at pentrating, however since British tanks didnt field HE filler rounds in the world, they lack them in the game, actually they dont have anything (expect for the recently added Sherman 2, thats basically M4A1 Sherman put into British line), This makes British one of the most annoying factions to actually kill tanks in, Because Armor Piecing rounds, with no HE fillers is what the British used in real life, in the game.. none of the reason why the British used said rounds, are at all shown, Since you can repair your tank, This also makes it so you have to snipe every single crew or 2 crew in the tank, or try to cause a their ammo to blow up, meanwhile most of the british tanks, cant take a single shot, and will mostly die in a single hit. Japanese have very little armor on their tanks, very small pentration with their guns, and very little HE filler starting out, later on they get up too the same ground as, Americans, Germans, Russians.Now Progression in this game, is low, its a grind while playing matches to unlock a new tank... however once you unlock the tank, you have too use the tank, in order to unlock mods, IE different ammo, REPAIR KIT, or ability to put out fires, all of which shouldnt be a thing, without the repair kit, if your cannon barrel or cannon breach is broke, you cant repair it unless you go too a cap point, Fires will kill you without the ability to put them out, and its a slow and annoying death and will happen alot since you only get 2 charges of it anyway. Luckly the game is nice enough to let you repair your tracks without the repair kit.Im not even going to touch the ""Pay to get"" tanks, because the fact you can buy them and get all the mod for them, already says why their there, its just a massive money grab too get a tank, you cant unlock.All and All, No I wouldnt recommend anyone to get this game, and if you do, too never spent money on it, I have, and I regretted it.

A mixed bag if I ever saw oneOn the one hand it's kinda fun, on the other hand it kinda sucks.On the one hand I enjoyed myself, on the other hand I felt like I utterly wasted my time and the fact that I have played almost 30 hours of War Thunder (so far) tells me I should really get my life back on track.The game is immensely unbalanced and the much maligned russian bias is definitely real, hence your experience will oscillate cheerfully between fun and total frustration. Also there's the grinding aspect. There's more grind here than at a Napalm Death concert. Everytime you upgraded your spaceship of choice (don't tell me they handle like airplanes) to gain a slight advance you continue to squash your frontal lobe into some kind of gooey mush while trying to repeatedly break the grind wall. So, what do you have gain from this practice? Well, you get slightly better equipment which you use to grind to get better planes which you use to grind to get better equipment for that plane and so forth. It's tedious but absorbing, I completely understand how people can rack up hundreds and thousands of hours in this game. The monotony is strangely addicting, it's like getting a drug habit and like with any serious addiction you're gonna take it as far as you can go. I cannot even judge the fans and addicts, I completely understand it, but for me in the end the tedium won. The progression is so slow and meaningless I cannot take it anymore. I also take issue with the flight model in war thunder. In the arcade modes it doesn't feel like you're remotely on planet earth, in realistic and simulation modes it feels like you're balancing a broomstick on the palm of your hand.

												Do not get this game. I´ve played this game for more than 600 hours in ground forces now and I really can´t recommend it at it´s current state.The game itself would be good if there would be more players and a better matchmaking system, the graphics and models are good, also there are no flamers in the community, but letting Tiger 2´s fight against T 54´s and IS3´s + IS4´s when you can´t even TOUCH them in the Tiger frontally is just a joke. Also there is no ""Russian bias"" itself, its just the thing that the Russian tanks are way to undertiered  to fight the Germans Brits or Americans. You have to spend alot of time and money into this game to get some  tanks which are actually fun to drive like Tiger I´s or T34´s. To be honest i hate World of Tanks but since Warthunder doesn´t give a single crap about its community and players you should rather play that instead of Wartunder.			",35,2,0,2,2,0,7

												Oh War Thunder, oh War Thunder.  How you have gone astray.  Initially it seemed like quite a nice combat flight simulator, with the revolution that mouse could be used.  As time went on the game devolved into a series of longstanding issues that have not been resolved:1.  The Developers come from a Russian world view.  The map structure, is centered around a Close Air Support (CAS) concept; strategic bombers have markably pitiable splash radii.  Consequently, the majority of USAAF combat takes place at a low altitude where B-17 and B-24 strafe AAA and pillboxes with their .50 cals.2.  Variety for the sake of variation is pointless.  The developers are very keen on adding new planes to the game, some with no differences (Spitfire Mk 22, 24 have the same FM).  The Flight Models are invariably a placeholder (OP/UP) upon a new plane's introduction which borks balance.  Gaijin has a goal of adding more planes, but fails to balance them due to misuse of statistics in determining Battle Rating.3.  Realistic Battles and Simulator are the red-haired stepchild.  If you want a realistic flight simulator, look to IL-2 BoS.  Of late Gaijin has ignored the misuse of Bombers' mouse aim gunners in the mode of Simulator where joystick is all fighters can use.  Attempts by the community to redress this have been suppressed by Gaijin.4.  Gaijin is a very Russian company.  Their relation with the English speaking community is lacking.  Most famously a developer remarked the Me 262 was doing fine fighting F-86 Sabres because it was ""feeling itself at its Battle Rating"".  Attempts by the community to curb the bomber spam in Simulator Battle have been met with denial and suppression.  Gaijin is markedly loathe to admit a mistake on its part (reliance upon an unofficial TAIC is used to balance the N1K Shiden Kai) and forum threads are frequently locked upon criticism.

												War Thunder is an Combat Arcade/Simulation Game (Depending on the Mode you choose to Play) Which Features Aircraft and Tanks. (And maybe later Ships) Positive Things. The Game is Fairly Immersive. Its getting you into a Mood and Manages fairly well to maintain it. The Graphics and Details of the Game are currently the Best of the Genre. The Gameplay is Based on Realistic Damage Models rather than using an HP System. The Game allows Mixed Mode between Tanks and Aircraft which makes for an Remarkable Experience. Neutral Things. The Devs Listen to the Community. But unfortunately it usually takes a riot for them to actually change something. And very Often the changes come out way off from what the community hoped for. Content added is for most Part Free and usually you will be able to Play the Game very well without Investing Money. However in exchange the Game is an Horrible Grind that Takes more Time than most People have if they are Working a Fulltime Job. Negative Things. The Event Management is Outright Incompetent and Stubborn to Hell. Despite People being up in Arms about the way Events are Done. They have been Refusing to Change anything. And Repeat the Same Mistakes over and over. By now Many Events are Frequented by less than 10% of the Playerbase and alot of People dont even bother looking into the Event Screen anymore. The Moderation of the Forum is very restrictive. Negative Critics is not Welcome. And if you want to Post some I suggest you pack it in Flowers as much as possible as you will not avoid Infractions otherwise. So if your the Type who doesnt want to talk around stuff you might be better off not Posting Critics in the Forum. One Big Problem with the Game is that the Matchmaking is very Compressed. You will meet Tanks more than 10 Years more Modern than your own in some Cases. And in many Cases you will be met With Enemies you simply cannot Defeat. Worse as some Parts of the Matchmaking are thus not Played. You will either have to Grind around them. Or will constantly Play as an sole Lower Tiered Tank in an very High Tiered Match. The Last and most Persistent Problem in the Game is the Incompetence of the Mission/Map Creators. Which are placing Objectives right next to the Respawn. And Practically Force People into Spawncamping. Which Results in Enemies Spawning onto you while Capturing the Enemy Base. Or People Sitting nicely Hidden 300m behind your Spawn and Killing you without you having any Chance to Fight Back. The by Far Worst Problem however. Is and Stays the Abuse of Low Quality Graphics. Especially in the Realistic Game Modes. There is no Extra Markers on Enemy Ground Forces. This causes an very heavy Interference for Players with High Graphic Quality because they see alot more Bushes, Trees, Grass and Objects than Players with a Low Graphic Setting which thanks to this will see Tanks much easier especially in Cities Forested Areas. Right now my Judgement on this Game (Pls note the Date of this Review as things might change for better or for worse in the Future) is thatAir Forces AB is Fairly Playable and Enjoyable given you want Fast Action. Air Forces RB is Very Good with Minor Problems. Air Forces SB is Nice in General but its nothing for True Simulation Players. Ground Forces AB I got no Idea as I never really Played it Ground Forces RB Is currently outright Unplayable thanks to the Incompetence and Stubborness of the Devs. Ground Forces SB is Fairly Playable but very Limited as you cannot choose which Tanks you want to Play. So I as an Ground Forces Player will not Recommend the Game.If your more into Air Forces I suggest you take a look at it tough :) Well in the End you need to Check for yourself anyways. And its Free so Give it a Try.Just Expect to be Frustrated alot on stuff if your getting into it some Further.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I could not recommend this game but why? Dispite the game having fun gameplay and some annoying features that could be improved I dont think the developers understand why its fun and continue to leave the game in limbo. Nothing of flaws have been address in several years from gameplay, UI, poor maps, bad matchmaking with only NA and EU severs, Slow tank and  model loading, unbound key features, annoying menu delay and in my opinion deteriorating gameplay in mid to high teirs (subjective). Combine with incredible grind to get pass teir 5 tanks you need to only play this game or spend more then on a triple A new release game for one fractions tech tree. From all this above I have got impression that the developers are more in line with EA and UBsoft, more interested in profits first then making a complete game.Ultimately do try warthunder it was fun but I wouldnt put money into the game because they arent interested in improving the game, only adding more mediocre content to continue keeping paying custumes attention. There is alot more amazing games out there that you can find that deserve your time or money.  ",104,11,2,12,5,0,22

												(I apologise about the lack of coherence, I have hundereds of actual hours in this game and was once my passion) As many others have said, this game was at one time absolutely stunning and full of promise, but now its just a ♥♥♥♥♥how filled with high quaility renders of vehicles. This game is beautiful and has fantastic physics, But this is a combat game and requires alot more effort than that.The devs are Completely clueless on retaining players and have no idea on how to effectively balance the hundreds of planes in this game despite the dozens of attemps to help from the community. gaijin absolutely refuses to listen with a vengance, and wont tolerate any negative publicity.the story of war thunder is a sad tale, doomed to be repeated by the countless F2P games that will never go away, we all hoped this one would be different, but corruption is a resilent foe, and war thunder fell victim.this game is only alive thanks to its exeptional premise and constant influx of new players, but make no mistake, this game has been forsaken and no savior is in sight.

												Used to be one of my favorite games to play.Now this game is so ♥♥♥♥ed up. Arma 2: OA takes the cake now. Pros: VARIETY!Wonderful, WONDERFUL graphics!!Many tanks and planes to try.Unbeatable armor system on every tank and plane.Custom games!Many roles to play. Never have to play the same.Easy ways to gain the big boi currency; Golden Eagles.Well-made weaponry with varying velocity and penetration values.No hit points for tanks/planes.Is not World of Tanks.Cons:ATGM's.Tier 5 is unplayable. You go in games camping or you don't go in at all.Camping is best strategy to win.TINY♥♥♥♥♥MAPS! WHAT THE HELL GAIJIN?!Idiotic community.Chat mods ruin the chat with all their bantering and bloating about their muzzles. Nobody wants them nor needs them around. Should be able to say anything we want in chat because it affects absolutely noone smart enough to understand they don't know the person spitting pixels on the screen at them. Grow. Up.Gaijin needs to grow up too... 12+? Are you serious?No infantry.No blood.No gore.No crews screaming for their lives.No realism in Realistic Battles. Just modified specs.Pay2play tanks/planes are overpowered not because they are 'overpowered', but because they are easy power grinds over normal vehicles hence the name 'Pay2play'.Ignorant dev team.Bias.America doesn't get a break from all the bs. Worst lineup in the whole game (before Japan) and still no RP/SL buffs. They are JUST NOW adding in more stuff for the US but counterbalancing it with more overpowered tanks/planes for other nations.Trolls. Lots of trolls.Almost everyone in-game is a fan of Germany. Just love supporting their mans hitlah.Russia gets beef for their garbage tanks. Germany is easy-af mode.There is a visibility stat...Players aren't pushed to jump to Realistic Battles. Instead, everyone plays Arcade.Daily rewards is a bunch of test drives. I like them but, it's just a bunch of test drives. You never get a vehicle or something cool.Wagers can only be used in high tiers. Makes grinding harder. Just a trashy♥♥♥♥♥game overall. They had it at one point. They screwed up. ",52,6,4,3,11,0,9

												Nothing worse than wasted potential...EDIT: While at the time of the original review the Pay to Win model wasnt so much an issue, it's grown to be a real problem. Those that are willing to spend the extra cash can quickly pad their line up of tanks and planes to include prototypes that never really saw action but are immensely powerful, duplicates of already top of the line tanks/aircraft, and 'premium' content like rocket launchers that are at lower levels exclusive to those who pay. some of these premium tanks/planes fill holes inbetween various teirs and making jumping to the next level without them incredibly difficult. This is far more noticable playing tanks, as all aircraft are generally flimsy enough to be destroyed by aircarft of any level. On the face of it War Thunder has a lot going for it. three modes of play for those looking for the hardcore cockpit only view flight sim with excellent physics, to the more casual pick up and play arcade sim, and even a middle ground. the graphics are top notch not just for a free game but any flight sim out there. the playerbase is fairly large. the ever expanding list of planes, and now tanks! to fly and drive. most impressively it strays from the pay to win (P2W) model and is an exceptional free game where 90% of content can theoretically be unlocked by playing for free, those few premium aircraft or tanks are not super powered and give no additional benefit to those that buy them and some can even be won through in game events.however...this game more than any other seems to have incredibly horrific balancing issues. planes and tanks from vastly different era's will come into contact with each other through a convoluted and completely broken matchmaker that uses a form of ratings to determine a planes effectivness (most noteably the fact that if you fly a ME 262 you can expect to see more Mig's and Sabers than B-17's and P51's). some planes are unflyable due to the fact they will be put in situations where they are laughably outmatched in nearly every aspect (looking at you japan), and worse some duplicate planes like the typhoon and early ME-109's will have different ratings despite being the same aircraft...The grind...oh the grind...the game roughly splits up aircraft and tanks into one of 5 catagories roughly equating to era, you start with late 1930's tanks and aircraft and through play (or payment) earn new aircraft/tanks by playing and earning points. now this works great with levels 1-3, but after that, without sinking money or an insane amount time dont expect to be playing with jets or late war panther tanks. (ive played 500+ hours with some premium time, which effectively doubles your research point rate, and while i have all catagory 4 aircraft for most nations and a good amount of tanks ranks 1-4, i am nowhere near a consistent line of jets or post-war tanks) TL;DR Version - The game has noteable flaws but a lot of potential and a large playerbase. its free and wont be a waste of your time to give it a shot, but dont expect a perfectly polished game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gaijin is determined to destroy this game completely. They have for a long, long time had very strange ideas especially when it comes to balancing the game. Their system for the relative matchmaking between vehicles (their ""Battle Rating"") is only initially based on expected performance, and is then ONLY based on player statistics. If players do bad in a plane it means the plane is bad and should get lower BR to get easier opponents, with absolutely zero investigation into WHY the plane does bad.Couple that with strange ideas like low graphics quality completely removing some graphical entities from tank battles (like some types of bushes) and the CEO effectively insulting anyone that thinks it is a bad system to not make the world representation at least have the same objects rendered in different quality of graphics and you are in for a fun time.Their interaction with the community is basically to tell us to give feedback, and then completely ignoring absolutely everything that's said. At the odd occasion that they don't completely ignore it they just completely misinterpret it and destroy the game that way instead.It is tragic that the above happens, because the game's ENGINE is excellent, and the game has an enormous potential, but the management at Gaijin is so incompetent that calling them ""monkeys"" is an insult to actual monkeys worldwide.Gaijin doesn't treat this as a game. They are simply milking it on money for all they're worth, and seem to treat it more as a test-bed for developing a game engine. How fun the game is is completely irrelevant as the code works on a technical level.There is no question about if they'll ever get the game on its feet. The only question is ""How long can you put up with the growing mountain of♥♥♥♥♥♥before you leave?""			",281,79,0,44,42,1,62

												Started playing back in 2013 waiting for the tanks part of the game and found the plane part actually pretty fun at first.When tanks came it was quite a ""diamond in the rough"" some bugs but good potential.Now more than a year later things on both planes and tanks have gone for the worse, high tier balance is not existant anymore since the recent patch. Another things is the slightly lingering russian preference in early/mid tier planes and mid/late tier tanks.Example: T34 wreaking havock for half a year now and totaly stomping since 3 months, the few changes they made, changed nothing, still rolling around with 95% winrate in RB, because obvously all german and US players are bad players.

												This game needs serious match making rework. After the first day matches are extremely unbalanced. You'll take your tier 1 tanks or maybe your first tier 2 tank into battle excited for combat, only to realize you're facing late tier 2 or maybe even tier 3 tanks that you can't damage at all!Why is this happening? Because the devs have decided to impliment this incredible ""battle rating"" system without telling anyone it was coming or even explaining why it was needed.You know that old saying if it's not broken don't fix it? Derp!So how this works is it takes your top three tanks in your load out, does some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ math with them, then poops out your battle rating. This is supposed to help in matching you to people with a similar ranked load out, but it doesn't work at all!That's right, Gaijin has put this system into works and it does the EXACT OPPOSITE of what it was intended.So I did a little research to find out what this battle rating garbage is all about.Overall BR = A/2+B/4+C/4 Overall BR = (6.0 / 2) + (5.7 / 4) + (5.4 / 4) = 5.775 Then it rounds your value UP to the next bracket.That's from the wiki page.http://wiki.warthunder.com/index.php?title=Battle_ratingsHowever when you actually get into a game and look at the player's ratings, you'll notice that you're is maybe a 2.7 with a few 2.3.. But then look over at the other team and it's 4.7, 3.7, 3.7 for their entire team, save maybe one or two.What does that mean?Tier 1 units are typically between 1.0-2.0 BRTier 2 are 2.3-3.7Tier 3 3.7-4+There are a few exceptions but generally that's how it works. So when you look at your BR with everything 2.3 or less, then the enemy BR is all 4.0+ you are not going to win, period!Many variations of turn speeds, fire rates, ammo types available, penetration on ammo, armor,  ect goes into the different tiers. So when you have a tier 1 tank fighting a late-tier 2 tank or even a tier 3, your armor penetration on ammo simply isn't high enough to deal any real damage. Your only hope is to use extremely high penetration ammo (which still most likely will bounce off) and pray you hit something vital.However, here is the fun part, the high tier enemies don't need to worry about aiming or using good ammo to wipe you out quickly. It's point-click-dead for you. In air battles, they will turn faster, fly faster, have more ammunition, shoot faster, do everything possible better than you.You may be able to get lucky and find someone as out-matched as you are and kill them before a high tier wipes your face in the dirt giggling, but typically you will be obliterated within seconds of spawning.This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't have such a wide range of tiers it places into every battle. For example, some of the final tier 1 tanks can compete with tier 2 tanks.. Not all of them can but some can. However, they can't do much of anything against a tier 3 tank. Even if you are the most elite pro sniper you are still at a massive disadvantage because you must use pin point accuracy to inflict any damage at all, then the damage is very minor. All your enemy has to do it hit you anywhere at all with basic ammunition and you're done in one hit.This is by far the worst aspect of this game and completely ruins the multiplayer PVP aspect. Other than this the game is fantastic and I would recommend it. Maybe you'll be lucky enough to never see one of this awful matches. But there is no way I can give this game a thumbs up when it allows vets to prey on complete noobs. (Yes you can be in the starter tank and fight T2-T3 tanks every single match, that happens a lot)But then there's also the spawn camping. Oh yes! This game is also 50% spawn camping. Most maps are designed so that the teams can instantly begin shooting at each other from spawn, or only have to move a little bit to fire directly into enemy spawn points. A lot of the maps have hills off to the sides that tanks can perch on then snipe everything in the map with ease, once these hills are taken it's impossible to compete. The horrible part about this is usually one team spawns on or right beside one of these incredible tactical positions and begins dominating your team in spawn or just out of spawn soon after the match begins. There is nothing more disappointing then spawning 3 times only to be killed instantly without even being able to fire a single shot. This game has zero spawn protection and in most cases players rush to get into the easier spawn camping spots, then it's game over. Until this is fixed I'd say don't waste time on this game. Many of it's players are quitting and going to other games because of Gaijin's horrible decision making and failure to listen to it's players.On top of all that the community doesn't do much to help out new people and is infact encouraged to prey on them. You'll notice during your first few matches how some of the enemy team are level 20 generals running around in noob tanks with maxed out crews (Its easy for them to rack up kills and get huge points for doing it!). If you're lucky to avoid that, then once you get your first few tanks you will most definitely realize the unbalance of this game's match making. Try your best to get those high tier tanks/planes but you will -always- be pitched against higher level tanks/planes and players without any mercy.			",101,10,0,8,7,0,6

												They have a good game here. I say that as someone who's played for what is honestly years now, starting all the way back in 1.27. Has the game worn on me a little? Most likely, but what I think has happened is Gaijin saw money and got greedy. Progression is my main complaint. The progression way back when I started playing was nice. You'd play for a week and unlock a plane or two and you'd have something new to play with. With patch 1.37 they changed the entire progression model, claiming you'd be able to get down the line faster than ever. That was a lie. Now you could play an entire month and would maybe unlock a single aircraft. Then it got worse. Gaijin slowly reduced the experience you recieved from your aircraft, upped the experience cost of everything, and charged more for premium vehicles. With every major update, they would put more obstacles in the form of more vehicles, some barely historic. Normally, a game that adds content like that would be great, but when it's used to extend the grind to later tiers it becomes a chore. The progression is a joke now. If you were to start today, you might see a jet in about 18 months. That's a long time to dedicate to what feels like a rapidly declining game.Overall though, the gameplay is still reasonable. For the most part, aircraft fly and fall apart convincingly, and tanks feel properly heavy like they should. It's got a solid core game. The biggest issue is the actual grind, and when a game starts to feel like work is really when you should drop it. Would I pay any more of my hard-earned money to these developers?

												Well, after sinking quite a few hours into this... I finally came into conclusion:WarThunder is free to play. As in, it is free to roam around the map, and be cannon fodder for overpowered russian biased players (even more if they're paying for premium or premium vehicles). You can drive around in a nice model of Tiger 1 which was no match for any other tank for a good few years, and used to anninhilate every russian t32, in this game this won't be it. You will get upranked and will have to fight ridiculously overpowered (cannon wise, shell wise, movement wise) soviet vehicles. Tbh, even high explosive charges feel to do a lot more damage once you fight for the russians... I'm no expert, but afaik Gaijin is a russian company, hence the bias...Don't get me wrong, I'm far from being bad at this game, I camp around, play the Tiger tactically, get my several kills most of the time, but it is a struggle. Gaining wins in Ralistic Battle? Yeah, right. 1/20 is a win. In Sim battles, it's better, but there aren't that many battles for Tiger1 in sim.And don't even get me started on planes... Did I mention scores of russian speaking players? Not having anything against, but most of the communication is done in russian without asking...What elsee... ooh, lots of spawn camping. You spawn in, bam, right into the back. It seems fair to Gaijin. Cause, you know, russian tanks are fast and nimble, by the time Tigers get to objective, theyre already at our spawn,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥everyone as soon as you spawn in. So if you think you enjoy being shot in ridiculous OP affected ways most of the time - this game is for you. Then again this isn't far away from sadomasohism. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game starts out fun but as you get into the high ranks, it starts taking 50 to 75 games to unlock a single tank or plane. Very often two or even three of these tanks or planes are indentical in every way, save the name, meaning you spent 200+/- games trying to advance past them to something new. At the same time you start seeing players who paid real money for tanks that are practically invincible. Suprise, they kill you at will. On top of all this, there is a terrbile bias towards the Russian faction and games are generally one by whichever team has more russian players.			",7,0,0,1,11,0,16

												The company who made this game is Russian, and there is huge Russian bias in game. Russian tanks and planes are way stronger than other nations' tanks and planes. What is worse is developers dont care about this. Russian tanks have op ammunition, their armor is very sloped, they have cold war tanks, their fuel tanks and ammo racks rarely explode, their ammo has double chance to cause fire etc.Bomber planes are extremely weak only one bullet is enough to cut the wings. Bombers are almost unplayable on upper tiers.Game has pay to win elements. Premium vehicles, premium account, accelerated crew training all give many advantages in game. There are also annoying bugs in game ( like disconnecting from chat and squad after every battle, no research points after battle bugs) .Game is only recommended if :1- You only play with Russian tanks and planes2- You dont use bombers 3- You dont mind pay to win game system.

												If you want a balanced multiplayer game, look elsewhere.  If you're wondering why my play time is so high with a negative review (well, aside from the fact that a huge chunk of those hours were from me being afk while in the hangar), it's because the game keep going steadily downhill.  In game graphics are the only things improving, everything else (balance, gameplay, balance, pay walls, did I mention balance?) are just getting worse and worse over time.  I'm no longer a regular player like I used to be, I only come back whenever there are major content patches to see if Gaijin finally pulled their heads out of their you-know-where and started listening to their playerbase.  Unfortunately, this is never the case.  Out of 10 matches played, only 1 or 2 would be actually enjoyable.  The rest will have you rage quitting and facepalming over how stupid the game has become.  Such a shame too, it has such great potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ever since the update, the game has gone to crap. Airplanes become paper airplanes with having one to three shots to kill you in the stupidest of moments. The game has an unfair disadvantage. Level 1 tier plane can take down a tier 3 plane within 5 to 10 shots. Amazing. 2 - 3 shots to cut your wing with any type of caliber. The U.S. Airforce might be taking this game as a joke since the B-25's wing can be cut-loose by a tier 1 beginning plane. For god sakes, pictures of bombers coming back home with bullet holes everywhere and my bomber is taken down with 2-3 bullets. A joke of a ""simulated"" game. And a joke to people in the Air Force.I will change my reviews once you guys look up facts, not from Wikipedia, but from actual US/USSR/IJAA/RAF facts.			",40,2,2,3,3,0,0

												Hello All! I am AzureWolf, and this is my review of War Thunder.I began playing War Thunder in early 2014, so you could say I have at least a year of experience. As you probably have noticed, I didn't use this account, or even the account before this one much when I played the game; don't be fooled though. I've spent well over a thousand hours grinding for the much loved planes and tanks (and god knows what else now!) that we have come to love the game for.But I was a pay to win!No, just kidding; although I paid my fair share for premium, and even other bonus vehicles - I played my fair share of game; at least enough to clear a country or two. (In war thunder vehicles are seperated by country! If you didn't know.)And so it was! I was a War Thunderer! Hundreds of kills and thousands of destructions! Oh yes ladies and gents I was the cream of the crop; gunning down even the most skilled pilots with my point-and-click methods. But one day..It happened! My old account was hacked into and used to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of games, including war thunder items, add-ons, and much more! So, in order to keep my credit from plummeting, I had my bank charge steam back for the false purchases. And what happened?I got banned from steam ._. - and so I made this account; luckily I still had War Thunder right? Wrong :cThey took my hours, my hard work, my real earned money, my love for War Thunder; and flushed it away. I am at this moment, permanently banned from War Thunder by the creators Gaijin.Now ladies and gents, I will not lie! This game is one of the best and most fun simulators and arcade battling games there is.. but if you are looking for customer service and loyaltly to you for your hard work (and money!) - you best try elsewhere.

												Before you read this, let me make it clear that I am only talking about ground battles in this review.I consider this game one of the best in its field, mechanics-wise. Graphics are well rounded and can play on even a mediocre PC. It looks absolutely stunning at max details, but it will give you a severe handicap when trying to spot enemy tanks.Now for the bad; The playerbase is absolutely terrible. Roughly half of players in this game do not understand the mechanics and seem too preoccupied with (trying) getting kills and thus tend to ignore the mission at hand, which will ultimately garner you a loss in the end. While the game doesn't reward winners and punish losers like in similar games, it is still quite demoralizing to lose ten or more matches in a row, because your teammates are running around like headless chickens.Another concern is the abundance of russian players on the european servers. They refuse to use english and tend to teamkill you when you don't understand a word of what they're saying. From what I've heard, it is because the russian server is even more toxic to play on, so they go to the european server instead.Russian bias; it exists in the form of favorable battle rating for russian tanks. There is no denying this.Community: The community is congruent to poison and Gaijin is more focused on punishing than listening. It looks like Gaijin is actively trying to sabotage the community and what good is left of it, is slowly fading with each ban.Bugs: A lot of bugs have been introduced over the course of the last two major updates - don't expect to have a good time, as wonky physics, horrible ballistic collision and missing tank interior will ruin your day.Half a year ago I would definitely have recommended this game - not so much any more.Warthunder is slowly turning into a rotting cesspool of biased game design, bugs, horrible player management and blatant disregard of community feedback.TL;DR: Don't get this game, just don't - you will regret it. It will seem fun at first, but then it will suck out your soul and leave your dried salty husk to write bad reviews.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: A new spark of life has been shot into this game. ""Enduring Conflict"". This is a fantastic gamemode that needs to be about on a permanent basis. The match is pretty much 6 hours on a drop in drop out basis. They need to fix the rewarding however as if you do not stay until the end of the match you will not get your rewards, they also need to add a few more objectives but overall it's perfect. You get to respawn as many times as you like in RB or SB and keep flying out your favourite planes from battle rating 2.3 to 4.3 (there are other barackets too). I feel for once gaijiggles have pulled out a golden egg and I cant wait to see it hatch, fingers crossed it's not rotten and it tuns into something grand. WarThunder is a little hit and miss for me, there is no doubt that this is the best game out there for it's genre, but whilst there is nothing to match it the game is plagued with problems within staffing and general game development. Recently the game has been on a decline, from what has been fun is now just beyond a joke. The development team continue to nerf aircraft such as the Mosquito, an aircraft iconic during 1941-1942 for it's excessive speed and maneuverability, it was given the nickname ""the wooden wonder"". However this game doesn't reflect this at all, the aircraft used to fly great however it has been nerfed to the ground so much that it's slow and does not maneuver very well compared to it's historical counterpart, in fact it has been nerfed to the point where the early planes it was built to outrun and outpace can catch it fairly easily, it faces late war prop planes which far exceed the Mosquitos capabilities. This is but one of many planes that have seen nerfs, the fabled Griffon Spitfire? Nerfed, engine HP is greatly reduced, 150 octane fuel removed. F8F Bearcats? Nerfed, Ta-152 and various other german planes? Nerfed, Japanese planes? Nerfed. Russian planes? Buffed.     Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is great but the balancing is terrible. Now the official forums are just a complete and utter **** show. Overly power hungry/mad community moderators and admins handing out bans and warnings to players talking about issues in game, broken planes or any other issues regarding the games development, they will make snide remarks and as soon as you make a retort they will come down on you and claim that you're causing a flame war when anything you say is far from it. I would like to reccomend this game, but the games is beingg ran into the ground by a poor development team and a corrupt band of misfits patrolling the official forums taking away peoples freedom of speech. Slowly but surely Gaijiggles is becoming an Authoritarian company, or maybe it already is.			",169,17,2,32,23,0,35

												400 hours in... Honestly, I really liked the game. I loved fighting in WW2 tanks and planes. It was fun at low tiers, and still is pretty fun at said tiers. That's where it is balanced. Higher tiers... don't bother. I'm only higher-tier 3 tanks (GER/SOV) and it's hardly fun anymore. If I can get the drop on someone, then I'm ok, but nothing I do can stand up to Soviet tanks. Being undertiered for every game doesn't help, so me in my Tiger H will end up fighting tanks a whole BR point or more above me. It was like that for planes too (I achieved Tier 4 GER) and Soviets destroyed everything no matter where I went. I nearly stopped playing this a few months ago... may just completely stop now until I see someone on Youtube show that it doesn't suck anymore.			",28,1,0,5,5,0,15

												I enjoyed this game whenI first started it. The problem is when you start getting into the tier 3 ranks of tanks. The armor on the tanks barely make any difference whatsoever. They say the armor is thicker on tanks at the front hull. Well I actually decided to spend a few dollars to complete my first tier 3 Tiger tank and let me just say I regret spending the money. One shot to the front of the hull or anywhere else on the tank will penetrate every time and destroy all of your crew and munitions. This is especially true as I am around level 8 and every tank I come across is 2-3 tiers higher than mine in every battle and severely dimishes the fun of this game for me. Needs better matchups for the games, and so far It's not getting any funner for me.			",76,5,1,14,2,0,9

												As usual Gaijin keeps driving this deeper and deeper into♥♥♥♥♥♥territory, with each patch worse than the last.A redditor sums it up nicely.""It's less a testament of that and more a testament to how much people desperately wanted War Thunder to be a good game. Hell, I saw this train wreck 2-3 years ago and stuck for it for a year past the point of ""I don't like where this is going,"" before I stopped playing more and more, finally stopping outright at the ~2.5 year mark.All the while I tried to get the word out as best I could on what was wrong with WT, how it was wrong, why this actually constituted being called ""wrong,"" and possible solutions to fix it.This largely fell on deaf ears because the devs/community representatives/etc (whomsoever it concerns) are too busy being sycophantic, self-serving, ignorant, intent on dazzling the playerbase with smoke and mirrors, and a general disregard for major problems in the operation of the game and its general gameplay.That I stuck around for so long shows just how good War Thunder is at its core. That is, its most basic gameplay is absolutely phenomenal even if it has problems due to imperfect flight models, bad balance choices for tiering in both directions, blatantly improper use of metrics for determining balance, damage models that feel like the devs threw darts at a dart board to determine how strong things were (my favorite being P-47 wings disintegrating to 0.30 caliber shells that the overwhelming majority of planes during WWII were largely immune to except in insanely large quantities measured in hundreds upon hundreds of individual strikes)...the list goes on.But the devs don't care about fixing the actual problems with the game, flat out aren't being told it due to incompetent community representatives for one reason or another, and instead focus on pushing out more buggy, imbalanced, badly designed but gloriously modeled filler instead of spending a couple patches just making the game more fun at the gameplay level. This coupled with the blatant cash grabs that they've done making the game significantly more expensive to accomplish significantly less, and people are finally starting to wise up to those who left before and why, and choosing to leave as well.Or, to put it another way, for them, they just had the final straw put on the camel, and its back is broken.This problem has been a long time coming, and people were desperate for the game to improve, but they're just now giving up. The game could have been that good.But it also shows that the problem takes a very long time for most people to detect, and Gaijin right now is banking on that high turnover rate to stay profitable.The best anyone can do is try to make people just joining the game stay away from it by warning them that it has serious problems, but this feeds back into the first point: The core gameplay is just that good that it masks the absolute failure that is its metagame and mismanagement for significant amounts of time. And until the reviews tank WT, this will continue to be the case."" -Taranok ",83,8,0,10,16,0,27

												After last changes, I am totally hate this game and did not recommend to play now. Broken damage system, a cheaters and an old bugs. With an each new patch, even worse.When I come here from the other popular tank game, I hope this is the hardcore, more realistic game, about oneshots, marksman skill, tactics. But now It has nothing with realism and historical accuracy, just another arcade game with pretend to be a sim.The balance was never great, but now, when a WWII tanks fight against a Cold War beasts – its absolutely broken.The damage model in current state – is ridiculously unrealistic.That feeling, when you make direct hit with the soviet 122mm AP shell, and an enemy doesnt blow up sometimes… Often, only possible way to make a frag with the HEAT or the APDS – looong killing crew, man by man.And of course, an old bugs doesnt fixes, many cheaters in the game, but when you tell about it, you just get a ban, hard to play without donate at a top tier... Each new patch just add a new models, and a stupid changes, developers doesnt listen community and do not make the game better, do not improve the gameplay, just make a money.P.S. ""We are all just waiting for a similar game so we can drop this one like a dead baby. I can't wait for Gaijin to die honestly. Or at least for them to restructure their dev team. They don't care, they don't listen."" – from the official WT forum.			",71,14,4,39,9,0,26

												To sum up what is being said within the 20,000 reviews is pretty long but in short it goes like this. For people new to this game it is a brillaint second world war arcady flight sim with different styles of play and many different aircraft, later on the game requires a lot of money to actually progress anywhere if you even manage to reach tier 4 out of 5 you will understand what I mean by this, If your not prepered to put money on this game i wouldn't suggest getting your hopes up for it.For people with 400+ hours or those who have played it prior to patch 1.37 we all feel your frustration, the company switched from the all knowing all loved, to the more ""give us your money"". What 1.37 added was different way of proggression from the much more simple 1-20 tier system with 20 being top and 1 being the start it was compressed into only 5 tiers, what was expected was rough boundries eg Tier 4 vs Tier 4 well nope... If you play tier four your more than likely to experiance the wrath of a MiG-15 pilot booming and zooming your spawn throughout the whole game, still not the worst part thought, both Arcade and realistic are now flooded with bomber pilots flying to the enemy base blowing it up and letting the AI gunners act as laser guided heat seeking laser beams that track and destroy all life, this is still not to mention the horrible progression system that in a whole translates to ""Give me all your money if you want to be good"" the game requires countless grinds through horrible and buggy (Not to mention unbalanced) aircraft and then it makes you pay for it as it takes months to progress to a higher tier without a premiuim account or buy paying to progress. All this to unlock a slightly less broken aircraft just infront of it (Which comes stock so it's probably worse) The game went downhill from 1.37 flight models are now copies and objects not fully registered meaning you can fly through houses or you'll slam into an invisible 50ft tree. The games Devs weren't bad people and still aren't they're running a compnay and it seems they need a way to make more money from it, unforunaely this is one of the ways they chose. They used to listen and fix almost all bugs and issues now I think money has taken over a once great game that used to be a brilliant, now instead it is the biggest example of pay to progress.

												I supported this game way before Steam, as pre-beta tester. Everything seemed like the future was unlimited. THey have removed all ""simulation"" aspects of the game, they nerfed the historical capabilities to ""balance"" the planes (what's the purpose of tiers if you have to nerf the planes too). They have Tiers where the Me262 is up again Mig 15s, (seriously?)Overall, the game lost all what made it fun, and is full of arcade players that don't care enough because simulation and historical accuracy doesn't matter anymore.Will anyone ever create a good Air, Land, Sea game again? (World War II On-line will always be the last good one, which also went the way of the nerf)			",36,3,1,2,23,0,12

Devs dont even want to fix the match making. They will delete any posts or threads or lock discussions. ♥♥♥♥ing gaijin.2.5/10: No enjoyable experience other than playing russians or british and even then 3/4ths of all deaths are from bombers who are OP and need to be taken out.Its worse than any game i have ever played that simulates any sort of vehicular combat. Its so ♥♥♥♥ing bad.Edit as of 12/21/2015: Gijin has though it would be SMART (dumb mother ♥♥♥♥ers) to give the British tanks superior RoF and AP capabilities to the point they can fight all other 3 factions easily and are now the new dominant and OP faction in the game, even more so than the russians in most instances.

												I've played this game a lot, and everytime I play for a while I put it away again because i get frustrated with it, it is neither historically accurate nor balanced. It has problems that are not being fixed and bad community moderators that just shut you up. I'm not recommending this game.			",140,15,5,8,9,2,8

												The game seems so good at first glance, almost revolutionary. But it is everything but good.It is really a pain... You play great flight sims like Cliffs Of Dover, Battle Of Stalingrad or Rise of Flight just to find out that the multiplayer servers are ghost towns. Then you try out War Thunder. You are amazed by the graphics, the amount of content and the huge playerbase and it is even free to play!But your amazement doesn't last for long. (1) The ""matchmaking""First you start to realize the matchmaking is more than a little ""off"". Espacially playing the german tech tree is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you pay attention and have a little knowledge about these ww2 vehicles you will notice that there is a huge time rift between the planes you are flying as germany and the planes the allied forces fly in the same match. But it doesn't stop there. It isn't just the germans who suffer. -The entire game consists of sealclubbing and getting sealclubbed.-The gamemechanics themselves support this by controlling everything for you by mouseaiming and target markers so that seemingly the only thing that matters is the vehicles performance.At this point you might think: Yes sure, matchmaking is bad, but the game is still in beta, so it will eventually get better after the next patch.No it won't. I'm playing this game for three years now and have invested houndreds of hours into it (didn't play it from steam) and I can tell you it gets worse and worse after each patch. (2) Flight models, ""Realistic Battles"" and ""Simulator Battles""If you are like me and you aren't interested in arcade games you will probably go straight into ""realistic"" or ""simulator"" battles. The problem is, that most of War Thunders player base is concentrated around arcade battles so the other two game modes get less and less attention by the devellopers each patch. They are basically removing content from these gamemodes instead of improoving them. For exemple since one patch that has been released this year ""Realistic Battles"" now have mixed factions. You will fly in an american plane side by side with a japanese one to shoot down germans and brits. That is what they call ""realistic"" now.Same♥♥♥♥♥♥goes on with the flight models. Almost all flight models in the game are placeholders. Some of them seriously broken. (Just to name two simple examples: With the japanese biplanes you where able to fly up straight into the air without stalling and reaching heights in which the pilot would probably freeze and suffocate. The bf 109 on the other hand gets its combat flaps ripped off when reaching speeds over 300kph)But what does Gaijin do about it? Nothing! Since three years we get in every new patch new vehicles to attract new players and the old flight models remain untouched.(3) The root of all evil. Gaijin itself.The problem with this game is not its engine or its game concept, its the company behind it.Gaijins aim is to make quick money with this game. Moneymaking is nothing bad and every company needs to make money to survive but Gaijin has taken a rout which pisses on its playerbase in the worst possible fashion.How does Gaijin make money? Do you need to pay money to play the game? No. Is it pay to win? Kind of, but thats not the main problem. What is the main problem then?The main problem is, that Gaijin doesn't aim to earn money with long time players, but with players that jump in, get a first glance of the game, are amazed and pay money to get quickly to their favourite vehicles. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will soon realize that they have sunk money into a game that is horrible. Gaijin doesn't care that these players will leave with anger as long as there are new players comming in and paying money to get quicker to their desired vehicles. This is why the game is so bad because the game doesn't need to BE good to earn money, it just needs to LOOK good.(4) Gaijin and the playerbaseAfter all the problems I have listed here I think this is the worst of all. I've allready said, that gaijin just uses new players to milk money out of them, but I think the worst thing is how they are treated afterwards.When people realize the problems with the game they go on the forum and complain about them. The most natural thing to do you would suggest, espacially when you have paid money for game content. Wrong!Even when people reaveal problems in the game in the most modest and friendly way they are are verbally attacked by Gaijins moderators in the worst and most childish manner. Posts and entire threads get deleted, players blocked or banned for simply pointing out problems and Youtubers get threatened for uploading videos criticising the game.Thats Gaijins propaganda machine at work. They don't want the game to look bad for potential players because the potential players are their money base and not the players allready playing the game for a few months.(5) SummaryThere is no game in the world that provokes as much fellings to me as this one. The reason being is that this game had so much potential to be an entry for a complete new generation of players into flight sims. It had so much potential to become something really big and revolutionary. But in the end this dream has been destroyed by the greed of its company: Gaijin.Do not play this game. I've sunk 20€ and probably well over 300 hours into it for nothing but pain, anger and frustration.			",42,4,2,6,9,0,8

												War Thunder is a ""free to play"" game where you can either take it to the skies in a variety of different airplanes from different nations (USA, UK, GER, USSR and JAPAN), or you can jump in a rather well modeled and simulated tanks from light tanks to anti-air (USA, UK, GER, USSR). I have quite a lot of hours in to the game and there is a reason for that. I have enjoyed this ""free to play"" game in the past, and I would love to keep playing it but it seems that one of the patches that came out in the last few months, or something else has changed the restock and repair fee amounts in the game. Back when I still played actively you were able to outfit your plane/tank and play the game without worrying whether you had enough credits to pay for the restocking of ammo and repairing it after the match, regardless of the outcome of the match itself. Today I noticed while playing with my Rank III german armor, that even if I managed to kill 1 or 2 enemy tanks in arcade game AND if our team won the match, I lost credits when I came back to my hangar. I had 96k silver lions (credits used to pay for stuff ingame), I lost 3 tanks and managed to destroy 2 and our team won the match. In the after report I saw that I got slightly over 10K silver lion credits from the match but when I returned to the hangar, it showed I had 94.5k left, which means that unless you are super awesome at this game and manage to take all the points and destroy half of the enemy team without dying yourself even once, you won't be getting much anything out of the arcade matches in terms of credits to buy new tanks. This is essentially the same method World of Tanks makes you buy premium and use real money at the end-tier tanks. Without one, you won't be able to afford the repair costs after the match etc. etc. etc.This pretty much saddens me, especially when we aren't even talking about end-tier tanks here in War Thunder, we're talking about Rank III tanks. Because I have no intention of spending any more real money on this game I suppose I will just have to drop it and stop playing. It's already almost impossible to get to IS-2, Tiger 2 and beyond without using real money, and the grind fest from Tiger H1 to Tiger 2 will literally take you months without premium unless you are willing to spend every waking hour playing the tank portion of the game.It was fun War Thunder, maybe I'll come back when you cut the repair/rearm costs between matches and actually give players a change to get to the higher rank tanks without pulling out the old credit card.

												I started a rant but I can't continue it, the game is just not worth the extra words. So you get a no for ruining one of my favorite games. Thanks, Gaijin for some good times and some even worse than bad.   I plan on writing a proper review, I just don't have time. You -could- skip over it and not even read it, like this game does with it's tanks. ""Oh unlock this tank, but if you use it you'll face Korean era end-game content that can pen you from ANY angle -what so ever- and since you can't pen THEM and you're too slow to maneuver around, you just have to bend over and take it!"" So you're better off skipping this tank altogether, Tiger II H for example. Let's not even get into the ammo racks situation. Russian racks don't explode, period, once in a blue moon. German racks explode regardless of ammo-types or where you were penetraded, one stray fragment from AP will set them off. Russian tanks have some miraculous shell-bouncing magic abilities, too, and I can say that as a Russian tank user. that ISU-122 has bounced 88mm to the side of the hull where the ammo is at point blank, many MANY times.Edit: So they announced naval forces. But they've come out saying they likely won't do large ships like battleships because in testing they're too slow and boring and battles would go on far too long or what ever. Well it happens that they've added several new maps lately that are just massive for ground forces. Neat, right? Well when it takes you 7 minutes just to see the first shot get fired, I call absolute 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about battleships being too slow and boring. This whole game is ending up to be just that way, they're just looking for excuses. Furthermore, there's this thing called the KV-220 that was added as a rare 'earnable through agonizing grinding' premium Russian tank. Tigers have trouble penetrating it, and it's faster than the weaksauce KV-85 that everyone else gets. You can't even buy this tank if you wanted an OP monster. Only way you could get it was to nolife ""tasks"" all day every day for a week or what ever. Adding it was a great mistake.			",88,10,18,17,11,0,28

												-PREPARE FOR A MASSIVE WALL OF TEXT!-I've had this game for a looooong time, since about patch 1.27 or 1.29 - never really played it then. Which was a massive mistake. I should have played this game every day when I had the time. I didn't, and I'm kicking myself for it. I think that this game should have stayed with the 20-rank system. Let me tell you why.-From what I've seen, overtiering wasn't a problem, as aircraft used to get into matches with others which were at worst 2-3 tiers higher than it.-Gaijin had 20 tiers of unlocks to play with, so putting an aircraft in slightly the wrong tier wasn't a big issue. Nowadays, if Gaijin screw up the battle rating on a plane, that plane becomes infuriating to fly - not that there's anything wrong with the plane, but because the matchmaking it gets is downright unfair. A perfect example of this in action is the low-tier German tech tree.-Expanding on 'overtiering', every plane and tank has its own battle rating. This is how matchmaking works for each of the 5 nations:UK: Fair matchmaking for appropriate aircraft.US: Good matchmaking.Japan: Seems alright, I wouldn't really know.USSR: TROLOLOLOLOL OP MATCHMAKING FOR OP PLANES TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLGermany: Don't even get me started... flying low-tier Germans is PAINFUL. Worst matchmaking, easily.-I have 95 hours on record or thereabouts for this game. It's by far the game I've played most on Steam - 90% of those hours have been spent after patch 1.37 was introduced. My highest tier aircraft is the F4U-1a Corsair, a rank 2 aircraft, and I'm at tier 2 with most other nations, after 85.5hrs played AFTER patch 1.37. If I keep playing this game, I reckon it's going to take me another 200 hours to get my first jets. Grindy, grindy, grindy, grind.-However, Gaijin are taking steps in the right direction to make the grind shorter and more bearable. They've reduced the amount of RP and Lions it takes to research and unlock aircraft and tanks by a large amount. Then they reduced the amount of RP you earn from tank battles. Errrr... not so keen on that, Gaijin.-Gameplay is solid for the vast majority of the time. Despite my lacking skill both in the air and on the ground, I can enjoy myself most of the time whilst playing this game. Maybe it's because I'm interested in WWII combat, maybe it's because I like unlocks.-Most of the planes and tanks you'd expect to be in the game are here.You've got plenty of Bf-109 models, plenty of Fw-190s, He-111s, Do 217s, Spitfires, a few P-47s, a few Mustangs, A6M Zeroes, a G4M1, LaGG-3s, MiG-15s, you get the drill.-The game *should* look gorgeous on max settings. You do need a good computer to run it on max, though, but it should be worth it. I have a cr**py laptop though, so I can't confirm or deny anything.-Money is a problem from what I've heard. I try to always keep as large a sum of money on my account as I can.Overall, the game has its ups and downs, pros and cons, but I think the cons outweigh the pros, especially for your average Joe gamer - someone stuck down at low tiers, enduring idiot players, awful vehicles, what have you. I did say this would be a long read!			",23,1,1,2,7,1,8

												If you are reading this, please do not stop. I am a veteran gamer who's been playing WT for over two years, and have invested thousands of hours and a couple hundred dollars into the game. Every single patch for the last year has been a mounting disappointment for me and the community. Just look at the feedback on the official forum or subReddit. Do not be fooled by their shiny graphics & vehicles. By the time you get to the mid-high tier matches you will understand why nearly all of Gaijin's most dedicated consumers have left the game. The developers, TIME and TIME AGAIN have demonstrated that they are INEPT at improving the gameplay. Any attempt to ""fix"" these balancing issues you will encounter as an intermediate player will make the grind EXTREMELY slow and YOU WILL NOT HAVE FUN. Gameplay in every mode (arcade, realistic, simulator) is slowly shrinking into enclaves of people abusing broken game mechanics, such as completely UFO flight models of aircraft that haven't been amended for months, tank shells that won't kill an enemy tank's crew member despite skewering him in the face, anything you can imagine in terms of WTF. Not to mention the recent battle-rating amendments that completely DESTROYED high-tier gameplay. You, new players, once you start getting a couple hundred matches into the game and unlock new tanks, you will come to realize that the developers will NEVER, AND I MEAN NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LISTEN TO YOU OR YOUR PROBLEMS, EVEN IF THE GAME IS ENTIRELY BROKEN. Tell me new players, does a first model A6M Zero from 1939, deserve to fight a P47 introduced four years later? The devs certainly think so, and they will tier these two aircraft at almost the SAME battle rating! How about the ME-262, a jet introduced in 1944, routinely fight MiG-15's and F86 sabres from the Korean war? The developers have actually tried to JUSTIFY this, despite these aircraft being WORLDS apart in terms of performance. And now because there are no more players who want to offer themselves as cannon fodder to superior planes, the queing times for these higher-level matches are getting longer, and longer, and longer. Gaijin's solution: lower the Battle-Rating ceiling so that Korean war jets fight WW2 German PROPELLOR-DRIVEN planes, and 1944 tanks fight End-Game Cold War tanks that are virtually impervious to their guns. Forum moderators will shoot down negative posts without reading your feedback. Instead of fixing these ages-old broken game mechanics the developers insist on adding shiny new tanks at prohibitive prices to lure naive, trusting new players like you, and you will regret it. Take my word, I have been on the forums and other social media for years now, and I can tell you with the utmost certainty that the WarThunder playerbase is dying. Slowly, sure, but progressively and steadily. And The only ones to blame are Gaijin and their inept staff. I am almost certain that Warthunder will become a ghost-town before ships are released. I tried to cram as many reasons for YOU to not pick up this pile of garbage that WarThunder has devolved into within the last two years. Take it as you will, but know that you are funding a HYPOCRITICAL, CRIMINALLY INCOMPETENT, and GREED-DRIVEN company that does not care an OUNCE about what you think. Don't wait until you wasted a couple dozen hours into the grind, only to discover what the rest of the veterans already know. Trust me. My screen-name is cdahdude5, and if you really are curious to see how much time I've invested in this game go here and search my name: http://thunderskill.com/Gaijin's playerbase was already shrinking, but this last patch of theirs is the nail in the coffin. Their losses are too great now, and I am highly pessimistic that the Gaijin staff will somehow save the game, and actually LISTEN to what their players have to say. Jesus coming back to Earth is more likely at this point.			",18,2,0,0,1,0,0

												2 years ago, this game looked promising, but this is no longer true. Gaijin are the worst devs ever, they ignore the requests of the community and implement things that break the game. Most recently they changed the BR system and MM system, which already compressed the vehicles too much. Now there's vehicles from different genrerations fighting against eachother e.g. Me 262 and Sabre.

												This game was great fun. Realistic-ish tank combat, air combat, ect, it was fun really..Too bad its been spiraling down the drain for a while now.-Total garbage performance/optimization in the updated game engine. This is really sad, was a very pretty good     performance game at one time. Problems persist unadressed for long peroids. When fixxes do come, they often dont actually fix squat. SlI? good luck. AMD crossfire-dont even bother, unplayably broken.-Hystericlly bad customer service. ( half the time mods just troll people asking for help on forums, if the post makes past the mods in the first place,,its pretty funny)-Famous Russian bias. This didnt actually bother me to much, but ya, its like Vladimir Putin coded the game,,,,,while riding a bear with no shirt on. Its a joke.-The grind is REAL. Reapair cost at high teirs cause turtle matches and emty wallets.-Divebombers. A classic example of unballancing mechanics that go unadressed.Pros- the game USED to be the best tank game around.

												Can't say I could recommend it to anyone.I liked it for a while, not gonna lie, but matchmaking makes it difficult to.I never played it for the flight sim aspect, quite simply because it is NOT one. And never will be.War Thunder, however, gave me a base off of which I could rate other games, with regards to things such as quality, graphics, realisticity, and historical accuracy (though textbooks would be a more preferable point of reference for the last one).I put about 700-800 hours on the game so I have a pretty good feel for how it works, and it is likely I will not play it again.But to recapitulate, it was a good and fun game to play in order to get exposed to flight sims, at least in my opinion. Again, I REALLY would not call this game a flight sim, but it gives one a good feel for how they work. For example: I used WT to learn how to use a joystick, and learn a few BFMs on simulator mode.Thank you for reading.TL;DROverall not so good, but if you've got nothing else you can play it for exposure to flight sims.

												I played this game for a long time, yet i won't recommend this game.For almost two years, each time i get the same useless bonus (backup vehicle or 5000 coins, a normal low ranked tank's price is 300.000 coins) only once or twice i could get a normal bonus, which was again a cheap, useless bonus but since it was few times it felt good (15.000 coins), so if i get 21 time bonus (21 days of login) i can buy a cheap tank for myself with again im greatful for some cheap, useless, low priced bonus.War Thunder is not a player-friendly game for free gaming, you need to pay for it or else game developers woudn't give♥♥♥♥♥♥about you because there are so many other players, you will see that i am right after this game will keep on giving you the same useless bonuses over and over..I keep playing War Thunder but i decided not purchase anything because i know the next day i pay, I will keep receiving a repair fee for a light tank as a bonus. This game will give you nothing instead of ''CONGRATS YOU WONT 5000 COINS'' so why should i trust this game at all? They won't get nothing from me for being so greedy, the only way this game will start giving you something is when no one will play that game, and the bonuses will be out of desperation. I've seen many greedyass developers that were begging for coins in the end and that is what they deserve.I spent almost 2 years for this game, don't make the same mistake (PS ; i won't delete the game since i spent so much time to open up high tiers, but give a chance for other tank simulation games, unless you have 2 years to develop yourself to have atleast decent gaming experience.In short, you may enjoy the game, but don't expect much help from the game itself, i will write further reviews if there will be any change in rewarding system or some player-friendly act by the game developers.I know no matter how much i write, game developers will laugh their♥♥♥♥♥of me since they dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥. why am i saying this, NO change at all. 5000 COINS gifted well done (after 2 years) can i not accept the gift since i do not want some chewed chewing gum as a gift? I'd prefer a gift that is written ""dear player, f-ck you"" instead of 5000 coins ( to unlock a♥♥♥♥♥♥tank its atleast 300.000 coins. Every chance-roll is set and known to the developers, after i spin it slowly stops at backup tanks or 5000 coins (every time). Seriosly sorry for my language but ♥♥♥♥off, i have more chance in an illegal casino. Someday ppl will realize this bs and will go away and then everything will be free, when no one is playing this game anymore. I hope g.developers will start to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about people.

												In 2013, and as closed beta before then, it was probably my favorite game.Now, enjoy getting skull♥♥♥♥ed by Yak 3s and the T34.Gaijin is a Russian developer with a huge raging hard-on for the Soviet Union. If you want to play as the Soviets, and you know virtually nothing whatsoever about tanks or airplanes, you'll probably enjoy yourself.Otherwise, and especially if you like anything German, stay away.

												Edit: I didn't leave because I couldn't deal with the bias (IJA main in the top 30% of the playerbase), I left because of Gaijin's shenanigans with the exploit coverup and the consequent banning of my clan's leader after he posted about it on Live.USSR: The Game.Seriously. For example, the ""our stuff is the best around despite sucking compared to everyone elses"" mentality, common in Communist countries such as the USSR, is very much in play here as Russian equipment is by far the most (unrealistically) powerful in the game. USSR-style censorship is also in play, with one particular example coming to mind where the CEO of the freaking company asked players to remove all trace online of a game-breaking exploit, which is still in the game. I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to get this review removed. USSR-style respect for the players is also in play, with the entire game running on the simple basis of ""You don't like thing? Good, let's make it even worse."" Despite all of this, they actually had the audacity to ask the playerbase to vote for them in the Steam Awards. I did, nominating them for the ""Russian Bias"" award. I recommend doing the same.I played this game for far too long before realizing all of this. If there's one good thing about, it's the fact that it's better than World of Warplanes, but let's get real here - what isn't.			",50,5,2,4,8,0,2

												Heavily flawed F2P game that takes itself somewhat seriously as both an arcade flyer and an air simulator but doesn't force you to buy in through ridiculous grinds like the typical F2P. I'll be discussing the flying portion as I have the most experience with it.The primary issue here is that the devs are Russian, and like all Russian devs who make WWII games the commie propaganda shines through heavily and the Russian bias is extremely tangible, either due to national pride clouding the devs' honesty or them being force fed Red Army propaganda as children. The key to having fun in this game is extremely simple: ignore Russians entirely. Don't play maps that pit you against Russians, and you'll have few complaints. The other factions balance well against each other, but compared to the flying saucer-tier unrealistic flight models of the Soviet Air Force(whose real life achievements include the worst kill-death ratio in World War II, the most plane crashes in the war, and probably the most pilots flying under the influence of alcohol), you'll find yourself raging out due to blatant imbalancing to favor Russian players and Russian planes(like pitting post-war Russian aircraft models against early/pre war German/Japanese/British/American ones, which is extremely prevalent in the first three tiers but consistent throughout the Russian aircraft tree). A good way to test the insane imbalance is by starting the game as a non-Russian faction, and then picking up the Russian tree after you've learned the ropes to experience maximum seal clubbing as you can climb sharper, dive faster and turn quicker than anything else in the game.The secondary issue is that these devs have added many types and classes of aircraft to the game, and any that aren't fighters or interceptors(70% of the aircraft models in this game) don't serve a purpose or benefit their team in any way. Bombers/ground attackers/fighters that focus on ground targets are nothing but a liability to/drag on their team and dog chow for opposing fighter aircraft. They do not serve a purpose in game modes that end 95% of the time in team wipes, even though there are ostensibly mission objectives for bombers to complete that almost never get done.Flying anything that isn't an air superiority fighter is choosing to play 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'. Fighting Russians in anything that isn't Russian(with few exceptions) is also playing 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'.The Russian bias, wonky flight models/characteristics and horribly imbalanced game modes bring my score for this game from a solid 7/10 to a 5/10. As it basically still in 'active beta' release, I cannot recommend it until it is more polished and the devs learn English well enough to read their forums. If you DO play it, please don't give these devs any money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Welcome to War Thunder, the game where B-17s can get shoot down by a Russian Biplane, let's get started.Things I like:- Realistic flying mechanic- Damage modules-Both planes and tanksAnd that's it.Now, let's get to the things I hate.- Balance -> This game is not balanced at all, there are 5 nations to join: USA, UK, Germany, Japan and Russia, now, the real problem (seen from a USA main) is that every nation exept for USA and maybe UK is overpower, expecially Russia.It might be me, but I think there's a problem with the fact that a russian tier 1 plane can completly obliterate a tier 4 US bomber.- Teammates -> Altough there are some good teammates who like to actually play as a team, the majority of the players wanna just get points, they won't communicate, they will """"steal"""" your """"kills"""" and they will bomb the objective you chose to bomb. Not to talk about the fact that most of the players will randomly write something in russian every 5 seconds ))))- Bombers -> As a US Bombers main, I realized that bombers go down very quickly, expecially B-17s and that's a shame, because it's very hard to shoot down most of the other bombers, but the B-17 is probably one of the weakers. And it's kinda strange, since in real life, the B-17 was one of the best bombers.- Russia -> Every russian plane\tank is overpower, I litterally got bored of playing as US and constatly get shot down by Russia that I tried to play Russia and got bored of shooting down other planes.People ofter ask ""Is this game Pay to Win?"" of course it isn't, it's play Russia to winSo, if you don't like to loose, Grab your Sekrit Dokumints, put on your tracksuit, choose your Russian plane made of Stalinium and spam ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" everywhere you can and put on ""Kalinka"" or The russian march of Red Alert 2, oh, don't forget to write  ""xaxaxaxaxaxa ))))))"" after every kill. Now that you know how to play Russia in WT, you're ready to go Tovarish			",20,0,0,0,5,0,2

												Simply put: I don't have such love/hate relationship with any other game than I have with War Thunder. Also no other game has made me more salty than War Thunder.That said I'll list some pros and cons.Pros:-Different levels of realism from shooty-tooty arcade to much slower paced simulator battles-Lots of tanks and airplanes to unlock and new ones are constantly added-Very nice graphics-Free to play but not win to pay-Does actually require some skill, especially later in gameCons:-Realism is sometimes more like ""realism"", tanks ricocheting rounds in very weird way OR taking damage when they really shouldn't etc-There are lots of stuff to unlock but sometimes you'll notice that vehicles are very similiar. For example when unlocking american tanks you'll spend ages grinding through three different Shermans that aren't actually that different from each other after all. (Slight changes to armour thickness etc, don't really mean anything) And that's just one example.-Technically it's still pay to win, War Thunder has this premium system that gives you different kind of boosters to use and also provides you with a selection of premium vehicles. Not all of them are that special but some of them are seriously unbalanced and overpowered.-Does require skill but still most of the time it seems that it's not enough. Game suffers from serious balancing problems and therefore some matches end in minutes no matter how good of an player you are.Some other things that need to be noted:Game has this Battle rating system or BR in short. This means that every vehicle has a rating, for example 3.7. Game then searches for players with same BR. Thing is that usually you have more than just one vehicle. Lets say you have three tanks with BR of 3.7. Things are good and you're having pretty evenly balanced games. Then you get a tank with BR of 4.3 Suddenly you're facing tanks that have BR of 5 or even higher. This leads to greatly unbalanced game.Also because of this game doesn't always feel rewarding. For example I grinded for some time to get legendary Tiger and Panther tanks but after I got them I really didn't feel like playing with them because I was fighting more advanced (prototype or post-WW2 era tanks) most of the time. That also takes away some realism.Spawncamping. Yes, I do it sometimes myself too but still. Too often I see games where one team steamrolls to other teams spawn and kills everyone. Some maps even make it very easy by having the spawn points on open ground and easily seen from across the map. Already unbalnaced games become even more unbalnced because of this.Lack of teamwork. It's extremely rare to see some real teamwork in WT unless you're playing with friends or are part of some clan. There are lots of russian players even on EU servers and they don't usually speak english and even less usually they give a ♥♥♥♥ about other players. Not saying that they all are like that, just like 80% of them...Game modes don't really force you to be a team player. Okay maybe it's bit wrong to rant about this but I still want to point it out. With tanks game modes usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map. Even though you do get a reward for capturing a point and you do get more points and currency if you win a match it doesn't force you to play the objective or be a team player. WT would be a lot more fun with new game modes etc, maybe there will be some in the future.All in all, War Thunder is somewhat hooking even though sometimes it makes you really salty. You might like it or not or perhaps you'll be like me and feel both ways. I chose not to recommend this game because right now it feels unbalanced and broken, maybe I'll change my mind after a while. Or maybe not.  ",62,2,0,5,7,0,14

												My Grandson turned me onto this Gem. Yes the game is free, but if you want to get more enjoyment then a kid at Christmas Time I would you spend a few dollars on a premium membership for at least 30 days and some golden eagles. plan on about $30.00 to get yourself started. I know you may read of the griping of handing over few dollars for a game that is supposed to be free. Do you not think the developers wrote this game not to have financel gain? Just give the game a test drive. If it can keep a 60 year coming back for more (even I crash a lot) You younger folks should be taking this for a spin. I also want to see if I can form a squardern of newbies called crazy eagles, insanitty is the only prequsite to membership			",15,1,0,1,24,0,38

I even spent quite a lot of money for premium / faster research. But now...  What the f*ck was that last update about? Is this new match making supposed to be a joke or something? What are rank 5 machines doing in rank 4 match? How is one meant to take on Maus/T-10M/IS-4/T95/Panther 2  with a T44 or IS-2?Is this another stupid trick to push players into spending money for reasearch boost? I'm done with this sh*t.

												This game could have been so much more.  It has everything at its most fundamental level for air combat to be an absolutely phenomenal game, with basic gameplay that is top tier.But this game is plagued by one irreconcilable problem:  It is being managed and developed by Gaijin.Since I started playing, Gaijin has lowered the value of of your money spent on this game (that is to say, they've repeatedly raised the price), frequently have increased the grind in the game beyond frustrating levels, habitually ignore major gameplay and metagame problems in all aspects of the game, and spend patch after patch trying to blind the community with new content while they fail to address legacy issues with the game.New content is frequently bugged, either hilariously underpowered or overpowered, and more or less keeps a status quo with a game stagnant in terms of gameplay when the gameplay is full of more holes than swiss cheese.  In addition to this, the devs frequently make asinine balance changes that ultimately lower the quality of the game more often than not.I could honestly go on, but it would make this review too long going into the nitty gritty.  The point is, as long as Gaijin is running this game, it will always be destined to get worse over time, not better.Despite this, the raw gameplay will suck you in and the overpricing will wring you for all you're worth before it tosses you aside with its easily missed legacy problems.  I cannot in good conscience recommend this game.			",205,54,3,33,33,2,48

												I've spent a lot of hours and a lot of money on this game. Trust me when I say this. It's a good game concept and to be honest I would like to continue playing this game, it was a good game. Now, well, you have to understand that these game developers like most other game developers in our current age are greedy little ***** who don't pay attention to the game but to the money. What can we do? Stop other people from wasting their time and money. Don't play this game. I would rather play 'Armored Warfare' or 'World of Tanks'. At least you can continue getting tanks without much need of the use of money. 'War Thunder' on the other hand, if you want to get above tier 3, you can either pay up or grind for the next 3 to 5 months for 1 tank or plane. The game itself is good, but the developers decisions are not.<EDIT>I think it would be more for ground forces vehicles than planes. Some high tier planes can be accquired much easier than high tier tanks. But all in all, after a certain stage higher in the tech tree, it becomes almost impossible to unlock anything without the use of money, unless you are willing to spend almost 3 to 4 months depending on how much time you have. This means the game is catered more towards the players with more money to spend. Don't get me wrong, you can still obtain vehicles at high tier without the use of money. It is just not practical with the amount of time you need and have to grind through. For someone who does not have 24 hours a day to play every day. A great game suddenly becomes a chore. As I have said, I would still continue playing this game, but I cannot recommand it as of yet because of how the developers react and respond towards bad reviews and handle these situations.

												As you can see I have played 548 hours on this game and I have been through alot.I've made it up to 8.0 in tanks and 5.3 in fighters. I have spent hundreds of dollars on this game and had many good moments. I even got to be half decent of a tanker. However, I cannot recommend this game due to the severe unbalance of the Battle Ranking system, the maps themselves, and the variety of choices available to different nations.To begin, the Battle Ranking system is based on the time period of which the vehicle came from (and also matches the vehicle with similar capabilities.) I believe the Battle Ranking system is too small to pitch the 1942 Tiger 1 against the 1955 STRV 81 which has 3 guided missiles (and I am aware that the Centuion model comes from 1945). Albeit difficult to use, the guided missiles are just a bonus to the base model of Centurion MK.3 with the 20pdr rapid-fire cannon with APDS.Next the maps, to what I believe to be the source of the problem. The spawns are only around 2km away from each other.This almost garuntees a spawn camp every match. If I was to deploy a base or forward position, I would never set a base only 2000 meters away from a hostile encampment. The spawn camp and rushing techniqe is not entertaining for the victims as it is satisfying to the instigators. And did I mention the planes in Tank Battles? You'd think it's a great idea. This is the only way I can describe it:    1. You spawn in a vehicle   2. You capture a zone   3. You see enemy ground vehicles   4. You aim to fire your weapons at them   5. You explode due to a plane crashing into you and firing its rocketsI don't like the unbalanced effect when dozens of kamikazee planes kill your entire team in 2 minutes. And there is no penalty for crashing these planes which is not a good thing to teach the community.I would recommend that Gaijin removes rocket planes from arcade battles and only allow a player to crash 2 planes per match. If the person crashes 2 planes then the player no longer gets planes for the rest of the match.The unbalancing factor for the end tier tanks though? It's the ATGM. Ever since Gaijin introduced ATGM's this game needs reactive armor to balance the overspam of limitless ATGM's on the field. For instance the IT-1. It can fire over hills from near complete cover, and destroy 5 tanks in 60 seconds. Not to mention that it has good armor, good speed, 500 mm of penetration and a 13 second reload. I have yet to see one that has its ammo rack explode.Now when it comes to tech trees for various nations I will explain.I know the Soviet Union gets many good tanks. But when they added the IS-6, things took a turn for the worst in the 6.7 battle ranking. I don't appreciate it when pay-to-wins get a tank that can't be penetrated by conventional rounds. You need HEAT-FS or HESH rounds to penetrate this tank. And if you don't, you don't stand much of a chance do you? I am aware of the weak spot on the turret, but if you destroy an IS-6, all they do is spawn in a T-54 1947,T-54 1949, T-54 1951, IS-3, IS-2, IS-2 mod 1944, T-44-100, IS-4M, T-10M, T-62, IT-1, T-34 100, T-44 122, and return to kill you in revenge. Where the british for instance get the Chieftain Mk.3, Centurion Mk.10, Centurion Mk.3, Strv 81 and the Conqurer. The selection is ""balanced"" right? I know that all it takes is the appropriate tactics to achieve victory, but you need a team of intelligent individuals to work together (which is not usually the case) with vehicles that can perform adequately.Anyway, I have experience in this game and it is mostly negative. I sometime loose my temper when I repeatedly get defeat after defeat due to an incompetent team that has no ability to think outside the box. I end my review to state that this is not my game as I prefer strategy games. And if you do get this game, I hope you enjoy it. But in its current state I cannot recommend it. ",24,1,0,6,4,1,2

												War Thunder would be a great game, easily the best WW2 vehicle simulator on the market, in the hands of a more competent developer.Let me qualify that. The engine is amazing. Great graphics and solid performance, even on weaker systems. The variety of tanks and aircraft is unmatched, and the 3 distinct gamemodes are all varied enough to be entertaining. What Gaijin consistently fails to understand, however, is their playerbase. I'm not even going to go into the whole ""Russian bias"" argument, just know that there are compelling arguments proving  it. Even if all the overperforming vehicles were British or American or Polish or whatever, the sheer amount of denial and refusal to address overperfoming vehicles, or mis-tiered ones is laughable. We have World War II era jets like the Ho 229 and the P80 facing off against cold war era ones like the Mig 17 and F 86 Sabre. Late war tanks like the Panther II VS some of the best post war tanks like the T-54 or T-10. The Yak 3P is currently much better than what's tiered against it, as is the I-185, a plane prototype that killed both it's test pilots and was cancelled. The grind is also unreal. Someone calculated that, without premium, and with a pretty good 2.5 k/d, it would take a person roughly 2000 hours to grind out a top tier vehicle's modules. Not a vehicle, just to unlock every unlockable module on a vehicle. That's roughly a year of grinding if you played 166 hours a month. That's insane. This kills the playerbase at the top tiers, which is causing all sorts of problems with the matchmaker as tanks are drawn up from the lower tiers to fill these games. So, overall, I still hold out hope that Gaijin will fix this game. They have the power to make this the best game of it's type on the market, bar none. But for now, stay well away before you get invested in a sinking ship.EDIT: So, this just happened: 


YouTube™ Video: Gaijin, War Thunder. . . . I have no words for this, This is going too far.

			Link: http://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/314355-developer-rb-mode-and-illegal-modifications/ Just in case this video receives a strike due to this vote I will be keeping a copy of it on my...		

For those of you who don't want to watch the video, here's the rundown. Illegal modifications for War Thunder have begun to circulate, and multiple Youtube channels who make War Thunder videos covered these mods. Chief among which was a mod that put vehicle markers above enemy tanks in the RB battle mode, effectively giving the player accurate information about enemy location that would not be available to him otherwise.Gaijin then put a poll on their official forums, asking for player feedback on one of 2 options.Option 1 gave Gaijin a blank check to copyright strike videos covering these illegal mods, effectively censoring their own community with unlawful copyright strikes (Yes, these would be unlawful, as critique of copyrighted material is covered under fair use)Option 2 just put those overhead markers on enemy tanks in RB for all players, ""Making the illegal modification useless"", and also ruining the gamemode of choice for a significant portion of the playerbase.This is ♥♥♥♥ing disgraceful, and even I doubted Gaijin would stoop so low. What they are doing is giving their own community, the dedicated players who keep interest in the game alive, an ultimatum. Stop covering these illegal modifications, or we will ruin the gamemode that you like. Keep in mind, they aren't even attempting to fix the exploit that allows this mod to work, no, they just want to bury it so that no-one can complain about it. This is truely disgusting behavior. They are admitting to the entire playerbase that they are more willing to issue unlawful copyright strikes, potentially destroying entire Youtube channels dedicated to making content about War Thunder and putting Youtubers out of business entirely, than address an actual problem with their game. This is not how you make a good game, and this is not how to reward those who create free publicity about your game. They have since backed down, and deleted the poll, but the issue remains. They were completely happy to do this in the first place. They saw no issue with threatening their own community with mass censorship, rather than deal with an actual problem in their own game. I'm calling it now. Gaijin will never save this game.			",114,5,1,9,9,1,7

												-Games not balanced nor ""historically balanced"", so why go a unhistoric unbalanced path?-Community is awful-Community Manager falsely advertises packs with bad wording and contacting support does nothing but ""will forward message to devs"" (Its been almost a year now and nothing heard back, feel scammed)-Either bad net code or majority of the servers being in EU or RU allows for ""hit"" shots to not really hit-Game is very grindy unless you buy a T4 premium vehicle + premium (I said forget it for tanks)The game has a lot of potential but theirs too many glaring issues such as balance to make it worth the time to play. Majority of new players wont see it untill they get a lot of hours in and I dont blame them. I thought the game was amazing at first too. (This was years ago)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As quite the veteran player, over 1500 hours at the time of writing.Don't get me wrong, i loved War Thunder, yes, loved, Gaijin (the company behind the game) made a couple of terrible mistakes lately.I play mostly air realistic, and sometimes ground realistic. And yes, it is still a fun game, but Gaijins BS is too much for a lot of people.1. They had a bad matchmaker, the community wanted it to get fixed, even proposed fixes, but Gaijin made it worse for a part of the available vehicles (the top of the tree) it was a huge failure, Gaijin calls it a succes and will implement it for all vehicles. (or they have already done,i haven't played it for a few days because of this)2. They refuse to listen to the community, see point 1 for an example. The forum topics that would get a lot of negative comments are moderated, your post first has to be aproved before it is posted on the forum.3. I don't know about this one, but they are going to implement gameworks into the new dagor 4.0 engine, i am sceptical, but the new engine looks promising nevertheless.4. Some flight models are incorrect, some ammo loadout are incorrect (ww2 tanks that get post war shells)Don't get me wrong, i still enjoy the game, but i would not invest any money in it, just because of this, if they fix it and show that Gaijin is a compentent game developer i would happily invest money in it, i think they deserve my money, look at how much of my time is in that game, without costing me a dime.I would love to see a competitor for War Thunder so they have a reason to listen to their community.It is a fun game, but don't invest any money in it now, only when they listen to the community!

												I have been playing this game for quite some time.  I had purchased the Sherman tank package in order to get access to early beta (which was only 2 nights a week and a time that I could not play).  I logged in recently to find I had a negative 2000 golden eagle balance and was notified that it was due to a bug on Gaijin's end.  I had not received the extra golden eagles but the system thought I did and removed it.  Gaijin's solution was to zero my balance and thus remove the 2000+ golden eagles that I had bought via steam.  I am not happy with the customer service on this and thus I cannot recommend this game for fear this could be a common situation in the future.Also in ground forces. There is a serious bias towards Russian equipment. It was good but not that good. BR system needs a complete overhaul.  The economy for ground forces is atrocious and an embarassment for the design team.  Very difficult to make a decent profit in a win let alone a loss.  The lockout for leaving a battle is a joke.  It makes sense in Arcade mode but in realistic or simulator you get one vehicle maybe two before the match is done.  Once gone (god forbid you down't spawn in a rock and have to bail) you have to wait a stupid amount of time for something you have no control over, or very little.  I had hopes but frankly the game has a long ways to go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my 1.37 review.http://i.gyazo.com/cc8c867e167736659a21271ae1160e5f.pngThis is the 1.39 review.http://i.gyazo.com/5b835eaacc8e4ac4d9a5eebd0429d5d9.pngThis is the patch 1.41 review. I've spent enough time to get an idea of the new additions and new mechanics that were introduced with this patch and I'll highlight them below. First thing to note is that Patch 1.41 is not as big of a patch as 1.37 and 1.39 were. In fact it was released under a month that 1.39 was out. I'll highlight the changes below.The biggest addition of patch 1.41 was the introduction of Ground Forces into the open beta phase for everybody. While this had a lot of hype built up and player numbers rose even breaking 100k the beta only introduced two countries, Germany and Russia. These countries don't even have fully fleshed out trees which I can understand but it makes me wonder when the other nations will get their Tank trees AND have them fully fleshed out. The gameplay of Tanks is rather interesting. You have a tank, you play on different sections of familar maps given the task of eliminating other tanks, capturing objectives or defending points. Tanks is excellent with the detail that Gaijin have placed into the game. Like planes every part of a tank reacts differently to how it will perform when hit. Your ammo can cook off or your tracks can get off. You do get the option to repair mid battle which is risky but useful. Something that is annoying however is the constant artillrry spam that all players do. Some realism aspects like armor thickness and certain shells not being able to penetrate is a great addition but doesn't bode well in the term of balance. Some reserve tanks are not competitive against even Tier 2 tanks as their shells can not pierce the armour. This is ignoring some tanks which are just unspeakably broken (KV-1).For the planes we had a few additions. Germany received two new Me-262 Jets, one placed on the way to the German Sabre, and other with a 50mm cannon placed in a separate destroyer line (the Me410 with the 50mm cannons). The British received more Spitfires bringing their total in the entire tech tree to 13. The Americans received two B25 variants, one with a 75mm cannon and the other with an impressive 12 .50 cal mg's. The Russians get a Mig with cannons with a BR that guarantees low tier clubbing and the crazy brother of the I-185. The M71 Etalon.The Japanese received a cockpit for the Ki45 line. (yes, just cockpits).These aren't the only changes, there were a massive amount of BR changes and these truly go to show how much Gaijin don't pay attention. Russian and American BR's went down while Germany and Japan skyrocketed. The high tier Japanese props have a higher BR than the Yak 15 and Yak 17 Jet. Granted those Jets are awful but that doesn't fare well for the fractured Japanese community. The Me-163 jumped back up into Mig and Sabre games after the amount of crying on the forums may have deafened Gaijin while the Mig 15 and Bis for Russia went down, the cannon Sabre went down whilst the German variants remain at 8.7. The msot controversial change was the P63 going from a 5.3 to a 4.0 Seal clubbing has never been so obvious. It leads to games all over the place. There is no balance, just pilot skill used to base the BR's which is a terrible decision as countries with large player bases have lots of data whilst countries with smaller playerbases have less data. It is why Japan are soaring high. Tier 2 A6M2 against Tier 4 La7 and P51? Clearly working as intended.It's hard to give an honest opinion about what I think about this patch. Some areas could really do with a fix. Japan could do with more content. The BR system needs to be on PLANE PERFORMANCE and not player performance to ensure more balance and the Tank mechanics really give more tuning. I'll recommend the game for the addition of Ground Forces but I will not recommend Patch 1.41.			",85,2,3,5,4,0,1

												War Thunder has been in a steady decline since ground forces went open beta.  Every successive patch has introduced changes and modifications to the game that make it worse, and Gaijin ignores and actively suppresses the suggestions of its playerbase.  Their moderators on the English-language forum are rude and corrupt at the best of times, their business practices are shady and they treat their players, the ones who support this formerly great game, like dirt.A heart 'not recommended.'

												Would be much better if the maps were actually fair to all countries.Basically, in real life US fighters weren't meant to be interceptors. They were made with large fuel tanks, sturdy airframes, engines optimized for high altitude, and machine guns. The reason: to escort bombers from long distances. In War Thunder, we instead see US planes thrown into an interceptor situation against planes which perform the role of intercepting extremely well (ones with light airframes, cannons, high climb rates, etc). The maps show an obvious advantage to planes designed for this role due to their size.  This results in people having to ""side climb"" to recreate the long journey the American fighters would take when escorting bombers. Problem is, you're usually the only person that does this, with the rest of your team either being bombers or fighters at low altitude that get picked off in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, making even the simplest mistake while BnZing an enemy leaves you vulnerable to their whole team and in a matter of seconds you'll have 20 cannon rounds in your fuselage. Why should I have to wait 10+ minutes just to get a shot at winning when other countries can get to altitude in a fraction of that time? And for some reason, naval and army planes are thrown together. I'm not whining about ""Russian Bias"" or how American planes suck. American planes don't suck. Actually, they're amazing for what they were made to do: ESCORTING BOMBERS over long distances. Not intercepting fighters. And if they were given that role in the game, they would be extremely formidable. As of now, unless you're with a squad of people climbing together, extremely good/lucky or going against a team of idiots, you're playing with a lost chance.Just to clarify I'm mainly talking about RB.

												Started playing Warthunder 1/1/14. At first it was entertaining but after 2 weeks of playing it lost it's appeal. I really shouldn't have to submit myself for hours upon hours of tutotials on youtube and reading message boards to understand the game let alone have success at it. I purchased a premium membership and nothing changed. Everytime I get shot down it's by a guy 2-3 tiers above me in a vastly superior plane. Matchmaking needs to be better (I.E tier 2 fly against other tier 2's) but it appears that's not of concern for Gaijin. Since I work and have some semblence of a life then apparently this is not the game for me since I require another three months of watching youtube video's and playing to even begin having success. There are dozens upon dozens of bad reviews regarding this game and all are centered around the 1.37 update which made me realize that it wasn't all my fault as to why I wasn't having success at this game. The comparisons to a ""hedge fund"" and ""ponzi scheme"" are accurate and I'm officially boycotting this game until these issues are fixed.The concept is great concerning the vintage WWII planes. Soundtrack and graphics are also appealing. Flying for 2 minutes then getting shot down by a higher level plan of which I stand no chance against......is not.I purchased the premium membership 3 days ago, I'm walking away from the game and Gaijin can keep the 2700 golden eagles I have on the account.

												At first I loved this game, it was fun, challenging and progression was slow but achievable... Far easier if you purchased in game currency of course.However, when they released patch 1.37 they ruined the game. Made it 4-5x harder to progress, devalued the in game currency so any prior purchases were essentially worthless... But the worst thing they did was alter the flight characteristics of some of the most popular aircraft to make then virtually unflyable... This was a game that was supposed to be balanced in terms of the aircraft/skill level of the players online. Instead you got dumped into games with players in far superior aircraft. It was like putting a Jet fighter up against a bi-plane.If you had a preference for Bombers as many people did... forget playing it anymore. Aircraft were basically crippled and rendered useless in battles.The they released patch 1.39 and I tried to update... forget it. They use bit torrent to spread the downloads amongst their players rather than provide a server for people to get it directly. The problem with this is that the download speeds are virtually non existant. People can turn of the sharing aspect and I suspect the majority do just that. I left the game attempting to update for 35hrs and had downloaed just 2% of the 5+GB update. At that rate it was going to take me weeks just to update the game.Gaijin's customer service is pathetic, offering no help what so ever... Their advice on the slow downloads was "" wait and it will finish"" I saw complaints deleted, people banned for asking simple questions.I removed the game and will not play it again.

												Little background, I have been playing this game pretty much from the beginning. I loved the time I put into the game but unfortunately am unable to get back into it due to the direction the game was heading and the loss of faith I had in the company. Positives:+ Amazing Graphics+ Runs Smooth+ Both tanks and planes feel amazing to drive and shoot really giving you immersive gameplay+ Free! (Technically)Negatives:- Funded by microtransactions (They need to make money some how but grinding take a very long time without spending money)- Ran by Gaijin..Personal Negative:- Frustrating gameplay (It's supposed to be realistic yes! Doesn't mean it doesn't get frustrating)- ATGM's don't fit into the game at all...- Bias towards a certain line of tanks...Anyways, I completely stopped playing after I was banned for a long period of time for an issue that was out of my hands. (I've spent $2k they banned me for like 20+ days over $40 or something like that) You can see that here:

												This game would be a good excuse for a game if it was in Alpha. the game is horribly un balanced. almost identical every time you play. facing the same enemies same maps etc matches for matches in a row.The small game breaking bugs such as shots not registering only to have the enemy turn and shoot you. Enemies shooting you in the track and having your engine explode etc.The fact that you can be one shotted from the entire map seconds after spawning and then be punished by not letting you play any of your vehicles for up to 10 minutes because you died early. The absolutely ridiculous research requirements. such as spare parts. basically making it impossible to play once your tank is hit.Terrible community. Team damage was disabled because of how many people shot their own team on spawn.instead of adding punishments and handicaps to their players they just turned off teamkilling.Lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game designers who do not listen to their community and only do what makes them money.

												Okay, where do i start with this game.. well once apon a blue moon you use to be able to play this game and it was enjoyable. but sadly this game has a SOOO many problems now.♥♥♥♥♥♥matchmaking, No joke it makes no sense an example is 1.0-1.3 tanks seeing 2.0-2.3 and sometimes even 2.7-the grinding is just too painful.-the community is by most parts trash. i see people who spout racism and or other harsh vulgar language never get punished. but if you criticize someones driving you'll get one warning and a 7 day chat ban.-People only play for themselves and not their team.-the game STILL has exploits/bugs people abuse. its rare but ive still seen it.-They tend to never punish people in clans, oh duh they bring in money and attention to the game.-people suicide bomb into the ground to kill a tank.-Realism is just as bad as arcade in terms of players.-You have to research Parts and the F.P.EThe list can go on forever.. this game i feel use to be enjoyable at one point. but as of recently its turned to pure trash. and most of what ive talked about have been things ive experienced and or have seen happen. i mean World of tanks use to be the top of the A-Game for awhile. but they had War thunder sprout up and they've been pulling themselves together. Now i don't play world of tanks either. but its looking abit more promising than this stinky♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game.So my point is.. if you want to play a game that will make you want to punch a hole through your screen, this is the perfect choice for that.

In Forza you might have a few races to get through before you unlock your next car. ♥♥♥♥ even in EVE Online it takes you less time to unlock a cruiser than it does for you to get one ♥♥♥♥ing plane on this game... In fact it would probably take you less time to go out into the real world and get your real Jet Aircraft Rating than it would take you to unlock Jets in this game. How ♥♥♥♥ed is that?So if i could fix it here's what i'd do.1/ All Tier one aircraft unlocked immediately and ready to fly2/ Research is like EVE Online, it's in real time say at the rate of 5000RP/Hr. You can queue up to 5 aircraft and once one is unlocked, the next in the queue automatically starts getting researched.3/No ♥♥♥♥ing elite tokens, you money grubbing ♥♥♥♥ers. If you want money just make us pay a fee for the game! A one off good 'ol fashioned payment of between $20-45 that i'm pretty sure everyone would be happy to pay, and then let us play your ♥♥♥♥ing game. It's a good game, we want to play it, but you're making it harder than it needs to be for us.			",22,3,1,5,3,0,8

												Warthunder is a beast all it's own.  At its heart, it is a very great game.  It's developed well, it looks pretty good and it offers a diverse take on the whole PvP plane or tank game.  It doesn't have stupid health bars or weird aiming mechanics, where you hit the enemy plane or tank takes a major role.  There are bugs, yes, some incredibly ridiculous, but they are usually fixed quickly.  Usually. Where Warthunder falls short isn't in the game itself.  It's not overly Pay 2 Win, you can unluck every vehicle by purely playing the game without paying a cent.  There are premium vehicles that you can pay for, but they are usually are reskins or one-off paper tanks that usually won't give much more of an advantage.  I say usually because the rocket tanks are incredibly over-powered, but they are also hella expensive.  I've only ever seen one in game.  Warthunder fails at community development.  It's community is fractured and diverse and its community managers are hostile and condescending.  Gaijin will not do a single solitary thing based on the voice of the community, no matter how hard the community will push to get something changed or added.  Gaijin bases all of its decisions on numbers, their own numbers, and are rarely wont to put any faith in their playerbase.  In fact, there are many times when they are openly hostile on their forums, placing the blame on players or entirely dismissing the voice of the community.  Their forum moderators are akin to the Gestapo or more appropriately the NKVD.  Any sort of negative opinion is immediately met with a ban and the comment deleted.  Petitions by the community are put up and vastly ignored.  Gaijin even pulled out its community managers from r/warthunder, probably their best oppurtunity to get feedback toward their game because of the upvote system,  and instead of listening they simply left. I want Warthunder to succeed, but until Gaijin want it to it never will. Also, I just use the direct launcher instead of Steam, which is why my number of hours played is so low.  I've been playing off and on for close to three years.			",30,1,3,5,7,0,9

												Patch 1.37 ruined the game for me.  I thought that matchmaking was sketchy enough with the old system of 20 tiers of planes you unlock through nation EXP.  Now you have five tiers that you unlock various planes by using other planes or some such thing.  But what that means for me is that I have planes that were tier 6 previously being pitted against tier 10 and higher planes in the previous patches.  I am getting killed in basically one hit all the time, and it makes me never want to play the game again.update as of 12/20/2015:Game still broken, matchmaking is absurd, since the Ground Forces came out I was really excited for a ""realistic"" tank combat game, however, there needs to be a balance between ""realism"" and fun.  Right now you can expect to get shot right out the spawn and then (if you aren't killed immediately) you spend the better part of a minute waiting to repair whatever got damaged.  I'm sorry if I don't find waiting very fun.  Not to mention the blatant pay-to-win style of ""premium"" vehicles...a sherman with a multi-shot rocket launcher on it?  a T34 with a 100mm cannon on it?			",160,18,2,14,20,0,7

												(As a side note, I ""play"" from the War Thunder launcher, not steam) I've been playing this game since before it came to steam, and back then, the game was fun and balanced, however, this is no longer the case. This game might as well be called Germans versus Russians since those two nations are the only ones worth your time. I find myself wondering why I'm playing half the time since most of the battles are getting into range of one of either the german's or russian's weapons and dying. On the other hand, playing as the germans or russians isn't very satsifying either since pretty much all you have to do is look at something to kill it. But if that's your thing like it is for all the other players in those nations, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I am writing this, War Thunder's ""most helpful"" reviews are almost all negative, as I am sure you have noticed. While I'm certain many of these reviewers' points have merit, I believe it is important to consider their viewpoint and that theirs might not be yours.By all appearances, the game is not fun anymore for people who have played it for thousands of hours and/or prefer Tier V (Highest tier / Most modern vehicles) realistic/simulator mode tank battles as non-Russian nations.As someone who has spent a couple hundred hours playing as Germany, U.S.A. and GB in up to T IV air arcade battles, and as Germany in up to T III tank arcade battles, I am here to tell you: This game is a lot of fun, I have encountered few balancing issues and fewer bugs, and I'm relatively sure I'll be playing another few hundred hours before I get bored of it and move on.If you are interested/curious, just install the game and try it for a few hours, it's f2p, after all. Due to the slow progression, I definitely recommend getting a premium account to speed things up a bit, if you end up liking the game. If you aren't stupid/rich enough to buy the ridiculously overpriced premium vehicles (that offer no real advantage apart from another progression speed boost), you will find War Thunder to be well worth the subscription cost.

												The Devs continue to ruin this game with their consistent, poorly-executed 'Patches'.They've turned what used to be a fast-paced, action-packed flight game into a tortuous grind to get new planes, and then more grind to max-out the features each plane has (engine power, guns, ammo/ordinance, etc.)The Mods are far too heavy-handed with their chat bans.  If you say a word they don't agree with, or talk about anything 'Other than' planes/the game itself, you stand a good chance of being muzzled for variable durations (at their whim and mood).Too many of the other players are either forced to be self-centered, greedy little psychopaths, or for whatever reason are just maladjusted human flotsam that choose to play against the 'Team', the objectives, or just cause grief and mayhem at every opportunity.The 'Game' itself, is really amazing. If you have all the time in the world and the patience of a Saint, you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it.For awhile.Good luck!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: October 6, 2016
												TL,DR: Very poor vehicle balance, heavy bias towards soviet vehicles in ground forces, double standards in selective realism features that tend to favour or disfavour certain nations.  Not Reccomended.I have been playing this game on and off since closed beta, if I remember correctly, and had high hopes for it. Not only it held a lot of promise gameplay-wise, but it also looked gorgeous, with great visual details to vehicles. While not a very big fun of ww2 airplanes, I awaited Ground Forces with anticipation, to become a more history focused and sim oriented version of world of tanks. I have been playing GF since closed beta and originally it was a real blast, especially simulation mode. And while game had a lot of problems back then, including balance, damage model, corridor maps and the like, the potential for a greatest tank game for ppl, that want something more deep and historically accurate,  was there. Unfortunately it was not meant to last. As a lot ppl noticed back then, and still do up to this day, game is heavily biased towards soviet vehicles, while german vehicles recieve disproportionate amount of hate from developers, and it only gets worse over the years. What was attempted to be excused as bugs, or overpenetration mechanics couple of years ago, nowadays became a norm, and it seems it was intended even back then, in gaijeen attempt to appease their main player base, which are russians, to slow a player decline from game. Just a few examples of disbalance and nonsense that happens virtually every battle:Balance issues:German tanks battlerating, which puts ww2 german tanks against post war tanks, and generally pits german tanks against opponents that were introduces much later in the war, thus virtually making all german tanks inferior to their opponents. What the point in tiger 1 100mm armor, when it has to fight late war tanks from 1944+ which can pen it from any range at any angle, while tiger keep getting ""no damage"" even from t34-85s relatively thin hull...Gaijin supposedly strives for realism, by adding armor coefficents for later german tanks, to simulate lover quality late war german armor, yet they ignore things like tank optics quality difference for example, which all ultimately plays in favour of soviet tanks. Another example of this is British solid AP shells whith which you virtually has to individually kill every crew member of enemy tank to destroy it, which translates into 5-6 shots to be able to destroy enemy tank, and i f its a soviet tank, then you can count on the fact that after your first shot, you will be one shotted by glorious soviet gun, unless ivan is too drunk and miss you.In realistic battles, where teams are being balanced by nations, germans loose 9 out of 10 battles, which speaks for itself.Most maps are made that way, that there are almost no long range engagements, like it used to be on old Prokhorovka and Mozdok maps, which again greatly plays in favour of soviet vehicles, which are more close combat orientated.Soviet glorious AP shells that 8 out of 10 times oneshot your tank by killing all the crew and detonating ammo racks, while it takes several similar shells to take out soviet tank, which is illogical considering how cramped soviet tanks were on inside.If soviet glorious AP shell did not one-shot you, then it will somehow crit gunner, driver, and your gun at the same time, this happens 99 hits out of 100, where german tank manages to survive the first shot.Nonsense that you will encounter almost every battles.Outsmarting and flanking enemy t34 on your Pz4 F2, making a sideshot in a hull, only to see ""no damage"", while guy notice you only after that, casually turns his gun and oneshots you without much offeort for aiming...Outsmarting and outflanking enemy t34 with your tiger 1, shooting twice from short range at engine compartment TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO OVERPENETRATION (as fanboys and gaijin like to claim) - after second shot with no damage, enemy finally spots that simething wrong, and drives away.... catching him 20 seconds later, direct hull shot along the tank hull axis, no damage, while he shoots back on the move and oneshots your tiger.... just great, so much about skill, but seems not a requirment for soviet tankers.This list can go on and on to eternity, because as I said, nonsense like this happens almost every battle.It is really sad to see a game with such great potential turning into♥♥♥♥♥♥by its own devs, trying to appease a part of community, so school boys and always drunk Ivans and Nikolays can have their fun at expense of other players, especially german tankers if we take realistic battles national balance into account. While I understand their desire to keep players in game, I think favouring one part of the playerbase over the rest is a bad call in a long run, and only need leads to game stagnation at best. So all in all, I cant reccomend this game in its current state, which seems to be only deteriorating over time, and unlikely to get any better. I will be cheking this game every half year or so, to see if there are any positive changes in game mechanics and balance, and might change this review in the future, but for now - NOT RECOMMENDED.

												After a 3 years abusive relationship, coupled with a Stockholm Syndrome, two keyboards and 3 expensive gaming mice destroyed, it's time to say goodbye to this game. I've started playing it on the promise that it would be a more realistic tank game than World of Tanks. For a while, it almost was. I've started playing planes on the promise that I would either have fun, or just get better at my normal flying. Again, for a time, it was. But that game is long dead. We trusted it. We trusted its flaws. We expected things to improve. Instead, we were flooded with new broken vehicles. Communication through the forum is like speaking to a wall. Not even the simplest improvements, not even the simplest suggestions were implemented over the years. Imagine a great looking car that stabs you every time you turn the engine on. To make it perfect, you just remove the problem. But Gaijin just releases a new car, that also stabs you. And then another one. It is so frustrating to be so close to a gret game, and yet not having any fun. Yes, it's free, but I'd rather I'd payed for a bit of quality. Fortunately, it can no longer hold the VR players hostage with its one year old VR support. I've found better. And I'm leaving.			",27,3,2,1,8,1,1

												I have played this game to its fullest extent. I have top tier vehicles in every nation in every game mode, i.e. Tanks and Aircraft. I will say that this game is a great game, everything is quite balanced up to tier III. There the BR system has its flaws and is supposed to be reworked soon. Getting to tier III without paying isn't too big of a deal, playing it every so oftern you can get to tier III, however if you wish to have the F-86F or MiG-15bis, you will have to put in quite a bit of time, or money (Tis the nature of F2P games). If you wish to have really fun games without the super grind, play a lot of tier III and just enjoy your time. This game has its flaws, and I hope Gaijin will address these soon(:			",41,2,3,4,10,0,3

Planes are overpowered (Tier 3 against Tier 1 and 2)7. Fun for the first ten hours, then it gets pretty bland. 8. Wanna play simulation battles? Good luck finding one. There is hope...1. Simulation is engaging, feels realistic. 2. The overall mechanics of the game are pretty solid. 3. It can be fun. Emphasis on *can*. However, as it stands now, I'm putting the game aside. I look forward to future updates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am fed up with the complaints commonly levied against this game. Firstly there is no Russian or Geman bias, there are only bad players. Am i saying all of the vehicles are ballenced, no way; never the less the reason people are strugiling is because people refuse to follow the meta game and try and use vehicles that have little to no use in most situations. I have to atribute this to people going for iconic vehicles and expecting them to win automaticly, thats not how balance works. The classic example is the Tiger people want it to be op because thats what it was like in real life, well its not real life crewmembers can fix cannon breaches in the field, so why should Tigers fight against early t34's. Onto the other main complaint, with the amount of hours i have in the game which is greater than my steam hours (used to play on the launcher) i have seen only 1 definate hacker ever, people with 50 hours can shut up about it being full of Russian hackers.Finaly the game is not pay to win baring a couple of examples of premiums (the XP-55 Ascender and the T-29  are the ones which come to mind) which even being very good vehicles and the best at their BR they are not good enough to carry every game, and with regards to the T-29 its only a issue as German teams are nutoriously bad because people pick them as their first tree to get the lepard ""the best tank in the game"" and there for have no experience playing high teir. However bushes remain to be BS but they dont affect the gameplay 99% of the timeEnough whining at why all the other reviews are bad.Positives:great looking game.amazing models.fun gameplay (when not enraged).lots of content .high skill cap.etc.Negatives:toxic comunity.bad ground forces map design.repair costs -.-not getting parts tracks and fpe as standard.... not cool.beyond that its disapointing the metta does not allow all vehicles to be competative but that is understandable.Very finally tips for new players.dont get a T4 premium untill you can resurch T4's.go through forums to see if the vehicle is good and your play style.Run down of the nations for new players:America Aviation- the planes are good, but for more advanced players as the time to kill is greater with 50cals.America Army- to be avoided at  all costs as your first nation. no armour medeocre guns, its hard.German Aviation- very strong easy to fly at low teirs but gets more chalenging at higher teirs but a higly recomended starting nation.German Army- I found low teirs very boring but there is nothing wrong with them beyond being repatative. at high teirs they are obviously one of the best nations, but the teams are auful. If you want to go for the Germans please mother of god learn weak spots your guns are not infalable.Russian Aviation- very fun at low teirs but soon gets repetative but has a high skill cap, i never enjoyed the Russians but their is nothing persay wrong with them.Russian Army- the best staring tank nation hands down the tanks are fun and easy to use, at high teirs they reamin compatative and fun.British Aviation- personaly my favorate planes in the game but they can be dificult at low teirs with the low ammo count so you need triger dicipline. At high teirs they are a joy and teams work well together. Highly recomended (apart from bombers)British Army- dont touch it its auful until T4 its a massive grind.Japanese Aviation- This is the one nations planes i have not touched extensivly, but i know they are very good but with no survivability dont touch as your first nation.Japanese Tanks- see british tanks but worse.If you have goten this far thank you. I appoligise for any spelling or grammar mistakes I am writing this late at night.In game name Squishy_Manatee.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is by far the best World War 2 simulator game i have  played, tho it does not cover infantry battle, it does cover aviation, it will soon cover tanks, and in the future, naval battles.They try to make a historically correct game and base their planes on reports and blueprints to make them opperate as much alike the real planes (soon to be tanks and ships in the future) as possible. Hosting events, such as real battles, like the battle of Berlin, the assault on Iwo Jima and many other battles, they deliver what an enthusiast is looking for.They also make sure there is something for everyone, with the ""arcade battles"" mode, where they put planes of any nation (USA, Nazi Germany, USSR, GB and Japan) with the ""some-what"" same preformance in a 15v15 battle anywhere on the globe, from Guam to Stalingrad.Gameplay handle like a dream, the game is action packed beyond what you can ask from a F2P (Free to play) and there is as i mentioned before, something for everyone, if you want to dogfight, or level a military encampment to the ground with a well placed 1000kg (2000lb) bomb, or carpetbomb a convoy, even sink a battleship with a torpedo, it is right here for you.The game preformes suprisingly well on even a low-grade PC, with a well optimised engine and good distance rendering, you can expect high fps (frames per second) almost no matter if you are playing on low or high graphics settings (depending on your PC hardware ofcourse), eigther you are flying at high or low altitude. I am running at 120 fps+ when i play the game at the highest graphicalsettings and i love the action the game delivers. 10/10			",211,30,12,29,30,2,63

												Gaijin are a bunch of idoits. Every single patch brings with it a sh*t storm of problems and introduces new content that noone wants or ever asked for. Prime examples are the Yak 30 and the Tu-4 and ATGMs and float planes that have no place in the meta of the game. I've been playing from the launch of this game, and it has been a rollercoaster ride of fun, it runs fast on my pc, and there are no other flight games quite like it. Sadly, Gaijin are a bunch of idiots. They ruin the game by being abusive to their community, and displaying downright abhorent behavior toward their content creators. Russian bias is existant, but not as bad as it used to be, The Russians have the best jet and best tank, but all the midteir stuff is fine. The game has become more and more grindy has the years have gone by, and grinding out a tank is a month long process for me. The meta of the game makes no sence. You are rewarded more for killing other players, but for some reason that has almost no corrilation to winning the game. Also, a tutorial would not go amiss, as new players typically have no idea how basic game mechanics work, even at high teirs there are people that don't understand how to win a game or shoot down planes, or fight in general. Perhaps most annoying however is the fact that the CEO of Gaijin seems to think that abusing YouTube copyright rules are a solution to a very small group of hackers. There are bigger fish for Gaijin to fry, and hackers should be the least of the companies concerns at the moment. To sum up, the game is spectacular, it looks great, and its fun to fly and drive World War Two machines and fly with friends. However, I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that Gaijin are a bunch of idiots and they seem to be uninterested in their community and the state of their game. Don't start playing, you'll be lured in by the first few battles, then you find yourself at odds with Gaijin, and you'll care to much to stop playing, but hate every time you get on to get your spin to fly a few. I still have a glimmer of hope that Gaijin will pull their heads out of their asses and make this game live up to it's potential, and thats the only reason I play still..... What a shame			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get this over with.I've been playing this cobbled together monstrosity since 1.25, since Gajin has continued to add content including new models of planes and tanks, maps, game-modes, and an entire new portion of the game; Ground Forces. Great right? The problem here is, the base of this game is an complete and utter wreck, while most online games suffer from poorly implented band-aids, this game could use a few. The same problems that were apparent in 1.25 are still there, with each patch and addition of new content only adding more and more. At this point the game is standing on a poorly contructed foundation with a number of medicore ""balances"" only further eating away at it. The BR system that was supposed to be the messiah for all imbalances in the game when introduced has at best stayed in the same cluster♥♥♥♥ as it was in when introduced, and at worst has only further became ♥♥♥♥ed with more and more vehicles being thrown into it. The few times devoplers actually acknowledge a problem, we are given the same answers we were given two ♥♥♥♥ing years ago, ""We're working on it"". To the people who still think betas for games are actually for fixing and helping devolpment, let alone those who try to use this games excuse for one as a way to defend it from criticism, wake up. This game is going into it's third year of open beta, they've had ample time to fix plenty of these problems and yet still here they remain. I want this game to be good, there is a real lack of it's type out there, but it's never going to find that success like WoT did until they go back and wade through their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to fix the mistakes they made years ago.TL;DRThis game has been a mess for a long time and has only gotten worse. Devs refuse to fix core elements and would rather implement new unbalanced premium vehicles than actually go and fix them.			",113,4,1,13,27,0,41

												War Thunder is an interesting beast.  Its closest competitors are both flight sims and the super-arcadey World of Tanks/Warplanes, with WT filling a niche in the center.  It is for that reason that I enjoy it so much.  However, the ""base"" game mode is the Arcade difficulty, which is where Gaijin is clearly targetting.  A good majority of the game's balance is based around Arcade, and the most interesting mechanics abound there.  Realistic is where the most involved players tend to congregate, however, and the split between developer and fan focus creates some ""interesting"" dynamics in balance and gameplay.  And by interesting I mean horrible.  Though there are certain aspects of the game that *are* balanced, there are others that have gone from horrendously overpowered to nearly useless in successive patches.  Most notably, bombers such as the B-17 were previously unstoppable death machines in all game modes, however as of patch 1.43 they have become almost paper in Realistic.  Though marginally more effective in Arcade (as with many changes this points toward developer focus) they are no longer the research/currency printing machines they once were.  Of course, even with these issues, I have almost 600 hours in the game.  How, if it's so poorly balanced?  Well, simply, it's fun.  WoT is much more arcadey and has very different mechanics than WT's ground forces, and I like the higher-risk feel of WT's more ""realistic"" damage modeling.  The replacement of WoT/WoWP's hp system with internally modeled components and armor penetration (which is obfuscated in the other games) makes it feel like you get more information and feedback.  The planes feel easier to control.  You can one-shot people if you're skilled enough.  There are dozens of vehicles to unlock and very few of them are pre-war no-name biplanes or tanks.  The graphics engine is very very pretty.I honestly don't know.  I love the game, but also hate it.  And here I am logging in again.			",151,16,1,17,6,0,16

												I Love this game but they have screwed it up so much it aint funny. DO NOT spend a dime on it untill it comes out of beata. Changed the whole tiering system so now Me262 fight MIG 15 all the time, no German 109 does not over heat, Russian plaes that were made in 1948 are in the same tier as USA, BRIT, JAPAN, 1943 year of ranking and I could go on. Game had all the hope you could possibly want. Finally a game that can burry that horrible thing called World Of Tanks. But, nahh, they went from a good company to ripping off the customer. Planes you buy get nerfed ( w/real money ) they nerfed the whole pay out system and made it almost impossible to play. ANd yes I have premium. A year of it to be honest. I never end up with more deaths then kills every match. Yet I make Jack crap in RP. You make less in which was once called historical battle because you use to fight nation VS natnion but now they call it real battles or some BS. Play it but don't spend a dime on it, Their Russians, and act like it. Bias to the hilt. Stalin was GOD, USA and all EU players are treated like garbage. So bad, that if you buy gold, its the same. No conversion between Dollars, pounds, and the Euro. But if your in mother Russia they do the conversion on that pathetic money of theires. The Rubble.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I play American and British planes and tanks, and find that the planes are competitive. The tanks are a different story altogether. The tanks seem to alternate between ""clubbing"" and being ""nerfed"". One day I'll get kills with, for example, an M10, the next game I'm bouncing shots all over the place, getting hits but no kills. As it stands, American tanks seem to exist to pad the scores of Russian and German tank players, especially Russian. Each updates seems to introduce a new nerf on the tanks I play. You never know what you'll get. American tanks are by far the easiest tanks to kill, especially between rank 5.0 to 7.3.  They have no chance against an IS-3 or T54 1949. It also seems like anyone recommending this game hasn't played it very much compared to those of us who have 700 plus hours, who seem to generally not recommend it. Or maybe they are just playing Russian tanks. I would have recommended it in the beginning, too. The game is as addictive as crack, and like crack, it will cause you to waste a lot of your life for no reward, other than frustration.			",2,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update - 12/9/16Still just as awful, player count dwindling so it isnt just me. Just a game you want to love but Russian developers make that hard with their inexperince and their Russian-Theiving hands. Would be better if the devs sell to another team. But Russians are stupid,just a fact of life.Update - 5/19/16Why play Medium-High or Ultra when you can play Ultra-Low to get a compeditive edge?Cheats Confirmed (Video Proof on youtube) Go play IL2:BoS or BoM or DCS instead. 60$ is worth it.Tired of losing with Realistic Soviet-Era Machinery in other games? Look no further! WarThunder has Buffed,Unrealistic Soviet-era Tanks and Planes that put to shame other,Suprior nations easily.Don't think its true? Find a player who says ""There is no Soviet Bias"" and look at his profile and Take a Gander at his most played/MostKills/MostPoints of tank, and look at the drop off. Still dont belive me? Find as many players as you can to do the little test to! So what're you waiting for?! Unless you wanted a game that had its logic based off facts not Propoganda or Her'sey, WEll then Ide suggest picking up IL2:BoS or DCS: BF109k4 , FW190 Dora or the P51D Mustang.

												Personally i would not recommend starting to play this game in the current state it is in and you must be willing to buy premium if you want to stay sane when you get to late tiers oh and dont bother getting to late tiers in tanks or planes because its just not fun.- Tank matchmaking sucks, lets match a low tier 4 against top tier 5's because thats a good idea, i feel sorry for anyone who is currently trying to research tier 4 tanks, as soon as you get their you will just be matched against tier 5 where you can literally do nothing but run and pray you dont get rekt by one of the many T54's. I was researching the Maus but gave up in the end and just boosted my way there because of the endless slaughter of being matched against stuff i can even pen. You want to have fun in tanks, play in tier 3 and lower. - Planes are similar, i mean we've all had that moment when we just want to kill ourselfs when we get rekt by that 3.7 FW which is placed in tier 2 (Because Logic) which will ruin anything in its path. I mainly play Britian planes and i never seem to actually be killed by anything but a Yak, Lag, FW or BF. I think you stand more of a chance in planes being match against high tier planes because theyre all made out of paper, yes they can out run you but atleast you still stand a chance unlike tanks. I just wish planes actually had some more good maps, they're all so repetitive, boring and all so open.- Taking away the 2x for your first battle at first seemed like a good idea with it being replaced with the daily rewards. You would be wrong in thinking the more days you play the better stuff you would get, in fact you're actually better off just playing it every other day. For example im on the 148th day now and ive just got a 10% silver lions boost, im so glad i've been loyal to the game for this long so i can get rewarded like this! They should start adding big golden eagle drops when you get past 100 days, i mean there is literally nothing that makes me want to continue this streak apart from my head telling me that there might yet be something good.- This game is also now turning p2w with all these rocket tanks they are bringing out as premium tanks and then placing them in tier 2. So no overall i don't think people should start playing this game unless you want to make yourself go insane or until the devs actually listen and fix this ♥♥♥♥ed up game.Edit - Just hit my 149th day and got 4 silver lion boosts of and a silver lion wager, 10/10 would waste life away again.

												I dont want to be so Offensive, but please understand me coorectly. Game itself its fine, I was, and I am quite happy with the game, but Reasons why I dont recomend it are too much.A) Gaijin is Lying us and they made great summer sale FRAUD to all of us, when they raised nominal prices. Ofcourse, that Sale off was Fraud, and its also confirmed by sale shops which are marking prices for long time...B) Gaijin told, that cheating is not possible in their game... Actually few replays was made, ""usage of wallhacks and aimbots"" and gain was Forcing all those peapole to stop streaming those replays... By their behaviour, is comunity paralysed, and I am really worried about playing this game furher.C) It is heavy grind game... Forget to play for highets tier tanks or planes... You will have not enough time for plaing with all those corupted mechanics by cheaters which officialy dont exist as Gaijin telling. If you want tanks for money, personaly I dont see any problem with that (many working players have no time for playing day by day over and over to grind favourite tank), be prepared for spending houndreds of Euros!! Yes, thats right... This is GREEDiest game ever made on the world.. Even planetside2 is less controversial.D) Bias.... And yes, after 2yers of playing this game I agree, There is russian bias.... T34 Tanks are really ""hidden coded"" bugged, same as more obvious vehicle, which is Airplayne calles JAK3 etc etc etc..... There were only few JAK fighetrs which was able to fly higher than 3km , but in this game they are best boom and zoomers  with incredible High speed (better than spitfires :-D LOL....I am done with this game.

												This game went from one of the best games I've ever played to being the absolute worst I've ever played since I started playing it in 2011.I've racked up more hours in it than Steam says I have, because you're stupid if you think this game didn't exist before it was on Steam.The devs are greedy, do not care about the playerbase (only their wallets), continually introduce terrible features into the game despite overwhelmingly negative reactions to them, don't know how to balance anything if their lives depended upon it, silence people who have bad things to say about the game, pay people to give good reviews, and as is probably obvious now... steal from the players by making them overpay in order to get things.The players are often toxic, brainless, arrogant, and all around jerks. I'm all for banter, but when people start attacking each other personally... that's an issue.If you want to have any hope of progressing past tier 3, you almost HAVE to buy a premium account unless you are a God (news flash; you're not). Even then, this game is a tedious, un-fun grindfest. Rewards are extremely low, no matter how well you perform in a match, compared to the research price and credit cost of vehicles.The battle rating system is just... broken. Almost nothing is rated properly. The game has a tendency of stacking teams as well. In other words one team is almost all higher battle ratings than the other. Couple this with the fact that many players lack a certain thing called ""Common Sense."" Then add the fact that the one team almost always has one (usually two) full squads of 4 players in a clan on Teamspeak/Vent/Skype/etc. and the other does not.When you add those together, you're basically playing Defeat Simulator 2014 (2014 because that's when battle ratings were introduced).It's just... not fun.I don't recommend playing this game unless you want to give yourself a reason to just end it all... well. When it comes to tanks anyway.The planes (minus jets. Jets are miserable) are ♥♥♥♥ing great. When it comes to the planes, it's ridiculously difficult to not have fun.			",242,11,6,31,22,3,40

 War Thunder  is a game that allows you to command planes, tanks (or other ground vehicles like trucks), and eventually naval vessels in PvP and PvE matches.The selection of vehicles you have range from pre WW2 (usually around the time of the Spanish Civil War) all the way up to the Korean War, and the nations that these vehicles can be selected from include the USA, Germany, USSR, Britain, and Japan (at the moment Japan only has aircraft, but will soon get tanks and will get naval vessels like the other nations too). There could possibly be more nations added in the future, but not much info has been provided on that. Additional vehicles are regularly added for the existing nations.The game has three realism levels you can choose to play in matches, these are  Arcade,   Realistic,  and  Simulator.  Arcade Battles  are the most popular, enemy nametags appear when in your line of sight, mobility characteristics are simpler so vehicles handle better, for aircraft a circle appears over a targeted enemy to help you lead your shots and for ground vehicles a colored marker appears when you're aiming at an enemy, with the three different colors (green/yellow/red) indicating whether or not the shot will penetrate.  Realistic Battles  has realistic mobility characteristics (though not at the same level of simulator mode), limited markers (nametags still appear, but the lead circle and the colored marker are gone), and realistic team matchups (you won't see all five of the nations on the same team like in arcade mode).  Simulator mode  does what realism mode does, but takes it up to eleven. You can only view your plane from inside the cockpit (some of the cockpit interiors aren't out yet, but you still get some kind of first-person view nonetheless) and for tanks you can only view the battle from above the turret (like if the tank commander were to open up the hatch to better survey the battlefield).The PvP portion of the game has you fight in teams to accomplish various objectives in a match.Aircraft will usually just destroy ground targets (generally the role of attackers/bombers) and destroy enemy planes (generally the role of fighters/interceptors/etc) in the common  Ground Strike  mode. There are also the game modes  Domination  (which involves landing on air fields to capture them) and  Air Domination  (where your team has to have the majority of planes in an air capture zone) The more realistic game modes tend to have better objectives, like the attacking side is helping an AI ground forces assault while the defending team trying to stop them.Tank variety in objective types isn't much better, which are usually just capture and hold points on the map. This is disappointing considering the many different kinds of ground vehicles you can use like heavy/medium/light tanks, SPAA, armored trucks... regular trucks with mounted machine guns  USSR plz . The realistic modes objectives don't change much for ground forces, but you can use your own planes and fight with ground forces at the same time.The PvE portion of the game can be done solo or with friends, at the moment you can only use aircraft to experience this content. The PvE content includes  Single Missions  where you control one type of plane and try to accomplish the given objective,  Dynamic Campaign  where you have a campaign map and fight several battles to conquer the whole map, and  Historical Battles  which you have to buy with the Steam Pack or in-game, which only seems to be a bunch of missions with voice acting and cutscenes added. Though there doesn't seem to be much of a point to doing these PvE activities because they don't provide much of a reward, which brings me to my biggest gripe with this game, the grind.This game is very grind heavy, especially if you decide to play without the premium subscription. If you really want to try out the jets you're going to need to sink in a lot of hours into this game.But I can kinda deal with that because this game is actually very fun to play. All of the vehicles are very well designed, while it may be challenging to play some vehicles if you keep practicing and make an active effort to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your vehicle and the vehicle you're facing will be what decides the outcome of a fight.The game isn't P2W either (well, I guess that depends on what your definition of P2W is), most of the stuff you can buy are cosmetics, or speeding up game progression. The only thing that might be questionable is that you can use money to level up your crew, which improves the performance of your vehicle, but if you're willing to grind it out you can also max out your crew.While this games combat is much more realistic compared to most games (in my opinion) it isn't the absolute best. If you want that go for DCS World.If you decide to play this I would recommend that you just play which ever nation looks interesting to start off with and go from there. Don't try to rush to the end game because it isn't that great. If you decide to stick around try to find a group of players to play with, and maybe you could end up playing in tournaments. Just try to have fun in the end.This review ended up being much longer than I expected.			",231,36,5,42,40,1,73

												The game is great. It kept my interest for many years. Had some great ideas to start. So much so  that I've put quite a bit of money into this game aswell. Having enjoyed it a lot.But in recent years, Gaijin has gone down the pan. They're not a good company. They censor negative views on the forums, regardless if they're non-trolls or non-offensive. They don't want your views if they're negative.They do not listen to community feedback. Overpowered planes in your battle-rating? Until their statistics (Which they never release) say it's OP, nothing will be done about it.Russian tanks get ammunition that they never used in WW2. But they have it, because reasons. Gaijin claims to be more historically accurate than WoT. Ok.There's a whole load of issues when it comes to their BR system. It's been discussed to death, you can find it if you search for it.Gaijin has also in a recent poll, where someone exposed hackers. Pointing them out or something. Their poll was either you let them do copyright strikes against youtubers, or they'll ruin realistic battles. Abusing copyright law to censor. Nice one Gaijin.They're not a nice company. They'll get no more recommendations from me.If you still enjoy the game, good for you. But I no longer want to support a company like this.I touch on Gaijin as a company a lot in this review, but it has a lot of negative effects on the game aswell. Like no community feedback being taken seriously, if at all. Not even when polls have overwhelming majority voting for a good idea that people want.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game started out as a very fun, exciting game which had you leaning on the edge of your seat while playing. But now that they've patched and updated several more times, it has lost its fun factor, due to the creators having made the game extremely difficult to proceed (levels etc) without paying money. I started playing while they  still had levelled planes and such, and that was when you could buy the planes without research points (which now you have to buy with real money) and so you're stuck playing untill you have enough research points to buy ONE plane... ONE! You'd think that you could buy two or maybe three, but when you play a battle, your battle points go towards a single plane which is unlocked eventually after about six successful battles. So if you get this game and think you're going to coast through to the top level, be prepared to buy a premium account and dish out the money to get there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was really nice before patch 1.37, but it still had some bad aspects before that patch, first of all, the devs are russians...nothing wrong with their nationality but  i mean you really notice they are russians, they are totally pro-russian, everything russian is just OP in this game while in real life russian airforce was trash having tons of casualties hell there were even battles where 30 german planes destroyed 400 russian planes (air skirmish before battle of kursk), but lets forget about the Russian OP part, it was never p2w until patch 1.37, now it takes ages just to unlock ONE single plane, before that you could unlock an entire line of planes and buy them if you had the money, well doesnt sound that p2w yet, but here it comes: every game you get some exp and additional exp that can be bought with goldeneagles, so if you pay you can just unlock most planes very early while others will probably never be able to unlock most planes except if they play 8hours a daily per week for 2 years ... another thing that makes me mad are the german planes, most of them are just garbage, i wonder how the real german planes could destroy 10x more planes than the russians if they had such bad planes... the worst thing is ww2 german jets vs korea war jets, i thought this was a ww2 game ! so you reach the legendary german jets just to fight the 10-20 years newer korea war jets ?? the devs tried to fix that problem giving the germans the EXACTLY same planes as russians and americans of the korea war... so i think everyone will be excited to reach the end game just to see that every nation will have the exact same plane without any differences and the so called ww2 game will be a mix of korea war and ww2 or a pure clone wars.

The latest update was a slap in the face to the playerbase, they implemented a new matchmaking system that had gotten an overwhelming amout of negative feedback when first proposed a month ago, yet still put it through, effectively ruining the latter part of the game as a whole. It's no longer fun or fair to play, because top tier vehicles are fighting vastly inferior aircraft for the sake of lower qeue times.2/10, stay away until they fix the ♥♥♥♥ing game.

												Firstly, Russian equipment is OP, and to quote another review ""Recently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…""Second, if you don't throw money at it to quickly upgrade your crews for any vehicle, you will be one shot every time you get in one. Flying a heavy bomber? Doesn't matter, one bust of machine gun from a I-16 and you have no wings. Driving a tank? Doesn't matter, someone will 1-shot you across the map with a Russian tank.

												I have a love/hate relationship with this game. Although, it is free! ... -ish.Being an old Starfox veteran, I got on well with the arcadey action in the early game, out-manoeuvring enemies and chopping their wings off with the target-leading system. Each nation has a different set of planes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, although these don't matter too much at this early stage. Needless to say, the bi-plane stage was great fun.Then, gradually, I progressed into the mid-war era of aircraft. This was fun, too, for a while. But then I started to notice a change in the play style of my team mates and my opponents. Instead of rolling away from each other to engage in a dogfight, my opponents would just fly straight towards my plane guns-blazing, then plough straight through me like a battering ram, killing both of us with no points scored either side. Get used to these head-on collisions. They happen a lot. And not just with enemies. Sometimes, you'll be chasing a plane, only to find that a cloud of friendly players has formed around you, fixated on the same target, trying to nab the kill before you do. Because of this tunnel-vision, eventually a team-mate will collide with you, then call you a 'F**KING RAMMER N00B' for your trouble. Lovely.My main problem with this outcome is that there is very little penalty to prevent it on either side. So the conflict just develops into a war of attrition - to see which side has bought the most planes to aimlessly throw into the meat-grinder.Alternatively, you'll get locked in a dogfight with a superior plane (usually a spitfire, with its better turning circle) and no friends will be around to get it off your tail, because 10 of them will be chasing 1 bomber ... and crashing into each other ... and yelling expletives in the chat box.I get the impression that the game wants me to spend money to buy super upgrades for my planes to make them pointlessly unbeatable, like in World of Tanks, or create a squadron of other people who enjoy getting rammed by their team mates. However, my reviewing system is based off the capacity enjoy a game even if you're a friendless hobo. So, if you're looking for some quick arcade dogfighting action, this game is one for you. However, if you're a fan of aviation looking for a dedicated team-based stress buster, you'll find this game utterly infuriating.They will eventually add tanks and ships into the mix, but until then, I'm not convinced.Sorry, Warthunder. You only get 4/10 golden badger eggs. :(			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignore the hours played, it's closer to 1000 but Steam decided not to count them when I started launching the game without itWhat's to say really? The game was rife with potential but is constantly re-broken with every patch. The developers are really trying, but unfortunately have no way to properly communicate with the community, so they end up ""fixing"" what isn't broken and breaking further what's already irrepairably damaged.The management, the forum moderators, and everyone else involved with community-to-developer relations has not a bloody clue as to what they're doing. Community asks for bug fixes and flight model updates for a certain aircraft? Gaijin ignores that aircraft. Community asks for repair costs for a certain nation to fall in line with the rest? Gaijin doubles the repair costs for that nation.And just don't even try to criticize them in any way. The entire management team can't take a shred of criticism, and pretends the community is out to get them, all the while actively antagonizing the community and ignoring their requests. Forum posts regarding poor balancing or unhistorical performance are met with smug, arrogant condescension.... IF they aren't flat out removed.You want to play an arcade flight game? World of Warplanes (never thought I'd say that)You want a simulator? IL2, DCS, the list goes on to a billion.And did I mention this game is free? It's free..... and I still wouldn't recommend a download. The company involved has spurned all support of the game. They deserve to watch their game crumble, but either way will end up blaming the ""toxic"" community they bred.3/10 - Disappointing beyond all measure, imbalanced and poorly managed beyond all comprehension. Run by completely oblivious, close minded fools. Would have recommended 3 months ago, can't even suggest a trail run now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played since closed Beta and have held on to hope for improvements all that time, not to mention over 3 years waiting for naval aspect/world war.While a few things have been changed for the better in that time, most has been taken in the opposite direction.Like so many dev groups, these guys scoff at players ideas and suggestions.  People have begged for some of the same things for years now. They made several changes to the MM system and got slammed in feedback by players.  They created so much imbalance in their battle rating system (br)  they lost 80% of the players that were in the game for 2 years after launch...which is why they came to Steam for all the exposure.  Good, ever-devolping games draw more players than they lose over time.  This game loses players 2:1 over how fast new players join.  No matter how many people left and/or complained, they reinforced the system instead of reversing it.  The more players they lose, the more they adjust the system creating more imbalance.  The more they adjust the system, the more players they lose...they put themselves in a catch 22 they could easily get themselves out of, but that would mean admitting their vision of what the gameplay should be isn't up to snuff and the players have a better idea of how the game should work than the devs who openly admit they don't play their own game...Allow me to re-iterate...they openly admit they don't play their own game and make all changes based on metrics - and then get upset and make threats to some players  that publicly respond with negativity to the changes...ALL the people I've met and enjoyed flying with in the game over these years have left.  Only a handful ever came back to check up...none stayed.Gaijin has taken to censoring bad press and reviews around the web where search providers will comply including the banning of players accounts that have been linked to the reviews.  They push threats of copyright infiringement on players for creating youtube vids of the game if they make negative comments towards any aspect of it, but never hassle those uploaders that say only positive things.  This was the proverbial straw for me.  They won't fix it, and they bully people worldwide for complaining about it.  I lost 2 friends I had since the beta stage to censorship.  They posted a video showing new changes some time back...they commented negativley but in a professional and tactful way.  Both had their accounts banned after years of playing and for them, thousands of dollars spent each over that time.  Lost it all for voicing their opinion on a consumer-driven product...that's about as low as a company can go imo.I've never been threatened myself or had my account banned for commenting, but I've never posted with my game name to reddit or ever posted any videos of my play.  I have however seen for myself the emails Gaijin sent to people and the emails from search engines and youtube advising a players content was removed due to copyright violations by request from GJ due to negative commentary in said video.I'm not going to dicuss it on the forums, respomd with feedback, or complain anymore myself.  I'm done...no matter what they change and what they add, if they realize their end goal for the game before it dies completely, if hell freezes over, if they bury me to my neck in sand in the desert sun, pour honey on me and leave me for the ants, I'll not be back.I'll admit that fun can still be found once every few matches, but most are nothing more than free for alls and even the sim battles now have yolo players.  The degredation of gameplay is immesuarable.  Want a crash and burn game that offers a good chance of winning to a yolo team?  All they have to do is run russian planes and tanks and they'll win more often than not.  I've never harped on the bias, but always felt it.  The time came when I decided to ""when in rome"" and in fact exploited it.  I switched to russian planes and tanks so I could still enjoy the game more and honestly, the bias is real...they get hit for damage less(can be hit lots, but very few good hits will ever count as dmg), have magical armor, and can kill most things just by shooting in the general direction without aiming, etc.A few particular vehicles of other nations stand out as exceptional but most of other nations are terrible in comparison...from their overall flight perfomance to their win rates by default, and very importantly, the quality and overall hit chance of their weapons.  The russian vehciles upped my win rate significantly...it came to be that I expected wins when I ran russian lineups - even if I played ""dgaf"".  Just no fun.The game is still early access technically, even after 4 years.  Only 1/2 the game they claimed to be making has ever surfaced.  Visually, the vehicles look great!  The terrain and such is lackluster at best.  I think, in the end, this is one of those games that should serve as a template for a new production done by a better quality company with more respect for the players they rely on for both funds and success.  Their censorship is over the top though.  Even if they fix it all and finish the development, I'll still not return due to Gaijins aggressive tactics on censorship of comments they don't want others to hear..I think some of the devs must be throwbacks from the old days...the only media they want for their game is ""state-run"" and ""approved"".Luckily they cannot forcibly remove Steam reviews.The storm has rolled in...see you in more friendly skies...tldr; read it or don't...the thumb is visible regardless.

												Even though the Axis boys lost World War Two therefore reducing the capabilities to produce high end products such as better tanks and planes, it kinda bugs me how broken the BR rating is. As a German tanker I'm alright fighting Is-2's, Pershings and all the tanks made from 1945 and below but fighting tanks from the future is kinda crazy, how can my super thick Maus compete with tanks that can penetrate its amour anyway.(and yes i know that Germans tanks are for long ranged combat but if everyone in our team keeps going long range who's going to rush?)I would play this game again if they would at least fix the BR			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While War Thunder is a very good looking game and arguably one one of the best WWII aviation games available, the state that the game is in now is unplayable (100% due to Gaijin's stubborness and inability to acknowledge or fix glaring issues). It is completely unacceptable and no one should attempt to play this game until its developers start to listen to the games community and the valid complaints they have, fixing the issues instead of disregarding them. I really want War Thunder to grow as a community, and i really enjoyed playing it, but at the moment, Gaijin and War Thunder have reached a new low.			",47,12,1,3,8,1,3

												Ive got over 300 hours on this game, and though its fun, i wouldnt recommend it to anyone. This game proclaims to be ""Historically Accurate"" but i assure you its far from. Like most of the other negative reviews state, this game is extremely bias towards russian tier vehicles. The only time it actually seems remotely fair is when your playing as planes. German tanks are practically made of paper while the T34 and its predecessors seem to be made of Unobtainium. In my opinion, wait it out. Sooner or later the devs will finally realize this game will continue to lose its popularity until said issue is fixed. As of now this review is staying negative.			",44,2,0,1,11,1,7

												It must have been 4+ years ago that I played the beta of this game. At that time, this game was more like  simulator style ''Wings of Prey'' but with some mmo progression elements and better multiplayer. For me, those were the good days. I love realism and simulator games, and the red and blue letter markers you see hovering over friends and enemies, and other UI elements of arcade battles and realistic battles break that immersion for me. In any case, since those old times I've seen this game go downhill step by step. Gaijin Entertainment has decided there is more money to be grabbed with simple game mechanics which makes the game accessible to a wider audience, even console gamers who have joined in on their PS4 as of the past year. However for people like me, this has slowly taken away everything that I initially likes. Progression has become more pay to advance faster. As a result of this new business model, Arcade and realistic battles have been gaining a lot of players, while simulator battles has been draining players steadily. It has come to a point where simulator battles only play a minor role in event missions, in which a person is not even able to pick their tier or vehicle of choice in many cases. This week I finally decided to uninstall the game when I discovered that while I was not playing the game for a few months, they changed the tank sniper mode aiming mechanics entirely to a very weird and completely unplayable state for me, with no alternative option to switch back to old style controls (at least not in simulator battles as I understand it). Which means that I can only play the by now extremely scarce simulator flight battles. There is nothing for me anymore in this game now, and I will say goodbye to it after many years of fun. If things ever change I may come back, however with Gainjin's new mindset I don't see that ever happening. To make a simple conclusion:-Do you like World of Tanks merged with World of Planes, with better mechanics, graphics and a better experience in general? Totally play this game! -Do you like a highly immersive experience with many elements similar to the challange of simulator games? This used to be pretty good, but not anymore. Go play Il-2.

												DISCLAIMER: Although it shows i played less then 60 hours on steam, i have well over 900 hours outside of steam.http://i.imgur.com/9R7mDRS.jpg--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great graphics.Great performance.Gameplay is awesome.Terrible balance.Bad match making.Incomplete game, full of vehicles that behave like UFO's.I have played this game for more than 2 years waiting for their promised changes to take place, only for developers to retract or outright lie. In the begining they said the focus would be realism and historical accuracy, but over the months more and more arcade elements were introduced and the realistic and simulator community completly♥♥♥♥♥♥on, simulator community in particular is good as dead, thanks to the complete negligence of developers.They exploit broken content to get moneys and realese an endless stream of clone premium vehicles that add nothing to the game.The worst moderating team and PR that i ever seen on any game, CEO comes to forum and said some of the most stupid things ever to the playerbase.It looks good, it plays worse then WoT when it comes to balance, match making and net coding, it is just a damned frustrating mess that shows no signs of clear direction or intent, every patch they tinker with stuff and that was uncalled for, it is clear they don't know what they are doing and they bit off more then they could chew.Patch after patch that is nothing more then content dumps, most of which always badly balanced or unfinished and then takes 3 to 4 mini-patches to get things to a minum acceptable level. Also they base their balacing around  player statistics and that is why this game is hopeless in that respect.Gaijin's motto: -We try fix what is not broken and instead break that also.Not worth the time.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update:As of 9/2016 this game is still a pile of garbage. If you are planning to give a try stay on arcade mode and nothing else. SB as been forsaken by Devs and RB is a waste of time, especially RB with planes. You will waste 20 mintues hunting a enemy fighter so that then he drags the fight to his base and have the Ai AAA kill you with super accurate fire. This is not a game for those looking fair chalange.P.S.Tank battles are more cancerous now then in the closed Beta, enjoy getting spawn killed repeatedly, as Gaijin has no spawn protection mechanism and all maps are tiny ( and therefore easy for fast vehicles to exploit).

They are trying hard to sweep this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t under the carpet. Trying and failing. This game is flooded with hackers to the point its ridiculous bs. There is even hackers in russian-side ""Thunder pro league"" tournaments. Imagine they are banning players and whole squads from competition only because their hacking have become obvious, so they are catched them.I'm personally find this dev attitude unacceptable, they are threating our WT community like bunch of stupid peasants.

												Learn new languages! Better than Rosetta Stone!Play unhistorical vehicles!Hate everyone!Get rammed to death!Blessed by Stalin APHE!Soviet nation best nation!-10/10.In all seriousness due to Steam not saving my review I had a nice long review explaining why I don't recomend this. If you have friends,and the patience of a saint,then by all means try it. But don't fall into the pit of buying a premium vehicle or item. Gaijin is a terrible dev and hasn't listened to the community in years now. The 5 ranking BR system doesn't work. It's designed to make them money and frustrate the hell out of you. Normally,that isn't a bad thing. However,in this BR(that's been ♥♥♥♥♥ed about since it came out) is very bad. Most Soviet vehicles end up undertiered(a few US ones do too) and Germany and IJN get over tiered. UK kind of falls in the middle.If you want to rage the least,you should play USSR. Generally the best unhistorical vehicles. If you want to rage the most,play Germany and Japan. USA and UK fall in between that. It looks pretty at least. It's a damn fine pretty game.

												Amazing Graphics, Great game, 5/5 hands down.Edit 1/23/16:While the game still has amazing graphics, the Devs need to listen to the community instead of being greedy. This game has the potential to be one of the best games to have ever been released.I do not change my opinion on recommendation because It is a great time waster and it still can be fun.Edit: 11/27/16The game's gameplay and community are certainly degrading, being level 100 with the majoirty of the game's vehicles unlocked. The CBT for Naval is certainly a refreshing thing to say the least.But I still retain the fact that the Devs and Game Masters need to listen to the community and hear their cries for change.  My Biggest problem is that I can get 10,000 research points in Air Realistic easy, but when it comes to Ground Forces I struggle to get more than 4k a match sometimes only getting 2k. This is absurd as late game tanks are 380,000 points to unlock. This means I have to play over 200 games to get a couple of vehicles. ",391,42,14,30,58,5,75

												Well i decided to change my rating, but i still wouldn't recommend playing it seriosly. The BR system is still bulllsh*t, ATMGs were a terrible idea, and i just couldn' resist some russian bias. The game is full of bugs and server issues. Example of some russian bias: Leo 1 HEATFS peneterates T-54 frontal, hits the ammo, nothing happens. T-54 shoots back, Leo 1 goes boom. Example number 2: A bug affected the performance of the IT-1, they fixed it hours later. They broke the RakJPz 2, still not fixed. Panther G is a submarine (somewhat accurate, but the engine wouldn't run 2m under water).			",5,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been on Warthunder on and off. And it's constantly the same thing, 1 Nation is OP as ♥♥♥♥ and all the others keep getting nerfed. Please, either fix the balancing matches for skill level (Tired of sh*t teammates screwing up the game), balance nations or just put the ACTUAL HISTORICAL values. Until then, beatings will continue until morale improves on my end, and I will play once again, once the game is ""stable"".			",116,6,0,11,15,0,22

												Can be fun at low tiers, like tier 5 and below. Above that the game balance in arcade battles is pretty poor. Tier 10 and above is horrible in arcade. Ground strike maps usually end pretty quickly with very few planes actually shot down due to bombers destroying the enemy airfield, which is a autowin. Historic Battles is the only place where there's decent fun to be had in higher tiers, but wait times are horrid and sometimes you end up in games where half the teams are AI.There's also some pretty blatant pay to win schemes going on in the game. Instead of earning xp for your air crews and unlocking upgrades through gameplay, your air crews and planes can be maxed out with real money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder has been a very good game from the beginning, but over the months it has been degrading.Lots of vehicles and lots of different game modes to play (campaign, co-op, random player run battles (custom battles,) arcade, realistic, and simulator battles.) The game looks great too. But over the last year the developers have taken a very hard turn towards trying to milk the game than to actually listen to the community and fix many issues that have plauged the game. Though the turn to milking has been going on for a year and a half, since the start of this year (2015) it has increase sharply.The official forum team (International one) are run by a ignorant unproffessional who thinks the community are over-reacting, haters, or even paid by the competiton to ruin the game's reputation when they are pointing out a problem. There is many more problems. The main one is mainly balance issues in game (Battle ratings.) But, I do recommend, you try the game yourself even if I a old grumpy veteran from early 2013 am going on negatively. Many new players love the game even with the apparent problems.

Now look at the play times. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of hours.I think the fact that the vast majority of this game's older players can't reccomend it speaks for itself, so I'm not going to bother reviewing it personally.

												I've sunk alot of time into this game and after the painful advance through the german tier I can give a 100% definite review on this game. If you plan to play, do not play the USA or German Ground tier. Only Russian. If you plan to play the air forces do not play the USA, British, German, or Japanese. Only Russian. The russian bias in this game is as real as it'll ever get. People can say whatever they want to say but the fact is, russian bias through and through. Only play if you're interested in playing russia.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Generally a very nice game with excellent graphics. However, due to the new matchmaking system which matches bi-planes with cannon-planes, I would not recommend it to new players until Gaijin changes the matchmaking again, because as new player you will have to start with bi-planes and are therefore only free point to others.

												The Russian bias is real in this game, so unless you intend to play anyone but Russian, planes or tanks, expect allot of frustration when they seem to be the only ones that they want to be allowed to 1-hit people, when they spend so much time talking about increasing the battle duration and nerfing down anyone elses ammo that comes close to the lethal destructive potential of non-historical Russian APHE.If only it weren't so much better than world of tanks, so much more realistic other than when gaijin arbitrarily swings the nerf bat at something like british APDS turning it into a needle gun where you virtually have to kill every individual crew member. Whats that, high tier british tanks ONLY get APDS other than their HESH rounds? its OK, top tier Russians still using non-historically performing APHE rounds and killing people just fine? lolololol.Planes can be just as bad, just wait until your running into the hordes of Yak-9's often put up against planes that where historically flying 3 years before them, with a flight model thats an absolute joke and seemingly made from bullet proof stalinium.

												While this is a good game, it is rediculously biased. When I first got this game it was a blast and I had a good time. So based on gameplay I would have given it a positive recommendation. I am an older gamer, from the mid 80's and as a rule I dont like making ingame purchases. But I am also an American and lack common sense. Ask any Canadian about us. Anyways, I made a purchase of ingame currency and it was all ""lost"" when I bought some upgrades. By no means did these upgrades use all of it. I submitted a ticket and to make a long story short I was told I would not be refunded the ingame currency and that I must have spent it all. What makes this all ludicrous is I never recieved the upgrades I supposedly spent everything on. I never played it again. In hindsight I dont feel I really lost too much after reading up on this companies behavior, practices and outright dismissal of historical facts. So I hope my review will temper the ""very positive"" rating they have right now since I dont believe they are on the right road to keeping it. I will just go back to Wot where I haven't been ripped off and they dont treat you like your IQ is 3 points above ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. That would be 73 points for all you guys who dont quite hit the mark....

Grind, grind grind. They need to double the exp points(including crew exp) to make this game any interesting to play without premium. On other side premium is too expensive for an average player. I still playing it only because i've got a friends to play with and i've opened almost all USSR and USA crafts before 1.37 was released.So, at current state of matchmaking, prices for premium, and amount of experience point you need to unlock.I don't recommend this game.

Posted: June 5, 2014
												Throughout the course of this game, my opinion has largely changed. I used to recall on the game as a pioneer of the aircraft simulator franchise as it embarked into the realms of World War II and its epic course, now I can only review this game as a mediocre displacement from that former realization of it being a ""wonder"". To begin, the company, Gaijin Entertainment, is ridiculous at best. I used to be a strong advocate of another title of the company - Star Conflict - until they nearly dedicated all resources to War Thunder alone. The company is infamous for dropping titles and other assets in pursuit of other monetary ventures. I still rather miss playing Star Conflict as it felt like a new take on space combat (Mind you, this was before Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, and several other acclaimed space simulators to be). Though my regards on Star Conflict do not reflect War Thunder, it reflects my opinion of the company that seems like it desires to be the next EA of Russia. Oh that reminds me, in its conveying of the depressing updates of Star Conflict, and other titles, they apparently have no English representive (Or that person needs to be fired) as it seems like the company uses Google Translate to loosely translate press releases to the customer. Personally, I like to hold onto Star Conflict and War Thunder simply so that I can read statements with grammatical errors so blatantly obivious, it is a pain to the eye while a laughter to the brain. To the matters of War Thunder, I used to play this game on a daily basis - to this day I maintain 175.5 hours - I would most likely have 1,000+ if I did not stop playing this game however. With the release of patch 1.37, to ""decrease"" waiting times for flight battles, Gaijin decided to remove several tiers and merge them into a few. Now, what does that mean? It means instead of matching against a player with a similar aircraft tier, it means going against individuals that can either be incredibly above you in level or incredibly low. To me, this seems like an attack against those who are just picking up War Thunder. How is it that a company can maintain a player basis when it invites new ones into battles that are significantly outmatched? I suppose the developers are able to achieve this, but I suppose the fame will outrun its course.As a reflection though of the current update, Ground Combat, I was elated beyond scale. I stayed up overnight to download the update and to finally get into my tank to discover how fun it was. While the ground forces update is exceptional, it is amazingly generic. I would dare to say it seems like Gaijin dissected World of Tanks to mirror the tanks and battles to the very   controls and combat. Personally, I almost laugh simply because I have wondered if Gaijin Entertainment and WarGaming (Developers of World of Tanks, Wartanks, and Warships) are brothers - family in ownership.Though my opinion and reflection of War Thunder is based primarily upon patch 1.37 and the company's background, I cannot sadly recommend this game. I still take fun in participating in air battles and tank battles on the occasion. Knowing the company's background, I cannot but wonder when they devise a new title that maintains such high success if not higher than War Thunder, when they will suddenly drop frequent updates to pursue the next monetary venture. If you're interested, look up Star Conflict on Steam and review updates and other news for the game. Everytime that I do that now, I simply get depressed. I wonder if people even know that this company has maintained other somewhat successful titles before this one, considering it seems like Gaijin throws old titles and other former successes off a cliff into a void of neglect. In my opinion, if a company releases a title, that company must maintain fixes for bugs and glitches while releasing new content to increase the player basis - in a professional manner. Considering Gaijin most likely uses Google Translate rather than an English interpreter, translations of the updates and other press notices are astounding. My yet born nephew would probably understand and convey English better than Gaijin. NOTE: This review reflects mainly upon the ethics of the company. If you are looking for a game to play occasionally that reflects your desires to defeat the Axis or Allied Powers of World War II in a simulated fashion, I would recommend this game. Though, I would stay WarGaming's titles would be a better choice. As a very frequent gamer, please take into account the ethics of  Gaijin - the next EA of Russia.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have almost 300 hrs into this game. It's not something you want to take seriously. If you do then you will become very frustrated and spend multiple hundreds of dollars on. I know because I've spent over $500 on upgrades across multiple countries. With Russia not being our closest allie. I stayed away from them. I was born and raised in the USA. So I went for my country and their allies. I didn't realize or know that this game is for the Russians. If you choose a faction make it the Russian's. They are by far and wide more powerful than anything. The kill the most powerful tanks of any other country with one shot, even if it's multiple levels lower. Don't waste your money or time. I'm finding all the free to play games are jacked up. I will stay away from them. There will be a shift away from them and they will learn and go bankrupt. hahahaha			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far I've clocked more than 800 hours in this game, and that's only after moving it to Steam.This game started out so well, and went so damn down hill. Me and some mates played all nations, both air and land, and what used to be a very good game with alot of options, has narrowed down to be a soviet game, basically. If you're flying planes you'll be generally way more successful with the soviet planes than any other nation, if you're playing land games you'll generally be way more successful in soviet tanks. And I do mean way more, like 5-6 times more.Graphics are really nice though, it's a beautiful game, but the development is going straight down the drain.You'll hear and read alot about bias, and see developers answer it is not so. But if you play this game, play all nations and make your own judgement.Developers for that matter, never had any grudge with them, but seen them more or less bully critics.And how many games do you know of that implements censorship on their forums? Try and make a post on any of the update threads.This game had such immense potential, and was going in such a good direction, when they for some reason just decided to nuke it all.

												Love the hell out of this game since it is one of very, very few places where you can play something like what they have made here.  BUT that being said I can't recomend it because there are many game modes, many tiers of vehicles, Tanks and Planes, for many nations.  Why is that bad you ask.  Because there may be 5,000 people as of the writing of this review but they are all spread out over all those modes, tiers, vehicles, nations, and servers.  And odds are since the devs are giving the most attention to ground forces that is where most people will be.In summory there are too few people playing now whith too many ways to play and the Match Maker is apualing and is all but unfixable que times can be anywhere from 0 seconds up to and above 20 minutes.

												Where to begin. This game, at first glance, seems like a fun game, and truthfully most of the time it is. However, the cons outweigh the pros in this game. For starters, once you enter tier 3 ground forces, the grind becomes unbelievably long and tedious. Even the modifications you have to research take quite a while, and it sucks that the game hinders you until you unlock these modifications. For example, not having parts or FPE can really screw you over, but if you play careful you should be fine. The problem lies with having to research adjustment of fire and the elevation mechanism. Your gun will be inaccurate as all hell until you research these two, which again is very frustrating. The whole battle rating system is confusing and unfair (Tiger E going against Tiger II's and T-44's when your line up is a Tiger E, H1, and a pz4 g). Some maps seems to favor certain spawnpoints, and the game can be a load of horsecrap sometimes with the gameplay. My main problem is the developers tactic of ignoring their community and making it nothing more than a money grabber pay to win game. And when I say pay to win, I dont mean buying premium tanks, I mean having to pay money to speed up a tedious research system. All in all, if your looking for a fun game to play, then by all means download this game. But dont expect to play it for too long before the games bullcrap starts to shine.			",106,7,0,6,6,2,7

												I started playing War Thunder at update 1.39. The game has changed drastically. At update 1.39 I saw great potential in the game. Recently the developers have annoyed me to the point where I dont even want to pick this game up and play it. They advertised this game as being a simulator. All though there are some aspects of ""realism"", I've noticed that they have added a few things that really strike my nerve. Additions such as paper tanks that never saw combat  ie Maus, T-25, T-44, etc. Its gotten to the point where you would drive a tank from 1945, such as the m26 pershing, and be up against Leopard 1's, T-55's, and m60 pattons. On top of that the developers do not listen to the community which could possibly help them change broken aspects of the game! In short, If you love games that are historically accurate, I do not recommend playing this game.*Recently this game has gotten even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ since the addition of cold war era equipment. Word of advice never touch this game.*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

War Thunder: Money Well Spent; A total of Zero USD.Revised Edition!Pros:• Fun plane combat... Sometimes• Fun ground combat... Sometimes• Wide selection of vehicles... To grind forCons: • A lack of admittance to problems• Unbalanced gameplay• Game relies more on type of vehicle than skillOverview: War Thunder is an arcade like flight simulator with added tank combat for near full scale battles of both land and air. Published by the company Gaijin Entertainment and labeled as an MMO it is quite unlike any game I've ever played. There is an assortment of game modes ranging from Arcade, to Realistic, to Simulator, to Historical Events and Campaigns. There is also an assortment of Planes, Tanks, and Armored Vehicles that you can get your hands on, most of which all have their own style of play that differs from game mode to game mode. The community is rather live and active although not always in your language. None-the-less you're sure to find what you're looking for even if it isn't what you want to hear. It's an extremely fun and rather addicting game that costs you as little as a mouse click; that is assuming you can handle the grind and don't want every vehicle and advantage.The Facts: 1: Hit detection is a joke. There is a phrase we use called 'sparkling' and it's when you see your rounds sparkle on an aircraft. When this happens they do no damage because your client is not in sync with the server meaning the rounds you see hit only happened on your screen and never actually registered with the server.  This is exactly as bad as it sounds.2: Crew Points. In this game Crew Points is something that matters way too much. You gain Crew Points from simply playing the game, but in rather minute amounts. The survivability, mobility, accuracy, and pretty much everything is effected by Crew Points. I have over 1000 hours in this game and I've yet to max out a crew on any nation for either planes or tanks. This is in large part because I refused to pay money.3: Pay 2 Win. Many people say this game isn't pay to win and I understand their stance on the matter. My opinion differs however. You can pay money for more Crew Points at an astonishing rate. You can buy Crew Slots so you can bring more planes into Arcade Battle. You can buy Bushes and other Cover to add to your tank. You can buy Premium Time which helps you unlock Parts and Vehicles faster along with giving you more in game currency to unlock those Parts and vehicles. You can even unlock Parts flat out with money. Most of these you can get by simply playing the game others require money and each varies in the advantage it gives. In my opinion if you pay money and instantly become better than you were before you are by definition Paying to Win.4: The Grind for Vehicles and Parts and Crew Experience. Once you finish a grind and get a new vehicle it will have zero Parts. This fact alone puts you at a rather large disadvantage even more so for tanks with the inability to put out fires or repair and even to a larger extent to people who have no Crew Points. This essentially in my opinion throws an element of skill out the window. For higher tier vehicles you will be held at a rather severe disadvantage for many hours of gameplay until you unlock the essential items to be compete effectively. This forces users to either grind it out in what I personally think is a rather miserable experience or 'lets' the users who don't want to wait simply purchase the parts with money. All this means is the person who plays longer or spends more will be statistically better simply because of their Unlocks and Crew Points.5: Match Making is horrible. This is one of the things you will learn rather quick in this game. You will, at least half of the time, face someone of a higher Battle Rating than you and the better you do the more it will happen. In planes this means they can out gun you, out turn you, out run you, and out climb you. In tanks this can be expressed with one one word: OVERKILL. The shier disadvantage you are in when you're facing someone of a higher Battle Rating is enough to make you write a bad review like this.6: Russian Bias. There is a reason people joke about Soviet planes being made of 'Stalin Wood' or complain about the Soviet planes having laser spray cannons. What makes matters worse is they are Historically Accurate in regards to the 'Secret Documents recently discovered in Secret Bunkers'. That is an actual quote and I can't even argue it. The game in essentially built around everything that the Soviet vehicles do well at. There are exceptions to this like everything, but for the most part it is blatant.7: Cover and Concealment. Since you're able to change your graphics settings you're able to provide yourself with a clear advantage over others by removing Concealment from the game. Doing so removes most shrubs, all grass, and most all foliage on the battlefield. This allows you to see much farther and through a lot more than Tankers who are player on higher settings. This leads you to being shot from places that you can not see yourself.8: Randomness. Pure and simple randomness. From having your wing ripped off from a single small caliber bullet. To having your tank explode from hitting a tin can in the road. To having your pilot knocked out in the first shot from 1.5km out. To having your tank bounce a round off of it's barrel, have it land on your gunner port, have a sliver of it's metal touch your ammo, and have you now at the vehicle select screen wondering how. This game is completely and utterly random in most every regard that matters.Recommendation:It's sad when you see a game with potential drift so far away from what it could become. Its even more sad when you see a game hide its problems behind the dedicated player base and by those who willingly choose not to see them. This was a fun game for me for many hours, but those hours took a toll. I started to see the problems for what they where and began to realize they most likely will never be fixed. Because the first step to solving a problem is admitting you have one.I would not recommend this game to people simply because it is not anywhere close to being friendly to new players.

												Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Total♥♥♥♥♥♥ Insane ammount of russian bias. A T-34, a low tier tank, can take 5 hits to the front and 2 hits to the side. My mid tier tank gets one shotted by a T-34. Every time. They can shoot across the damn map! Russian tanks are much much faster. Do not spend any money on this game, especially since its so overpriced. I dont have anything else to suggest you, because WoT is a PTW piece of garbage too. Just dont play. Grinding is insane, as you have to play for 2-4 weeks just to get a new tank. Never play. No customer support as well. Maybe if we get enough people to leave the gam, Gajiin will fix it. ",65,2,1,5,10,0,11

Prepare for the biggest grind you will ever grind, this game puts Path of Exile into casual grinding game.What bothers me the most is that the game is actually good, really good, and TAKES skill to play.I've put 50 hours into this game so far. Haven't got through the Rank II yet.This game is not pay2win but pay2progress. If you want to skip one plane, it will cost you for like 10-50 USD.If you have time for this game like I do, then this game is really amazing.- Unrewarding gameplay.- Very grindy.- Can be very frustrating.- Questionable MatchMaking System that puts you with a better aircraft, makes it really difficult to overcome.+ Takes skill to play.+ Has a massive community, finding game is not a problem. (There're NA, RU, and EU servers IIRC)+ Fun, interesting, and challenging gameplay.+ Many things to learn, and improve.If have time, you should give this game a shot.I love this game and I'll continue to play this game casually.

												Seriously, its not worth the time. I've spent too much, and wasted my life on this game. Hell, I was even permanently banned of the forums for complaining. Gaijin doesn't listen to your complaints. Gaijin only cares about making money. Easy example, CBT tanks. CBT tanks are tanks that you must buy a pack to unlock or use. (This happened with American tanks and currently happening with British ones.) In order to unlock these, you need to purchase a pack. These tanks are really OP so for people to enjoy tank games they need to buy these packs. As soon as their out of CBT? Nerfed into oblivion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mechanically a good game with a lot going for it.But patch by patch the balancing and match making gets worse and worse and the developers ignore all complaints. Some tiers are neigh on unplayable right now, with planes and tanks with vastly different performance being pitted against each other. Your enjoyment of this game is now mostly reliant on the MM putting you in a match where you get fair opponents. And those matches are getting rarer and rarer, near to non-existent. It is now not a game I would recommend anyone spend the slightest bit of money on. Play for free and play it casually, if at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is still cool with tons and tons of potential. You will enjoy it if you are looking for some casual, braindead, short term fun. However, if you're not braindead and you end up a little bit smitten with the game's potential, you quickly find out that the game's biggest problem are its developers and most notably the absolutely atrocious decisions of project management, the completely skewed priorities they set, the nearly indisputable fact that these people obviously do NOT play their own game and the utter incompetence of the 'community managers' who act more akin to secret police than to actual community managers.Gaijin Entertainment is killing their own game, one patch a time. They do not listen to their community, they do not play their own game, they have been making awful decisions for years now with zero results to back them up. It would take much more time and effort than I am willing to put in to describe all the problems with WT and Gaijin, not to mention that people have mentioned them literally thousands of times by now. This game and its developers are pancaking this sinking airship into the ground at a record rate. Stay away from it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just, please, spare yourself from this hellhole. I made the horrible mistake of playing this game and leaving it back in 1.37. I wish I kept kept playing, because the game was playable back then. I imagine that you come to this game because you like WW2 vehicles like me. Gaijin (The developers)  give you the finger constantly during your experience with the game. Insane bias. My friend pumped 300 .50 cals rounds in a yak-9 and didn't evn get a hit registered, but he could see the impacts on the yak-9. BEFORE YOU EVEN POSSIBLY THINK HE'S A BAD SHOT, THE YAK WAS LINED UP. Oh, and you know how japaneese aircraft blow up when they are set on fire? Well yeah, the fires on russian planes will take a flap off if you're lucky, and will always go out.What about the Germans? Well, as a German main, I am disgusted at how horrificly underpowered they are, it takes a fully upgraded BF-109 to be any use. FW-190's get sniped by russian gunners on auto, but that's actually a normal occurance to ALL OTHER AIRCRAFT.How about tanks? I hear you ask. To put it simply, and kindly: a chaotic piece of s****. Armor has no meaning. And yes, I actually care, because so many tanks on lower tiers dont fight other tanks anywhere near their time period, so some are so unfaire, while later on at teir 5, armor is pointless, but the russians bounce Maus shells as if it were nothing.KEEP AWAY. I don't know why I hope to think it gets better and try playing more, I'll change the review when it gets it's old charm back, in the meantime, I reccomend you play World of Tanks or World of Warships, or even better, IL-2 over this, thing.

												I don't usually write reviews for games, but in this case I will make an exception so as to lend my considerable time spent playing War Thunder to the decision-making process.First on the agenda is the ever-present complaint of ""Russian Bias"" or, as it's more popularly known, ""I suck at this game so I'm going to complain that the nation the company is based in is OP.""  Seriously, if there is any Bias in this game whatsoever, it has been mitigated over time by the inclusion of more vehicles for other nations and the refinement of the game mechanics.  Furthermore, this game is HIGHLY skill-based, which means you need to get good to do good if you play any mode other than Arcade.  While this may require a time investment, it does pay off by providing the player with a FAR more rewarding gameplay experience than anything Wargaming could shovel out of their pit of despair.  I must, however, concede that the game DID have bias when it first came onto Steam, of that there is no doubt.  However, since then other nations have been added to the game and the game mechanics (such as spalling, armor deflection, and ammunition properties) have been refined further and further.  At this point, the only Russian Bias that might exist has to do with their aircraft, but I'm not familiar with that situation personally because I predominantly play tanks.  In the case of tanks, I can confidently say that Bias is virtually nonexistent as Russian tanks are easy enough to knock out if you know what you're doing.  Also, the Panther's gun eats T-34's alive because its shell normalization is so good.Speaking of shells, you recall when I said that to do good, you had to get good?  This includes learning what ammunition types do what and, especially in the case of Sim battles, learning what tanks belong to which nation.  When it comes to ammunition and its capabilities, it pays dividends to know that APCBC rounds are more capable of defeating sloped armor than APCR.  The first thing to remember is that this isn't World of Tanks, and APCR in War Thunder isn't the magical ""I win"" button it is in World of Tanks.  Furthermore, it pays off to know that loading a full load of ammunition is not actually a bad thing.  Yes there are MANY people who will tell you otherwise, and in some tanks I admit that it may be true that loading a diminished load of ammo is actually a good idea, but if you are even halfway decent at War Thunder, you'll notice that you're surviving longer and running out of ammo when you really don't need to if you do load a minimal supply.  It's details like this that make War Thunder so good; it makes the player think, and therefore makes them better teammates.Moving on, let's talk about the devs shall we?  Gaijin has been notorious in the past for ignoring their community and doing what they damn well please with War Thunder, and to an extent that is still true, but at the same time Gaijin HAS been making an active effort to pay more attention to what they're community says.  On the one hand, I'm happy they're paying attention, there are problems that do need to be resolved.  On the other hand, I'm EXTREMELY happy they continue to ignore the community for the most part.  Why would I be happy about this you ask?  Well, for one, the majority of the War Thunder community plays Arcade, which is just...not War Thunder's main mode, no matter what anyone may tell you.  Unfortunately, the fact that the majority of the playerbase plays Arcade means that they tend to complain about game mechanics and balance that are really quite alright, and some of the REALLY hardcore elements tend to zealously campaign against the existence of Realistic Battles and Simulator Battles.  I personally believe that Arcade is not War Thunder's main mode, it still feels tacked-on even after all the TLC that Gaijin has given it, but despite that I do feel it is a necessary evil as the mode keeps the most toxic and bigoted elements of the community contained.Speaking of the community, it's not as bad as some people say it is.  Yes, it does have it's fair share of idiots and toxic trolls, but they are not as prevalent as many would lead you to believe.For those who may be interested, the graphics in this game are fantastic, easily besting World of Tanks or *shudders* World of Warplanes in graphical fidelity.  The sound design is also quite good, with the tanks actually sounding like tanks and the planes, for the most part, sounding like planes.  You still have the odd flying lawnmower and tank with the wrong engine audio, but those are easily ignored in the face of everything else.Let's see, what have we missed?  Ah, yes, the ""issue"" of ""bad balance"" that you see so many people complain about.  I'm going to be brutally honest and say that I could not give Two ♥♥♥♥♥ if the game was actually unbalanced or not.  I personally believe that if a game is unbalanced, it provides the player in a supposedly disadvantageous position a real challenge, and a chance to really shine as a player who knows what they're doing.  I commonly say that there are no bad tanks, only bad tankers, and this game really demonstrates that by requiring a player to practice good situational awareness and intelligent decision-making.  The game is one of those few MMO's that actually rewards good players for being good, though good fortune still factors in like it would in reality.There are other reasons to enjoy War Thunder as well.  Gaijin has created a detailed and comprehensive custom battles system that allows players to create entirely custom matches with settings of their own preference.  This has allowed entire player-run tournaments to be created with special rule sets and custom vehicle lineups.  That's not all however, as Gaijin has added the ability for players to create entirely custom scenarios in which the creator of a scenario can edit virtually anything about it.  If you want to recreate the battle of Kursk down to every detail, you can.  Unfortunately, the custom scenario's system is still single-player only, but Gaijin recently announced that they are actively working on making the system multiplayer-capable, meaning players would be able to create, upload, and host entirely custom battles with things like forced ammunition loads, vehicle choices, and preset trigger events.  You could recreate the Normandy invasion if you wanted, complete with offshore bombardment, AT guns, Infantry, and specific tank spawn locations.Some people will commonly complain about the number of premium tanks in the game, but those people also forget that Gaijin has to fund development of the game in some way, and the prices for premium tanks and Golden Eagles is actually quite reasonable compared to the way Wargaming extorts you.I could go much deeper into reviewing the game, but I think I've made the majority of the better points towards downloading War Thunder and giving it a go.  I highly recommend this game, and I suggest that you give all game modes a try before you pronounce it terrible and give it up.  Every game has its flaws, and War Thunder is no different, but the game is being actively developed by a developer that is learning to communicate with its community more than it used to.  Not only that, but the game offers a truly unique experience that doesn't subject itself to the whims of RNGesus as often as health bar based games.  It is possible to get one-shot in this, but that feeling of blowing a tank sky-high with one shot of your own is something I have only ever felt in this game.  War Thunder is unique, and I hope it doesn't conform to what other MMO's are doing just because they're so Arcadey and successful because of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not nearly as good as the game was, but you know all for the sake of ""beta"" status most players went along and continued playing. 1.35 came along and is still to this day considered the best update. But that was autumn 2013. 3 years ago.Since 1.37 the betastatus has ended and the game is officially released. With that came a totally toxic gaming developer, mod/admin community and more and more restrictions on the forums. Which would have been manageable if the game wasn't brough to its knees...which it did, obviously.Bottom line, WT was promising to be a historical and graphical astounding game but it has been completely destroyed by its developer and toxic mods/admins. The player numbers have dropped from 120k online to 40k-ish which tells you something as well.If you want to get started, I can't recommend this game anymore, it has become too much of a moneygrab (the recent navy beta that has been introduced is the new utter low Gaijin has fallen too) where if you have to start right now, you'll be frustrated after less than an hour. And there's no reason why you would get frustrated over a game.TL;DR:Used to be good, got destroyed by its developer and mod/admin. Chances are very slim that Gaijin will ever unlock its full potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In its current state I can not reccomend the game, by any means. Cheating runs rampant due to the lack of an anticheat, and gaijin's insistance on burying their head in the sand on the subject and pretending said hacks dont exist, a clear and present bias, as well as poor matchmaking make this game an obviously poor choice of time and money.Until they fix the faction biases, the unrealistic and at times laughable balance choices, the horrendous matchmaking, and acquire a good anti cheat program, this review will remain negative. 1/10.

Or the obligatory guy who can shoot 10 rockets at you where you have 90% chance that the first one kills you Having fun times when encountering Soviet tanks, which are somehow performing way better than the tanks that in reality dominated them hard. Being pitted against tanks that are 2 tiers higher. Getting oneshot has never been more fun!

												First off, I used to love this game until the reccent patches made it borderline unplayable unless you play japs or russians. The american planes are always killed because .50 cal is like throwing pebbles at steel and they fly like bricks. The american tanks are armored like they're made of butter. The german tanks cant pin anything (Especially the Tiger H1). The russian tanks are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the grind takes years when the RP gain from matches is 1-3K a match with premium. The Brit planes use cannons to rip the wings off of anything they face. And lastly, all the devs want is your money at this point. The game has become Pay to Win in so many ways, the premium planes out pace all other planes, the premium tanks are bulletproof and the RP gain is impossible to grind without premium accounts T4 and up. In short, dont play this game for the sake of your sanity and bank account.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a WW2 flight simulator, this definitely it's not your game. Of course, have good graphics and some physics, but it's all. Seems more a Call of Duty, with plane skin. And you'll see, planes with doubtful flight model, weapons not working realistically because of hit detection problems and other issues, multiplayer missions and map designs forcing players and planes to act weird, different than an aerial combat of WW2: High altitude bombers flying low, strafing ground targets; Interceptors attacking ground targets; Ground attackers joining in dogfights; Bombers joining in dogfights; Bomber hunters afraid to attack bombers; planes of the same team attacking each other; in rarest times you can see any cooperation as aerial squadrons, and so on. And don't get surprised if your prop plane of the WW2 got in a match against a jet of Korean War era... it's pretty normal there.Well... they said, game still in Beta phase... So, they need fix and implement a lot of things yet... If you want give a try, be my guest...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Save yourself the trouble and go play another game that does any sort of simulating or realistic combat scenarios on the ground or in the air. This game, for the first year or so, of its development, release and subsequent updates was a GOOD game. A fun game. A game that drew in people and stole a good chunk of Wargaming's World of Tanks fan/customer base with its air combat in one of three distinctly different game modes. All that changed with the introduction of their BS riddled battle rating system that they would, with each patch, adjust each plane's, and ground vehicles when they were introduced, ""battle rating"" to fight enemies the PLAYERS WHOM MAKE UP A TOP PERCENTAGE AND EXCELL within the vehicles in question while shafting everyone else. Every. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Patch. Time and time again you see a major increase in the number of SOVIET aircraft with their UFO like flight models outperforming, even though the Soviet UFO should never have gotten off the airstrip, other aircraft that make the ""UFO"" seem like a volkswagen. The same exact @!$^ is occuring on the ground as you see some BULL!@#$ T-34 get ammunition at a 3.3 battle rating, think Shermans and barely upgunned Panzer 4's with higher velocity 75's, that can penetrate and one shot a Tiger. A TIGER at medium to long range.All in all, I would hope that those whom would be interested in this game..go play another game. Armored Warfare, World of Tanks or SOMETHING besides wasting your time on some Piece of !@$# that Gaijin refuses to get anywhere near balanced called World of Soviets. Oh wait sorry, ""War Thunder"" as they claim its called.			",132,13,1,39,15,0,58

												The best WW2 vehicle combat game you can get. Easy to play and understand and open to anyone. Wide variety of Historical aircraft to choose from and fly offering unparalleled flight combat and soon ground forces combat. The developers are a hard working and committed team who are always evolving and shaping things based on feedback. Excellent events and rewards on a regular basis and great community.

												During my play time of warthunder i tested tanks all the way from closed beta to what it is today.and its a pile of ever loving purly rotted♥♥♥♥♥♥so mutch potential down the drain cause really its the only game out in development right now with modern graphics that could have made a epic tank combat but the fallowing killed it.they claim tanks operate like they did historicly which is a load of pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. denfesive smoke launchers dont work. cannons phase space like wot through buildings and other tanks. and if your down to two crew members who is aiming the gun and loading the gun while your driving to?low quality graphics still remove bushes trees and rocks.br rating system while is a good idea is really to compressed for a fair fight that sometimes comes up. (as in there are certain tanks that if they get a +1 match theres no snowball chance in hell they can dissable the tank they face frontally) and ATGM""S main missle can take fire like a champ. 105mm sabot no prob 120mm HE shell to the tip of the missle just makes it look a bit worn. not to mention is also can phase threw tree's and fins dont get damaged from multitude of bushes it flys threw.shells dont peform anything like real life.rng bounce mechanic and module destruction just like wot you flank the tank that outclasses you in everything but speed put a single shot into a criticle part and what should dissable/destroy the tank doesnt.i really wanted to love this game i really did however given the fallowing all this really leads to is just another wot that makes you dumb down the graphics so you can see the♥♥♥♥♥hat shooting from 4 forests and a village away.they also cherry pick historic advanteges dissadvaneges certian tanks had.example: the tiger 2 has a bad steel modiphyer making its armor worse than what is stated in armor view.early t34's dont get bad weld/cast modiphyer.along with reaload times being altered for ballance reasons.back to steel beast./edited for first spelling pass. im not the best.

												Refering to the time I spent on this game, I think I'm eligible to show my rage about what War Thunder has became.I use to have a 10/10 review on this game. But...yeah, in past tense.Gaijin use to respect history. They add vehicles and make changes according to real data.Now Gaijin make changes according to the amount of Vodka.Several most direct reasons that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off:1. US tank shells' penetration got nerfed and changed shot types (APBC to AP, like M103's M358 shots).2. XP55 incidents. (You should know what happened if you have the premium plane.)3. Bullsh*t changes to battle rating system. (Battle rating decides what vehicles you will see in a match.)4. Ridiculously unbalanced game while the CEO still insists the game is perfectly balanced.5. New vehicles always get sooooo OP for a couple of patches and then got nerfed to sh*t.6. Soviet noob rush kills everything.OMG can't list anymore. This list will become a 5000 words essay if you want me to list every bullsh*t currently in this game. Gaijin has been adding a bunch of unnecessary changes like UI changes into the game while the content of the game is as messy as my underwear closet. Stupid errors and mistakes are everywhere in the game. I afked for like 2 months and found out the game is even worse when I came back. I got so mad tonight and I deleted my previous 10/10 review and changed to this comment. Now I would literally give the game a -10/10 if possible.I loved this game Gaijin, we all loved this game. Plz plz plz plz don't kill your community. Overall, go to IL-2 or DCS World if you want to fly a plane. Go to WOT or Armoured Warfare if you want to play tanks.Update: just watched Phly's latest video

												War Thunder is a free to play MMO Plane/Tank simulator with vehicles from the Spanish civil war, through World War 2 up to the Korean war.My hours in this game would make you think I'd recommend this game, but I can't in good conscience do that. This game has both absolutely terrible qualities and redeeming qualities but ultimately it's not enough to recommend this game and below I'll tell you why. This review will be based mostly on my thoughts as a realistic game mode player.If you want to skip the indepth review and just want my quick thoughts : It's a game that has great potential, but greed and lack of listening to the community are runing it. Give it a try if you're into your history or flight sim games as it's free, but you'll likely run into some things that will ruin it for you, I did and so have my friends who I play it with. Be it the grind, inbalance of matchmaking or the dreadful community.Good pointsLooks great - The game itself looks amazing, vehicles and locations have been carefully recreated to try their best to give an immersive experience and at a decent frame rate. I have a GTX 760 ti and run the air force part of the game at 100+ frames and the ground forces at 50+ frames on average. It dips from time to time depending on the map and the lighting.Optimised - Almost every update brings some new optimisation in the form of how the networking is handled or how everything is rendered and will run moderatley well on some modern potato machines.Choice - At this point in the game's development, there's a wide variety of what you can fly and drive with 5 nations : USA, Japan, Germany, Great Britain and the USSR. Every Nation has tanks except for Japan at the time of this review, and every Nation has a full air force, with Fighters, Bombers and Attackers to chose from and more are being added with each major update.Progression - To progress in this game, you research different vehicles at each tier, to progress to the next. You'll start off with Biplanes and eventually work your way up to Jets. Each vehicle has upgrades it can receive, from engine upgrades to armament upgrades like bombs or rockets, or bigger cannons. This sadly can end up being grindy if you don't have premium.Groups/Squads - If you have friends that play the game or will play it with you then you can form a group to go into matchmaking with, however you should ideally fly/drive vehicles of the same tier/battle rating (Battle rating is what defines what matches your vehicles go into, and what they go up against) Otherwise you can wind up with a slow, cumbersome biplane fighting against a post-war Jet.Game modes - There are 3 game modes in this game, Arcade which has little to no realism, other than bullets and shells have drop, certain armor cannot be penetrated by shells and you can't fly into space. 'Realistic' and that term is starting to become looser with every update but in this, your pilot can be knocked out if you pull high G turns, the flight models of planes are more realistic, you can rip of parts of your plane from going too fast. Lastly is simulator, it's called this as it is as a simulation of what it would of been like, or so they try to make it like that. In this game mode you have very little HUD, it is better off played with a joystick and your enemies have no markers over them, nor do friendlies at longer ranges.Bad pointsRealism - I don't mean this as in I don't like how realistic it is, on the contrary it's not realistic enough. From them adding planes/tanks that never flew or saw action such as the Maus or the Horten 229. Another problem is in the realistic game mode which will see only biplanes fighting in the Korean war, or some Alternate history rubbish, which is Gaijin's answer to what would of happened if the cold war escalated right after WW2. Late war vehicles are going up against Korean war vehicles thanks to a new, messed up matchmaking system and is apparently no longer worth playing in late war Jets, as they get decimated by Korean era Jets.Matchmaking - This used to be a good point, or so I would believe but nowadays like I mentioned, the higher tiers are messed up and no longer worth playing. at the lowest tier, you have 'reserve' vehicles which used to only fight other reserve vehichles, but due to lack of players searching for games the entire system has been compressed, which is unfair on new players, who get absolutely clubbed if they're in a biplane, and go up against early monoplanes with cannons. Some nations are favoured more than others, but I'll touch on that later.Lack of Map variety - This one was hard to word, as there's a lot of maps in the game, from almost every theater of war but some how the matchmaking doesn't like variety. Naval fighters for example in the American tree don't often get get into Naval maps, instead they get thrown in with the British on 'Alternate History:Berlin'. I've no clue why they've done this, there have been loads of terrific maps that are actually historical, such Malta and Guadal canal. This lack of variet often puts Bombers and attackers at a disadvantage as it's often more difficult, if not near impossible for them to contribute to their team, if all they have to attack is a carrier fleet, which will rip a single plane to shreds with laser guided flak( not actually laser guided).Community - This is pretty consistent with any game, particularly free games but the community is mostly God awful. There's obviously the few good people, who appreciate history, or how beautiful the game can look, but the majority is weeaboos, racists, unfunny meme-loving, man-childs or actual children. So just stay clear of that if you're still interested in the game.Exploits - Though I said previously that they've optimised the game for bad PCs, this meant they added ultra low quality settings so even your grandma's oven could run the game, this brought the option (which has thankfully been removed since then) to completely remove foliage such as bushes and small trees in ground forces. This would give players the advantage of being able to see other players, who try to hide behind this foliage, which is more often than not big enough to conceal a Tank. Now the only option they have left in, is the ability to turn of grass + foliage in your optics, which puts players, who don't want to cheat and play the game at higher settings at a disadvantage. Another option is the game, while not really cheating is an option called 'verticle targetting' which essentially allows planes that have fixed guns to shoot bullets out the sides of their guns, rather than where they're actually aiming, which results in a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t kills and deaths as I have experienced on both ends.Russian Bias - Now alot of people are skeptical, as am I about the so called 'Russian bias' in the game as it is made by Russian developers, who were born or lived in a time where the soviet union still existed and so did the Communist ferevour. A lot of players who say it exists are just outright bad players, who think their American bomber can out turn a Russian fighter and proceed to get shot down, then claim it's 'Russian bias' that they lost. I believe it's a combination of patriotism, and unfair matchmaking. For example, Russia goes up against Every nation, including it's allies but only in Korean war games and Alt History. This is often bad for the allies as they're split between British and American planes, which fly quite differently and fight differently, resulting in a split and on top of that, more allied players fly bombers and attackers which results in less fighters, which results in them being outnumbered in dogfights (usually). Secondly you get a lot of Russian fighters, usually their post war super-prop planes that first flew in say 1946, fighting German planes from 1942.Hopefully you found this review useful, if you did I'm glad I was of help.

												If you dont want to suffer, play russian tree. This game is highly biased, for example my tiger 1 88mm gun shell bounces off t34 almost every time when its at slight angle and when it penetrates the 45mm armor there is not enough damage done to stop a t34, but when t34 hits tiger 1 with over 100mm of armor, even at slight angle, with its 85mm gun it breaks turret drive and knocks a crew out so you cant fight him back till he kills you, or it kills you instantly. I have shot t34s in back portion of turret where is ammo, and they often manage to run away, but when they touches my ammo rack its instant kill. American tree of tanks suffer even more.. Talking about planes, fighting mig 15s and mig17s with f80 or f2h is not fun at all. And every pach its getting worse. Now i regret playing this game and wouldnt recommend it to anyone.

												The game has a very good engine and a great variety of vehicles. And because it's a free to play game you can expect an ungodly grind unless you spend a LOT of money but that's just how these games work. The thing which really leeches the fun out of the game is the fact that as soon as you stick your head out of the first tier you will be matched against high tier 3 opponents. So how do you fight planes which are faster, turn better and have better guns and armor? Well, you don't. They will kill you head on, they will simply fly away, outturn or outclimb you if you manage to tail them. And how do you fight tanks which can penetrate your front armor with ease at long distance while you can maybe hope to damage them at close range from behind? Well, you don't. That's the basic failure of this game: Most of the time you will fight an uneven and unfair battle. Bottom line: The matchmaking in this game is plain broken.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hello there. I got this game for a while now, And i can say i got dissapointed with each and every update.I play only tanks, ground forces. I started up with the rissian line, obviously thats the default line you start with,so i stuck with it, pretty quick advance, no real money spent, never my intention. So at one point i got bored of those, not to long ago i started the german line(the only one i did besides the russians), well, here the problems starts, reserach takes ages, the armor of tanks are weak, guns are accurate, but lack the real power. All the conclusion, as ive seen others say aswell, if you mind the time, you wont mind the money. As i am, i have not much time to play, just a simple H1 tiger tank takes ages to research with no real money to help. You hardly get stuff. And plus you are forced to research all the useless stuff that you dont actually want just to advance a tier,plus this cold war stuff they recently put in it,rubbish. Bad things go on.Ive left world of tanks for the same reason, now i see how greed got hold of people. What do we expect, the whole world runs on that stuff,and its to powerfull.....Wonder if my car can run with that xxxx.			",20,1,3,0,4,0,1

												The realistic ground battles in this game were great, but after they introduced the P2W bushes camouflage, I just can't recommend this game anymore.

They ban me from posting, give me a warning point AND delete my post! Eather warn me or delete my post, this is too much...Deleted post because reasons: http://prntscr.com/aqaum5But they did something I have never seen before, they deleted the whole page of content that was against the recent game changes, so now you have the page 82 and page 84 (yeah there are 80+ pages of players telling Gaijin not to do something and they still do it) but the page 83 is ""not found"".- For those of you who think I only played ~20 hours, see the screenshot I posted from the WT forum. There you can see how I got 3000+ battles, and was Ground Forces, Steel Generals and Royal Armor tester, which means played more than 20 hours...			",60,6,2,33,21,0,22

												The plane are overall good game , give you satysfaction playing it.The Tanks have interesting gameplay, but have many game breaking bugs like :-Terain deformation destroying your traks or killing your driver.-Poor armor penetration calculation (eg. you can penetrate on the conection of frontal armor and side armor)-Some time croshair shows that you can hit enemy tank shooting near the ground, but the ground eat your shels. (whit no explosion efect ...)-Some buldings have buged in game models and you can shoot thru them walls.For now i'm giving negative evaluation for this game until they repair ""ground forces"" bugs.If you want only to fly plane's you are good2go.

												This game has such amazing potential, but it has been compromised by the seeming apathy of Gaijin. At least I hope it's apathy, because the other option is pure incompetance. I have given this game a huge chance in both the amount of time I have played, and the money I have spent. I have researched and spaded most of the vehicles from rank 4 down.  The play time was frustrating at times due to their schizophrenic balancing, but for the most part it was very enjoyable.Until I hit the upper tiers, then it turned into a nightmare. It can take 15 to 25 games to unlock a module, and over 100 to unlock a tier 5 tank (playing tier 4 -5 tanks), and this is with having a premium account ( which allows ""faster"" advancement). At @ 20 minutes a game thats about 30 hours of playtime to unlock one tank.At the lower tiers it is much easier, and if youre looking for a fun little brawler check it out. But if you are looking for a good sim, it isn't.  Also if you want to play higher levels of vehicles be prepared to spend months playing or spending hundreds to fast track it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is only about War Thunder tanks.Had fun in War Thunder at the BR 6,7 ? No more because Gajin had the great idea of lowering the maximum BR from 8.0 to 7,7. The way i see it Gajin did it because to reach BR 6,7 is plausible with just grinding but beyond that getting vehicles is extremely time consuming with out MONEY.  So now you are faced against the top tear tanks like                   T-10M,Maus,IS-4M and others of same class whic is not very fair on my opinion. If Gajin did this to balance the german Tiger II (witch are pretty powerfu) why didin´t they lower also the IS-2 Mod44 BR.  The point of this review is i dont just understand the reason behind this change and it seems quite like the game is just asking for more money. Now of course i can be wrong but the ""update"" seems like its only goal is to make Gajin richer.War Thunder is still extremely fun game at the tiers that this is not happening and don´t shy away from it for that reson but the players that have spent a good amount of time in War Thunder are geting trampled on by the pay to progress mechanic of this game.

												This is what happens when your matchmaking system is designed by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.You play for a few hours, thinking it's fun. You'll get shot and blown up in one hit because the enemy knows the exact pixel to aim at that is weakest, no matter what tank, but that's part of the fun. Then, you unlock newer tanks, that despite being heavier and looking tougher, are just as vulnerable to machine guns and random fire as the cardboard armored tanks of tier 1. You'll get components taken out by trees, because this game is awful.God, this game really makes you feel for all the morons who serve in tanks. Since just one hit makes 'em a firework. Don't play this game. Don't waste your money supporting them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE aviation!SPECIALLY WW2 aviation!Maybe thats what kept me trrying to play this game for so long!My rant with it is that it is SO unbalenced!Really ... EVERY ♥♥♥♥ing plane you get is♥♥♥♥♥♥before you spend dozens, of hours on EACH plane to get ALL modifications available.Plus the ""cover"" modification is in the LAST tier of modifications!This means that you will get one shoted in less than a blink of an eye by someone with a better plane after sometime 10 MINUTES just getting to where you wanted!Why does it take forever to mod up planes?When you enter a new tier you have 2 options since your plane suck and you know it suck!1- Play defensively, try to use energy fighting to the most and fail frustrated because:a) your guns tickle enemy planesb) you will not kill any one unless you keep fireing ate them for at least 5 consecutive secondsc) you will get one shottedSo after 10 minutes of climbing youdive on an unsuspecting enemy plane ,tickle it and your dead because your plane is SO underanked that some one who was cruising has more energy than you and you WILL get one shoted because you have NO ""COVER"" because you just ♥♥♥♥ing got the plane.2)Jump in the action taking now 5 min to get there fire against some plane, tickle them and die one shoted.Repeat that with all your planes an go back to the hangar and repeat like a robot for 7 hours, because thats what you´ll need to get all of you planes allmodifications ... Opt 2 is perfect because everyone loves losing right?Not only the planes are underpowered when you enter a new tier but they will also put you against people with dozens of levels of more experience than you with 1 or 2 tiers of plane difference.To make it more clear:You just got you new karate belt!You are so happy that you got it and now you can test your skills! =)So they will put you to fight someone with 2 belts more experience than you and give him a pistol!I am SO frustrated with this game right now I punched the wall SO ♥♥♥♥ing hard and woke everybody up.The only reason I don't have broken fingers right now is because I actually practice karate! ¬¬			",7,1,1,2,1,0,5

												While I somewhat enjoy the game, I just can't reccomend this to anyone who wants a somewhat realistic World War Two plane/tank game.The seemingly random ranking/stat ""balancing"" model Gaijin has employed is a great detriment to the experience as planes/tanks that acted a certain way one week can be completely different the next.Also the massive amount of pay to win and changes to the ingame economy make it very difficult to want to continue to unlock new planes/tanks.

												What have you done? I used to love this game and have put hunderds of dollars into it. But with the recent updates, it just keeps getting more and more messed up. Compressing the BR even more and more, to the point where a Tiger 2 faces T-10s? Raising the repair costs for only certain planes? Premium planes having lower BR than it's normal counterparts? It's just all forms of messed up. Don't even get me started on the forums where people get banned for expressing an opinion or pointing out that a admin made a mistake. The game itself is amazing, the people who decide what changes to make are monkeys with a typewriter.Edit: Still bad devs.			",162,12,8,18,27,2,33

												I have played this game a lot, and I've had a lot of fun most of the time. However, since they introduced the 'research' system many moons ago, War Thunder has never been the same. It now takes a disproportionate amount of time to unlock anything new. Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is excellent,  both in the air and on the ground (especially in Realistic Battles), but it tires me how long it takes to get to the next plane, which is invariably just a slightly improved retexture of the last vehicle you spent 5 hours grinding with.If they fix the unlock system, tell me.

												A plane war sim that for some stupid reason decided to add tanks. You know a game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when you spawn and get sniped from across the map by a tank twice your rank who knew that it would be better to take random potshots towards the opposite spawn than to actually play the game.The plane part of the game is good - if a bit boring at timesThe Tank part however was a stupid addition that has next to no good balancing, a broken physics engine (they decided to add in a tow for your teammates to use on you if you randomly flip over rather than fix the issue) and gameplay based on complete luck as to whether your shot hits, and if it does it is very likely that it will just bounce off.Possible solutions-1: Fix the stupid engine (I don't know how, i'm not the one who gets paid to fix it)2: A timer/distance that once a tank shell reaches it will just explode (maybe just for arcade mode)3: Make the plane spawns slightly closer together, it gets annoying when you fly for 5 minutes just to get off a few rounds/bombs and then get killed.

												I used to have fun with this game, but the devs seem determined to run it into the ground. After the latest update, any resembalance of balance that was left in the game was destroyed. The devs value queue times above anything else in the game and have made high tier tanks and planes extremely compressed with vehicles being sealclubbed as a norm. They refuse to use anything but player statistics when deciding where to place a vehicle's BR which leads to severe over or undertiering and further exacerbates the game's matchmaking problems. The official forums are ruled with a Stalin-like fist with any disent towards the devs' decisions being met with a ban and or post being deleted. The forum moderators do everything in their power to make sure that players have no contact with the devs and generally act like manchild wannabe dictators towards users and are constantly powertripping. the game does have a subreddit, which is better (usually) than the forums, but gaijin *officially* has no presence there. The sad thing is that the vehicles themselves have vastly improved compared to how they were two years ago, but the devs have consistently made researching vehicles a huge pain and matchmaking consistently more and more broken with every tweak they make to it. If you do get this game, just play it intermittently as trying to take it seriously will leave you burnt out and sick of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Downloaded the game via Steam, took about 30 minutes to patch it. Why am I mentioning this? Tune in to find out! Created an account, got an error. ""Error 80130182: The authorization server is unavailable""Followed the fix instructions for it and got past that error message only to recieve another error message. ""Failed to load player profile"". The fixes I found suggested modifying ESET or Kaspersky settings, neither of which I use. Figured I'd try downloading the game directly. Started patching and low and behold, it started patching at an average of 20 kb/s. It jumped anywhere between 20 kb/s and 200 kb/s, a massive change from the 1.5 mb/s to 2 mb/s. The estimated download time ranged from 56 days to 123 days. Personally, I didn't feel like waiting that long to play the game. I'd dismiss it as a problem on my end but a quick google search showed this was an issue affecting a lot of people and most of them didn't really have any idea what was causing it. If this issue changes somewhere down the road, I'd be all up for trying it, especially since it looks pretty interesting. As it is right now though, it doesn't really seem worth all this hassle.

The problem was that the objectives to ""win"" a chest with a  slim chance at getting a premium plain/tank were completely luck based and had nothing to do with anything and I was venting my frustration with them that I had spent 40-50 hours in two weeks trying to get the premium tank/plain.  I told them that I could have just spent that time working overtime at my job and probably had enough money to buy every single premium item they had for sale.They pretty much told me I could F off, that the contest was working as intended.I told them that the high level of customer service I had recieved was leading me to uninstall the game and never play again.  All they had to say to that was ""We are sad to lose any customers"" to which I replied, ""No, no you aren't"" they closed my ticket in full before I could choose if I was satisfied with the result or wanted to keep the ticket open for further help.

												With the recent patches made to this game Tier 4 is being crushed due to tanks that they can do nothing against. That is no the worst part, anyone who says anything on it about the forums is having their thread locked. Do not play this game you are encouraging the developers to do crazy things like this, or if you do play it stay away from any battle rating in tank battles higher than 5.0, it is ruled by tanks you are nothing but cannon fodder to. As I said the devs are silencing anyone who voices a negative opinion on this topic. They also DO NOT listen to the community as planes have been asked to be taken out of tank battles ever since they were implemented and Gaijin have firmly stated they are staying.The censoring has gotten worse, they have been threatening youtubers who say negative things about their game and forcing them to say positive things or else their chanel gets deleted. this is a complete violation of youtubes copyright system. After the first time they did this and the backlash from it there was another youtuber who brought to light cheats people were using, not saying where to find them or how to install them and this time instead of doing what they did previously they held a poll on the forums that let players vote if the video should stay up or not so that they could be justified in taking it down. This is yet again more abuse of youtubes system and is also Gaijin using their own community for personal gain. DO NOT PLAY! Take a stand against the devs and show them that this will not be tolerated and cannot be forgiven.			",101,3,3,6,6,0,1

												Every patch seems to make this game worse, they still have broken matchmaking after 3 years and they almost never fix anything.Community interaction is horrible and the dev team seems to be entirely discontected and isolated from the playerbase.Don't get invested TBH, it's disappointing.

												This game is horribly un ballanced after the latest patch and it seems like the developers don't care about their players or feedback. Cold War tanks are put up against WWII tanks that have no chance of scoring kills. The game was already a massive grindfest and now anyone without a top tier tank has no real hope of getting one without putting up with 100s of games of being consistently 1 shot by enemys they have no hope of killing.

												This could be a great game for people who love ww2 simulators like me, but it isnt even the pay to win that gets me, it is the play Russia to win. It is impossible to get fair matches due to the bias towards Russia in balance. I highly reccomend NOT playing this biased pay to win game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I once loved this game.But now sadly I would only advise you download and play this game f you want to watch an overly Narcissistic developer run it's game into the ground.The developers seriously cant take any criticism at all and they are so slow to help when it comes to solving serious problems customers are actually having, often denyiong that these actual problems exist because it would seem they are far too proud to admit that their game has anything wrong with it. The extent of Gaijins Narcissism extends beyond the game and even Gaijin's forums where any criticism of the game is swiftly removed. They are now flagging you tube videos that say anything negative about the game and I mean anything Negative. This company is acting like a spoilt child and if they want themselves and this game to be respected  they need to grow up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review isn't for the game, as the game itself is fantastic.This review is for the customer service.I contacted customer service about a problem with a contest they were having.  The problem was that the objectives to ""win"" a chest with a  slim chance at getting a premium plain/tank were completely luck based and had nothing to do with anything and I was venting my frustration with them that I had spent 40-50 hours in two weeks trying to get the premium tank/plain.  I told them that I could have just spent that time working overtime at my job and probably had enough money to buy every single premium item they had for sale.They pretty much told me I could F off, that the contest was working as intended.I told them that the high level of customer service I had recieved was leading me to uninstall the game and never play again.  All they had to say to that was ""We are sad to lose any customers"" to which I replied, ""No, no you aren't"" they closed my ticket in full before I could choose if I was satisfied with the result or wanted to keep the ticket open for further help.

												The game was great! I've been playing since  the early early open beta around a year or 2 ago and loved it! I would have given it a 10/10, but now ever since a patch that came out around last December i would give it a 2or3/10. The gameplay is the same and is very fun to play whether alone or with friends but now you have to grind grind grind grind grind just to get 1 plane. Before i could just buy plane after plane in tiers but now i have to grind for research points (which are very hard to earn) to research a plane. Plus Gajiin went and had to make the game go from Free2Play (completely) (only buy if you feel like it) to having to pay if you want to unlock a new plane in less than 50 matches or more. You basically have to buy Golden Eagles so you can convert them all to research points to speed up the research of a new plane. I would still reccomend this game if you are into fun aviation type games and playing with friends but the free2play aspect is just no longer here.			",122,8,6,10,7,0,6

												Imagine this. The perfect game. A flight-sim paradise with a mix of Arcade fun where you can fly multiple planes. Imagine this game also had tanks. Tanks that players use. Imagine you being able to go between a plane and a tank. Sounds great right?Now imagine that the devs behind this game completely not care about the community. Flight Models broken in every patch, Planes being crippled. WW2 Planes matched against Korea Era jets. And now, sprinkle a bit of ""Devs decide what you play, and how you have fun"", then stick a big, stinking, huge♥♥♥♥♥grind to get anywhere on top.A game where the devs force you to play specific races, penalize you for doing good in planes, and utilizing them as they should, and then force you to pay money to lessen the grind, a grind which increases with every patch they release. Don't forget the fact that they keep lessening the value of everything in game, and raising the prices for less reward. What's that? want a pack with a premium plane? ""SURE!"" say the devs ""But we'll charge you twice as much, turn 2 months of premium into 2 weeks, and completely ♥♥♥♥ over the premium plane as well""That is warthunder.

												This game is very unbalanced, and yes i am one of them who doesnt realy like this game. This is my personal oppinion so dont rage as we all have different oppinons. F2p words just translate (try this out for fre unlimited time) As premium players can easaly dominate free users. As the game itself it takes hundreds of hours to finnaly achieve normal plane which will get destroyed by again premium players.  But the game itself is nice and polished. And im actuolly keen to try this with user release of ""Oculus Rift"". But still, to fuly enjoy this game you have to spend extra money for joystick (joy-stick) and for ""Oculus rift"". But you must agree, that you need fast PC in order to enojy this game even further. At the end, i wouldnt reocommend this game for f2p user. But if you are interested in spending your money to this nice polished flight simulator. This is the right choice.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 After putting a year into this game. I enjoy it alot! However the developers and chat moderators are at times completely off their rocker.   It's a natural case of pay to progress/win. Premium Vechiles recieve advantages over their progression tree vechiles of the same Tier and even model of vechile!   I'm use to being out spoken on video games I enjoy. Gaijin has a reputation of silencing negative criticism.   Promoters of the game like PhlyDaily are pentalized for giving constructive criticism. They retaliate against his criticism with removing all of his videos off warthunderlive.  Questionable bussiness practices is the bottom line!   IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 will give you all the planes and more. Same realism and it's only 9.99.   I've spent 500+ and only have 1 full tree of German planes grinded.... A year and 500+..  Warthunder could be the best in series. But, They won't stop trying to make money over a good game.   Raising prices on their ""DLC"" then putting it on sale!  Also know as a crime.    :)  They also sued a man who owns Gaijin.com  .  I'd look else where for the money you have to spend. Lastly! Anti-facism laws mean you can't use ww2 german ace names.

												It used to be much more fun.They remove or change fun things to make them more historical.Like a road, wide enough that you could fly meters over the ground for miles, and turning it into a railway, so thin the smallest aircraft can't fit between the bordering trees.This is what I would do every time I got annoyed, because it was so much fun.I'd load up a ""Custom Battle"" (a battle where there are no rewards or losses, purely meant for fun or other activities) and mess around. Fly through bridges which Gaijin removed. Fly over roads which now don't exist. Even land on railway bridges in massive bombers.

War Thunder forces you to purchase premium Tanks or Planes to do better. Playing with friends is a disatser as it places your squad into the highest members server rank.

												Great fun at first, but after a few months gets really monotonous.  You go up a tiered weapon progression system for each nation starting with simpler, less powerful weapons at first then advancing to more advanced weapons.  Tier one is great fun, but once I hit tier 3 it stopped being fun.  At tier one I at least felt like I was contributing to my team.  I could run around, shooting, destroying, and getting points for my team along the way.  At tier three that stops happening.  I'm not sure what changed in the game, but I couldn't just fly a plane and blow stuff up on the ground.  Ground warfare stopped being fun as I would spend more time traveling between respawns than actually fighting other tanks.  You can still choose other nations to play in tier one battles, but the game now takes far longer to set up matches at those tiers.  Essentially killing that option of play.			",22,2,0,7,8,0,7

												This game is just a game from russians to russians... game is really unbalanced and has a lot of problems but gaijing wont fix them. they are focused on new post war tanks when the old ones (especially german tanks/planes) are still in too hight battlerating or has other problems. if you want to still play this game, you should start with soviet union because they have the most OP tanks and planes in any battlerating.

												Español: Este es un juego muy divertido. Posee un realismo y jugabilidad que no he visto en ningun juego. PERO te vas a encontrar con que los hijos de♥♥♥♥♥♥desarrolladores en las actualizaciones agregan puras ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s y no reparan lo que realmente es necesario; Me refiero al equilibrio en las partidas, puedes estar jugando con un tanque en un nivel de 4.3 y te vas a enfrentar a tanques hasta 6.0. Ustedes dirán ¿Que tan malo puede ser? bueno, solo en una diferencia de 4.3 a 5.3 con algunas naciones es IMPOSIBLE penetrar a los tanques del bando contrario (A excepcion de la Alemania Nazi, por que sus tanques penetran más que ninguno) lo cual es una real CAGADA de los desarrolladores. Si estás jugando este juego recientemente (o vienes de World of Tanks) no notarás estas cosas por que no tienes los conocimientos del juego necesario, pero comenzarás a darte cuenta de esto de a poco. Solo digo, si quieren jugar este juego bien, yo como jugador con experiencia les digo que hasta que arreglen esta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ del desequilibrio no vale la pena entrar a jugar. (El equilibrio que los ""Genios"" desarrolladores usan es que si juegas en 2.7 en tu partida probablemente jugarás maximo con hostiles 3.7, pero lo que no se dan cuenta estos ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s es que de 2.7 a 3.7 hay MUCHO desequilibrio)English: This is a very fun game. It has a realism and gameplay that I have not seen in any game. BUT you're going to find that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s developers in the updates add pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and do not repair what's really necessary; I mean balance in games, you can be playing with a tank at a level of 4.3 and you're going to fight with tanks up to 6.0. You will say How bad can it be? Well, only in a difference of 4.3 to 5.3 with some nations it is IMPOSSIBLE to penetrate the tanks of the opposite side (except Nazi Germany, because their tanks penetrate more than any) which is a real♥♥♥♥♥♥of the developers. If you are playing this game recently (or you come from World of Tanks) you will not notice these things because you do not have the necessary game knowledge, but you will begin to realize this bit by bit. I'm just saying, if you want to play this game well, I as an experienced player tell them that until they fix this imbalance♥♥♥♥♥♥is not worth playing. (The balance that the ""genius"" developers use is that if you play in 2.7 in your game you will probably play maximum with hostiles 3.7, but what they do not realize these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s is that from 2.7 to 3.7 there is a MUCH imbalance)			",50,2,0,1,11,2,4

												i used US tanks only until now , i have to pay to play this game , this 100% not a fffree to play game , at least not ffree to pay in Tank Battle . OKOK , maybe this is my problem because i cannot play the plane battle very good , so always lost all planes at less then 5 minutes , so , i cannot earn much white lion from air battle .........the problem is , i use US heavy tank , the repairing cost is over 5000 white lion each , and need to pay for the ammo reload for the next match , BUT even i won a battle , if 1 of my tank was destroyed , then the reward was unable to cover the repair cost , most of time i cannot kill more than 1 enemies tank , why ???????? Because US heavy tank is hardly to killed a Russia heavy tank or Germany tank in 2-3 shots , but always shot by enemies by 1 round ( germany or russia heavy tanks ) , and all my crew dead and my tank was total lost , so if i lost 2 tanks in 1 match , then i at least need to kills 3-4 enemies to earn enough white lion to cover the repairing and ammo charge for the next battle ......... if you wait for the FREE AUTO repair instead of paying the repair charge , you need to wait for 6-7 days , then you can use that tank again !!!!! FxxK !!!!! that mean if i have less than 1000 white lion ,  guess what happen ???? i join a battle , 1 -2 tanks was destroyed , no enough white lion to repair , wait for 6-7 days until the tanks was finished FREE AUTO repairing , than play 1 battle , and wait 6-7 days again ................ or you can BUY white lion by REAL money from cedit card , than you can have many white lion to pay for repairing .................THIS GAME IS NOT FOR POOR GAMER , unless you are a professional and always can killed 5-6 enemies in 1 battle !!!!!

												If you just want to get killed by Russian planes and tanks all day, then by all means play this game and die a little on the inside. This is one of the worst games I have ever played on steam. At first it was amazing and there was nothing else like it, but then I started to find that every update was like, ""Hm... I seem to get killed more by Russian planes each match... oh well I'm sure they'll fix it."" Nope, they're never going to fix this game, so I do NOT recommend this game unless you want to be very, very, very disappointed. It's really a shame how the game is turning out. I hope people start boycotting it soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: May 14, 2016
												So this is going to be my first review of any game on Steam. However I think that people need to know what they are getting into before sinking any time into this as I did.  As a warning this is a long review but there is a lot to go over.First the pros:1.) The different physics models per mode (arcade, realistic, and sim)2.) The wide variety of vehicles3.) beautiful graphics4.) damage models that are not hitpoint bases, i.e. not World of Tanks style5.) intuitive controls.6.) can take multiple vehicles into one battleNow for the cons:1.) The developer does not accept any criticism from the players. Forum posts that are negitive get deleted by mods and you can get your account suspended.2.) the economy is screwed up. The only way to make any decent silver lions (free currency) is to finish in the top three on your team and be running a prem account and several prem vehicles.3.) The matchmaker. War Thunder works on a system they call battle ratings, BR for short. In essence it is a system to reduce the waiting time for a match. Each vehicle has its own battle rating and the different BRs in a given lineup create the combined BR used for matchmaking. Now this all sounds well and good but having even one vehicle of a higher BR in a lineup can put you in very high tier games. Here is an example. I am taking a german air lineup into a match. I have two Bf-109s, two Fw-190s, and a Me-410. Using this lineup will likely get me into a battle with F-82s, Bearcats, and late model Mig fighters. All of these fighters can easily beat my lineup if the enemy pilot is halfway competent, which is likely a given for such high a tier. The same problem comes up with ground forces. M4 Shermans are regularly put up against Tigers and IS series tanks.4.) the damage model. I did put this in the pro section but it also belongs in the cons. This is because it is extreemly easy to one shot vehicles, especially tanks. This is actually the aspect that drove me to stop playing the game. It is a regular occurence to get ammo racked from even the smallest hit to the ammo rack. In order to do well you really need to study all the vehicle models to know where to hit to do the most damage. 5.) the graphics. This is another thing I put in the pro section but also is a con. This is specifically the lowest graphics setting. Despite what the developers have said about fixing the exploit many players still play on the lowest setting to remove a lot of the foliage from the game. This is key in the realistic and simulatior modes because there are no enemy markers to aim at, only direct observation. many times I will be behind a fallen tree or tall hedge and get shot at from the other side of the map. Thanks to the kill cam feature I can see that the shot was not random but aimed correctly and hit the ammo directly. The person who killed me is clearly using the exploit because I was completly behind the concealment and without target markers it should have been impossible for him to see me.6.) the grind. Over the course of my time with WT, not just on steam but also on the direct client from the devs, I have still not unlocked any tier five machines. this is because it literally takes hundrest of thousands of xp to unlock a vehicle and higher than tier three. As I mentioned before the economy is also terrible and makes it hard to buy any vehicles you unlock. A silver lining is that once you buy a vehicle you keep it and do not have to have a individual garage slot to keep it in like in WOT. You also have to unlock other ammunition and the stock is often terrible. There are also no current vehicles that have multiple choices of main weapons, only extra mounts for aircraft. 7.) the playerbase. The community in WT is one of the most toxic ones I have ever encountered. Due to the damage model system almost every kill ends up with the receevign player calling hacks and reporting the other player. I made it a polocy to never enter team chat or general chat.8.) game engine. The game originated with the aircraft component. Therefore the game was developed on a flight sim engine. This made for a wonderful air combat game untill the massive changes to the aforementioned BR and economy. If you are a new player I would suggest you really only play air battles because the physics for ground forces are terrible. Collisions are extreemly common and can lead to huge glitches. For example tanks can get stuck inside each other or get pushed into the gound. Fast tanks can also easliy flip and many heavy tanks use it as a tactic against lighter tanks. Final thoughts. War Thunder started out as a great game but has now devolved into a money maker by the developers. It is possible to advance research on vehicles and even outright buy the upgrade with Golder Eagles, the prem currency. i personally have not spent a dime on this game and I am glad I didn't.My final rating is 2 out of five stars. If you can put up with the grind and want a good MMO flight sim then go right ahead but ignore ground forces and try not to spend money. The developers sometimes have specials for free prem vehicles but they are often extreemly hard to get. As the developer is based in Russia the event times can be sometimes weird and you have to keep watch for them. You will also need a decent comp and large monitor. I do not know if this issue still exists but the Mac client is filled with bugs. I have not used that client in a couple of years so that might be fixed but if trees are not rendering correct with it then it is not your computor but the game itself.			",54,1,1,8,3,0,6

												Alright, I won't lie. This is a good game, but the devs are rather horrible. Staff in general is pretty damn horrible actually. They're the kind of people that if you I guess so much as say one plane is broken and needs fixing, they'll ban you from the forums. End of story. The kind of company that has biased moderating. If someone says they have a friend thats a moderator, don't always believe them, but those mods will ban you from the chat and voice commands and even THE GAME if they feel like it. Anybody can really be a mod and be an♥♥♥♥♥about it, but quite frankly, Gaijin doesn't really have half a polished sh*t. Play this game if you'd like, it's alot of fun. Just be aware of the community and company. The community can be good, but you got a couple of kids and clans (=oBRSo=) that act like a bunch of CoD 12 year old ♥♥♥♥. Just tread lightly.EDIT***: Alright. This new patch came out and completely ♥♥♥♥ed over the game. As of now, I can't recommend this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Watch this:

												i have loved this game for a long time after the new update i cant stand it. i mainly play arcade i find it alot of fun until recently where im making a turn i could make no problem before and my pilot loses control or my plane simply will not turn its bad enough getting ganged up on by russian planes and japanese but at least before i could manuever to avoid them and turn until allies came or i could make a break for it but now i cant even do simple manuevers without my screen going black, my plane derping out and not turning or my pilot losing control. there have always been balance issues with russian bias and things like that and the mechanics made it where a good player could survive against 2-3 planes chasing them, and if you're lucky take one or two down in the process but now the skill of the player doesnt matter if you didnt put points into your G force skill or if your plane refuses to make the turn.

												I give up. In the beginning this was fun,very enjoyable game. There was fair amount of one shooting and being one shoot and bouncing shells. If someone would kill me there would be no hard feeling,good job man you outplayed me. But...but...once you reach IV lvl tanks your world turn upside down. You will always and I mean always being one shoot from any possible angle and from your thickest armor.Someone hits your track kills you,someone hits your barrel it kills you,someones shell ricochet of you still kills you, even when someone hits your antenna it kills you.I tried to play more carefull,pay more attention how am i positioning,tried using terrain and building to protect me and still no use.The enemy simply shiiits on my future.When game is about to begin of course is not going to put all players in the same time and you are going to love the invisible ghosts that are hitting and blocking you from blitzing to the capture point.Lets not forget the glorius badass players who took bombers and drop bombs on your respawn point right after you return in game.You could do nothing,you returned simply to be killed and add that repair price who is devouring your silver lions.I dont think I'm going to play this game that much as i used before,simply it reached point where I'm frustrated too much.Not to talk abuot players who never communicate and i mean never. I used to have golden moment where i felt unkillable,godlike,was in top of the list,have 10-12 kills,but now this is just always bad expirience no matter what you do.(ok trolls come on let us hear how I suck how i dont know to play,come on boost your ego,confidence hope it helps you feel superior then rest))			",25,3,0,1,0,0,13

												If you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with War Thunder! Every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for Golden Eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.The Russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! This most experianced in the mode Realistic Battle where it's nation Vs. nation and the Russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! The RNG for Russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off OP ammo (some WW2 tanks have post war ammo)!You really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the MM is one of the worst i've ever seen! It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.    Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse! A lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates 1.37 and 1.43 where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!

												Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on ""their data"" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins ""data"" says they do ""perfectly fine"" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible ""data"" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of ""Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!"" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result. It has a lot of potential and could really go somewhere, but only if the devs stop and listen to the people that've spent thousands of hours of gameplay on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, but...The game has gorgeous graphics, butThe problem is... I have spent over 350 hours and over $100 dollars on the game and i still havent hot a single JET!!! I understand that they want you to spend money on the game and do a bit of grinding but not quite this much. I SPENT $100... How much more do they want me to spend to unlock at least 1 tier V plane (or tank). This is my favorate game and most played on steam, I've spent $100 and have been loyal for several years, but still not even close to a jet. I CANT EVEN TEST FLY ONE! Its a great game that I would reccomend but after a month you have no goal because none of them are in your grasp. ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRIND YOUR WAY TO A JET AND ITS NOT PAY TO WIN SO, WHAT IS IT!!!!!!!!!!If anyone is reading this that has any sort of power towardds the game at least concider thease problems than me and my friends are having and for other people thinking of getting the game also concider thease points.

												nice graphics for a free simulation. that's all that there is to it.now the negative points in short: ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mods/supprters/developers, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ premium (as in op and expensive as hell) and buggy as hell. it gets worse with every update and gaijin seems to care less and less.details:-♥♥♥♥♥♥ community: friendly fire is the war thunder way to say hello. also you have to pay for the repairs yourself. also you can't disable friendly fire. also, reporting friendly firing teammates will make your team a lot weaker than it already is after all the quitters left. also there is no way of joining a normal game later. so you're pretty much ♥♥♥♥ed if you have an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your team. i usually have 2.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay: wow, cool, as if camping and sniping for hours without end in other games wasn't boring enough, you can now do it in a tank that takes 5-60 seconds to reload after every shot depending on how ♥♥♥♥ed you are. mother♥♥♥♥ing yay.yay king of the hill mode, like i haven't seen that one before. yay domination, something new. yay, there is literally nothing interesting in this game, except if you like to drive 10 mins with a tank at 15mph to try to flank the enemy just to get one-shot.also: one shots. you'll get one-shot all over the place, doesn't matter if the enemy is right in front of you or a mile away. you'll get one-shot through buildings, the floor, debris, dead tanks, and even ricochet from a friendly unit.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance: t34 best tank in the world. world war winning tank with stalinium armor and cryptonite ammo. nuff said. the russian bias is real - who would've thought it, it's a russian game after all.interestingly gaijin writes about tanks at level 1.0 (""battke ranking"") that are able to deal with tanks at level 3 (which is true). but they dont change the level of that tank. nope. seems about right.also tank levels seem to change with every day passing and depending even of game type you're playing, but you cannot look up the real facts, when that very tank has what level, so that after you made a decent team and joined a game, you see that the levels are all over the place and your once balanced team suddenly has one very high level member and you now have to fight other players that have way stronger units, not as if one-shotting wasn't a huge issue anyway, now you cant even retaliate.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ supporters/mods/developers: there is actually a forum where you can post all your bug reports just to have them ignored. yay. each update comes with new bugs. yay. old ones rarely get fixed. nay.-♥♥♥♥♥♥ premium: how about you pay a ♥♥♥♥♥on of money to get great units to fight real♥♥♥♥♥♥ones? great, isn't it? you're invincible and can one-shot everybody for some cash. also, you can buy the whole game for millions of dollers. awesome. some people actually grind all the stuff for years on end. yeah, ♥♥♥♥ them, amirite gaijinalso who the ♥♥♥♥ came up with these ideas:spawning points are not possible to get artillerized, but can very well can get bombed.airplanes should start out being built out of wood, so that you catch on fire the first 100 times you fly it until you have researched the last def-upgrade. same applies for tanks, except there you can't upgrade you def normally, but fire extinguishers aren't available from the start either. also you cant repair your tank from the start either, everything has to be researchedyou can help your squadmate repair, but not your other teammates. it's also not possible to repair a tank if you havent made that specific upgrade, even if your squad mate has the same tank as you do and is around to help but you cant start repairing.fires cant be put out under wateryour crew drowns literally in 3 secondsmaps usually look like each team just came from their respective base to the battle, still you start out with tanks all over the place, srsly, noone drives a tank backwards to battle, not even the ai, not even 90° tilted. also you spawn on/in eachother which gaijin only could solve by making your tank impervious to damage for some time at spawn - great, but useless against all spawnkillers and ""traffic jams"" at game start.if your tank's tires/chain is damaged your crew immediately refurse any orders for a second and stop driving to start repairing it asap. nice feature, right? nope, you cant hide like this from enemy fire, you cant put your tank in a more favourable angle to the enemy fire. you'll have to wait 4 seconds to be able to do anything. also, crew doesn't give a damn if literally everything else is destroyed, but hell brakes loose if the chain is loose.killing ai will not give you any points whatsoever for researching your already very weakly starting new units, so that it's even more of a pain to try and use new units. also, most matches have like 50% ai, which makes for very boring , since not very intelligent, play.the greatest pros have to face the greatest noobs. fact, how else are they going to sustain their high rating?""this game aint a game, it's a simulation"" - gaijin. the only thing that differentiates it from other games like world of tanks, (except everything mentioned) are (the very unrealistic battles (jk, but it's true)) sim battles that noone ♥♥♥♥ing plays for many reasons that i'm not going to get into. there is a lot else i dont want to get into, too, but i think i'm exceeding the character count.would i recommend this game?have you read my review? do you still want to?if you want to camp and snipe around, there are better games to do so.if you want to go teamkilling/trolling, there are better games to do so.if you want to play a beautiful game, there are always newer ones with better graphics.

												If you want a game that listents and is fair to the player base or gives competitive gameplay, don't bother with War Thunder! Every now and then they'll nerf progresion and implement stuff that you can buy for Golden Eagles and the player base doesn't want(you see that in the forums) , rather than to fix year old bugs.The Russian vehicles are far better than from any other nation and they are getting buffed constantly! This most experianced in the mode Realistic Battle where it's nation Vs. nation and the Russian nation has a win rate over 80% at ranks 2 and 3 over 90%! The RNG for Russian tanks ai just a joke becouse they'll pen other tanks at absurd angles and kill them with 1 shot becouse off OP ammo (some WW2 tanks have post war ammo)!You really dont have anything else to play than random battles if you're not in a clan and the MM is one of the worst i've ever seen! It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose!Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.    Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse! A lot can be credited to heavy forum moderation between updates 1.37 and 1.43 where every critique and realistic player opinion was deleted and the player got banned from posting or could post only with moderators approval of the message!

												Great game, but...The game has gorgeous graphics, butThe problem is... I have spent over 350 hours and over $100 dollars on the game and i still havent hot a single JET!!! I understand that they want you to spend money on the game and do a bit of grinding but not quite this much. I SPENT $100... How much more do they want me to spend to unlock at least 1 tier V plane (or tank). This is my favorate game and most played on steam, I've spent $100 and have been loyal for several years, but still not even close to a jet. I CANT EVEN TEST FLY ONE! Its a great game that I would reccomend but after a month you have no goal because none of them are in your grasp. ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRIND YOUR WAY TO A JET AND ITS NOT PAY TO WIN SO, WHAT IS IT!!!!!!!!!!If anyone is reading this that has any sort of power towardds the game at least concider thease problems than me and my friends are having and for other people thinking of getting the game also concider thease points.

												Don't play War Thunder. It prides itself for realism, but the fact is that the stats of the russian planes and tanks are as false as my grandmothers teeth. It's a game where the russians need to be the best nation. If you want to play this game afterall play russians. Only that way you stand a chance.			",202,44,8,28,46,4,53

												Before I start, I just want to say I have WAY more than just 400 hours played in this game. I originially didn't link it to my steam account.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great game, I love flying around, dogfighting and ground pounding but there's just so much wrong with it right now. Namely, the battle rating system and Gaijins reliance on ""their data"" for it's balancing (the battle rating system (or BR system) is basically the match maker for those new to the game).First off, I'll start with my largest gripe, the BR system. This just doesn't work well enough for it to be in game, simply because the devs only adjust the BRs of planes/tanks off of player data, which is a huge problem. This makes tier 5 (highest tier in game) near unplayable. For example, the Me-262 C variants, 1945 jets with rocket boosters on them, fight F-86 F-2s and Hawker Hunters, Korean/1953 era jets. While the Me-262 Cs are good enough planes in game, they just can't catch up with, nor dogfight top tier jets (they struggle to take off their engines are that bad). Yet Gaijins ""data"" says they do ""perfectly fine"" where they are. That's only because in these battles, there are similar jets thrown into the slaughter they can actually kill outside of head ons. Vampires, Meteors (all of them), F-80s, MiG-9s, F9Fs. None of those should be in the place they are.I could rant for hours on this and all the individual adjustments they should make (lower tier planes have this issue as well to a lesser extent) but there's really no point. Gaijin refuses to listen to the community about this and just constantly refer to this invisible ""data"" when they make decisions like that. It's compressed tier 5 into oblivion, and as such, people leave out of frustration. Then it gets further compressed to increase queue times, loop, loop, etc. Eventually, if this keeps up, the game will die.As for tanks, it just feels endlessly frustrating to play. Get one shot, forced to leave the match. Get shot from somewhere you couldnt see from because someone turned their graphics to the lowest settings to see you while you want to enjoy the grass/trees/smoke/etc and be immersed. Tanks are also subject to compression as well, but since I never played them much, I don't know much about that situation.How about game modes? Well, you have arcade (AB), realistic (RB) and simulator modes (SB). AB is simple, just chaos, respawns and lots of angry children. RB is more strategic, one life and the planes/tanks behave in a more realistic fashion. It's safe to say that RB is the middle ground of this game, the one I've played most and probably the mode that suffers most from the BR compression. SB is total trash compered to other simulator games like IL-2 bos or DCS world. Oddly enough though, SB tanks is good and probably what RB should be for tanks right now imo.Oh, and to finish it off, Bombers/attack aircraft are mostly useless. Bombers/attackers don't contribute to a victory outside of tier 4 (and or spam) and are just exp pinatas. In tank battles though, they're just an annoyance, since SPAA can easily one shot them. Oh and SPAA are pretty damn good at killing tanks. WAY too good in fact. One tier 1 SPAA in fact can drive 80kph and seal clubs everything it faces.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tl;dr: The mechanics/controls are fun and smooth. But the game right now suffers from balancing issues, a company that totally ignores community feed back outside of ""Gimmie dis plane/tank, I'll buy it!"" and in general, frustrating gameplay as a result. It has a lot of potential and could really go somewhere, but only if the devs stop and listen to the people that've spent thousands of hours of gameplay on this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you love outstanding physics, intense tank battles, realistic mechanics and incredible gameplay....Then you came to the wrong game. Welcome to War Thunder, please insert money to continue. For some reason the developers seem to think Russia and Germany won WWII as the bias in this game would suggest we should all have pencil mustaches and be slapping each other with lederhosen. I've done my best to enjoy this game, but through the constant aneurisms of unfair matches and special education teammates who enjoy driving into you and team killing, it's somewhat impossible to do so. I've seen plenty of reviews of angry players who resemble 12 year old Xbox Live children angry they can't get a kill, however don't take this review as such. The game REQUIRES some sort of payment to make the game enjoyable. If you enjoy watching paint dry, then boy will you enjoy waiting for your tanks to finally research! But have no fear, the waiting does NOT end there, as you need to pay in game currency to train a crew to operate that tank you spent your entire adult life researching.But if that doesn't tickle your belly button, then don't worry, I have more good news! Those tanks you spend eternity researching will still never stand a chance against the players you're matched against who seem to be far ABOVE your level, so the excitement of researching a bad*** tank is short lived as you're eiffel towered by tanks 3 ranks above you (or by players who stole their parents credit card to purchase the Pay 2 Win tanks!) This includes having to take 50 shots at a single tank to get a penetration, but if you drive over a rock, prepare to spend 50+ seconds to repair!But the GREATEST part about war thunder is their servers. Plenty of PING to go around! The developers must run the game from a shack somewhere on the forest moon of Endor, as you'll find yourself huffing tank fumes from players who killed you before you even loaded the map. HOWEVER! ""If you do pay for premium,"" your tanks seem to become empowered with the magic of capitalism as you breeze through research....oh crap I ran out of premium already...as their system charges you by DAY instead of the typical monthly payment. Be prepared to install an arcade coin slot to your PC to keep your benefits coming, because the moment they run out, the game progresses slower than an African Sloth trying to climb Mount Everest.So grab your friends! (but not more than 3 because they limit your squad to 4 people.) and huff some glue, because the amount of braincells you'll sacrifice lose from doing THAT is MINISCULE to the amount you'll lose to broken physics, monkey run match making and confusing deaths (walls don't wall properly in this game). I recommend a spare keyboard as you'll most likely bash your face against the keys a few times.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UNINSTALLED ON MY 2nd DAY OF PLAYING. I've already gotten fed up with being cannon fodders for the pro's.This MMO combat flight sim started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade-ish, so I'm pretty experienced with them. This one has good graphics and different levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to choose from and tinker with.When I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era plane, and so were pretty much all the other players in the matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. At first, it was fun and challenging, and I found myself consistently ranking in the top #2 or #3 spot on my team (this, mostly due to my experience with other combat flight sim's). But after I reached level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At 3rd and 4th level,I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20-40 players. Not only were these players way more experienced with the game than I was, their planes were way better too! I would have to line them up with my relatively slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky little 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons.

												Strong pay to win, broken game design.I've written another review over a year ago, this is more of an update. I haven't played tanks much, but a lot of things from the review are the same there as well. The pay to win: Crew skills. Its bad enough that without paying money it will take you years to grind those up, and you really need to since they give massive advantages. Pilot vitality ""skill"" makes the pilot grow adamantium scales that when max out can even shrug off 20mm hits (so much for the advertised historical accuracy and realism), golden eyes for the pilot give a huge advantage in historical battles, and gunner accuracy for bombers adds chuck norrises to your crew that insta gib everything. ETC.  On top of that, there is a qualification (ace) that increases these skill over the regular limit and it can only be bought with gold, you can't even grind it up after no matter how long.Premium matchmaking: An example from the air tree - premium buffalo has 1.3 battle rating (battle rating is whats used to match planes vs each other) while the regular one thats exactly the same is 1.7 battle rating. This occasionally varies, sometimes after a while a new premium plane gets a normal battle rating, but hey, while they are the way they are for some planes, its baby seal clubbing. Upgrade system. Every plane stars out as ""stock"" and is gimped in performance (climb rate) by around 50% (!!!!!!!). For anyone with any clue of air combat its quite apparent that even discrepancy of 5% makes a massive difference, but the developers of war thunder had clearly too much vodka (they are Russian btw). For example - historically yak 3 is 25kph faster than bf109 g-2 and only 2kph faster than fw190 a-5. However, if you don't have the upgrades for the yak, you will never catch any of them, and if you don't have the upgrades for the a-5, you will be caught by yak3's very quickly making any historical accuracy or real tactics for those machines completely absent. Either you pay gold to upgrade your planes, or you will suffer in a horribly underperforming plane for a long, long time while grinding out millions of xp needed to even unlock the upgrades for purchase with regular currency. (on lower tiers the grind is much less significant however)Regarding tanks - being unable to extinguish the fire in a tank before the proper upgrade is purchased with either gold or grinded up, as well as only having 1 type of shell... well its alomost as bad as with the planes. Though with planes the differences in performance are a lot more significant. Flight models. They are completely out of whack. Most of Japanese planes have climb rates higher by over 50% than historical, making them total ufo's that out climb everything in the game and out turn everything as well. A lot of planes were and are beng added without any flight models, just a placeholder copy paste (why add them in the first place if the FM's aren't done yet?). High altitute performance is only modelled on some planes, some don't have it... KI-43 is still a ufo with a placeholder flight model for what... 3 years now? Matchmaking. The better you do at the game - the worse the matchmaking you will get. Apparently developers decided that you need to be punished for skill and your effort to learn air combat and do well, and therefore have implemented a system where trash players get put into lower BR matches to compensate for their lack of skill, and good players get thrown in to play against planes years ahead in development. Imagine dota or league of legends ( or even counter-strike) were to do something similar and give more hp to losers. Those games would be done the next day. So unless you are planning to be bad at war thunder - you are gonna have a bad time. The false advertisment of historical accuracy:There is 0 of the advertised historical accuracy in the game. The developers have stated on the official website that the current tiering is historical. Tier 1 - pre war, tier 2 - early war, tier 3 - mid war, tier - 4 late war and the final tier is corean war. So what do we have? *I've deleted the old part of the review but everything remained generally the same, some planes moved up and down but 1944 planes are matched with 1939 ones still. I'll just give one example, since I don't want to waste too much time writing about more planes like I did before. You can look things up yourself. 1944 F4U-1a corsair has the exact same battle rating as 1939 BF-109 E3, as well as some other 1939-1941 planes. The result? An unstoppable powerhouse of doom, such is the corsair flown properly. Nothing can compete with a late war Boom and Zoom energy fighter. It was so easy to club baby seals in it I genuenly felt bad. To summarize: This game used to be quite a good game during early release and beta, but some of the broken ufo planes never got fixed, the developers keep adding planes with placeholder flight models to this day, the pay to win gets stronger and stronger. First it was the crew skills, then upgrades, then premium planes with lower battle ratings and ufo flight models...etc No real reason to play this game unless you want to throw in some cash to get a big advantage over other playes, and/or only fly broken ufo or rediculously undertiered planes. If the amount of hours or dollars (120$) I have spent in this game doesn't not convince you I know pretty much everything about it inside out, here are some of my stat screenshots:Arcade -

												War Thunder stands undoubtedly as a title of great interest, both for fans of historical war games for anyone who has never experimented with such productions. Do the math with an interface not just immediate, in fact, the three styles available allow anyone to try their hand with the missions and the campaign, in single or multiplayer, enjoying a system of precise and multifaceted, as well as a 'strategic approach that on the one hand does not hide moments of waiting, the other is particularly satisfying when we are able to pull off the eliminations, perhaps in a context of great complexity. Beautiful to look at, full-bodied and engaging, War Thunder play hassle free and should therefore certainly tried			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I was really excited to play this, had a midweek sale and looked amazing was planning on buying at least one of the packs depending on how well I liked. BUT WAIT! Someone decided that they wanted to do a server update which basically made Thursday useless (at least in my time zone). Honestly my main problem is that one the main launcher it said nothing about this so I wasted an hour trying to log in and diagnose what could have been causing this. Luckily the 3rd/4th time I had to restart I noticed the Steam news saying that the servers would be offline for maintenance, which is fine updates are fine, but again would have been nice if the actual game said as much.

												A flight a day keeps the doctor away.  Unless a doctor is your wingman, and since it's free to play, there's no reason not to try it.The most basic aircraft can shoot down a paid-for plane.  If your first aircraft victory is with Russia, you even get a biplane that can carry rockets to take out pesky bombers that ignore your other guns!  See the following image for an example:

 Overview  War Thunder is a free-to-play [F2P] tank/plane arcade and simulation MMO hybrid. War Thunder is an online only game that requires a constant internet connection to play; there is no offline mode. You’re also required to create a Gaijin account to play, though the launcher is incorporated into Steam so no additional DRM is technically required.In War Thunder, you’ll be given the opportunity to control and play with several hundred tanks and aircraft spanning prewar to roughly the 1970s. You’re given the option to pick any starting nation you prefer: German, American, British, Japanese or Russian and chose to play either aerial battles [planes] or ground forces [tanks]. When you play, you’re given up to three vehicles to pick per battle and then placed into a game that is 16v16. There are different game modes, but your typical mode for tanks is capture-the-point, which can be won either by eliminating all player vehicles, or capturing 2/3 control points on the map to drain the enemies “ticket” counter. For planes, you’ll encounter forms of domination and “ground strike”. When the battle is over you’ll be awarded experience and silver lions, War Thunders in-game currency regardless if you win or lose. You can use the currency and experience to unlock new modules and better equipment for your vehicle, as well as newer vehicles as you advance up the tech trees of each nation.The battles are broken down into three types: arcade, realistic and simulation. Arcade mode is the most simplified of the three, hit markers, simplified physics and enemy outlines when aiming at an enemy vehicle are present in this mode. Realistic battles will have you encounter more precise physical issues [speed, g-force, turning speeds…etc], removal of tank outlines and slower battles overall. Simulator brings realism even further by attempting to simulate tank and plane controls, which removes play tags and forces the players to visibly identify friend and foe among many other differences. In simulator battles you can only play from the viewpoint of your crew. For a full list of the variations, I’d recommend checking the forums or their website for additional information.For those wondering, when it comes to F2P games, often the stigma is that they become very pay-to-win [P2W], forcing players to invest an unreasonable amount of money to stay competitive. Luckily, War Thunder stays clear of this pitfall. While there is premium currency called “golden eagles”, buying them only gives a few benefits. Firstly, you can use gold to buy premium account time or premium vehicles which give an increased amount of research and money revenue per battle. Secondly, you can use said gold to advance up the tech tree quicker or by cosmetic decals for your vehicles that may otherwise be unavailable. Often times you’ll find events held by Gaijin that will give you the chance to earn some of these items for free if you meet certain requirements in the allotted time. As someone who has played on both a basic account and my current premium one, there are no real advantages to premium time/gold aside from reducing the amount of time you need to grind out your next vehicle or module(s). A tank from a basic account is no better nor holds any advantage towards the same tank on a premium account. All that being said, let’s look at some of the core gameplay aspects.When it comes to gameplay, War Thunder is a great team game to play with friends. There’s a lot that could be said about it that I cannot possibly cover in this review, but after several hundred hours I still find it extremely entertaining. The battles are exciting, the maps are visually appealing, different and for the most part are well done and fairly balanced outside a few key issues that will hopefully be addressed in the future. Overall, the game runs quite smooth given the superb visuals and vehicle models. If you have the PC for it, the game can be visually stunning.The game really shines when you play with friends, or join a clan and compete with additional teammates. Playing solo isn’t bad, but being able to coordinate with your team, provide cover fire and create strategies mid-combat really brings out the fun in War Thunder and breathes a whole new level of skill and challenges into the game. That doesn’t mean the game is perfect. There are your occasional clipping issues, mismatched hitbox variations that don’t line up with what you see visually and the shell mechanics can be frustrating at times, but overall I’d say I’m quite pleased with how everything works in the long run; there’s always going to be hotfixes and changes that can be made to improve gameplay.In regards to UI, in game the controls and UI are well done. However, in the hanger [main menu] the UI could use some serious work. The messaging system, while improved, could use some extensive altercations to make it more user-friendly and less cumbersome to use. Message notifications, chat boxes and the invitation system all need work as well. It’s not a game breaking issue, but it can be annoying when you have to wade through menus trying to find something quickly.In the end, War Thunder isn’t for everyone, but I feel anyone with a competitive edge or a knack for playing MMOs will find it enjoyable. It takes some dedication and time to learn the maps, the controls and understand how the game mechanics work, which makes a bit of a learning curve for some. However, it is well worth the time to learn, especially at the low, low cost of being free.  Pros   Solid visuals, vehicle models and sound effects. Great by yourself, even better with a team or clan. It’s free so there’s no risk in trying it. Gaijin is constantly updating the game and fixing key issues that are brought up. Cons    The game has some clipping and hit-box issues in certain areas in various maps that need attention.  Aircraft in ground battles still need to be addressed. Grinding can be very time consuming. Teamplay is heavily geared towards those who join your squad; relying on random teammates is not advised. Overall, War Thunder has been a real pleasure to play. It currently stands as one of my favorite multiplayer games and even after so many hours invested, I haven’t grown bored of it at all. If you’re a tank or plane enthusiast or just love quality MMOs, then I’d highly recommend checking out War Thunder.			",640,214,19,74,89,12,80

They obviously want you to buy more planes with real money.  But the trouble is, you don't get enough planes to properly learn the game.  Frustraiting.

												To begin...Do not listen to the negative reviews about all the Russian bias because the developers are Russian.Every country is good in their own way.For example:Americans: Large amount of ammo, mostly acrobatic, good offence, generally bad defenceJapanese: Large amount of ammo, very acrobatic, good offence at higher calibres, very bad defenceRussians: Low amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, defence spans from good to horrible depending on plane.British: Decent amount of ammo, acrobatic, good offence, average defenceGermans: Large amount of ammo, moderately acrobatic, good offence, average defenceThe game mechanics in this game are very good. The diversity of planes is very good.You can play as army or aviation (tanks/ground vehicles or planes)Diverse selection of maps Many gamemodesThere are 3 levels of difficulty:Arcade - Recomended for new players who are still getting a feel for the mechanics - includes lead indicator to assist aim and planes do not rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available - enemy and friendly players stand outRealistic - Recomended for seasoned players who understand the mechanics - does not include lead indicator, planes can rip apart due to physics - First person and third person available- friendly planes stand out, enemy planes must be close enough for the pilot to identify the type of planeSimulator - True realism - Recommended for expert players - does not include lead indicator - locked to first person - enemy and friendly planes are not distinguishable until the player can identify them - basically simulating the WW2 battles.The game features a tree-like unlocking system, which includes 5 tiers of planes. As the tiers go higher so does the advancement of planes. There is an option to pay real money to unlock planes, however these planes can be unlocked without paying any extra money. There are also 'premium' planes, which can either be unlocked in bundles or bought. These planes cannot be unlocked without paying real money and also grant the user bonus experience from the plane. These planes grant little advantage to the user.The matchmaking system depends on two things.1 - Tier of the plane2 - Battle Ranking of the planeIf you have a tier one plane - you will be matched with tier one planes, BUT if you have a tier one plane that has a Battle Ranking of 2.3, you will be matched with Tier one and Tier two planes, which have a battle ranking of 2-2.3. This system is continued throughout the entire game.TL;DRThe Russian Bias in this game is not anything crazy like the community has exaggerated it to be. Every country has its advantaged and disadvantages. The game is very expansive with its content and the mechanics are well made. The game has many difficulty levels targeted for new players and expert players. There are microtransactions however you will be at no disadvantage if you do not participate in them. The matchmaking system is dependant on Tier and Battle Ranking. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder is an incredible free to play game. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail is mind blowing. Every model of plane or tank in the game is historically accurate. They have tons of future vehicles planned for the game. They really have only begun to scratch the surface, in terms of the aircraf that will be added. They also have plans to start bringing more tanks into play. The game is cross platform playable on Windows, Macintosh or PS4, which is just friggn awesome! I would still consider this game to be in beta, since they have so much more to add, and bugs to fix here and there. Sometimes, it can take several minutes to get into a match. Other times, you can't get into an arcade match at all. They have also had strange issues with spawning into a match also, where your tank for example will spawn inside of someone else, or you will fall from the sky. All of this stuff seems to be getting fixed though. The team developing this game has a real passion for it, and the history behind each vehicle in the game. It really shows!			",9,0,0,3,0,0,2

												while there are some good aspects of the game, such as being able to control tanks and planes of different nations, there are many downfalls to this game as well. Pros:- Addictive. It is very addictive and can be very entertaining if you don't mind some of the faults in the game. - The game looks somewhat nice, and for a free to play game it's decentCons:- Spawn Killing. There is a lot of it. And in RB tanks this is a real problem So much in fact that sometimes people don't bother with the objective and just doge the enemy in order to camp at their spawn almost five minutes into the match. You may be out there, capturing the point while killing enemies and then you get killed. It's okay though, because you have enough respawn points to get one of your best tanks. You drive forward, and bam, some guy sitting behind spawn is waiting there to kill you. They one shot you and you die. Of course though, you no longer are in the battle as there are no more respawn points. Great, some guy behind spawn killed you with little effort while you try to help your team.- Grinding. While it is a free to play game, the grinding is incredible if you don't plan on paying for golden eagles or lions. While you do get convertable research points when you are in battle, they are usless without you having to pay as the conversion cost not only costs those research points, but also golden eagles. So those are usless, even if you do have golden eagles because the conversion cost is insane.			",9,1,1,1,6,0,1

												Latest patch ruined the game, and the developer is refusing to revert back to the more fun and fair way it was set up before. Matchmaking is FUBARed. Going from all the tiers they had to only 5 tiers isn't working, and is making for completely messed up matches where sealclubbing is the order of the day (e.g. advanced WW2 fighters vs biplanes).Planes will often catch fire now much more easily and burn up or explode from a single hit. I've exploded from having a tailgunner on a bomber wing me with a couple rounds.They also increased the grind by 600% or more according to someone in the community who did the math. Their in-game currency was vastly debased when it came to converting XP. It's a huge money-grab on the part of the developer.Worst of all is the fact that Gaijin is actively censoring their forums, removing non-abusive posts criticizing the changes made in patch 1.37 and banning people, like me, from being able to post if they don't like the patch. They're also making troll accounts praising the patch and insulting people who aren't happy.A good game ruined by greed and a bad company. Stay away.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Mean while Nerfing any non-Russian plane or just out right refusing to fix them.   It is now turned into a horrible grind against more experienced players equipped with far better Aircraft;  due to their matchmaking pitting you against higher tiered opponents to ""encourage"" you to spend more $$ as well as their pitiful higher tiered game that no one wants to play and therefore everyone playing in lower tiers.If you didn't level up before 1.37..

												Grind thunder. Don't bother with this game.This game just makes you want to bang the wall with your head.You fire a 37mm hits the plane*Spark*Fire another*Spark*Another*Spark*10 shots later none do damage. Game servers are horrible, literally if their servers decide to be awful,than 9/10 of your shots will spark.The fourms are horrible the mods love banning people speak agaisnt Gaijob,Your post will be deleted you wont be allowed to post and you will get banned.They are money greedy, before premuims werent that high...All they want is your cash.A good game that is run by moronic cavemen that get excited at the sight of a fire(money).

												I cannot reccomend this game.I originally wrote this review in a bit more of a positive light, and I honestly wish feedback was excepted on the official forums. But, unfortanutely, this game lacks any form of dev support or care whatsoever.For starters, just reading the update posts by Gaijin made me want to delete this game and send it back to the bomb-crater it came from. Literally every other sentence was praising Russian historical documentation and how Russian books were the source of most of the information. And, honestly, I didn't care about that.What kills this game for me isn't that it's a Pay-To-Win game, it's a Free game that's Pay-To-Play. I was just fine in Tier 1 on my very first day, and I really looked forward to a grind and working up to my next tier of tank. I now regret sticking around that long.Ontop of that, matchmaking is the definition of team-stacking, with high-tier vehicles being placed specifically in one team, especially with things like Churchills. While my team cowers in fear, the enemy rolls over us in tanks a tier or even two higher than ALL of us.I wish this game was more open, and better. But, the devs of this game have destroyed it entirely. The match-making is despicable, the Pay-To-Win mechanic is absolutely disgusting, and the overall game would have been better off without both.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. More edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.EDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.-We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.-For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.-They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.Its nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog ♥♥♥♥ we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess._________________________________________________________________Such a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has to one up everyone else. * Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.			",80,7,4,11,8,0,1

You have a limited number of respawns in the same match, some maps has air&tanks units. I didn't found a proper way to organize battles, for people who does not have teamspeak is a free for all.It runs smooth (when it does not freeze), nice models and sounds.For a free game is ok.

												War Thunder is an incredible free to play game. The visuals are stunning, and the attention to detail is mind blowing. Every model of plane or tank in the game is historically accurate. They have tons of future vehicles planned for the game. They really have only begun to scratch the surface, in terms of the aircraf that will be added. They also have plans to start bringing more tanks into play. The game is cross platform playable on Windows, Macintosh or PS4, which is just friggn awesome! I would still consider this game to be in beta, since they have so much more to add, and bugs to fix here and there. Sometimes, it can take several minutes to get into a match. Other times, you can't get into an arcade match at all. They have also had strange issues with spawning into a match also, where your tank for example will spawn inside of someone else, or you will fall from the sky. All of this stuff seems to be getting fixed though. The team developing this game has a real passion for it, and the history behind each vehicle in the game. It really shows!			",9,0,0,3,0,0,2

												Welll the game is really fun and good practice for upcoming battlefield 1.  But the respawn system is pay to win type. They want only money.. there is a number of diminishing tanks or planes and you have different 3 tanks or 3 chances before it says to leave lobby and get back to hangger. I said diminishing tanks because you could buy extra ""back up vehicles"" with the ingame token bought by real money. Well that wes fine untill i noticed that the extra respawn is reduced by 1 after each match... meaning the money you invest goes in the drain. Plus they offer Premium Account. Atleast if they had unlimited spawn in premium account I would have given a thumbs up.. So dont waste your money in this game.  Thanks that they gave me inGame currency for completing tutorials.. I do not recomend this Gane unless they improve the respawn thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has such an up-down style of competence, so I would rate somewhere in the middle, but as there are only two options, I'm going to choose no.It can be immensely fun, and if made by ANY company rather than Gaijin it could be a VERY good game, but with the direction they're heading I'm not getting a fuzzy, warm feeling.On the good side, it can be amazing fun, with three different game styles with varying realism, and tons of different WW2 aircraft to choose from.After a few hundred hours, however, the downsides of the game really show.-The balancing in WT is usually questionable to downright bad, ESPECIALLY at higer tiers, where German and Japanese WW2 props see postwar American jets.-Russian bias? No. But definitely some extensive support for the russians from devs, where we get another Yak to add to the pile of 20~-No options to opt out of gamemodes, like the new and awful ""Air domination"" which is one big cluster♥♥♥♥ you don't want to be a part of. Also, odd ""Alternate history"" matches that really should be able to be deselected.This review is just for the Airplanes, by the way.

												It used to be a game i would willingly recommend to any of my friends to play. Those were the times where you'd actually get tanks of your era pitted against you. Now its bloody IS2s, Pershings and King Tigers going against some late war and many, many post war tanks. I've honestly lost count on how many matches i had with my 6.7 BR tanks where i have had the unfortunate ""match-making"" out me in with Leopards, M47s, Maus' and the odd T54 and M60 here and there. And there's that issue of Russian bias. If you want good evidence of it just take out any of their planes. They turn on a frikin dime, pump cannon rounds in to you and take god knows how many .50cal rounds. And their tanks...holy crap. T34s♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Tigers left right and center. I've gotten more kills in my T34-85 alone than in both my Tiger H1 and Tiger combined...and i started both the German and Russian ground forces tech tree at the same time (somewhat equal amount of grinding on both) And so many matches are filled with kids who have never heard of teamwork Jsut don't guys.

												Ignore the 0.5 hours, thats just the steam version. I'm in tier 5 America and have a positive kill death ratio in the P-51 Mustang. To anyone who has ever played this game long enough, you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of Christ. For anyone else, let me tell you why. This game has so much potential to be good, but it squanders it in the silliest of ways. So let me just get this out of the way, it is Russian biased. Not even gonna lie, don't have to because I'm in the safe Steam forums where KGB...I mean Gaijin developers can't execute my posts. Imagine this.It's a terrible day to be a tanker, the Germans have a tiger and you have 1 T-34, in real life you win by number advantage. In WarThunder, you win because the Tiger decided to replace it's armor with paper and lined it's hull with High Explosive ammunition. I can not believe how many times I have been ""Ammo Racked"" in a Tiger. You can be shot in the tracks, and your tank could randomly explode. How does Gaijin explain? The game is still in developement. That's why when tanks first came out, lets just reduce the listed capabilities of ALL German cannons by about 20% or if you wanna be technical, model it at 15 degree before even regarding what you're hitting, so technically you could hit something dead on, and still be penalized 15 degrees and just be glancing off.Is this just one case example? Definietly not. Everytime they put new stuff in the game (while completely ignoring existing issues), if it's Russian they just say screw it, raise all of its values from the previous plane, times that by 2, and make it a UFO. If it's anything else, case example the twin mustang, which is litterally a p51 times 2, is actually now 1/2 in value. Instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically, they add in more planes and with the twin mustang, were too lazy to even code the second engine. WTF logic is that?Look I'm not going to recommend this game. This game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me, were given false feelings of love. Frankly the kick that I can get out of this game is winning in a Tiger or P-51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that I like. If you play for that I applaud you. But for everyone else flying UFO planes and ww2 T-90's, you are so blind to how bad this game really is.Btw I can agree with many of the other negative reviews, but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people. The funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues, but still think this game is worth it. I don't, as a WW2 history enthisiast, I have been pushed to World of Tanks. That's how bad this game has become. At least War gaming has a method to their madness. Here, make sure you pray to RNGesus.			",45,0,3,5,6,0,5

												I started playing this back in 1.33 I think. Back then it was fairly well balanced though did have its issues. However, as of now, 1.55, the game is ridiculously unbalanced. The main focus of this review is aimed at the ground forces, but has some relevance with the planes as well.When tanks were first released, they were balanced quite well. You could go into a game knowing you could do well, regardless of which nation or tank you picked. Nowadays though, Russian tanks will one shot you, regardless of where they shoot at you, and they will bounce most shots you fire at them. Those shots that do penetrate rarely hit anything vital. For a long time I've defended against the whole Russian bias, but as of 1.55 I can no longer ignore it. A prime example is HE rounds. Russian HE rounds (designed for soft targets e.g. infantry) are about 4 times as powerful as any other country, this means even well armoured tanks will get killed by them.With the release of Brit tanks, we finally had something that could actually kill T-34s, but of course, they have since been nerfed, through either reducing armour, or by making rounds less effective. Fair enough on some of the ""updates"" they cited sources, however, they have not shown us where they get their data on Russian tanks.Until this balancing is address, I find it very hard to reccommend this game, which is a shame as the potential is there for perhaps the best game of its kind.

Lemme explain, so throughout the entire time I had played this game, which is longer than I have on my steam acount, Russian planes were and still are known as the most op s**t ever. ""Well c'mon the dev's can change it if you present historical evidence"", well it has been done, and you know what? The devs said it was just anti-russian propoganda. It seems like Gaijin is stuck with this whole nationalism thing even into a game. Now lets talk about the Community, it seems like Gaijin doesnt even F*****ING KNOW IT EXISTS. I mean c'mon, if you promise something, at least make something. For example, Gaijin promised bomber interiors for a long time, pass a couple years later, we have new airplanes, new tanks, new maps, and everything but F*****CKING what they promised. I have long stopped playing this game for myself, I only sometimes boot it up to play with my friend, but other than that, I am really done with this game. I would not recommend this game to anybody that wants historical accurracy, or fair matchmaking, or anybody who like to communicate with the devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now I can't.I don't have experience with other flight simulators (if you can call War Thunder a simulator), so I can't say whether the game is realistic and uses accurate flight models or not.But I can tell you that the game at it's current state is mostly not fun to play, and the developers seem to try to make the game more unfun with each update.There are two main reasons for this: the grind and the (un)balance.In order to research a new plane you have to invest a certain amount of research points towards it, which you earn by playing matches. When you finish researching the plane, you can buy it with ingame currency (buying the plane is not actually an issue, as you always have enough money).Doesn't sound too bad, until you see the numbers. At the start of the game it isn't too bad. A low tier plane costs around 9000 rp (research points) or less and you can earn at least 1000 per match if you do well. That's 9 games, fair enough.The problem is that rp requirements for planes get exponentially bigger and bigger, while the game only lets you earn about the same amount each game. To get a tier 4 plane (the game has 5 tiers), the Fw 190-D9 for example, you will need 89,000 rp, while you are only able to earn 1200 rp on average. That's about 75 games for one plane, and each game takes about 20 minutes.That means you need to grind for 25 hours for 1 plane. Want to get a jet? Play 500 matches.The game doesn't reward you for playing well either. Even if you eliminate several players every match, and even if you are the MVP, the game will only give you a pitiful 2000-3000 rp at most. It's a little better, but the difference is almost not noticeable. On top of that, Gaijin (the devs) keep adding more filler planes to the game that no one asks for. Those planes are virtually identical versions of planes already ingame, and I can think of no reason to add them other than as a way to slow the grind even further. They could have at least made researching them optional, but in order to advance in the tech tree, you have to research said planes. This means that you will find yourself finally researching a plane after many hours only to find it is the same as and maybe even a worse version of the previous plane. So to get to the plane you want, double (at least) the amount of time I mentioned earlier because you have to chew through a bunch of useless planes first.Gaijin couldn't care less about this issue, and has in fact reduced the amount of rp earned significantly over the years. RP gain has been reduced over time by approximately 99% (not even kidding) since I started playing. This is also why I have such a large number of hours played on this game, because had it been this way since the beginning I would have quit very quickly.This makes progressing the game a painful experience, and it is why I quit playing it.Now the second issue - balance. This one is a lesser issue to me because I didn't play game for historical matchups.The game uses a system called ""Battle Rating"" to match different planes together in a battle. A plane's battle rating is supposed to reflect its ability over its opposition (a combination of the plane's armament, speed and such things). Planes with a similar battle rating will be matched together. The problem is that the Battle Rating system makes no sense, and simply doesn't work.You will see planes from 1943 face planes from 1941, and planes from 1941 facing planes from even 1937.Planes that were rarely flown in real life are used en masse in the game against planes that never saw them in combat, and were perhaps obsolete by that time.Keep in mind that World War 2 lasted 6 years, and so a 2 year difference is huge. Also keep in mind, that most of the planes that fight aircraft older than them in the game actually matched their opposition well enough in real life.The result is that a large majority of the planes ingame are borderline useless, because at the same battle ratings there are more effective planes, and they are outperformed by their opposition (which probably never fought them in real life). Some planes are mediocre, and some are blatantly overpowered at their battle rating.If I feel like seal clubbing I can just take out my He 112-A0, F2A Buffalo, or almost any spitfire of choice (there are more options) and easily get up to 10 kills per match (in realistic battles) because my opposition simply stands no chance in their planes (of course I'd get next to no reward for this, but I sure would make a lot of people frustrated).In the case of the He 112-A0, the game thinks this plane should be match against biplanes, which simply stand no chance against a pilot who knows what he's doing.On the other hand, the entire heavy fighter and bomber lines in all nations are nearly completely useless. Bombers and heavy fighters are free kills to any pilot who knows his stuff in Realistic Battles (a tiny amount of exceptions does exist). Some fighters are completely helpless against their enemies, while some even a monkey can use and be an ace.Similar problems occur throughout the entire tech trees of all 5 nations.So why do these matchups exist? That you can ask only Gaijin, which if asked would delete your post and tell you there are no such things as balance issues in War Thunder.This brings me to the final part of this review, the developers.Any of the above will likely never be fixed. The developers' only feedback about the game comes through the forums. They don't read the English forums, and it's up to the community management team to take care of the user input.The way the forums are managed by those moderators honestly gives off a cold war communist regime vibe. Anything that may be percieved as disagreement with the way Gaijin does certain things, or as a complaint about a major issue in the game, is dealt with in a similar way. The post deleted, the poster maybe banned, and if enough people complain about the issue that Gaijin has to address it, they will claim it simply does not exist. There are many more problems with the game that I haven't mentioned because I haven't experienced them personally (simulator bomber abuse - no such thing according to Gaijin despite plenty of video evidence, the balance of jet era fighters, the ground forces aspect of the game in general).I'm not sure if the developers themselves don't care about the quality of the game, or if the community managers simply do not pass over the feedback.Either way, the developers think the game is fine as it is, and keep releasing more filler planes, more ridiculous battle rating changes that make no sense, almost as if their goal is to take what fun is left away from the game.Everything works perfectly well in Gaijin-land, comrade! (Except it doesn't).TL;DR:If you have a lifetime to spend grinding, and you don't mind the terrible devs and balance issues, play this game. It is free after all. But it's a waste of your time.

												War Thunder is a good game when you look at it as a whole, but when you play it you will start to notice that there's a lot of things that are wrong with it. The players have been screaming at Gaijin from day one that the so called battle rating system doesn't work, Gaijin have made several attempts to fix it, but they always do the wrong things to fix it. The game is losing all the old players because they have become sick and tired of Gaijin's way of fixing the game... ADD MORE STUFF! Ignoring the problems with the game completely. The latest major patch of the game, patch 1.53 had the shortest peak in player interest ever. I left the game not long after this patch after having played the game since 1,25.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has such an up-down style of competence, so I would rate somewhere in the middle, but as there are only two options, I'm going to choose no.It can be immensely fun, and if made by ANY company rather than Gaijin it could be a VERY good game, but with the direction they're heading I'm not getting a fuzzy, warm feeling.On the good side, it can be amazing fun, with three different game styles with varying realism, and tons of different WW2 aircraft to choose from.After a few hundred hours, however, the downsides of the game really show.-The balancing in WT is usually questionable to downright bad, ESPECIALLY at higer tiers, where German and Japanese WW2 props see postwar American jets.-Russian bias? No. But definitely some extensive support for the russians from devs, where we get another Yak to add to the pile of 20~-No options to opt out of gamemodes, like the new and awful ""Air domination"" which is one big cluster♥♥♥♥ you don't want to be a part of. Also, odd ""Alternate history"" matches that really should be able to be deselected.This review is just for the Airplanes, by the way. Ground forces is so terrible at the moment I don't even want to mention it. ",41,1,0,2,9,2,8

												I'm afraid I'm going to have to say this game used to be good, but blatant disregard for game balance by the developer has taken away from it in such a way that I cannont with a good conscience say it's going to be fun for a new player.Sure, there are some vehicles that are still tiered competitively, markedly some premium ones, but by and large, most nations' tech trees will make a new player want to drill holes in their head until they're mentally six years old. Incidentally, that is the age I suspect Gaijin's lead developer to be. But I digress.A new server update was pushed upon the playerbase recently, causing considerable backlash due to now nonexistent game balance exacerbated by bugs both large and small the developer has neglected to fix for one reason or another. The playerbase by and large advised against pushing the update immediately after the preliminary changelog was posted about 2-3 weeks ago, citing game breaking issues with balance that would be the result of it. As has been evident for everyone with half a brain cell, that is exactly what happened.To shed some more light on vehicles' battle ratings in this game, they are tiered in regards to each other by comparison of player effectiveness. This has led to some vehicles getting hilariously undertiered because they are abused in roles they're ill-suited for whereas others have been tiered so high you're depending on your opponent being cripplingly stupid to have any chance of killing him. I assume I don't have to point out the problems inherent in such a tiering model.To add insult to injury, some vehicles were given new ammunition types, ones they never had IRL. This has caused ground forces battles around certain battle ratings to have become increasingly lopsided for any nation that is not Russia as the new ammunition type is much more capable at penetrating angled armor on tanks.Add to that arbitrary nerfs to certain vehicles despite the explicit statement about historical accuracy and I can only recommend you do not spend any money on it, at least right now. Maybe things are going to get better once Gaijin has felt the pressure from decreasing income, who knows.			",68,5,0,11,8,0,34

												Ignore the 0.5 hours, thats just the steam version. I'm in tier 5 America and have a positive kill death ratio in the P-51 Mustang. To anyone who has ever played this game long enough, you will praise me as your new lord or repel me in the name of Christ. For anyone else, let me tell you why. This game has so much potential to be good, but it squanders it in the silliest of ways. So let me just get this out of the way, it is Russian biased. Not even gonna lie, don't have to because I'm in the safe Steam forums where KGB...I mean Gaijin developers can't execute my posts. Imagine this.It's a terrible day to be a tanker, the Germans have a tiger and you have 1 T-34, in real life you win by number advantage. In WarThunder, you win because the Tiger decided to replace it's armor with paper and lined it's hull with High Explosive ammunition. I can not believe how many times I have been ""Ammo Racked"" in a Tiger. You can be shot in the tracks, and your tank could randomly explode. How does Gaijin explain? The game is still in developement. That's why when tanks first came out, lets just reduce the listed capabilities of ALL German cannons by about 20% or if you wanna be technical, model it at 15 degree before even regarding what you're hitting, so technically you could hit something dead on, and still be penalized 15 degrees and just be glancing off.Is this just one case example? Definietly not. Everytime they put new stuff in the game (while completely ignoring existing issues), if it's Russian they just say screw it, raise all of its values from the previous plane, times that by 2, and make it a UFO. If it's anything else, case example the twin mustang, which is litterally a p51 times 2, is actually now 1/2 in value. Instead of making sure that the planes and tanks in the game work well and historically, they add in more planes and with the twin mustang, were too lazy to even code the second engine. WTF logic is that?Look I'm not going to recommend this game. This game feels like an abusive relationship in which many like me, were given false feelings of love. Frankly the kick that I can get out of this game is winning in a Tiger or P-51 because the odds are stacked so poorly in your favor that its the feeling of satisfaction that I like. If you play for that I applaud you. But for everyone else flying UFO planes and ww2 T-90's, you are so blind to how bad this game really is.Btw I can agree with many of the other negative reviews, but the positive reviews seem like they are from easily impressed people. The funnier ones are from people who recognize the blatant issues, but still think this game is worth it. I don't, as a WW2 history enthisiast, I have been pushed to World of Tanks. That's how bad this game has become. At least War gaming has a method to their madness. Here, make sure you pray to RNGesus.			",45,0,3,5,6,0,5

												2000 Gold Eagles to ducktape shrubs to my tank? Thats the last straw for me and it should be for you guys too! Don't support these money sucking Rusian biases anymore until they change thier ways. Gajin can take my credit card and shove it up thier @$$es.Cation, huge wall of text, but contains the truth. also, I apologise for any spelling errors. Thankyou for your time.My Professional Review:   To make this more professional, I have been playing War Thunder for over 3 years. I have ssen they game grow up and add lots of awsome features like ground forces and lots of game engine additions. They also added a lot of additions that are either poor or money grabbing scemes like the vehicle research and xp conversion system. And they battle rating which is and has been one of the biggest problems with the game. you might not think its a problem at low tiers but wait till you get to tier 4 or 5, then you will be ripping your hair out every match epecially if you are a bomber player. If they would just sit down and fix the BR, the game would be 3x more enjoyable and might even help fix some of the Russain and German bias you probably heard so much about. Last, is the Gajin staff and forum moderators. While I give them credit for some of the great work they have done, they completely disregard the community and thier oppinions which is another reason why this game isn't reaching its full potential. The staff always says that if you have any opinions or ideas to make the game better, to go talk about it on the forums. Most of the time they dont read any of the suggestions most of the time unless a post is attracting a lot of attention. If they don't like what the post has to say, they will take it down and ban the author from the forums because I guess they still don't have freedom of speech in Russia. What really irritates me is thier recent actions to the community like thier "" Russian Bias Party"" joke which while I agree it was kind of funny, was also unproffesional. What really upset me though was thier cash grab with the new tank customization features. After recieving community backlash about charging 500 Golden Eagles for tank customizations and bush camo, which I disagree with at least paying for the bushes. They then stated 2 days later that that was only a special and raised some of the bushes up to 2000 GE. I found this vulgar and unproffesional, Gajin has plenty of money not to do this yet they just keep trying to milk thier money maker of a game. If Gajin wants to keep thier community happy, they need to get thier act together anf if you are still here, welcome to the madhouse and don't pay Gajin a cent until they fix themselfs and the game.

												Dont look at my steam hours on this game. i played not from steam. It took me a long time to get to this point . I am not that guy who goes just about to rage after he was killed.. This review is a sum up of my expierence with gaijin from the long past time. I joined them in 2013 december. Back then it was only planes and was fairly good. Had its bugs pros and cons but was good. All went to hell with the patch 1.24... and from that on it went only down.. Then came the ground forces. Man it was good. Again alot of bugs but it was good.. you would kill and get killed but it did not bother me. And after every patch it got worse in groundforces. And you could feel the bias towards russian forces. And now it just RussianThunder. Why? becouse russians dominate tier 5, dominate tier 4 ,dominate tier 3. Before the Br spread and change 6,7 was really playble BR. Well you guesed it. Down came the br nerf"" it is for the people , to get the tier 5 battles going "" oh yeah right... only nation benefited from these BR was russia. There tier 5 beats the hell out of anybody. So ""free frags for the t54 t10m and is4!!!! Russian shells have also  better mechanics then other nations. 122mm shells just go trough anything. why other nations shells obey the laws gravitu ant etc... Russian armor: oh man those t34 bounce a tiger II shell even from a 50m distance, whell you now they had like 9999+ armor values... but somehow there 85mm go like a knife trough butter,,. My opinion: Stay away from this game!!!! save your selfs some time!! go out, dring beer,make a barbecue or a picnic dont now . Anything is better then this developers game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not waste your time on the tank mode of this game.You will be one-shotted in any tank you choose, (except the later tiered Russians of course)So many bugs and glitches, (Like invisible bombs falling from the sky, with no indication and no planes on the minimap)I was playing in a Tiger E and I drove about 10 meters away from an enemy Tiger II H. I shot him directly in the cheeks of his turret, on GREEN. (Green, indicating you can penetrate.) And it bounced.Russian tanks are overpowered and can practically one-shot any tank. Which makes playing any other line pointless and not fun at all.BR (Battlerating) Is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed. (Tier 3 tanks with 4.0 battlerating get's placed in tier 5 tank matches with 7-8 battlerating.)Paid $50 for golden eagles. Which got me to tier three. (gg)Glitchy repairs (The timer resets randomly sometimes, even if you don't get shot or anything. So you'll be on a minute repair, it get's down to like 20, and then it resets and goes to a minute again.)You can get oneshot/shot from across the map. (Literally, be careful going 25 feet away from spawn, you can and will get one-shot/shot.)Spawnkilling, yup, no spawn protection, no cover. You can literally spawn and be one-shotted.The list goes on and ON with bugs and glitches that they don't fix.-Honestly It's a waste of time, They refuse to fix these glitches and bugs, and I heard somewhere that they were going to BUFF the RUSSIANS. (?????????????????) THE ♥♥♥♥? Now, I don't know if that's true, but.. damn.-Planes is a lot nicer, but It's boring.			",211,10,8,14,18,0,4

												DISCLAIMER: I PLAY ONLY GROUND FORCESAfter 700+h on Steam and another 800 on the external client without Steam, it's time to say goodbye. So i write this review now:Simply put, WT is a game with good concepts of gameplay, but ruined by bugs and unbalance.WHY IT IS RUINED:1. Tier 5 of ground forces has been ruined by 2 things: HEATFS rounds, a type of shot which can penetrate any tank at any distance and moslty 1-shot it, and also ATGM carriers, a class of tank destroyer that can fire a guided missile that can 1-shot any tank at any distance, cannot be destroyed in mi-air, and this missile can be shot from full cover positions with just the launching rack exposed, with the actual tank becoming invulnerable to all frontal attacks.2. Other tiers ground forces is also ruined by huge quantity of bugs, like a shot that is suppsoed to pierce a maximum 120mm armor piercing 200mm, or a shot that is supposed to pierce 270mm bouncing a 20mm armor surface. Or again, tanks with a dead gunner being able to shoot at you anyway, shots disappearing in thin air... the list would be too long. Also physics are broken.3. Then there is also planes in ground forces. Oh yeah. If you do some kills in a match you get to drive a plane, each kill is worth 1 point you can spend for this plane, 2 points for rocket plane or 3 for bomber plane. You basically get to drive this plane for like 60 seconds, and you go and bomb or rocket tanks on the ground. Other people can come and shoot you down with 1 points fighter planes or also anti-air trucks can shoot you down. The point is planes are totally unnecessary, are spammed every 5 seconds, people uise them as kamikaze on tanks, and so on.4. In Realistic mode it's even worse, people can bring their own planes and use them indefinitely, so it's a big bomb / rocket spam all along on tanks, while players maybe want a TANK battle not being bombed every 30 seconds.5. A lot of tanks are premiums, you have to pay to get them or drop and complete Golden Wagers, which are nigh impossible to do. Those premium tanks are often overpowered, not all of them but most, and give you an edge on other players. I know this is F2P but some are ridiculous.6. Sometimes there are events, where you can get premium tanks for free, often ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones or ""special"" ones who are just reskins of existing ones, very rarely good ones. These events are always incredibly frustrating, not difficult but just frustrating. But, if you have Golden Eagles (premium credits), you can actually PAY and complete the tasks of an event instantly! Or even better, in some events you can buy a premium ticket, which allows you to get unlimited chances to perform specific tasks and so get an HUGE advantage above non-paying players, and in these events the number of special tanks is limited to say first 200 players on the leaderboards... so or you pay for the premium ticket or forget about getting even close to the special tank no matter how good you might be.7. Tanks are often incorrect about what ammo they carry respectively to their historical counterparts, and shot mechanics are completely broken, it can happen you shoot the enemy's ammo rack with a cannon, and the ammo becomes yellow, or orange, that means damaged, or even black, which means destroyed, but NOT explode, and then the enemy kill you. Same can happen for any other part or crew member, it is totally realistic a crew member can survive a cannon shot in the chest and be only wounded right?8. Maps are often bugged and tanks can actually often shoot THROUGH buildings, concrete walls, steel beams, trains and so on... so don't be surprised if you see killcams of people shotting you through a house or a steel beam.9. [1.61 Update] Last stand mechanic re-introduced. Basically, tanks used to die if they had 1 crew member alive left. Now they do not anymore, but instead thet last crew member can use Gunner or Driver positions as you choose, and you can now request ""reinforcements"" to replace dead crew members with new ones. They will respawn directly in your tank. Honestly, last nail in the coffin.===This might have been a bit ranty and i apologize, but this is completely true. Try for yourself if you want.This was a good game before OP tanks, before Maus (which i own), before HEATFS and ATGM, before plane spam, before events you can pay to win.It is not anymore.

												(I have played 200 hours on PS4) I mainly play germans i dont care if u disagree, its just my opinion, I was not in ww2 so I dont know everything about it.  Russians are way over powered, battle rating system messed up e.g tiger 1s going against IS 2s and ISU 152s when historicaly they versed T34s and K-V1s and smashed them. but what really puzzles me is that the game  is not realated to time for e.g when the jagtiger (came out in late 1944-45) it is versing late 40s to late 50s tanks which kind of defeats the porpouse when they say it one of the most realistic ww2+pre and post  games out there. but what upsets me the most is that the german armour is so weak when in real life it was very good the best example would be the panther it couldnt be pened by a 76 at 2000m. in summary it is an unrealistic game, which is unfair for the japs brits US and Most of all Germans. when i saw ""get know us"" (credits) i saw the whole team was of some slavic background apart from a couple (no exaggeration). I have not been in a single game were a german played says ""**** this game"" or ""Soviets are op"" (because of how easily germans get blown up) but what sums it up best..

												Do not waste your time on the tank mode of this game.You will be one-shotted in any tank you choose, (except the later tiered Russians of course)So many bugs and glitches, (Like invisible bombs falling from the sky, with no indication and no planes on the minimap)I was playing in a Tiger E and I drove about 10 meters away from an enemy Tiger II H. I shot him directly in the cheeks of his turret, on GREEN. (Green, indicating you can penetrate.) And it bounced.Russian tanks are overpowered and can practically one-shot any tank. Which makes playing any other line pointless and not fun at all.BR (Battlerating) Is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed. (Tier 3 tanks with 4.0 battlerating get's placed in tier 5 tank matches with 7-8 battlerating.)Paid $50 for golden eagles. Which got me to tier three. (gg)Glitchy repairs (The timer resets randomly sometimes, even if you don't get shot or anything. So you'll be on a minute repair, it get's down to like 20, and then it resets and goes to a minute again.)You can get oneshot/shot from across the map. (Literally, be careful going 25 feet away from spawn, you can and will get one-shot/shot.)Spawnkilling, yup, no spawn protection, no cover. You can literally spawn and be one-shotted.The list goes on and ON with bugs and glitches that they don't fix.-Honestly It's a waste of time, They refuse to fix these glitches and bugs, and I heard somewhere that they were going to BUFF the RUSSIANS. (?????????????????) THE ♥♥♥♥? Now, I don't know if that's true, but.. damn.-Planes is a lot nicer, but It's boring.			",211,10,8,14,18,0,4

												Look, lets be honest here, War Thunder was amazing back before russia became ufo's and the compressions of the Battle ratings, but i honestly cannot recommend this game.let me explainyou have a tier 2 plane at say a b.r of 2.7, any yet you get matched with some tier 3 planes at a b.r of 3.3 or less, and it makes it hard to enjoy. also the new g-lock system where u faint after too many G's, its a good system... Just take it out of arcade battles. next point, the s500 or commonly known as the AAA, these godly overpowered things will one shot you from 2.0km out or more, how do i know you may ask, because i have been sniped way to many times by them and it is just unfair, understandable if it was base AAA, then snipe away but these are placed near the middle of the map and you are screwed if you go to close to them.all in all it was a great game but not now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After around 150 hours of flight, plus tests etc (started without steam client then moved here).[LONG post incoming...and a bit of rant after the break...beware!]Read comments for updates.Premise: part of the negative review is due to the Free 2 Play model and company/moderator policies towards customers/community (paying and non-paying). The other part was for having the prices of the packs go up during or just before Steam Summer Sale. Not a smart nor respectful move if you ask. Let's see if a negative review hits the soft spot more than a comment cancelled and a thread closed on the main forum to ""keep people at bay and show only one point of view"".F2P model:Not a huge fan of F2P but I gave it a try since I like flight sims. This F2P is not Pay 2 Win but it can get your money out of anger instead of encouraging you to pay for the fun you had (oh and to avoid the grindy grind, but this seems fair enough).Like being competitive from the get go based on your skills only? Not in this game, well, almost. I also don't like this F2P model in particular (Riot/LoL is a lot better IMHO but probably won't work in this game), too much advantage if you use some money in the early tiers. Gamplay levels out in mid tiers. After some hard times trying to face paying players at the beginning you can compensate with experience. Just touched a glimpse of pre-end-game and it seems to get there again. Face experienced players and pay to have some advantages (or not be at a disadvantage) with crews that can only be bought with real money. You can also get more strategic choices with planes lineup and some planes (unbalanced in many subtle ways) that will probably get fixed in the end.Hard to be sure because of the many variables but I had the impression that as long as a match is between non paying customers (some hints on how to recognize them, not 100% sure) it's balanced, otherwise you're facing a veteran player or a paying player. In short: money can substitute experience. As I said not a fan of this model but not game-breaking too, just pretend you were against a veteran or pay for the product you're using.About game modes:- Arcade is quite fun and can be enjoyed without any special equipment typical of the Flight Sim genre, so if this is your case sure give it a try. Less skill based than other modes, just less waiting in queue and more action in game. Badly unbalanced at times. Bomber gameplay broken and game breaking. Matchmaking is questionable at best. If you do good it will penalize you with worse teammates. Some bugs here and there and improvements to be done (collisions, hitboxes and kill assignment) but also positive development on interface features polishing.- Realistic battles are too much of a compromise to me but this is quite personal, they can be fun with a friend and spending some money not to be at a disadvantage with crews and upgrades. Just a warning for all the joystick users: you have to just go directly to Simulator mode here or might have more fun with other flight games because of the mouse issue (Arcade/Realistic battles with joystick vs. mouse users? If you like a tough challenge...mouse users have a sniper rifle, joystick users have a knife, sure you can win a round or two in Close Quarters Battles...but...err...yeah). - Simulator: they're apparently shifting from the simulator aspects towards an almost Arcade oriented game. I might be wrong but this is not bad per se. Simulator is tough to get right and is a money sink, also not fun for the big audience. Some really good premises but slow progress on this game mode, mainly due to lack of interest by the server population. Not Gaijjin's fault, they have a limited but good team on that. Just lack of interest in this mode, though I have to admit that most of the simulator crowd bled away in the past months due to this already starting shift in priorities and some game breaking issues not getting attention (bomber's gunner view and sniping precision for example).You can stop reading here..._________________________________________________________________Still with me? Then probably you're interested in why I gave a negative review...The game is good. It is fun (sometimes not, but others have to win, you know the 50% win rate rule in competitive games ;)).  Pretty solid server infrastructure. The community is a bit harsh on some points but you can ""almost"" ignore this aspect and just enjoy the game until...Until the company policies and forum policies gets in. Luckily we have a right to post our concerns on steam, otherwise the impression given by the forum would be quite far from reality for the average joe.Let me explain better: complaints and criticism are not met well, even if expressed in a respectful and (hopefully) mature form. Plenty of posts cancelled and/or edited. For example my second post on the forum got cancelled, seen happening the same for at least 2 other people in less than 2 weeks. I'm feeling bad about not having freedom of speech but you know, it's an overrated privilege :P.Example: prices for packs on steam went up just when the steam summer sale started, so they were 1 euro more expensive even at a 25% discount than before sale started.I just replied to someone pointing out that Gaijin had the power to fix a matter brought up by the Steam Summer Sale.Less than an hour later my post was removed and the HOT thread closed with people mocked and insulted by a Senior Moderator for ""gambling"" on the sale. I mean, who wants to pay more for less? If I know a steam summer sale is coming, I can wait a couple of days to see what I can get. Complaining for a ""wrong"" policy might have been too much, but suggesting to evaluate if it could be handled in a positive way is another thing. Or at least I thought so...anyway I perceived the price change as a bad move and I expressed it. Result: I was told I ""gambled"" and ""lost""...but my money are still in my wallet and they ""lost"" 2 sales...not sure who ""gambled"" here... Want to do F2P? Get it right or beat your community to get money from anger instead...I don't get it but I might be wrong, only time will tell, sure I learned a lesson and I am curious about the future of the company and of the game ;)To conclude the review on more game oriented negative aspects, almost exclusively about the Air Combat part of the game, Ground forces are not my bread and butter.Many things that can improve gameplay a lot are not top priority (MatchMaking balance, planes' Battle Rating balance, Flight Models and Damage Models) apparently for financial reasons to create artificial shifting gaps that attract money. This is not big news, I've seen masters of this strategy in the last 15 years and Gaijin is just making some experience in the field. If it floats their boat they're right to do so.Emphasis on new planes (sometimes with completely broken flight models) might be good or bad, depending if you like a good polished game or a dynamic one with frequent news.Grind is a bit tough but can be accepted if you have patience and dedication. Progress is like hitting a wall in the late tiers, approaching endgame, but I admit that I agree with them, if you get there you have to pay for what you got.Honestly I was in the process of doing so, just thought that with the sale I could buy 2 packs, one for me and one for a friend who played with me up to here. Just got a bad feeling about this. I'm going to buy one pack anyway probably because I feel guilty for the fun I had before. I just wanted to point things out so they can at least see it, I know they don't care but I never lose hope in mankind :P. Other people might be interested as well before committing to the game.Thanks for reading through, hope this puts things in perspective for a game that has so much potential for the Flight Sim genre and for gaming in general.Wolf			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning:  this game may cause you to swearThe developers have done a good job in making War Thunder a reasonably realistic MMO wargame.Lately, I have been playing the tanks and can report to you that the key to knocking out an enemy tank is to kill all of its crew (as opposed to the tank having hitpoints - as it is in the other major MMO tank game).This game may take a little bit to get used to, but once you do, it can be addictive fun.I believe War Thunder deserves at least one award for its hard work (including research and development) in bringing the nearly-forgotten war machines to life.

												My favorite free to play game! I currently have 220 hours in and I haven’t spent a cent on it! Yes it does take some time to get more advanced planes but if you can be patient about it you can still unlock them without purchasing anything. The graphics are amazing, and the gameplay is intense! You could get into firefights that could last up many minutes. There’s no reason for you not to try this game out! It is also extremely optimized so you can play this game on a less-powerful rig.

												Dont download this game. ive been playing it for a long time now and honestly, through all the rampant hate for thsi game i can say at this moment ever word is justified. Gaijin (based on my view) has no intention of making a game for the gamers, of making a game that someone wouldnt hate after 10 minutes. 1.53 officially killed it, once i saw how much was behind a paywall i knew that the game had reached the point of no return.

												Used to be a good, fun game to play either by yourself or with friends.But then greed. Greed ruins everything.So when I last played this game, it was a fun as heck F2P WWII dogfighter game with an excellent matchmaking system, was not p2w, and was well optimized with great graphics! But then I heard what they did to the game, and died a little. They ""REVAMPED"" the matchmaking by decreasing the amount of teirs that are sorted by your level, skill, and plane that helps to keep the powerful planes with people of their strength. This lead to said powerful planes (witch consits of paid planes too) to leak into the less powerful planes matches, and causing the less powerful planes to not have a plesent experiance. After hearing that and reading a few of the other reviews which gives a much better and more recent review, I am not happy. This game used to be great, but then they ruined it.TL;DR I would NOT give this developer any attention or money until they forget greed and fix the system, IF they fix the system.

												If you wanna play a game full of bugs, terrible unbalanced, bad optimized, and with a community dying due to the previous stuff ive mentioned, and the moderators, staff abuse in general, and if you are a masochists then this game is for you. Otherwise  ( and of course unless you are a communist since all the russian vehicles are OP on poorpuse besides all the denials from devs/mods and other staff, which also includes their soviet cold war era rules ) then i reccomend for you to NOT to play this game, and either save your time and money for other actual games or upcoming games which in even earlier stages of development than this one, they are more solid and advanced in many several ways than this piece of commie crap.

												The game was fun to play, now its horrible.Constant one hits in both aircraft and tanks, tanks especially make this game so keyboard smashingly frustrating I have decided to quit playing.  The balance of nearly every game you play is WAY off.  In aircraft arcade mode nearly every fight is dominated by jets and other aircraft with seemingly impossible aircraft physics.   In tanks you are cruising out looking for prey then suddenly you explode from and exploding ammo load or your crew is rendered unconscious!  So you spend money to get extra crew training points and to upgrade to ace crew and it makes little difference.There is nothing in the game to encourage team play, I play this with a few friends and its impossible to actually play with them.  Another player here refered to it as a complete free for all, he/she is 100% right.Hit aim indicators are pretty much useless, especially in tanks.  You get a green armor penetration marker, you fire a shot knowing that the round should land on a vulnerable location then all you get is ""no damage"" or a complete miss.  Drving a big♥♥♥♥♥tank through the woods you clip a tree then your tank track breaks -.-  are they made from used condoms and tissue paper?  Vehicle models for ground forces are absolutly nuts.  Russian vehicles are OP, game developer is russian, nuff said.Historically the game is way off, if you spend the time and do your research on vehicles you will see what I am talking about.  Now look at both positive and negative reviews!  Positive reviews are for the vast majority from people with very little playtime and only a few sentences long.  Negative reviews from players with HUGE play time and the majority of them are quit long and descript.  I have spent a long time reading the negative reviews, I agree with them all.  1.37 destroyed the game in favor of capitalism.  1.39 did little to rectify anything.Moderators and support in general is TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE, I actually got chastised by support staff in my last two tickets even though they where acurrate, polite and somewhat complimentary!  The support staff for this game need public execution and mature experienced support persons to take the reigns.Short of it is:  The game is terrible, when you have a problem expect little in the way of help, once you get into a teir 3 vehicle you will just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over making progression nearly impossible.  DONT play this is you love MMO's  This game is marketed as an MMO, its missleading.Pardon spelling, in a rush :)Game sucks donkey balls - Enc out ",8,0,0,0,0,0,3

												This game should be renamed to ""Russia Thunder"". Its a good game. But its not about skillz. Its about who plays Russia. Couldnt expect less since Gaijin is a russian company. They got the best shells, best armor and the best lucky. You have 25% chance of onehit a russian tank. But they have 100% of onehit you. lol. Since its a russian game, of couse, the US tanks and planes are the worse. haha. They really dont like amaricans. So have fun. If you wanna win, dont forget: play as russian. :DI play this game. But i do not recommend it.Go play World of Warships. Its a fair game.			",11,0,0,0,0,0,1

												I'm trying to write a review somewhat base on my experience. For playing almost 3 yrs grinding with the Germans, Americans, British and the Japanese but not the Russians because i don't have the time and interest.Whether is tanks or aircrafts each faction has its own ups and downs. However every battle i jump into, the Russian will win often whether is alone or joint with other factions. Maybe it could be map design or people complaining about broken MM(Match-making),FM(flight model) and many things in the game if you read the forums in the communitiy. For the most important part is that i refuse to believe ""Russian Bias"". You can win by communicating to team, best played with a friend through Skype or Teamspeak. It takes skills and observation in the battlefield and knowing the weakspots of your enemy. But now due to recent updates and horrible fixes of the game it became somewhat unbalanced mostly Match making and the graphical glitches where you see your enemies behind a wall or bushes when you are not aiming your gun sight. Sometimes the hit detection doesn't inform you whether you make a confirm hit of the target or not. Not to mention the amour physics can be a bit whackky.

												In a very big nutshell:BEING GERMAN IS SUFFERING, AVOID. These russians have a huge bias against them not because of nerfed plane models, but instead they make GOOD GERMAN PLANES OVERPRICED to the point where you break your bank AND THEYRE TIERS are TOO HIGH so youre paired with allied flavour of the month planes.Russian biased developers who tweak and nerf planes that were presented to them accurately by their international flight team and make russian planes overpowered and dirt cheap to repair (which just quit a week ago because they discovered this and a whole scandal ensued).Grinding like you've never seen before (It makes World of tanks look easy unless youre like that one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who bought a years worth of premium and spent $1400 on this game.)Pay to win features shoved up your face (you only made 10k lions this match but buy premium and get double your lions now!!!) (You can have 6 people in your squad with premium! Which still doesnt work).Overpowered planes that usually are flavour of the month (F4U Corsair, Bearcats, Pay to win Spit Mk IX, Vampire, La 7FN, etc) becoming either nerfed the next big patch or made overpowered even more.Did I mention it has terrible hit registration?Ура вы♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥России))))))Update to my Comment:Unfortunately, my comment still rings true and Gaijin dumps this game down the drain once more. Im not surprised because my first comment already explains whats wrong with this game, the new 1.37 patch just amplifies the difficulty and bias of the game even more to the point where now youre practically required to use p2w planes and have premium in order to grind at a decent speed.

												first off let me say warthunder is a great game with lots of potential, but it will never reach the full potential, heres why:1.the russian biasit is pretty self explanatory, the devs are russian and so they need to beef up their tanks and planes to make them look better than they were historically.2. the pushing of premiumthe devs constantly push you to buy premium by shoving it in your face as you log in or by telling you that you could be in in tier 5 right now if you had given them your life savings.3.Overpriced premium packsThe premium packs can cost upwards of 100 usd. its sad i know4. extremely slow progressionprogression takes too long, its just a way to get you to buy premium.5. the preium biasyes i know its pretty sad but if you buy premium your ingame performance magically just improves. your guns and armour do so much better.so dont buy into this game or pay the devs money. they dont deserve it they never will. also dont go onto their forums, everyone is toxc and so are the leading moderators who are rude arrogant and vulgar.

												After putting in a metric ton of hours into this game and around £140 into it ive come to the conclusion that its just not worth it.This game is really great at times, there is however a weird parity, its regarding planes, they are great because you can use a tier 2 plane to completely destroy a tier 4, it gives options. Sadly this gets you limited research points not sure why and that becomes a problem, it forces you to use planes you probably dont want to use. for example spitfire vlc has quad 20mm but the game wants me to use a spitfire xvi which has dual 20mm and dual 7.62mm which is worse at everything apart from top speed. Make making is odd because its rarely on point, you either slaughter the enemy or get slaughtered, it could be due to the number of people that are playing it though. By the time you get to tier 4 you have to put in around 20-30 hours to research a plane which is halfed if you waste money on premium. At tier 5 you will need to push an insane 50-75hours for a plane and that extends by 10hours the deeper you go into tier 5 its a massive grind. Tanks however are worse, firstly you get less kills, this means less research which in turn means it takes a lot more time to get a new tank, you are at a disadvantage if you dont have premium there. Afterthat the balance for the tanks is shameful, it comes down to pretty much having your tanks go from epic to paperweights with a minor change to the battle rating system, you arent given that choice and that bugs me big time. I used to be fine with this because i didnt have anything else to play but once i realised war thunder was turning into a monthly subscription to me i had to draw the line somewhere.

												I first tried this game back in august 2013. I really really enjoyed it for a few weeks. Back then there were only planes in this game and since I was a beginner, I could unlock new tier aircraft rather fast without putting money into the game. I did however buy a few premium aircraft at a very 'reasonable price' ('good old times') simply beacuse I was enjoying WarThunder so much and also wanted to support the devs for this increadible WW2 fighter aircraft game.Being a hardcore aviation junkie I spent most of my time on the realistic battles. The arcade battles are just way too unrealistic for my taste, however I still do play them alot and enjoy them aswell. After a while I stopped playing WT but after a few months break I came back. This was before the ground forces and the game was pretty much the same as the first time I played. I still did enjoy it very much and there was nothing to complain about.Later the ground forces was added to the game. I installed WT again and started playing tanks. In the beginning I did not enjoy the ground forces at all, simply beacuse my lowest tier tanks were facing higher tier tanks with proper armament whilst I had a worthless low caliber gun on my tank. I simply could not get any kills. Therefore I lost interest in the ground forces very fast but went back to the air battles again. I enjoyed the air battles very much but this time around I noticed that, particularly the russian aircraft were OP. Maybe this has always been the case? but I did never notice it as much as I did this time around. Then I bought a steampack where I got some golden eagles and a premium account. I also bought even more golden eagles and bought a ridiculously, insanely expensive premium tank. It literally cost close to 33 euros! For ONE god damn TANK! However I did start playing and with a premium account I enjoyed the game more then ever. Nowadays I pretty much only play tanks because I want to unlock them all. But even with a premium account unlocking new tanks was ridiculously expensive. All the time I have to spend my money on golden eagles to buy lions. This is getting really expensive. If this was a game that cost 60 euros on the steam store, you would save soooooo much money on just buying it once. The prices are insane. They are disgusting. And this is what ruins the game for me. I enjoy the game but its getting way way too expensive!Another HUGE problem is how OP the russian tanks are! Just because the devs are russian it does not mean they should make the russian tanks 2x better than the germans. The IS-2 for example! It is ridiculous! It can take hits like nothing else, and it one hit kills the god damn Tiger pretty much wherever it shoots. Same goes with the aircraft as always. This is a major issue that has to be fixed. However I highly doubt that they will ever fix it.All in all, the biggest issue with the game is the fact that it is virtually impossible to play without a premium account! I would be fine with that as long as all I needed was a premium account! But this is NOT the case! Even with an expensive enogh PA, I still have to put TONS of money into the game! This is solely a PAY TO WIN game and NOTHING else. Even though I love the game itself I am quitting altogether! I am not going to play this anymore simply because its so god damn expensive!

												If there's anything good to be said about War Thunder, then that is the graphics, because it is truly impressive and beautiful. The planes are all nicely worked out, and there's nothing like an airplane falling from the sky unloading machine guns on an enemy fighter, as well as the explosions and fires equally impressive. The sounds that accompany all the bullets, guns, bombs, rockets and anti-aircraft artillery are pretty impressive (and very high!). The music is appropriate and of good quality, but forgettable, since we are busy enjoying the blue backdrop. We can also paint our planes with a variety of different emblems and symbols to our liking. There are also several maps, and some of them with a night mode.			",109,6,2,3,5,0,5

												If you want to play make sure you go Russian and have your backup nation be Germany.  Do not play US or UK lines.  I do not even know why they bothered to put those tanks in the game they are so broken and unplayable it will lead you to quit.  I quit 3 different times for months on end because I was stupid and went US as my main line and UK as my backup.  If you plan on going US or UK lines just do yourself a favor and don't play the game.   Don't be me. Gaijin seems to think putting a 75mm M3 cannon on your M4A3E2 Jumbo ""Heavy tank"" and giving it a 5.3 Battle Rating (the same gun your first crappy 3.3 BR sherman has) so you can go up against Tiger's which you can't even pierce, from behind, point blank is just hilarious.  Especially when they can pierce your front with ease and 1-shot you every single time. When you get up around the 5.3-5.7 BR games you can tell which team is going to lose before it even starts when you bring up the scoreboard and you see which team has the most US / UK tanks.  That team is going to lose every time.Until they balance the game don't bother playing.  Its pretty boring when every corner you turn has a T34 or a pzIV/tiger (or both!) ",33,4,0,6,6,0,3

												A lot of people hate the game because Gaijin changed things for the worse. Arcade is increasingly unbalanced with premium planes, no one wants to do Realistic because if they go 2fast4u, the wings rip off, engine failures, ammo problems, spin outs, everything real planes are susceptible to, or because Germans get 1-shot by 'mericans. However, if you can look past the fact that increasing imbalance has caused the game to become more ""unenjoyable"", I beg to differ all of these negative reviews.Firstly let's start off with my experience. I have at least 400 hours logged from the game before I joined Steam. I've played for about a year now, before steam, so I know what I'm talking about.Okay. So about the game itself - It's a WWII simulation. Arguably the best damn one out there that is and will be for a number of years. Mechanics in general are great, and you can fine tune your planes (And as of June, tanks) to however you want to have them. There is a higher level of customization in the game than people think - You can add decals, paint the vehicle (After getting all upgrades for it, which is kinda bs but whatever), select what bombs/turrets/bullets you want your plane to use (depends on the plane/tank), etc etc.Playing with friends is very easy. Just set up a squadron with them after finding them in the chat. Send them a mail, add them to your friends list, then you're good to go for playing together with them.Another thing is that the combat, while steadily becoming unbalanced from how it was over a year ago, is both intense and drawn out. Most of your time will be comprised of flying around actually looking for people until you're ~500km away from them. Ghost Shots can be an issue if someone knows what they're doing and can actually aim without having to use the target system that shows up on your screen. Overall though, when you do get into combat, it can be intense and very fun, and damage on your plane is very noticeable (Look on my video section for a War Thunder intro video, there are a lot of shots where my plane(s) damage is shown). There is little music in the game, if any. It is recommended that you just turn on your radio/pandora/personal playlist/MP3/iPod or whatever else you have and jam to your own tunes. Keeping sound effects is optional because 3/4 of the time all you'll hear is the engine sound. The other 1/4 are planes shooting and random radio calls that get annoying (""The enemy has taken the base! We must get it back at all costs!"" - No♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock).Overall, the game is very enjoyable if you're not SUPERHARDCOREPVPMUSTWIN. Just be casual about it, enjoy it for what it is and you'll have a grand time on it like I do. Give it a shot and if you don't take it too seriously, you won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: Don't play this game. In it's attempt to be realistic, it sacrifices fun. It's patonizing, and teaches you nothing about it's core systems, while constantly telling you how to not crash into the ground. Bad controls, bad gameplay, and just not fun. Avoid. Go play Ace Combat instead. 4/10 (Numeric breakdown at the bottom.)A truely awful experience. I tried this game while losing a bet, but tried to go into it with the best mindset possible. After all, I'd wanted to try for awhile, and Ace Combat 0 is one of my favorite games. Not the same thing, I know, but, hey, maybe I'll love it!I didn't. Going in, the tutorials are god awful, meandering around and teaching things in reverse order (Such as telling you to speed up to a certain speed, THEN teaching you where the speed indicater is), and telling you simple stuff. I'm aware this is nessecary, and I'll let it go. After all, what is a tutorial but a ""how to play games."" (Although, there were a TON of ""Yeah, I get it."" moments..)So, I was let into the game, and it was just boring at it's finest moments. And at all other times, insulting and confusing. The game boils down to ""Put the circle over the enemy's circle and win."", but it doesn't.  It kept popping up reminders to ""shoot the lead indicator"" and ""don't fly into the ground."" Reminding me of core, simple concepts while I puzzled why my screen was going black, or my gun was refusing to fire.  Even with these problems, I was only downed four times in five games. One was a strait forward victory, but the others were caused by being rammed, either by my team-mates or enemies, or a single occasion was my engine cut out, only to allow an enemy to take off my wing with a single shot, leaving me helpless. I was later informed that the game, in it's claim to realism, decided to make guns jam with rapid fire, pilots lose consciousness at turning to much, and bullets be useless unless you hit something vital, if they hit at all. While these are interesting concepts, and true to life, they do not make for a fun experience, especially when they are never explained in game.The control feels sluggish and sloppy, often wavering dangerously out of control, or jerking to a knife turn with a slight shift of the mouse, when it's not slowly plodding along to get where you want. Again, I feel this is probably due to the game's aim towards realism, but it feels boring, and irritating. The visuals are nice, but I don't have much to say on this, as I don't much care for graphics in this day and age.The menu's are likely more understandable with time, but I felt confused as I just pushed buttons to go along with what they told me. Researching and buying and equipping weapons, nor crewing is ever explained, and left me feeling confused and upset when I felt no effect. Once again, this is very likley due to my short playtime, but I feel it needs to be much more well explained. All and all, it's a pretty game, and for those model plane collecting realism fanatics out there, you may have some fun with this, but not being able to turn the camera to look at your plane will take away from your pleasure of this. Numerical breakdown: Visual: 6/10I know nothing about planes, but the ones I got seemed...accurate, I guess? The clouds and the explosions were lovely to look at, but it's hindered by the fact you never will get time to take it all in. I ran the game at high, and it looked very dull and lifeless.Gameplay: 3/10I hated my short time in War Thunder. I didn't feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥pilot, dodging fire and chasing my enemies down to their inevitable defeat. I felt like I was piloting a cranky hippo, and slowly following other hippos as I plinked at them with spit balls until they fell down out of pity. Usability: 4/10The UI is competent enough, but due to the lack of explanation on anything important, you'll likely feel lost and confused, at least for awhile, if you don't have someone to jump you in. I gave it extra points because, on High at least, it ran like silk, never a hiccup or slowdown in sight. That in itself is to be commended. Sound: N/A*I don't recall hearing any music, and while this makes for a much more realistic experience, it's a boring one. Bring your own music. The sounds, however, are servicable. Bullets plinking off your plane sound like bullets, and explosions go boom, but nothing that makes you feel there. Nothing that feels like a bullet hitting your plane, or the huge blast you want in a bomb. *Not rated due to my lack of rememberance on the topic. Utterly unprofessional to not go back and make sure, but hey, this isn't a professional review.			",199,24,2,40,9,3,12

												This game, in it's current form, has some serious problems in terms of in-game economy, balancing,  and grinding.Balancing: While not too bad for players that fly allied planes (Britain, USA, Soviet Union), those flying in planes of the Luftwaffe or Imperial Navy/Airforce feel the pain. So much so that for the Luftwaffe and Japanese planes, late Tier 3, Tier 4, and Germany's Me-262, Ar-234, And He-162 jets are quite literally almost unplayable. In tier 4 for these nations, you will commonly see on the opposing team P-80s, F-80Cs, Meteors, Yak-15s, B-57s, IL-28s, and the like. All of these are jets planes from late 1944 to 1951 and onwards. All going against prop planes from 1943-1944 with guns that lack enough velocity or power to even stay on target when attempting to engage these planes, and it's not like they can catch them. These planes cruise at about 750-900Km/ph. Now you may think, ""but the axis jets get the same treatment, right?"". No, they don't. Me-262s go up against F-86s, jets which were intodruced in around 1953, a full 9 years ahead of the rudimentary and clunky jets technolgy present in the 262, which has difficulty even getting up to 700km/ph in level flight. The He-162 has the same balancing problem, only it has only 2 low velocity MG151/20 20mm cannons, instead of the 262s 4 30mm guns. The Ar-234 is a jet bomber with no guns, and low speed (topping out at about 760ish Km/ph), and yet it is matched up with Meteors, F-80Cs, and IL-28s. Planes that are not only significantly faster, but also have several rather large and powerful guns. This renders all of these planes, the 262, 162, and 234, not only torterous to play, but also virtually useless, despite their historical significance. As for the Japanese planes, they have the same problems at teir 4 as the germans do, only worse due to the low armor present on most of the planes, along with low speed, making most teir 4 matches in a Japanese plane 7-10 minutes of pure seal club favoring the other team. The only saving grace for the balance system for axis players is the Japanese R2Y2 jet bomber. A manuverable hugh-speed jet bomber with 4 30mm high velocity Type-5 cannons. Other than that, most of the other late game axis planes are bunk do to quite possibly some of the worst balancing I've seen since the ACR 6.8 in MW3.Enconomy: Early on, things arent too bad, but after late tier 2, it becomes that if you get shot down before a match has ended, you end up losing money very quickly, to the point were after a few bad matches, your once baby smooth cool Million has been reduced to a pitiful 300k, hardly enough to afford or train crew for your next plane. To make matters worse, unless in an event, the most one could make during a game on average is usually only 15-30k(ish), making it take literal ages to save or pay for anything in game.Grinding: Similar to Enconomy, in the early game, researching is pretty quick, and relatively satisfying. You get to squee over getting your shiny new P-40 in only a few short matches, but later on, it begins to take days, weeks, and in the case of tier 5, possible months to unlock the new plane, and thats just to unlock it for purchase. If you don't have enough money, than feel free to cry yourself to sleep while you continue the grind so you can pay for the plane, only to have it immediately knocked out from stock-syndrome.All in all, the game has the potential to be something beautiful, but do to the almost blatant refusake to fix some problems shown by the devs, it remains in a rather unbalanced, and in some ways, painful, state.However, Ground forces is pretty great except for the high cost of tanks.

												I started playing this game in February or March of 2013... not too sure now. At that time the game was pretty fun and they added some good features along the way. I enjoyed playing and how all the planes were more or less on an even playing field. The matches had some flaws but not too many. But in December they added a new update which made the game completely different. They had a 1-20 Tier selection...and changed it to 1-5. The planes you face are at many times not fair in any way. I now HATE this game... I still find myself playing it but only because of how much fun I had before...and the fact that i dumped money in to it. (Luckily only 15 dollars.) I dont really recommend it now, I wish they would bring back the old game.			",94,7,4,13,12,0,10

												Lot of good mechanical concepts, but they're burried under abject incompetence in almost every aspect of execution.Horrifyingly unbalanced, grindtastic, stuffed with requests for inordinate amounts of real money, blatant pro-Soviet bias, incredibly slow and laughably unfair matchmaking. Most of that playtime you see is from 5 minute plus queu time.Grind amplified by the number of pointles duplicate aircraft/tanks without meaningfull differences that wouldn't even warrent an upgrade module with a vehicle in any other game.Patches are predominantly composed of utterly pointles and overpriced premium aircraft rather than anything that would take work they can't get directly paid for like balance and optimisation or simply anything other than kicking the playerbase.In the concept, this could be a great game if the developers (or their management) weren't somewhere between malevolant and incompetant. And Gaijin's PR is abysmal.What comes next may be subjective, but I swear to you it is unoquivically the case: The game hates me specifically.I land multiple 37mm cannon hits on an enemy fighter and they don't go down, I fly out in a B-17 Flying Fortress and literally get dismembered by the first 20mm shell to greet me or my pilot takes one machine gun bullet and the whole plane counts as dead. This alone is reliable.			",49,5,0,6,15,1,10

												For what it's worth, this is probably one of the better flying and shooting games i've played that involve WWI and WWII aircraft. It's fairly realistic, easy to learn, and easy to find a game. The graphics are decent and you can change cloud density and ground texture. This is mainly a multiplayer game, but it does offer some single player missions if you can get into it. That's pretty much where the good stuff ends, though.Given that it's Free To Play, of course the game starts you out with literally the crappiest planes they have to offer. The planes you see on as the cover art and in the screenshots? Yeah, you can't have those. It wouldn't be so bad if the matches could be ranked. But every time I joined a session, there was always somebody on the other team with a faster fighter plane that takes more hits and can kill you in two shots. Why two shots? Because you're in a ♥♥♥♥ing bi-plane from World War 1 (unless you play USA and why wouldn't you unless you're some kind of commie) and they're in a German Stuka, for example. And no, you can't fly away, because you are slow as hell. So you might as well just crash into the ground and save them the trouble. Trust me when I say the dogfights that the game hypes you up for aren't as exciting as they could be. It's usually just you being chased or the other way around and going in circles until somebody gets a lucky shot (or crashes) or the 15 other enemy players arrive to gang♥♥♥♥♥♥you with endless tracers and bullets. And to top it all off, some people in multiplayer matches have come to believe that ramming their plane into yours is a viable strategy, even though they lose their plane in the process. The point is to NOT get shot down while shooting down enemies!It is unforgiving, and you will start out very slowly. Unless you have the time and patience like some people apparently do to eventually unlock an actual decent plane, I would not recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR great game destroyed by bad devs.Would I reccomend this game a year back? Yes. My best friend introduced me to it and I got hooked, we played for HOURS just pwning people in RAF planes.  It was brilliant, with wonderfully detailed models (still applies now tbh) and varied gameplay with a challenging yet entertaining game that was just fun to play.Then slowly but surely they made dumber and dumber decisions, like casualising tank gameplay (Even on sim mode!) Having imbalanced and unrealistic gameplay (Stalinwood and RAF Planes are best, everyone else suffers) making the game a grindfest and making planes too expensive (you have to grind 'silver lions' to repair planes after battle, if you run out you have to grind starter biplanes) My friend gave up about halfway through saying 'this game is just another P2W 'free' grindfest.' He's right, the game isn't as bad as others (No names), but he's still right.And then the team started making outright moronic changes to the game, the dealbreaker for me was when they started to make flags and certain decals in the game cost real life money, apparently because Ukrainians were using them to bully those poor poor Rooshan soldiers who play this game, after takings ze vacations in Ukrop...Comrade Pootings was made of the sad there, comrades. Politics aside, it's just a cash grab. A dirty filthy cash grab. If they really cared, they'd ban Ukrainian IP's or just removed the flags all together.It was kinda like my ex GF, she started off interesting, fun and she was pretty too, but then she started to get fat, started chatting behind my back and asking for more and more gifts, I hoped both would eventually go back to the good times, but I knew it wouldn't happen. I knew it had to be broken off. So I unsubscribed from the subreddit, deleted it from the library, broke up with Gaijiin by text and killed and hid my computer under the patio when they started to talk backBasically, the developers suffered Hanlon's Razor (never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance). In other words, they aren't EA, but they did make some dtupid decisions that pretty much ruined the game. so I'm writing this review, then I'm uninstalling. Sorry  Gaijiin, you dun goof'd. Also forums have finest KGB mods that will ban you for any reason, keep grinding comrade and keep your head down. 3/10			",89,7,6,6,14,0,3

												I don't think one can speak of War Thunder without giving World of Tanks a mention at least.At the time of writing War Thunder is roughly around 1mil players and WOT has around 18mil players; does this mean anything? No.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------General Overview:A Free-To-Play game aimed at mutliple market generally suffer in terms of game-quality along with many other issues. War Thunder runs great on PC; has a sleugth of options to fit your liking from shadow-blurring, borderless-windowed, to a mountain of adv settings.Visuals:The visuals are absolutely stunning and gorgeous, everything to the models of the planes to the beautifully rendered fluffy clouds. Single-pilot planes allow for cockpit-view; where the dashboards and controls of the plane are all visually working, along with the pilot and his throttle plus rudder. Landscapes are also vast and give you a sense of flight-realism as you’re staring down from the skies. Along with that, weapon-effects from 1000kg bombs, torpedos, and MG-fire are represented fantastically.Gameplay/Game:War Thunder supports a multitude of different control inputs natively; mouse/keyboard, controllers, gamepads (With a ton of default profiles for most-market gamepads.) and even Oculus Rift support. As any F2P game though however, level-progression is slow and most newbies will likely turn away in frustration after their first hour of constant death. But I doubt anyone who wants to play a game with much depth as this will not-overlook that factor.War Thunder has different control schemes from advanced to intermediate but the most basic control method; the one you being with is the Mouse-Control. In most recent memory, or perhaps in my entire gaming history I have never encountered a game where mouse control worked so well; it is incredibly accurate and fluid in its function. Mouse-Control is great; works flawlessly and will do wonders for players who cannot wield keyboards and other paraphernalia as most hardcore gamers can.As mentioned before War Thunder is a great PC game, in terms of UI, engine and stability; along with options. The developers do care for their game and it really shows.---Gameplay is usually revolved around player-controlled airforces and AI-automated fleets and ground armies. Your team has an airfield; which can be defended and attacked; affecting scores. Generally mission objectives are either: “Destory all Enemy Players” or “Destory Enemies Ground Troops”The outcome of games relies on the mix of fighting between players and the elimnation of AI-troops. Focus on airfield, bases, and troops too much and you’ll notice your entire team had been wiped out. Or waste your time in a 1on1 dogfight; chasing your enemy during the entire match to find that YOUR ground forces are nearly gone.A game needs a good balance of strategy as methentined but airplane composition is also important.Fighters/Bombers is the general-split classification of the planes, if the enemy team has many high-altitude bombers and you have no-fighters in the high-skies = problem.The amount of depth and sophistication in gameplay is astounding for a F2P game, at the same time it is not without some “grinding” and novel-gameplay aspects most are bored with-do exist.---Whether you want to roll down bomb-carpets of destruction with the B17 Flying Fortress, shoot down Americans with the MIG-Jet fighter, or just have relaxing dogfight with biplanes… War Thunder is a great F2P game that should appease to new players and some adv-flight sim players.

												As a pilot, a combat flight sim jock, and a military historian, I can only say this:War Thunder isn't worth it.The Simulation mode is broken beyond repair. Flight models vary between ""incomplete"" and ""complete,"" whereby the community will argue that ""complete"" means 'perfect,' even though they pale in comparison to other sims. The missions that you are put through completely dash any sense of immersion and waste the potential of aircraft that were role-specific. The AI is laughable and deadly at the same time, which I'm sure an experienced simmer would rapidly recognize.As such, I totally gave up on it, as well as Realism mode.That left Arcade, which for a time seemed a decent distraction of sorts. A game, certainly, and not a simulation. But time tends to bring out the worst.Tiering is broken beyond compare. Not only did they forsake historical accuracy, but ""balance"" involves throwing grossly inferior aircraft into the same match, and by that I mean there is literally not a single advantage some have over the others.Damage modeling and/or hit detection is so poor that you are forced to maintain long tracking bursts rather than make effective snapshots. Conversely, there is evidence of some skill or stat-based handicapping which makes even the slightest scratch lethal, whereas other players can take literally thousands of rounds and keep dogfighting. This dynamic is curiously absent from Russian aircraft which use cannons so large that near misses equate to instant death. Maneuverability in the form of elevator authority and horizontal turn rate is also messed up, because radial Gs and therefore turn rate are fixed. This means that there is literally no way to win a turning fight against even a 1 degree per second advantage without the enemy completely fouling up, and, once again, the Russians have the best turn rates at almost every tier. ""Energy retention"" is a farce, primarily because of a grossly simplified physics. Heavier objects accelerate slow and decelerate fast, regardless of their momentum. Acceleration is also very linear, as opposed to being an inversed exponential function where you have to fight for the last few mph. When all of that is combined, Russian aircraft which are predominantly made out of 'wood,' even at a stage where they were using 2,000 HP engines, accelerate ridiculously fast, dive ridiculously fast, and climb ridiculously fast. Even if a metal aircraft has a higher top speed, it will take so long to get there that even some biplanes can catch and destroy it simply by hitting their top speed first. At the same time, the ever vaunted I-153 Chaika, because it's ""light"" and has its horsepower, is capable of outclimbing and outcruising even a P-40 at altitude. Thus the statistics seen in-game about maximum speed and climb rate are effectively Lies, and, yet again, the Russians hold the advantage.And finally, the ""domination"" game mode which is so often repeated is nothing more than a ""please kill us, Russia"" festival in which altitude advantage and performance are practically irrelevant. Russians armed with cannons can simply nose up at leisure and plug you with cannons, and it is only through rapid and shameless ganking that you could possibly defeat them under such circumstances.All of this begs the question whether or not it was designed to favor Russian players, or if Russian aircraft design just happened to work best under broken conditions. The answer to that will never be known to satisfaction unless a Gaijin employee blows a whistle, which is highly unlikely.So in the end, there really isn't much else to say. War Thunder is worthless as a simulator, and is considerably broken as an arcade game. If you play it, my suggestion is to avoid the forum, avoid the fanboys, and avoid Paying Money. It is Not a game I would pay money for, under any circumstances.			",51,3,0,2,8,0,16

												War Thunder has been one of my favourite games for the past year or so now, and it's changed in so many different ways. Even though some of the core game mechanics have been altered and vehicles have been added in which have changed combat completely, I still find it to be the same addictive vehicle sim that i've loved every minute of. One thing you'll want to know before you try this, which you should by the way.... it's free!.... is that Gaijin like to change around things. A lot. Oh and don't play this for one nation, as you'll get burnt out really quickly.Time for a little list....Pros:Its freeIsn't Pay to Win (though some will argue otherwise)Can't instantly buy the best vehicles, Tier V's need to be earnedLots of vehiclesDevelopers update regularlyEvents and competitions(Eventually.........SHIPS!)5 complete sets of Aviation trees for US, Germany, Russia, Britain and Japan (though there are still planes to add)4 complete sets of Tank trees for all of the above except Japan, who are in developmentControl customizations...too many.....Did I say it's free?Looks beautiful!Cons:A little bit of nation bias.... just a bitNo proper realism mode e.g a few Me 262's face off a couple dozen P-51'sThe grind to the next tier can be rough aloneVoIP is a little mehWhat are you waiting for? Try it out!With a bit more balancing, and less Russians (шутят), then this game could easily be bumped up a bit. Oh and wait for ships to come out, RIP WoWS....Score 86/100			",87,8,1,11,33,0,41

												I've been playing this game for about a year and a half, mostly on the standalone client. Through this time period, the game has had it's ups and downs, and on top of that the game has had its fill of Gaijiin not caring about it's playerbase. I've been at the  second to last tier for most of the time I've been playing the game (using the new tier system) Why, you might ask? Well, I don't have the time to devote the almost two hundred and thirty hours JUST to research, and not purchase, the next plane in line. I don't have the effort to sit back while Gaijiin's official community response to the horrible matchmaking, and substantially increased grind is ""It's working as intended, none of the players understand and the blame is squarely on them."" Yesterday, I was going to buy premium, OUT OF FRUSTRATION. And then I wised up really quickly, and saw exactly how much it would take for me to get to my next plane. I can safely say that this game will never get another penny from me until they fix their dreadful system. The fighting and the actual core gameplay is fantastic, and in my opinion, unmatched. That being said, the game core that supports you, like earning currency and experience quickly leeches the fun out of the game, leaving it a cold and empty husk of what it used to be. If you're thinking about playing this game, as a longtime veteran that has been watching things slowly go downhill, and the player numbers dwindle, I can only recommend that you wait until the next major patch and see where it goes from there, unless you are into grinding that makes World of Tanks, which is the game that most of us early players were AVOIDING, look like it's a quick progression system. I hope Gaijiin steps up their game, and their attitude with the international community.If and when they do, I would be more than happy to make a new review parading the turnaround. Until that point, I absolutely cannot recommend the game to anybody unless they like korean made grindfests. In which case, we've got a Russian made grindfest right here that you can possibly enjoy.Good luck, Gaijiin. Listen to your player base when they're screaming at you and dropping like flies.Edit: I've just recieved Jets after all the time i've been playing the game. Again, if you don't already love the game, there's not much in the way of keeping you hooked as far as progression goes.			",340,31,2,35,34,2,43

 War ThunderIt is a multiplayer / mmo game released as a free title, where we are fighting with other players in the air and on the ground but also soon on the sea. This production gives the opportunity to play in different modes: arcade, realistic and simulation. Each differs in the level of difficulty as well as varied gameplay. The game has micropayments, premium accounts but they do not interfere in the game (perhaps only at the beginning). In the game we develop crew that they are in a better use of our war machines, you can use real money which is not really that expensive, or develop them by playing the game. To unlock another machine, you have to play a lot to gather a certain amount of points, or once again use real money to unlock immediately (which is not profitable). In addition, after each unlocking we have to buy them and train our crew to use it. The game offers several nations such as Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan. Each of them has a lot of number of machines to choose from (Japan does not have tanks). War Thunder has a very powerful, realistic physics and damage system. Controlling planes and tanks is very realistic. Destroying enemies is about eliminate the crew or give critical damage to machine. This game is a really great production except for a weak balance the machine, while playing I had a lot of fun destroying vehicles enemy players. Great sound system, nice gameplay, beautiful graphics convinced me to play for hours. I highly recommend this production, however, I warn that, for me, the game began after unlocking Tier 3.All in All  War Thunder is a really nice Simulation Game!9/10 From MeSweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												THIS GAME IS FUN TO PLAY!Everything else about it is♥♥♥♥♥♥First and foremost:How would you like to fly a piece of tissue paper against an army of ginsu knives?  Because that's what the matchmaking will do to you.  They have tiers: different levels of planes that follow a semi-chronological order of how the planes were developed and improved throughout history.  But, in matchmaking, the tiers mean nothing.  Have fun flying a bi-plane against a jet.  The matchmaking used to work, but then they upgraded it, and now everything is terrible.Secondly:The interface is awful.  I hope you like opening menu after menu after menu.  There's no real explanation for anything, and there's a lot that needs explaining (matchmaking, upgrading planes, what the currencies represent, what do my crews do, what does upgrading them get me, why aren't my friends getting my invites to my team, etc.).  The only thing that's obvious is the ""start battle"" button.Third:The game is fremium.  It isn't 'pay to win', since there's only so much you can upgrade the planes, and they're minor upgrades anyway, but there's a constant siege of ""pay money to not have to grind this.""  It's not really a big deal, but if that sort of thing bothers you, then watch out.  Honestly, before they bungled up the matchmaking thing, I would have gladly paid money for this game.  It is fun, when it isn't horrifically broken.Fourth:The chat interface needs work.  Nothing too major, just smooth it out a bit, make it carry conversations from out of game to in game, so I don't have to constantly swap between steam chat and ingame chat.Having said that, the game IS fun, when it works right.  When you're not being instantly shot down after five minutes of flying towards some dot in the distance.  When your weapons can actually do something against the enemy npc targets.

												Where do I begin?  I have been playing the game since early beta, great game.  I even spent some cash to get some gold lions (10000 deal).  I thought man I could play this forever.  Then 1.37 rolled down hill like a big brown turd.  I realize game development isn't cheap, but 1.37 wasn't about supporting the business, it was all about GREED.  The strategy was something like this, let's not develop anymore aircraft or maps, and let's make it sooooo frustrating and expensive to upgrade/purchase planes with silver that users will have to pull out their cards and pay a premium to do either.  Enjoy your big yachts and party girls.Disgusted			",20,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Only way you can have fun in this game is by playing the undertiered Russians with their glorious Chaikas, LaGGs and Yaks all built with glorious Stalinwood that can shrug off even a 75mm cannon. And while you're not dying, you can feel the the light of Stalin shining down on you as you kill all the poor Tier 1 planes with your heat-seeking 20mm cannon that nobody can escape from. All Soviet tanks fire shells that the ghosts of Stalin and Lenin will personally guide towards the enemy so you don't have to aim.

												An honest review:I have been playing War Thunder since 2013. I started off playing mostly Aracde and getting the ranks that way. It has changed a lot since I joined. It's changed in different ways though, a lot of crazy things have been added. Still though, Gaijin Entertainment has done a fantastic job with War Thunder, and I hope that will continue.I voted for War Thunder in the Steam Awards for the ""Just 5 more minutes!"" Award, or whatever it's called. It really is that type of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't even bother,I've spent nearly a year of my life playing this game, Probably spent around £600 on in game purchases. I bought every single premium aircraft and tank in the game. I've there since the beginning. Every single update that has been released for this game has slowly ruined it. Stupid ideas that never work,Many broken promises. Constanly getting chat banned for saying the slightest thing bad against the game.And not to mention the forums.You will get banned for literally doing anything they deem as wrong. Now don't get me wrong, I've had a great time with this game.I've met some great people and made some great friends.I've had my fun.But i'm afraid its goodbye from me and many others.The game is sadly slowly dying. And unless Gaijin buck there ideas up. It will be gone. Which is a massive shame because this game has so much potential and will always have a place in my heart.

												This game is pure for the company to get money from the players.I am a tanker in realistic simulator and arcade, and i don't fly anymore because stalium on planes.And since you're not getting much research points i get about 800 rp in realistic and 1200 rp in arcade.Simulator is a timed event so you cannot go in your favourite tank at any time in simulator (also counts for planes)They also got a bad system for  ranking tanks and planes with a 0.7 br difference possibility.So when you have a tiger 1 you face of with t-44's.The team is not realible because they all want kills to get rp and get the new vehicle, the tow hook for example is in game already a long time yet nobody knows about it, and the spawnrape is real expecially in realistic and simulator.A bad system for teamkillers how do i know i was about to shoot a enemy and clicked to shoot, bam teammates shows up behind a rock and i get kicked for that aciidental teamkill and all i get is a loss in lions and go to the main page where i just can go directly to a new battle.The post war♥♥♥♥♥♥is real m8 you got vehicles that dident even existed in ww2 and mixing ww2 vehicles with post war ones doesent make it accurate at all.Not only that they also wanted to make a REALISTIC game with not REALISTIC armor on tanks and planes.and planes that never flew or left the designer table.Prices go always up and so do reserch points needed, and now im talking more about rp it takes me atleast a week or 2 to get  a new vehice with many hours spent.Alot of people will get frustated with all the above so they would pay to get to the high tiers for a free to play game.Dus people are leaving the game more and more making it emptyer and so they increase the br difference for fast games making unbalanced gamesThe only good thing is the lion gain and the graphics and the models and thats it.

												I know I have not played War Thunder for too long, but I am experienced in gaming. War Thunder is honestly great at the surface, there is so very many little details to the vehicles and environment, and the dogfights can be absolutely gorgeous. The tanks and aircraft are so incredibly well modeled, and personally I find the shell penetration camera to be quite amazing. Watching tiny fragments explode and bounce around inside the tank's interior. As a simulator, it fares quite well, as tanks do not just explode into full speed, and turning requires skill in order to not lose speed. However, there is a but to all of this.I understand that this is a ""free to play"" title, and as such they plant micro transactions to hell like usual. One thing I do like (i play world of tanks a lot as well) is that decals and customization, while limited, is permanent and you don't have to keep rebuying as you do in wot. The grind is not good in War Thunder. Actually, it is just terrible. Games such as War Thunder and World Of Tanks make getting to the next level of vehicles feel like a job, and the reward after hours and hours of gameplay is just not worth it.The matchmaking is poor, as you will often be fighting enemies you have no hope to defeat, and the ai comrades are not exactly the best.If I were Gaijin, I would scrap the whole free to play idea, because it makes this game and many others like it just a crappy and greedy cash grab. It is just my opinion, but I think that War Thunder would make for a great full price title, but more focused on a singleplayer than multiplayer, because as we all know online multiplayer is sometimes just the worst. A true PVE mode would be great, as well.I know these ideas are just that, and that Gaijin is just one of those companies that is more interested in the payment and income rather than making a genuinely deep and amazing video game.And because of that, I cannot reccomend War Thunder in the form that it exists right now.It is an amazing concept of land, sea, air direct control warfare buried beneath a freemium pay to win mess like so many other games.

Don't get your hopes up and think you can get a better tank and then you wont get killed so fast. You will always die. The game is free so that is a plus and it is worth a play.

TLDR: Great if you want simple, brainless fun. Do NOT spend money on this game; devs are scumbags. Not meant for you if you are a flight-sim veteran and want historical accuracy. Matchmaking is hilariously broken in such a way to make certain machines unplayable. More Thoughts:From an ethical perspective, this game is an abomination. Here's why: Gaijin are objectively scumbags. Try starting threads regarding broken russian flight models on their forums without being banned. Anyone who tries to raise concerns about pre-russian, russian-nationalistic biases, and pandering to russian audiences get's deleted, censored, or banned. The russian aircraft in this game are objectively better. Even though, historically, they were in fact not. So they surpress criticism of the game and blatantly pander to a certain audience in a manner that seriously affects gameplay. Not cool. Which is why I would tell anyone to not spend money on this game, and not support this dev/publisher.From a gameplay perspective, this game is alright. Here's why:The game offers varying game-modes, each with a ""greater degree of realism than the other"". The controls are all right, with both joystick and keyboard and mouse working fine. I haven't heard about gamepads, nor have I tried them myself. Arcade is the most fun, with fun aerial maneuvers being easy to pull off, and the game being overall casual, silly fun. The game employs the usual normal and premium currency model seen in so many other f2p titles. Due to the structuring of the game, it is often more profitable for players to focus on killing other players, when the mission objective supposedly is bombing the enemy base. Now, the realism is where the game falls short, in large part because of the russian tech-bias I described earler. Flight models are obviously broken on russian craft, and other vehicles have been artifically nerfed to make the russian ones even better. Tanks are fun in arcade, but the physics models make them behave like something out of ""Girls und Panzer"", with drifting being absolutely feasable. So again, if you want historical accuracy and realism, this game isn't for you. I've logged in far more time than is displayed on my steam account, having played the game via the client downloaded directly from their site, for roughly 80 hours total.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder is considered to be one of the most realistic flight and tank game in the history of gaming. This game inrtoduces a variety of play styles ranging from tank warfare in a fight to gain more land or taking flight in a bomber to destory enemy bases and win the game. Warthunder also includes tactical advatages you would have in real life, historically accurate planes and tanks, specifically tanks because each shot fired will do a ton of different things like knock out crew memebers or damage engines, explode fuel tanks and ammunition, it's very realistic and absolutely fun to play.The graphics of War Thunder are a very high quality esp. since it's FREE! A high quality game like this for free, is absolutely insane, yet I love it. Tanks and planes are given lots of history in their information, and tons just from the designs and handling of each one.Over all, War Thunder is a stunning game, it can be very hard for beginners, but I've made it far enough to get a good feel of what to expect with the rest of this game and in higher tier planes and tanks.9.8/10, would knock out pilot again. And again... and again... and ag- Ok ♥♥♥♥ this.			",46,4,0,0,7,0,1

												Being a dedicated tank player, War Thunder is or was a delight. When you hit tier two, which is my current level, you encounter tier three tanks. Hence, you encounter tanks with greater armour as well as greater armanent. Thus, if you are ready to play underdog, this game is definitely your thing. However, it is quite annoying in the long run to encounter a Jagdpanzer or a late T-34, when in fact you would expect only Sturmgeschuts or early T-34s. Basically you end up firing grenades meant for earlier models against later models, which makes it much more difficult to kill an opponent. On the other hand, when they point the barrel against you, you know that you will be driving in heaven.			",26,0,0,0,0,0,5

												TL:DR The balance issues in this game are nothing short of atrocious. The developers are iconoclasts with no respect for half-decent free-to-play models or competent community management. With that out of the way, let's get down to the more in-depth description of what's wrong with this game:- Every subsequent patch seems to be based on strong-arming people to buy overpriced premium content rather than allowing them to do it themselves. Progress through tech trees is incredibly slow to the point of frustrating and fun-crushing. It is difficult to grind out new machines (especially at higher tiers) even by the standards of tiered F2P games.- Balance issues are present from Tier II upwards, most notable at Tier IV and Tier V (especially with Ground Forces). The game is prohibitively difficult to enjoy when the vast majority of battles involve facing off against tanks that cannot be penetrated or aircraft which effortlessly gain energy advantages. Many planes and tanks that see each other in this game simply aren't comparable.- High tier bombers are Satan's children. Honestly, though, I can see why bomber spam exists. So much horrible behaviour comes about from the War Thunder community because the devs have made it painfully difficult to actually enjoy the game, and people playing it to grind out higher-tier vehicles are obviously going to do unpleasant things in order to make it happen.- Community management is nothing short of terrible. The CMs who are present on the game's forums are unpleasant and incredibly heavily biased, acting defensively and with standoffish behaviour regardless of topic or criticism. No issues from the playerbase are getting through to the devs because these community managers act as indiscriminate gatekeepers. One of the best things that Gaijin could do at this point would be to overhaul their entire community management team.- It's not fun. That last one hurts me a lot because I used to find it fun, before patch 1.29 where they took it upon themselves to wreck the economy and slow the grind down to a crawl. Progression became so horrible that it's hard to pin down quite when it stopped being fun, but before long I realised that I was playing for the grind rather than anything else.So I can't recommend this game. It's a technical masterpiece, really well optimised, beautifully rendered and gorgeous to look at. If you're after a nice visual experience, give this a go. If you like good devs and fun gameplay, give it a miss.			",66,8,0,14,18,0,11

												Pointless game. Get into combat, get shot at through obstacles, get killed right away. One has to wonder, is it cheating? Manuever into their rear, take shots, either bounce or no damage, they turn around, you are dead. Updates process is so complex... obviously design to get suckers to spend. But, when it is all said at done, the cheating and you inability to inflict damage makes you wonder why spend any money. The cheating wont stop just because you spent money. And the ramdon effect of shots makes it pointless to even try. Give it a try but dont get sucked into spending money. It's not worth it.			",10,0,0,0,6,0,10

												I would have recommended this game maybe last year...but then the British patch came out and now tier 3 tank battles are hell. The reason, pay to win with the A.43 BlackPrince. Can't pent the front with any tank below 5.7 BR (unless you're playing Russian, which the game is very bias towards). Apparently it is fair for the A.43 to get sabot rounds while no other tank has them until late war-post war. People may say just flank it cuz it only goes 10 MPH, expect the A.43 can just stay 1 KM away from everyone and snipe.			",41,4,0,10,3,0,11

												DO NOT BUY, DO NOT TRY.  I spent almost $300 on this game thus far and the developers have cynically and deliberately ruined the experience for paying customers and made it even worse for non-paying ones.After a fair experience in previous patches, which while they had their ups and downs, the pricing system was equitable and a player would get a fair reward for his time (if free-to-play) or his money, the latest patch has completely ruined the experience.First and foremost is the greed of the developers, evident in the pricing structure.  The latest patch promised easier research of individual lines of aircraft, as opposed to unlocking whole tiers at a time.  That's out the window.  Starting halfway through tier 3, any individual aircraft takes longer to unlock than one of the old tiers would.  The developers think to disguise this by changing the tier system from 20 levels to 5.  Moreover, the rewards for having a premium account or for spending in-game money have been severely reduced, as well.  Given my $270 investment into the game thus far, I am not amused by this blatant attempt at ripping people off.I came into War Thunder hoping that the developers would learn from World of Tanks and not drive their fanbase away with increasingly absurd timesinks and financial costs.  Patch 1.35 was a great experience and patch 1.37 is worse than anything I went through in World of Tanks.As far as gameplay, the gameplay developments in 1.37 are also generally decidedly negative.  Whether it's the selective application of flight model realism, like overheating and compression, to some aircraft but not others (essentially nerfing most German and many British aircraft), or ridiculous changes like increasing the starting altitude of all aircraft in the Arcade Battles difficulty (where you get to respawn). which basically permits people who just died to come in with a significant speed or altitude advantage... the developers clearly don't know what they're doing.  Worse, they often hide behind the ""working as intended"" line for weeks, until they suddenly fix an issue and pretend it never happened.			",117,19,2,34,58,2,64

												MMO Fans, Hardcore Gamers, Aviation Enthusiasts, Etc. can all like this game alike. Great planes to fly on, and most certantly great company developing this game, war thunder will beat the living S**T out of World of Warplanes easy. It has some great controls and new players will find no trouble leveling up through the ranks. active developers, once again, always release specials for golden eagles and discounts on in game planes, which is what makes this WW2 Flight Combat Sim stand out among the rest of the mmo crowd, and you learn alot more about the history of the planes, and the pilots who flew them along the way. If you are looking for a great aviation combat sim, look no further than War Thunder. If you do, join us at The Art Of Warfare clan, where we have an active community of 24k players supporting hundreds of games.			",135,16,5,18,23,1,49

The CMs who are present on the game's forums are unpleasant and incredibly heavily biased, acting defensively and with standoffish behaviour regardless of topic or criticism. No issues from the playerbase are getting through to the devs because these community managers act as indiscriminate gatekeepers. One of the best things that Gaijin could do at this point would be to overhaul their entire community management team.- It's not fun. That last one hurts me a lot because I used to find it fun, before patch 1.29 where they took it upon themselves to wreck the economy and slow the grind down to a crawl. Progression became so horrible that it's hard to pin down quite when it stopped being fun, but before long I realised that I was playing for the grind rather than anything else.So I can't recommend this game. It's a technical masterpiece, really well optimised, beautifully rendered and gorgeous to look at. If you're after a nice visual experience, give this a go. If you like good devs and fun gameplay, give it a miss.			",66,8,0,14,18,0,11

												While this game may be fun in the beginning after putting 300 hours in I can offically say that this is the first game in my life that I hate every moment of playing. This game is what cancer actually feels like. Gaijin doesnt care about anything either as they havent fixed a single thing yet continue to add broken tanks into the game and pat themselves on the back for it.

												After dying in my own spawn after immediately respawning for the second time i realised that this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The lower tiers are fun because getting tanks are easy and they are pretty fun to play even though they mostly are a bit boring. The Russian planes are fine however when i have to research 3 ♥♥♥♥ing LaG's in a row that made me pull my pubes out. When i try to play the English tanks and all the tier two's are practically 30000 Research points a pop for a Mk XI version of the Crusader i realised that this game is fun if you have the money to speed up the proccess. All the high tier vehicles are very fun to watch but when you realise it takes a year and a half of grinding just to get a tier 4 you realise that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The developers are morons because they don't read the feedback from public and i do not think they understand that the T34 is incredibly overpowered. The Russian tanks are impossible to kill and they skull♥♥♥♥ you with one shot. Overall, good if you like blending your♥♥♥♥♥♥for the pain but bad when you realise you just blended your♥♥♥♥♥♥and all that time you spent with your one eyed snake is wasted because some ♥♥♥♥♥ with 500 Ping ♥♥♥♥s you up with a 75mm cannon or the entire arsenal of America's missile barrage because he decided to buy short cuts and got a♥♥♥♥♥♥extention like the little ♥♥♥♥ing weaboo♥♥♥♥♥♥he is.

												I have played the game mainly outside of steam, so my real time count would probably be about 600 hours and not 6,5. I can safely say that the games is only a long and boring grind. the soviet is MUCH more powerfull and get a lot more options when it comes to arsenal than all other nations. ill let you guess why... (gaijin is russian.) 90% of all your sessions will be ended purely because youre too frustrated to continue. For example: Youre grinding that annoying aircraft that you already have used in more than 400 games and it struggles to even scratch anything and out of nowhere you get instakilled by a fkcen yak or any other russian (soviet) aircraft in generall. And btw, I have friends that have just out of nowhere lost all of their GE (kinda like gold money that you buy from real life cash)EDIT: After a 2 years long break i thought that maybe they fixed the ammount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game, but nah. bombers are still made of paper, and russians are still super biased... the thing about the russians being biased is extra frustrating because they always say this game is realistic, but in reality, the soviet was really poor and couldnt afford any good aircraft. they were so poor that they even used the ""5 man line"" tactic, the first guy in the line had a rifle, and when he died, the second guy took his rifle, and when he died, the third guy took his rifle and so on...Moral of the story: 3/10. Pretty graphics, but terrible in any other way.Dont install it. Unless you have the patience of fkcen buddah or if you just want to be mad all the time and suffer.its sad because its such a missed potential.			",18,1,0,0,4,0,0

												I picked up the game following it's recommendation from a YouTube personality known as the Mighty Jingles. Long story short, I enjoyed the game to some extent for a while, the flight controls were intuitive, the graphics and audio were near-perfection, and even the ground combat was entertaining, keeping in mind this entire game is built out of a flight simulator game engine. Sounds nice right? Well, the real problem comes from the publisher, community moderators, whoever, that have repetitavely smothered the game's community contributers for little to no reason. I'll only name a few examples, as if I wrote out all of the stories this review would be a novel. I believe in mid to late 2015, the War Thunder premium content prices were hiked up roughly two weeks before a steam sale, so that when put on sale, the content would be reduced back down to it's original price. Anyone dumb enough to buy the pre-steam sale hiked prices were not given refunds. Most recently, there had been a survey posted on the WT website, asking players to vote (due to a hack that makes all enemies fully visible) whether to basically give this hack to absolutely everyone, thereby implementing it into the game, or to pledge support to Gaijin, permissing them to abuse, the YouTube copyright system to take down any videos discussing the hack in any way. This is definitavely not how a developer or publisher should ever act; let your product speak for itself, don't make it lip-sync, then get angry when others point it out. Overall, good game, the issue is that it's under the control of someone at Gaijin who is obviously too inmature to handle the video game industry.			",32,2,0,2,11,0,19

TLDR: Great if you want simple, brainless fun. Do NOT spend money on this game; devs are scumbags. Not meant for you if you are a flight-sim veteran and want historical accuracy. Matchmaking is hilariously broken in such a way to make certain machines unplayable. More Thoughts:From an ethical perspective, this game is an abomination. Here's why: Gaijin are objectively scumbags. Try starting threads regarding broken russian flight models on their forums without being banned. Anyone who tries to raise concerns about pre-russian, russian-nationalistic biases, and pandering to russian audiences get's deleted, censored, or banned. The russian aircraft in this game are objectively better. Even though, historically, they were in fact not. So they surpress criticism of the game and blatantly pander to a certain audience in a manner that seriously affects gameplay. Not cool. Which is why I would tell anyone to not spend money on this game, and not support this dev/publisher.From a gameplay perspective, this game is alright. Here's why:The game offers varying game-modes, each with a ""greater degree of realism than the other"". The controls are all right, with both joystick and keyboard and mouse working fine. I haven't heard about gamepads, nor have I tried them myself. Arcade is the most fun, with fun aerial maneuvers being easy to pull off, and the game being overall casual, silly fun. The game employs the usual normal and premium currency model seen in so many other f2p titles. Due to the structuring of the game, it is often more profitable for players to focus on killing other players, when the mission objective supposedly is bombing the enemy base. Now, the realism is where the game falls short, in large part because of the russian tech-bias I described earler. Flight models are obviously broken on russian craft, and other vehicles have been artifically nerfed to make the russian ones even better. Tanks are fun in arcade, but the physics models make them behave like something out of ""Girls und Panzer"", with drifting being absolutely feasable. So again, if you want historical accuracy and realism, this game isn't for you. I've logged in far more time than is displayed on my steam account, having played the game via the client downloaded directly from their site, for roughly 80 hours total.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder is considered to be one of the most realistic flight and tank game in the history of gaming. This game inrtoduces a variety of play styles ranging from tank warfare in a fight to gain more land or taking flight in a bomber to destory enemy bases and win the game. Warthunder also includes tactical advatages you would have in real life, historically accurate planes and tanks, specifically tanks because each shot fired will do a ton of different things like knock out crew memebers or damage engines, explode fuel tanks and ammunition, it's very realistic and absolutely fun to play.The graphics of War Thunder are a very high quality esp. since it's FREE! A high quality game like this for free, is absolutely insane, yet I love it. Tanks and planes are given lots of history in their information, and tons just from the designs and handling of each one.Over all, War Thunder is a stunning game, it can be very hard for beginners, but I've made it far enough to get a good feel of what to expect with the rest of this game and in higher tier planes and tanks.9.8/10, would knock out pilot again. And again... and again... and ag- Ok ♥♥♥♥ this.			",46,4,0,0,7,0,1

												War Thunder is frustrating. I long gave up on fighter combat, because I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥at air-to-air in anything and the balancing was stupid as all hell anyway, so I instead spend most of my playtime now in the mud. It sucks, because as it stands warthunder is the only non-simulator tank game that makes a tank feel like a tank (rather than the gliding-across-the-ground tanks you get in WoT and Armored Warfare), but the game is just SO so bad. The balance is terrible (How do you like facing Panzer IIIs in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cavalry tank that's not even up-armored enough to defeat .50s?), the grind is terrible (~500RP is a decent match, and it'll be costing you tens of thousands of RP to get most vehicles), the playerbase is terrible (have fun being the only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moving from beyond some useless camping positions!)Just don't bother. The playercount has been steadily shrinking for a while now, too, meaning the wait times between battles grow longer and longer (and Gaijin continues to do dumber and dumber things to ""fix"" that), and the quality of players grows lower and lower.

												Used to be so much fan, a birlliant game I sunk hour after hour into, on both PC and Playstation 4. The more you grind the more difficult it seems to be to unlock new vehicles. The 'Wagers' (challenges in which you unlock extra ingame currency) are borderline impossible more often than not. People always bang on about Russian bias however, and let me tell you something, those people are speaking complete and utter..... sense. The Russian aircraft often take you down in a small burst whilst you watch your German aircraft pump 300 mg rounds plus 100 cannon rounds into a lower ""battle ranked"" aircraft.The graphics still hold up well but the question on reviews is would I recommend the game. In it's current, seemingly pay to win state, no, not one bit.			",84,11,0,2,9,1,1

												If your new to war thunder  here's a key tip, the aim reticle you see on an aircraft, if your behind them aim a bit above it to actually hit themAir battles are alot more relaxing depending on the situation your compared to ground battles where it can be stressful and frustrating while rewarding on how well your match can go, i would recommend starting off in air battles at first then transitioning towards ground later on to ease you in.On ground battles however its a different level of game entirely with the possibility of having your entire line up of tanks getting wiped out within minutes to not loosing a single tank, i would recommend starting off with either russia or the recently added japan ground forces, russia as their tanks have some good sloping and armor early on in their line upm while japan for some highly mobile (in my opinion) tanks with an equivalent tank to the KV-2 on tier 1 called the ho-ro with a hefty but lethal 20's reload, 150mm mortar canon, which will one shot kill most tanks should you use the high explosive rounds being viable until tiger tanks or is's start appearing.The game is fun and doesen't become a paywall until you start unlocking some of the more iconic tanks to each faction, the closest thing i can relate it to is the heavy tank no.6 and all the tanks to its left.

												I don't have words to explain how fun this game is, all I'm going to say is that this is the most fun free-to-play game ever made, and if you disagree then you have a mental disorder. Its not pay to win either, go ahead, drop 20$ on that tank that you think will win you the game, I'll still one shot you if I hit your ammo.			",103,3,0,10,3,2,6

												I can't believe I still play this, I can't believe I am still caving to these commie, brain-washed, ungrateful, spineless, lying, willfully awful devs. I would completely ignore what steam says about the reviews at the top, because experienced players like me, don't think this game deserves ""very positive,"" reviews. The mods on the forums are censoring nazis. This game is a shell of the great game it was. It could be great, but the devs refuse to listen to the community, ultimately, a 2/10 from me.

												An amazing war game. Quite adictive aswell, i found myself playing for 4 days in a row with out knowing. Its fun, action filled, fast paced.....most of the time. I strongly recommend this game if you like dogfights (airoplane battles) and are looking for a fun online game to play with your friends. However best choice to have a mouse and not use the touchpad and not to play if you have alot of revision, homework or something else important to do.			",32,4,1,1,7,0,4

												=Old Review, 2014=  Great primarily WWII era military game. with Aviation, ground units, and eventually naval units as well. Overall fun to play.=New Review, 2016=  All I play at this game's current state is Jets.  Not because jets are better, or more balanced.  That's a total joke.  I can't really think of any plane or tank that has its real life performance accurately portrayed in the game.  Then again, I only play jets.   Jets as in a general term.  I own pretty much the entire US and German air tree, some Russian, and British jets as well.  So I fly F-86/CL-13 Sabres.  Which, are underperforming in regards to their flight models.  Germany also has a GDR MiG-15bis, that does not perform as well as its Russian tree counterpart, the MiG-15bis.  Some could argue that it's Russian bias in a way, as nearly every game I play, Allied pilots scream about MiGs being a 'point and click adventure' and being overpowered.  This is also not true.  Recently the N-37, the 37mm cannon that the MiGs carry ingame, recieved a nerf.  They 'spark' on almost every shot, and fire at a lower velocity compared to its, still relatively slow, previous version.  Getting kills with MiGs actually takes some skill to use, and if the children that only fly F-86 played with MiGs, they'd cry that Sabres are overpowered.   Nothing in this game is truly balanced, and there's doubt that it ever will be.  I have been around since 2013, and logged about a total of 4000 hours ingame (played it before it was on steam), and every plane and tank has seen changes over the years. And will continue seeing changes.  Yes, there is a real Russian bias.  You can see this on the forums if you dare to go there, or just ask any player.  But even Russian vehicles aren't IMMEDIATELY overpowered, just because they are Russian.(well, maybe in tanks. Russians club anything atm that isnt British, but that's just because as of this post, British tanks are still in CBT, so the only people playing them PAYED to play them, including myself)I still recommend this game, because it can still be enjoyable, if you overlook all the broken aspects.  But flying props is cancer, and jets are completely broken.Here's to hoping 2016 will help fix many aspects of this once glorious game			",78,7,4,6,16,1,14

												Yes, the game is really fun and addictive.  At 918+ hours I can say it is a true pay to win game.  I do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have  crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money.  There is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for XP so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ♥♥♥♥ ton of nickel and dimes.  You will earn those same XP during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp.  It takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in Tank battles).  Good luck earning XP by just playing.  Long story short, this game sucks for PVP because of pay to win.  But is the best I have seen in a while for what I call eye candy (realistic looking models and FX)  and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.PS.  I would accept War Thunder Gold Lion donations!  LoL			",33,3,0,9,1,0,1

												I've played this game for years and I used to really enjoy it, but the times have changed. Gaijin openly censores any critique of this game on the forums. Gaijin constantly adds things to the game that players dont want. Gaijin never listens to the community. Gaijin doesn't ever fix broken flight models or test their aircraft before they patch them into the game. Gaijin pits first era jets against Sabers, Mig 15's, Hunters, etc and refuses to rebalance or address issues that the community points out. Gaijin rarely adds any new game modes or changes anything about the game. Gaijin likes to take your money and give you nothing in return. Gaijin wants to ruin the game they worked so hard on creating. Please don't support this company or this game until they turn themselves around because at this time, Warthunder is an aggrivating, unfair, money pit where the developers♥♥♥♥♥♥on anyone who actually likes the game and want to support it.

												game is filled with social justice warriors in advocate with elitest views of the game. when you try to describe something wrong with it. gaijin has an army of people that will belittle you and say you are wrong. Then they will go on about how you should have been aborted. Why does gaijin do this? simple. it brings them cash to have people just shrug their shoulders and buy their pay to win content. to partition gaijin of a problem is like climbing mount everest of Arrogance. because gaijin handpicks elitest people for their =MOD= community that is in agreement with its views. in turn they are like the SS of 1939's german reich. if you try to make a argument about the games inbalance they are unleashed and say you are just a ""weak"" player. they also try to antagonize you so that you make a fool of yourself than actually arguing with you about the actual problem. they make a player a joke to the community so the player gives up trying to convince others of a actual problem so people just continue on with their day with a good chuckle.this is what gaijin advocates? It truely displays the immaturity of their staff and genuinely shows how gaijin appreciates the community. A player is only appreciated as far as a one night stand.sure you can read a huge article about how they say thank you to the community but in reality they genuinely hate you.			",22,0,0,4,3,0,8

												This game had me hooked when i first saw how graphical and realistic it was and i have to say its been going strong for a long time, it most certainly is better than world of tanks and warplanes and i think theyre also getting ready to setup the docks for ships as well, i cant wait for it and from what i can see with the content coming world of tanks and warplanes is nothing but junk compared to this game. but after playing for a long time i can see that this game is no better than world of tanks, as well with the russian bias going on it used to be pretty damn good and ive been playing before the tanks were even a thing in this game, pretty much the tanks launch was pretty good and fun though after the updates went on i started noticing how much the russian tanks and planes did so much better than the german tanks and american tanks and their planes as well. for example this t-34 85 was fighting a panther a mother♥♥♥♥ing panther at long range and i expected the panther to win but nope the t-34 just ♥♥♥♥ing shot at its turret and it blew the panther up and im like thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but then i started noticing most of the guys on the leaderboards were using russian tanks and the germans and americans were lower, as well with the planes. i used to think the british planes were op but i guess russian planes decided to go op and ♥♥♥♥ing molest the british planes. i used to have so much hope that the developers would do something about this and just realized their russian too and after i saw the recent thing going on with these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s denying that they didnt do anything about the whole situation with the russian trees, i saw no more hope with this game anymore i bet when they get vietnam up the t-54 are gona ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥the pattons and m60s. i also bet that the t-62s release is going to be where the t-62 just ♥♥♥♥ing stomps on everything and squashes anything that gets near it. overall this game is awesome in terms of graphics but when you get to the driving planes and tanks you get a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is just like world of tanks biased and unrealistic i bet those blueprint tanks are gonna be here in no time. Also including with all i said they ♥♥♥♥ing sell things for prices even a reasonable person wouldnt buy sure you get alot of perks from premium accounts but seriously id be broke before i even get to like my second premium tank or plane i feel like this game is all pay to win nowadays i remember when premium stuff werent all that big until the later updates and i have to say gaijin has really fallen far down into the pit and its problably just going to get worse from there.And from what ive seen so far the quality of this game is that of a old bottle of beer i drank on new years eve its good at first but you later come to regret itThis game has alot of pros and cons so i will tell you what i thinkPros--beautiful graphics-pretty good controls-squad battles -lots of customization-lots of content Cons--Developers that literally censor any criticism or feedback that they dont like-Developers that deny anything you accuse them of and try to recitify with ""how we want the  game to work""-the game has overpriced things everywhere i was lucky enough to get to tier 4 without getting broke.-you can hardly get anywhere on the trees unless you buy premium crap to getup faster -Russian bias its pretty simple comrade you take your t-34 equiped with the great STALINIUM armor and bounce 88mm shells easily, no tiger tank will be able to snipe you comrade-the matchmaking is just awful in this game you get a tiger and your already facing is-3s and is-2-44s-the battle ratings are also very awful when it comes to weak tier 5 or 4 tanks being ""balanced"" with a higher rating-Tanks that have modern ammunition i mean seriously a rifled gun shouldnt fire a fin stabilized heat round it would be the same as firing a regular heat round come on gaijin you live in the land where the smoothbore was born in so im pretty sure you know where the round was meant to be in-vehicles that didnt even get a prototype, oh boy the blueprint/sketch spam will be real...-prototypes in general its just so hard to not hate a t-29 and t-28 even when i drive my premiums out i feel like a damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥-The more stuff gaijin adds, its going to take even longer to balance it if you dont even put the correct br on it *Cough* *Cough* Tiger I *Cough* Cough*-Literally all my deaths are from planes and about 10 of them are from tanks which is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous, there is literally more kamikazes then there is tank combat and if you get lucky you might have a halfway decent game but when they cream their pants when they see that 2 button is available be ready for high quality kamikaze runs-Ballistics are problably the most broken thing on this game because of the lazy developers. some of the richochets i get make no sense			",20,0,0,6,1,1,1

												Having played this game for nearly 300 hours and progressing fairly far down multiple tech trees Ive come to the conclusion that this game is a waste of time. The recent patches have made playing this game less and less enjoyable with buggy physics and terrible damage and control models for aircraft and tanks alike. Flying realistic and arcade battles has become highly irritating as many players dont know how to support team members, read their maps, and even purposely kill other allies for no reason. Tank battles are slow paced and dont reward players for teamwork or tactical plays and the hitboxes and damage models are terrible.  It is a game catered to people who would rather spend hundreds of dollars on premium currency and tanks than upgrading the computer they play on. The biggest problems is the ability to turn every graphics setting to the lowest it can possible go, which disables everything from trees to grass turning realistic battles into nothing more than a long range turkey shooting campfestOn top of that the game is pay to win with the addition of premium currency bought camoflauges that can be added to the tank and over powered premium tanks like the Sherman Calliope, M18 Black Cat, KV-2 Zis 6, and etc. Unless you can afford to spend money on a week to monthly basis or if you happen to have your dads credit card on demand you will not enjoy the game in its current version. Maybe Gaijinn will fix this, maybe they wont, either way the game has become a waste of time and more anger than what its worth.			",34,2,0,9,7,0,8

												Currently the game is no longer fun. Gaijin is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the entire community (unless your russian) and only see's us for the money in our wallet. We have been bring up, pointing out, and suggesting things to fix and make the game better but the game has only goten worse. The only thing that gaijin has done to make it seem like they 'might' pay any attention to what we say is the creation of the player counsel. However this counsel has as about as much power as a middle school student counsel. Oh, by the way, they are under a NDA which makes them completely worthless to begin with. An obvious and clear bias for russian players and vehicles has been present for years now with no desire of changing that from Gaijins part. The T-34-85 for example very rarely catches fire, explodes after getting its ammo racks hit repeatedly, and seems to have some kind of internal explosion dampener to lower the effects of any round that makes it inside the tank. There was recently a poll on their fourms started by players to change the battle ratting from a 1.0 spread between vehicles to .7. so for example tiger II's dont have to fight tanks from the korean war. Last i checked the poll was at about 3,100 for yes and ~30 for no. Gaijin has offically stated they will not change the BR system and that it is perfectly fine. Despiste this poll showing that we the players strongly disagree.If you insist on playing this game the only way you will have fun after about tier 3 is playing russian vehicles. Also on a observasional note, the amount of premium vehicles for russia is massively dispraportional to the other nations. Just saying, they seem to be paying more attention to (a) certain nation than others.As the game is i simply cannot reccomend you join and waste you'r money on a company that clearly has a negative bias to anything not russian. The only reason i have not stoped playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥completely is because there is no other alternative game that can reasonably compete with it.			",24,3,0,5,12,1,10

												The game used to be fun, and used to be a good flight game. Now? I cannot reccomend it, more and more changes are made without being published in the patch notes, and more and more the game gets grindier and grindier, as well as less and less fun. The developers are outright ignoring community input at this point, and make changes that make the game less fun to play, then turn around and cite statistics that they refuse to show as their sources for whether community approves or disproves. I and many others are sick of it, as more and more vehicles are made premium that really shouldn't be, and there is such a focus on increasing the grind to increase incentive to pay that it is utterly ridiculous. I cannot stand the attitude of the developers toward their playerbase, nor that of some of their moderators. When I play a game about planes, I expect them to either be UFOs or somewhat realistic, and War thunder can't seem to decide between being a fun, instanced representation of ww2 and korean war aircraft and tanks or being a game about spaceships. There are so many arbitrary, unbalanced differences between vehicles and nations that it has lost fun. Indeed, many planes, despite having similar armament and turning radius, are made completely inferior for no solid reason, in arcade, where every plane has boosted stats. The so called 'realistic battles' are even worse. There is no incentive whatsoever toward teamwork, or really toward anything but furball dogfighting. I'm sick of it, so I'm saying goodbye. There are just too many frustrating things about the game, and it's only getting worse, unfortunately, thanks to the closeminded developers, the only way for the discontent to get through is for players to stop playing. The developers appear to have no interest whatsoever in keeping players around, instead focusing on bringing more players in, resulting in a high turnover rate. The only reason I stuck around as long as I have (since patch 1.27) is because of the time and monetary investment. Having a lot of new players come in is good and all, but not when it is by ignoring the issues in the game in favor of upgrading graphics and throwing shiny crap in people's faces. Games that do that tend to have no staying power, and end up falling into memory withing 2-3 years. I have the feeling that the only reason War thunder is still so popular and not terminal is because it has no real competition. ",120,6,5,24,13,1,17

Posted: January 13, 2014
												UPDATED 6/1/14War Thunder sounds great on paper, but the gameplay in this game is total garbage. The combat is awful. Since 95% of players will likely just play in arcade mode, if you get someone tailing you - you're done. I've tried every move in the air combat book and nothing works. This makes this the most infuriating game to play, because you can't escape a plane behind you. You literally need someone else to shoot them, and good luck getting help from random players.The controls are also terrible. I don't know what sick joke people play by telling people mouse mode is good, but it's awful. You don't have a direct feel for how much you're banking at any given moment and it's very difficult to get the reticle to line up for a lead shot. Most games you'll just spend your time circling an enemy, or if you try for a head on engagement you'll likely be rammed as death by plane collision is extremely common and some try to do it on purpose (Take out a bomber which is hard to shoot down by ramming it). The playerbase is not very helpful, and no one really helps out. You're most likely to be greeted with ""lol l2plane"" verbatim if you ask questions.The Realistic and Simulator modes resolve some of these issues, but the game controls still feel bad in mouse mode. My joystick hasn't arrived yet, but based on comments from many in the community mouse mode is easier than joystick mode so I doubt honestly it will get much better with a joystick. There are far less players in the realistic and simulator modes as well.Balancing is also an issue. There are some entire nations which perform far below others. Most players would say to play Russian and British planes and avoid Axis planes because they're not too good. At the starter tier, the Chaika a soviet plane is the most decried overpowered plane in the game. A high turn rate, biplane which fires 4 deadly cannons at a very rapid rate which can quickly take out the other planes at the tier and even many that are higher than it. Matchmaking will suddenly ramp the difficulty up for you significantly and start introducing you to many bombers and fighters as well as many strong ground targets which need large bombs to take out. At this point, you have nothing but light guns to shoot at ground targets and light bombs. This means you'll be forced to slug it out with the stronger planes, which you will likely lose to since they have superior guns. The overall process of getting to your next plane is very painful and doesn't feel well implemented. There are many things you can research, but the game presents them in a haphazard way that doesn't make much sense. Some tier 1 planes can't be researched, but then others can and after a random other plane is researched then a new one can be researched that is in no way related. The game's research tree is confusing, as much of the rest of the game is even to someone who knows what to look for.I spent a fair amount of time trying to give this game a chance, and it's just the most frustrating game experience I've had. Wouldn't recommend at all. If you're looking at this compared to Wargaming's games, this is way more pay to win model as you don't get any free XP (RP in this game) and with the premium currency you could easily skip up to a higher tier plane. I have played maybe 50-75 matches and I have 50k free RP that if I spent premium currency on I could unlock probably a tier 3 plane (The game has 5 tiers with multiple planes within the same tier). This game strongly rewards those who spend money, far more than a Wargaming game and it will likely prove frustrating for a player that's not hardcore into air combat and is honestly not that satisfying for someone who is interested in air combat given realistic and simulator modes are the modes you would want to always choose. A sidenote about those modes too, the matches are very long. The timer for realistic matches (More realistic than arcade but not as hardcore as simulator) is 60 minutes, to the generally 15-25 minute timer for arcade matches. The arcade mode to me just feels very off, and the difficulty curve into the realistic mode is much higher which makes it more difficult to grind for your next plane.UPDATESo I've heard about the ground combat. I decided to try it out and see if that was any better, of course World of Tanks is the first thing to compare it to. You start out in a lowly tank with a weak gun, but you face similar tanks and all is fairly fun. Arcade mode numbs down the difficulty a bit too much since you can immediately see where the enemy tanks are even if they're in heavy cover. Realistic mode is a bit too punishing though. Unfortunately if you're moderately decent at all, you get up-tiered because of your skill level very quickly and then you'll be facing off against tanks you can't hurt. So you'll find yourself cornered on maps, with no teammates (team work in this game is somehow even more non-existant than World of Tanks, likely due to the large maps and spread out goals). Often times flanking the enemy tank and shooting the rear doesn't even work. After a dozen matches of losing and being wiped out, with minimal XP gains, I just gave up again. You also get to worry about planes bombing you at any moment, as if the overpowered tanks you can't hurt aren't enough.Gaijin is never going to improve this game, clearly they've decided they want their game to be this ""realistic"" game that they won't back down from. Once again, realistic mode is far more sparsely populated than arcade though - and I think this is a huge mistake. Arcade mode is basically what World of Tanks is, though it has more enjoyable gameplay. War Thunder's ground combat is sloppy and feels like a mess. This game is a pretty big download and an even bigger disappointment for all the hype it receives. If you want ground combat, stick to World of Tanks (though I can't honestly recommend that anymore, teamplay is so awful there that matches are rarely fun anymore). We're sorely lacking a good game in this space now, but the choices are to make do with Gaijin and Wargaming's very mediocre games or do without. Frankly, I'd rather do without - these are just exercises in frustration and time wasting.			",296,66,6,40,38,3,61

												Yes, the game is really fun and addictive.  At 918+ hours I can say it is a true pay to win game.  I do not recommend this game unless you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or more on upgrades so you can at least have a fair chance against the other players who have  crews and or gear that can only be purchased with real money.  There is nothing wrong with using real money to buy stuff in a game but, when it comes to paying for XP so that you can lvl up your crews for the needed bonuses it adds up to a ♥♥♥♥ ton of nickel and dimes.  You will earn those same XP during each match, but at the rate of around 10 to 20 xp.  It takes several hundred if not thousands of xp to train one of around 25 skills (in Tank battles).  Good luck earning XP by just playing.  Long story short, this game sucks for PVP because of pay to win.  But is the best I have seen in a while for what I call eye candy (realistic looking models and FX)  and in single player mode, you can really take the time to enjoy what the game has to offer.PS.  I would accept War Thunder Gold Lion donations!  LoL			",33,3,0,9,1,0,1

												I've played this game for years and I used to really enjoy it, but the times have changed. Gaijin openly censores any critique of this game on the forums. Gaijin constantly adds things to the game that players dont want. Gaijin never listens to the community. Gaijin doesn't ever fix broken flight models or test their aircraft before they patch them into the game. Gaijin pits first era jets against Sabers, Mig 15's, Hunters, etc and refuses to rebalance or address issues that the community points out. Gaijin rarely adds any new game modes or changes anything about the game. Gaijin likes to take your money and give you nothing in return. Gaijin wants to ruin the game they worked so hard on creating. Please don't support this company or this game until they turn themselves around because at this time, Warthunder is an aggrivating, unfair, money pit where the developers♥♥♥♥♥♥on anyone who actually likes the game and want to support it.

												game is filled with social justice warriors in advocate with elitest views of the game. when you try to describe something wrong with it. gaijin has an army of people that will belittle you and say you are wrong. Then they will go on about how you should have been aborted. Why does gaijin do this? simple. it brings them cash to have people just shrug their shoulders and buy their pay to win content. to partition gaijin of a problem is like climbing mount everest of Arrogance. because gaijin handpicks elitest people for their =MOD= community that is in agreement with its views. in turn they are like the SS of 1939's german reich. if you try to make a argument about the games inbalance they are unleashed and say you are just a ""weak"" player. they also try to antagonize you so that you make a fool of yourself than actually arguing with you about the actual problem. they make a player a joke to the community so the player gives up trying to convince others of a actual problem so people just continue on with their day with a good chuckle.this is what gaijin advocates? It truely displays the immaturity of their staff and genuinely shows how gaijin appreciates the community. A player is only appreciated as far as a one night stand.sure you can read a huge article about how they say thank you to the community but in reality they genuinely hate you.			",22,0,0,4,3,0,8

												Sucks.Way too many ""skills/mods"" to level up and points to allocate to further increase the available efficiency. Everything screams ""Use real money to unlock me so this plane/tank doesnt suck so bad"". Literally, the tanks are stripped apart of essential equipment and set aside as unlocks. The crew who operates the tanks are another seperate entity requiring leveling to make the tank work better as well. But luckily this is a F2P and if you want you  are able to spend WAY too much money just to have an enjoyable ride without high centering on a curb or figuring out why your tank cant turn while on a 25 degree incline.

												So I thought I'd update my review since things have changed..The positives of this game are, in no order: - Incredible optimization - Incredible graphics - Incredible attention to detail with the vehicle models (not damage models though) - Enormous selection of vehicles to playThe downsides are: - Gaijin are complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and basically the dying fetus of the USSR - Hard to figure out mechanics for a lot of things - Russian vehicles often have game breaking bugs or problems that benefit them that go without fix for months.. if it hurts them then patched in a day - Non-Russian vehicles have a game breaking bug that benefit them for a day before it is completely patched, if it doesn't benefit them... months on end no fix - Shells that Russian vehicles don't mainly use (Solid AP, APDS, HESH etc) are underperforming and unrealistic - Smoke launchers don't work but you can use artillery which makes much more smoke as smoke screen - ATGM's completely ruined what little balance there was - Matchmaker can be stupidly biased with one team stacked with 8.0 tanks and enemy team have 7.0 tanks (basically a point pinata) - Lots of prototype pay to win vehicles - Grind is ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous  - Repair prices are so bad that only the top three people on either team will earn money - Running good graphics is a disadvantage (harder to see enemys in tanks) - Lot of unrealistic maps and unrealistic situations for tanks - Beta game being used as an excuse for problems when it has content that costs 40 ♥♥♥♥ing quid  - Keep adding content without fixing content in game - Community is full of weebs (I mean what the ♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ off with your anime fetish underage tank girls this is literally the reason germany started kicking off) - Easy to exploit game problems - Lack of information in tank RB makes it incredibly tense, long winded and really hair raising.  - Compression at top tiers is so bad that less people play entry level jets and then gaijin compress it more to lower matchmaker times and then less people play aircraft below that.... aka Gaijin just increase BR range and lower RP costs and these problems will sort themselves. - Lots of arcade gamemodes for realistic tanks - Gaijin claim to have realism (and do in a lot of aspects) but will ignore the community with overwhelming evidence (COUGH MAUS 240MM FRONT PLATE LITERALLY MEASURED IN REAL LIFE WITH A TAPE MEASURE AND GAIJIN JUST ♥♥♥♥ING IGNORED IT AND LEFT IT AT 220MM) and other times will change things in the name of ""balance""  instead of realism - Lots of German suspension is crap in game but there is a video of a Panther rolling over bumps with no problem but in game you break and the entire vehicle wobbles for 5 seconds before the gun can be line up with the target - Awful tournaments which nobody played and ended up being money grab - Getting free content requires grinding off your entire life  - Didn't add ships, despite leading the community to believe that they could play proper naval vessels, and instead added boats because everyone wants to sail in rubber ♥♥♥♥ing dingys instead of HMS Warspite - British tanks were ♥♥♥♥ing boss and actually competitive when first introduced because of APDS, whilst it was maybe too powerful all solid rounds across the board were nerfed so that British rounds are now not only laser pointers but cost silly amounts. - Spalling doesn't exist and apparantly a human in a tank is able to completely absorb a 5 kg round travelling at 1400 m/s able to penetrate 250mm of solid steel at 2km... yeh - APDS has a you hit it you kill it policy with ammoracks.. so if you're off by 2cm then congrats that ammorack survived and that's 400SL down the drain.So to summarize, it's a good game with good qualities but it's a grind and has extensive problems. Gaijin are so far up their own♥♥♥♥♥♥that they can taste their own tonsils and will never listen to community feedback, lest it disadvantage their agenda. Good luck if you do try it though!

												I think the battle between the 2 rival game devs Gaijin and Wargaming will continue on for a good long while. Which one you choose if you're looking into World of Tanks/Warplanes or War Thunder is your choice. However after playing both for a good long time I'd like to state that War thunder offers a great variety of things to do and possible some things that WoT/WoWP doesn't.  Have a comparison:-While WoT/WP has more tanks available War Thunder clearly has more variety when it comes to aircraft as it features bombers/dive bombers and other craft as well as nations not covered by WoT/WP yet.-War Thunder does NOT sell premium ammunition making players that invest in that slightly stronger.-War Thunders tier-system got changed from 20 to 5 tiers and a lot of work went into the game to maintain a good matchmaking balance (no invincible tanks/aircraft cause of uneven tiers.) However it seems to have infuriated a lot of people as progression seems slower compared to how it was before.-War Thunder does offer players coop pve missions and rewards you for playing those as well and it also features a variety of tutorials!-War Thunder lets you customize the paint of your tanks/aircraft and apply stickers to them without charging money for it.-War Thunder also offers you advanced settings like realism and simulation matchmaking which change the hud and other gameplay aspects (in terms of planes even the controls and things like wind resistance etc) to make the game feel like a simulation, though players wanting a more arcade'y experience get that as well in the standard arcade mode.-World of Tanks/WP mostly due to the earlier release id say offers a bigger competitive scene than War Thunder though might be subject to change in the future.-World of Tanks/WP gives you more detailed information in battle like hp bars, tiers (needed due to multitier battles) and lets players mod their ui. (Not sure if War thunder lets users use ui mods)-War Thunder's normal games are more Objective based and let players respawn a limited amount of times wheras WoT only gives you one shot at achieving your goal (games often end due to one team getting wiped out rather than objective victories)-The game engine that War Thunder uses is a lot prettier while maintaining a more stable framerate than World of Tanks (it also contains a at least evenly advanced physics engine)-At last I'd like to note that while World of Tanks/WP are seperate, the goal of War Thunder however is to implement battleships just like Wot/WP but also combine all 3 forces. Currently as theres only tanks and aircraft available those will be matched together. So ground vs air via flak tanks and air vs ground with dive bombers/heavy bombers is going to be a thing.In  the end War Thunder according to the developers will try to aim for a more open world experience in which ships , tanks and aircraft will battle over control in a world domination kinda mode. It will likely be a long time till that happens but it shows that they have a pretty solid plan for the games future.I hope those facts helped you decide what you think is best for you and enjoy the game. ^^Ps: I spend over 400 hours in War Thunder and used the non-steam client for a long time.

												Unfortunately even after playing this for over a year in realistic mode, grinding my way trough the German ground forces line, hoping that somehow in the future all this grinding will pay off, and I might stumble upon a tank that is at least a fair match against my Russian & American counterparts... alas twas not to be.- Don't play the German line in ground forces you will loose 90% of the time, only the first 2 tiers are a little bit more balanced.- Don't believe the bull**** that German tanks have better guns. Your Russian & American counterparts have the same + better armor, better bouncing, and much faster speed.- Maps are most of the time just a race to the capture points. Since your German tank is as slow as a snail, you will loose again and again to the faster Russian & American tanks.- For the love of god, don't use a panther tank, your turret will be disabled 99% of the time by a wisp of wind. Shooting your counterparts in the turret will just bounce it off, and even if you somehow manage to do damage, they will probably still be able to shoot.- Your German gun needs to time to get in position after a hard stop, it will slowely crawl it's way to the center of your crosshair. While you wait for that to happen your Russian and American counterpart, can just stop, aim and fire. - And if you still want to play after all this negativity, don't forget to put your graphics as low as possible you will magically be able to see through trees and bushes.

Product received for free
												***Honest review coming from about 800 hours in AB, slowly been transisitioning into RB.***The fact that I even have 1,000+ hours in a Free-to-Play game is astounding to me.I'll get straight to the point. This game in my opinion, has an acceptable balance of purchasing in-game currency vs. playing free. A lot of FTP games out there, again in my opinion, release overpowered items for purchase, and you got some guy running around like the Tazmanian devil and mopping up the place. This game does have premium purchases, ranging from planes, to tanks, to even buffing research on units and crew experience. However, it's entirely based on the individual's skill as a player, not some John Doe 5 mins in the game thinking he's a sexual tyrannasaurus aftering buying a shiny premium vehicle. Mr. John Doe can be dispatched simply by players who are more skilled and have more flight time. Moving on.I have made some great friends from all over the world in this game. Community can make or break a game. I'm not going to ramble on about comparisons to other games like DCS because you can go watch a youtube video somewhere for that. I'm just a history buff fascinated by the logistics of the WW2 era, and have a unique respect for the more experienced flight simulator pilots in this game.			",165,13,0,16,5,2,14

												It's near impossible to make real progress in this game since the latest update. You have to buy premium if you want to unlock new planes, especially in the later tiers. And you buy premium with the in-game currency, Golden Eagles, which has a RIDICULOUS exhange rate. Unless you were playing before the 1.37 update and already have planes unlocked, I definitely would not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ADVISE FROM A WAR THUNDER VETERAN!Do NOT play this game, I've been playing it for quite a long time and had to deal with a horrible unbalance (Gaijin prefers to give better planes to Russians and give them lower battle ratings). Besides, the moderation team is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that if you complain or use your speech of freedom ability, you will be immediately banned.I was unfairly banned permanently for using my right of speech of freedom.

												Now that War Thunder is officially released as of update 1.65, I figured I should probably get around to writing a review. This is the state of the game as of 12/20/16.War Thunder is a free to play vehicular combat game for PC and PS4, commonly described as an MMO. It's not an open world and there isn't one massive server with thousands of players playing side by side in the same battle, so I don't know if that's really an apt description though. The range of aircraft spans from just before World War II to the Korean War. The range of ground vehicles is from just before World War II to the Vietnam War.Players face off against eachother in teams of 16 versus 16. Airplanes have three modes: Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator.  Arcade is just that, and the mode most players should begin with. Most pilots fly with a mouse and keyboard in third person view, with a crosshair and lead indicator to help target enemies. Players can win a match by bombing out the enemy base, shooting down all enemy aircraft, or destroying all of the AI ground targets. Flight models are simplified and an instructor is present, meaning all planes of the same class (bomber, fighter, etc) perform relatively similarly and the computer will help you fly, eg, controlling the rudder in turns. Matches are typically ~10 minutes. Realistic battles have the same objectives, but the maps are much larger, flight models are not simplified (though an instructor is still present), and players must take off at the beginning of each match rather than spawning in the air. No lead indicator is present, and less HUD elements are present as well. A more comprehensive spotting system is included. Matches are typically 30-40 minutes long. In Simulator battles, players are locked to a first person cockpit view. A joystick is heavily reccomended, but not required (players can use a ""virtual"" joystick with their mouse).Tank battles follow a similar logic, with less HUD elements present as the difficulty increases. Aircraft play a minor role in tank Arcade Battles. In Realistic and Simulator battles, aircraft play a larger role.There are five nations available: The United States, Germany, Soviet Russia, The United Kingdom, and Imperial Japan. Each country has ground forces and air forces available. Each country has a tech tree, divided into five tiers. Players earn Research Points in battles to unlock new vehicles and modifications for their vehicles. Five vehicles must be unlocked in a tier to progress to the next tier. Players also earn a currency, Silver Lions, that is used to purchase these vehicles. Each tree has several lines, such as Fighters and Bombers or Light Tanks and Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns. Each vehicle has a Battle Rating to determine what other vehicles it fights.A premium currency, Golden Eagles, is available to purchase with real world money. They can be used to purchase a premium account (earning more Research Points per battle) or Premium Vehicles. As far as the issue of 'Pay To Win' goes, War Thunder is fairly well balanced. Premium vehicles do not have any inherent advantages. Premium vehicles are usually a certain pilot's aircraft, such as Alexander Pokryshkin's P-39, a lend-lease or captured vehicle, like a British F6F Hellcat or German P-47D Thunderbolt, or prototypes, like the Ki-87. Premium tanks are similar. They have higher currency and research rewards or offer a unique playstyle not available elsewhere in that respective nation's tech tree.The game tries, and succeeds in most cases, to be historically accurate. Some late war prototypes like the Maus tank or Kikka jet fighter are present, but most vehicles fought in a war of some kind.Visually, War Thunder is a beautiful game. Almost every moment is worthy of a screenshot. For lower end machines, the graphics can be lowered a decent amount.The main issue with the game is the grind. While there is no hard pay-to-progress paywall, around the fourth tier of a tech tree the grind becomes sufficient to cause many players to lose interest. Again, it is possible to reach the top tier of vehicles for free. But without a premium account or any premium vehicles, it can take multiple months to research a single vehicle. At lower tiers, progress is fine. But for jet-powered aircraft or ATGM-equipped tanks, one has to be an extremely dedicated player or purchase a premium vehicle or account to have any semblance of progress.War Thunder is well worth your time. For a Free to Play game it is visually stunning, and it's easy to have fun whether you're storming a factory in Stalingrad in your T-34, part of a bomber formation in your B-29 superfortress, enduring artillery and cannon fire in a Leopard I, or dogfighting over MiG alley in an F-86 Sabre. And with naval forces on the horizon and the release of update 1.65 adding numerous much awaited features like bomber cockpits and Japanese ground forces, there's never been a better time to jump in.

												*** I DO NOT PLAY THIS ON STEAM. THE HOURS ARE INCORRECT. ***As a life-long fan of aviation, This is of course right up my alley for a relaxed game, it's fun to play, especially with friends. And I believed the intial concept of War Thunder to be perfect, unfortunately, the beta progressed, and it began to show it's FUNDAMENTAL flaws. Mainly being jointly the developers and moderation team, especially in areas such as decision making.The developers will happily break something to change the game, and 'accidentally-on-purpose' increase the performance of something and then put it on sale for a while. So, so shameless. The moderation team, are truly exempt from rules, although they like to say that they're bound by their rules too, it looks good but it's not true. The people who hold authority over them speak Russian, in Russia. They trust that the English speaking staff will manage things accordingly, but that trust is misplaced. It's ran with a very ""You'll do as I say or else"" atmosphere, Speaking out against their decisions results in a punishment, voicing an opinion, first-time offenses, and if they dislike you, they'll go out of their way to punish you. They particularly hire moderators that like to throw their weight around, watch general chat for a while, you'll see what I mean.The overall direction the game seems to be going in, is very + and -. The developers don't seem to review what we tell them directly is bad, yet force it upon us (20 Tiers to 5 Tiers ahem) Oh and that annoying self inverting camera angle. The USA seem to have it easy, probably because they pay the most. It wouldn't surprise me, these guys are shameless. Although I still have hope for this game, I must rate it negatively, this may change if THEY change.. But that's the problem. Until these catastrophic issues are resolved, I strongly advise you to play other games... Whilst we all hope that they get their @#!$ together.And yes, I'll speak out against their power abusive ways here because I can.. Or can I? Incoming ban.			",98,6,6,20,26,1,34

												War Thunder is a massive MMO combat game thing where you take WW2-era aircraft and tanks (eventually ships) into small online matches against other players where you try to complete map objectives, kill your enemies, or just die horribly because you don't know how to fly or drive. Fun!This game shares considerable resemblance to the games made by Wargaming, namely World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. However, Wargaming's products tend to be very ""arcadey"" in their gameplay, require an obscene amount of grinding, and seem to be heading into the direction of e-sports. And while it is true that War Thunder also requires lots of grinding to unlock the best toys and has tournaments of its own, it also leans more towards realism than Wargaming's products, for better or worse. The mechanics of grinding to unlock new vehicles and upgrades for them is shared, but while World of Tanks forces you to play mediocre vehicles like the M3 Lee or Jagdpanzer IV to unlock the much better M4 Sherman and Jagdpanther respectively, War Thunder allows you to get experience towards unlocking your next vehicle of choice regardless of what you choose to use. In other words, you can use the F6F Hellcat and gain experience towards unlocking the F4U Corsair, B-25 Mitchell, or even stuff much later in the research tree like the B-29 Superfortress and F-86 Sabre. So in short, War Thunder is like World of Tanks/Warplanes, but with less BS, less moneygrubbing, and far less vehicles that saw no combat or never made it off blueprints.To answer the biggest question all people have about free to play games: No. War Thunder is not Pay to Win. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a troll, an idiot, or a fanboy of the competition. And while you can spend money on War Thunder to increase your experience gain or to buy special vehicles, none of this feels like ""must haves"" as Tier VIII Premiums do in World of Tanks when credit income starts becoming a severe problem in the light of rising repair costs. Some things will take a little longer, but you can easily get by in War Thunder without spending a dime. And besides, there are plenty of awesome vehicles to use in the early parts of the tech tree, so it won't take long to get to the good stuff. :DSince the game is Free to Play, I feel as if there is little more I ought to say here. If the idea of a game where you can fly around planes or drive tanks and make people explode sounds appealing, then go ahead and give this a try. Who knows? You may end up having lots of fun! :D			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												After having played this game for....1,111.1 hours; if steam is to be believed...I still haven't grown tired of it. Each match feels different from the last. The game has evolved considerably since I first started playing. I can remember when each nation only had a handful of aircraft. Now the game boasts over 300+ Unique aircraft (Guiness World Record). And the game also now has tanks for Russia, Germany and the US. WarThunder has a variety of modes to appeal to a variety of different people. Arcade is a good mode for quick matches. Realistic battles are more challenging and remove aim indicators. And full sim battles are particularly intense in that your view is restricted to the commander or cockpit view. The vehicles all have distinct characteristics and models and perform differently as a result. You can go a whole match without scoring one kill and still come out on top of the leaderboard if you play the objectives. If you manage to belly land your plane after sustaining critical damage your rewarded for it. If you take a lot of hits your rewarded for it with an adamant reward. Playing in a squad and assist your team mate killing a tank; your rewarded for it. This is in stark contrast to a game like WoT. In WoT you get one spawn, and when your vehicle's HP pool is depleted thats it. In WarThunder you can try to get back to base in your plane. Or you can repair your tank in the field if you have the repair module unlocked. You aren't just given a static 'death' animation as you get in WoWP. It also needs to be said that the tanks have evolved quite a bit in WarThunder. With changes like ground deformation you see your tank's tracks sinking into the ground. And if you get into 'muddy' terrain. Your tank becomes covered in Mud and ends up bogged down. WarThunder also has a great customization system. You can put decals on your vehicles, adjust their camo, and on tanks you can even adjust how worn that camo is. Or you can load up the texture in photoshop or another program and make your own skins. WarThunder has a lot to offer especially for being a free game. And you may find yourself coming back for more and more. I know I have. Especially when new vehicles are released. Like the recent addition of the B-29. What are you waiting for? Go download the game; and see you in the skies and on the ground!			",85,9,0,9,7,0,16

												War Thunder is sadly one of the game i decided to quit after following it over a long time. Playing a few hundred hours non-steam and 243 hours on steam i can safely say that i am done with it. Ive been a beta tester for planes & tanks and have had experience with early gameplay and the final gameplay - very often not a big difference between those two.The flight part is very good, might be even one of the best free flight games on the market. You have an enormous amount of planes over various nations with let you play in a lot of different ways. Bomber, Dive Bomber, Torpedo Bomber, Fighters, Attackers, Jets [...]. The matchmaking is okay, depending on the game mode you are playing. You have the choice between Arcade, Realistic, Simulation. The names indicate how realistic each mode is. A huge flaw however is the huge grind it takes once you reach slightly higher levels. The sheer amount of planes which you need to research to reach a new tier is insane! I would still recommend this for casual players.The tank part is incredibly bad. Many problems with it were addressed during the closed beta, but were never resolved. The Dev's were spamming unnecessary updates for stuff that did not need to get fixxed. While they tried to be realistic they went overboard and got too realistic. Tanks being able to fire rounds which were incredibly rare during WW2? Hey, doesnt matter, lets fully load them with it! Now every tank is gonna be a one shot easy kill. Bugs over bugs made this hugely anticipated game mode unplayable. Overall i do not recommend this game. The grind is just too strong and the overwhelming amount of bugs and problems within the game is too problematic.			",561,189,17,68,47,2,97

												War thunder is a great game.Now, I speak from 38.3 hours on record at the time of this review; Now that may not look like much and it isn't compared to the veterans here with 100+ hours played but I'm going to write this review anyway of a newer players perspective.Just some background on me and my experience with this game: I started playing a little bit here and there about half a year ago and went through a phase of playing daily but now I play a couple of hours every few weeks, it's a good game both for playing a lot or sparingly and I like that.The game does encourage you to log in everyday to collect rewards wether that be RP (Research Points) or Silver Lions (1 of 2 in game currencies, the other being Golden Eagles which is more of a premium currency that you purchase)I have mainly played the aviation side of things and only delved a few hours into tanks which is why I'm basing this review on the aviation side of things.The game does not feel very pay to win to me, most of the planes that can only be unlocked by purchasing are really not to good from what I've seen and I'm okay with that. The game has got a few balance issues as some planes can dominate depending on which country you're playing as. The first American planes are really not that good and feel VERY underpowered compared to the competition.Now onto the gameplay, the gameplay is incredibly fluid and feels amazing. There are two modes that are widely used, Arcade Battle and Realistic Battle. Arcade is some good fun and I personally enjoy it more than Realistic but Realistic is realistic just as the name applies and feels really good. It feels like your ammo and weaponary are doing good damage, it's so satisfying watching a plane burn down with pieces falling off of their planes.Now there is one more mode, Simulator Battle and that requires a joystick but I've been told that honestly the joystick does not control well at all which is weird in a flying game. I've also heard that they can get destroyed by keyboard and mouse players too. The controls for keyboard and mouse do feel REALLY good though and I cannot find a fault in that regard.Onto the graphics, sound and performance: Both graphics and sound are beautiful in this game, seriously, it looks AMAZING. Everything about it is great, nothing to complain about. Very very pretty game.This game is also REALLY well optimised and runs amazingly. It has a tonne of graphical and performance settings so you can get a good setup for your PC and it will run amazingly. Seriously that on a F2P is rare these days.Pros:Amazing graphics and soundsReally well optimisedOverall a very fun gameCons:Sometimes can feel inbalancedWhy I would recommend this game: All of above ^ Besides, it's free to play! You have no reason not to try it!			",218,30,12,22,34,1,18

												Ive decided after almost 3 years of playing to write a review...and to quit.This game started with a lot of promisel; when it first came out it co-incided with World of Warplanes, in which Warthunder was clearly the better game with 20 tiers of airplanes and without microtransactions, a good pricing for premium game time.THe game has since morphed much closer to how World of Tanks operates, but without any of the balance, with Sabres fighting Fw190s, its really questionable how they chose to matchmaking (I did hear this was being fixed ""soon"").The low tiers are fine and fun, but the end game just isnt there yet, constatly in flux.Arguably, this is the most ""authentic"" tank simulator out there (its not realistic, but its not bad),  But there's a lot of work to do which frankly after 3 years there's no excuse for.If you choose to invest time into this game,  do not do so heavily; the grind is long and the balance at the upper levels are poor.If you simpyl want a WW2 tank sim, I suggest and recommend IL:2 Battle Of Stalingrad which now has tanks and frankly its much better than this.

No single hit that damage his stuff or crew and just got hitpoints and exp, the fourth bullet manage to hurt the driver a bit. He backs up and I manage to hit him one time on the side. Just exp and hitpoints. He takes aim on my front and fire off, my tank got destroyed. Next time I take my tank destroyer and again I hit him with 2 armor percing rounds and no single damage on his crew. He comes up at me with some BB gun bullets and just shoot on my front and It takes out the driver. My driver manage to recover and he shoots again and my gunner is out. He keeps shooting on my tank destroyer and at my front side with BB gun bullets and Im out. This is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and this is not just one moment this happend almost every time. ",42,2,0,5,11,0,9

												There's atrocious balance, gameplay, physics, RNG, and playerbase. Gaijin as a company is shady and their forum moderation is cancer with a lack of respect for the community and bullying criticism of the game into the dirt. Constant updates with ""ninja nerfs"" that they rarely list in the patch notes and new mechanics no one wanted or asked for. The game is only fun with friends when you abuse the broken bits of the game that have been broken for numerous patches without any real fix. Plenty of grinding and band-aid solutions to everything, however. So if you really need some WWII combat game, you'd be better off just playing this for a few hours since it's just free-to-play, then finding a different game that's worth your money and time. This game looks beautiful, at times, and that's about it. Lot of wasted potential here, which is the saddest part in my opinion.			",49,2,0,7,6,2,12

												Shouldn't even be classified as a game, but a rage simulator. You may seem to enjoy it at first but you will shortly find out that this """"""""""game"""""""""" is terrible. You will die in the most stupidest, unfair and most rage inducing ways. This game would be twenty times better if the current game owner ""Gaijin"" would sell it to a developer that's at least somewhat competant and that doesn't have a bias for their own country (Gaijin is a russian developer, go figure)The grind for new vehicles is also slow and suffering once you reach about rank 3 in any nation, tank or aircraft. This is when it encourages you to buy a premium membership, DON'T. Giving any money to Gaijin only encourages more bad updates, vehicles and bias.And the people who say there is a ""Russian Bias"", I whole heartedly agree with every single one of them.Also another thing, Prepare for an rng simulator, RNG for EVERYTHING you do including: If a shot can penetrate a sliver of armor, Critting landing gear when you aim for the wings and much, much more.Please, Go play another decent game while you can because this is virtually a black hole and you don't want to get sucked into this.

The worst thing above all is how the MOD and DEV team react to forum cryout and to people who criticize bad features of WT,They will neither banned you or permenantly de-voice you both in forum and in-game, in other words they will not allow you to criticize the game at all! They only allowed you to do ""pro Gaijin"" comment.

												War Thunder is a good simulator game in which you can fly planes or drive tanks. It has good, detailed graphics and effects to show damage or fire, such as the smoke trail left by burning planes. It is very easy to get into and the controls are very simple to get the hang of.However the game can get very frustrating, very often you are 'one shotted' as soon as you get into combat, and the matchmaker is slightly poor, with reserve or low tier vehicles being sometimes placed in high tier games.Reseaching other upgrades and new vehicles sometimes feels like a grind but the effort is more than often worth it.I have very much enjoy playing War Thunder and overall i would recommend this game as it is extreamly easy to play and anyone can get into it although it does have its weaknesses and problems, but not everything can be perfect.

												Half-arsed PvE.  They added a practically non-functional PvE mode to the game so they could slap on those ""single player"" and ""coop"" categories.Custom games do not give any rewards for playing.  There is a highly fixed range of PvE missions that give experience and currency, and those few missions even have to be earned through grinding in PvP first.I'm sure it's fun with PvP, if you're into that.

												Awful game and support team, definitely do not recommend to anybody who wants to have fun! I have been playing this game for years and spent many hundreds of pounds and days getting to higher teirs on their game experiencing Russian bias which I could put up with since Arcade was okay.This game has tanks that are made of paper and explode after 1 round and Russian tanks which absorb 10 to 20 hits and come out just fine. If that's your style then cool.It also has planes, the beginning of the game which was my favourite game mode to play. However there are bias there too unfortunately.That's all I have to say about the game since my account got hacked and I lost £60 to someone purchasing Eagles until I checked my emails and found out they had changed my password, bought eagles then the day after attempted to close my account.Oh cr*p I thought.So I contacted Support and our conversation didn't go as expected. Expect YOURSELF liable for any of this happening as they will refuse to help you!Full details on a facepunch thread I shared here: https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1512443&p=51060348&viewfull=1#post51060348You can see what I had said to them and I was being polite, regardless telling people about their awful customer service is deemed the equivalent of account execution!So her last words to me were this: ""These actions violate the Terms of Use you accepted while registering the game accounts:http://warthunder.com/en/support/termsofuse/So, due to our EULA your account jxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxm will from now on stay blocked permanently.Our decision won't be revised.Also please avoid making new incidents and duplicates, as it causes confusion.I'm closing this one.All tickets regarding the same issue will be closed as duplicates as well.Farewell.Best regards,Gaijin Entertainment Support Team""Please do bare this in mind when you play the game, if you get Hacked, well as Gaijin would say ""F*ck you!""

												This is outdated but the only difference between now and then is more problems with things.( I SAY THIS WITH HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE GAME )If i was to wright this two months ago I would say Yes play this game , but after the clear♥♥♥♥♥♥Gaijin is tryin to do , I do not support this game at all.The ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; started along time ago when they did some changes to the BR and seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up the game ( and or when Spitfires were the best planes in the game ) and the game could deal with it because it was only planes and planes require more skill , but after they added tanks BR has been alot for importent to the game and after finaly fixing the BR once it is clear as day that the BR is broken in the way that most USSR tanks have very broken BR sytems ( like the newest T-34 ).The next thing that is very broken in the game is the Rewards system and the whole grinding up in the game. This game along time ago ( befor all u newer player started playing and befor it got on steam ) this game fun to play because it was not to hard to grind up in this game but not to hard were it made the grind unenjoyable, but now the grind normally grinds away player that like the game and with the BR BS stuff makes it so people in my experience stop playing te game around the Teir 3 Vehicles and the Teir 2 Planes. That #1 makes it so Gaijin has to make money some were else because of hte lose of so many players makes them try to grind money out of us in other more annoying ways ( and or Pay for enjoyment type of system which is different from Pay 2 win ). In conclusion ( after houndreds of hours of playing and playing hundreds of hours befor it got on steam ) this game is not worth any ones time and World of tanks and hte new Armored warfare and tons of other games like heros and generals have more rewarding things and less BS things in the game and so far has alot more devoted systems to fix problems in the game.

Posted: January 18, 2015
												This tank/warplane simulator is definitely one of the best out there and, without a doubt, I can say that I'm in love with it. Gaijin Entertainment has certainly beaten its Wargaming counterpart - World of Tanks - with this simulator and I will tell you exactly why.I - HEALTH SYSTEMThere is no such thing in this game. You don't see no health bar that shows you how much damage you've taken or can still take, what you do see, however, is your tank's status. You can clearly see each part of your tank, like the tracks, suspension, engine, fuel tank, ammunition, turret and individual crewmembers. There is no way to destroy a tank just by shooting its hull continuously in areas you can penetrate (like in World of Tanks), but you can effectively disable a tank by shooting its engine, fuel tank, ammo rack or by knocking out its crew. The last option really pisses people off for a reason.Same goes for air battles. Your plane can get knocked out when it gets damaged just enough that it can't stay airborne, or when its wings are clipped entirely off. Or the pilot is killed.II - PROGRESSIONWhile progression can be quite slow, it's generally fun and more rewarding than in World of Tanks. Why? Because it simply has a lot of things attached to it that are worth the grind! Namely, the more you earn experience, the more you can use it to upgrade your tank's modules, like, add fire extinguishers (which are free), add APCR rounds (More penetration at the cost of damage, also free), improve gun stability or your tank's turn rate which is a lot of fun. Sure, progression speed is based on how many kills you can rack up per match, or how good you perform (assists count too, and they count for a lot), but in general, it's fun and rewarding.III - CUSTOMIZATIONCustomizing your armored fighting vehicle is free! You don't have to pay real money to attach a flag or a symbol, or some text to your vehicle, but you do have a limitation. You can attach two things at the same time, while, if you pay, you can attach four things on your vehicle. Customization options include camoflage, world flags, numbers, sentences that tankers used to write on their tanks back in WWII and a lot more. To unlock certain pieces to paint on your tank, you need to complete a few challenges. When you complete those challenges, you're free to paint on that text or symbol that you've wanted to attach for a long time!Note, this is just a small review for the game and it's prone to editing, but overall, I recommend this game to EVERYONE who wants a good World War II tank simulator. Forget about World of Tanks and its grind and unfairness, War Thunder is the best WWII sim ever and for now, the best tank sim (Until Armored Warfare appears, anyway).			",93,13,3,13,14,0,10

												War Thunder is a game that will change your perspective on flying games, this game is Free to play and does a fairly decent job at staying away from the Pay to win aspect that most free to play games have.The Graphical fidelity in this game is stunning, the scenery is beautiful and maps are very well put together and are just incredible to fly around in. The planes are a wonder to fly in and make you want to stick with it and learn its strengths and weaknesses. The overall gameplay is very good and never gets old and dull with more maps are being added in each new patch to keep the rotation fresh and entertaining and with you learning new tactics and skills to take down your foe. There is quite a bit of customisation allowing you to put decals on your plane and change the skin to one of a differnt theatre that the plane fought in or an iconic Ace's design.Depending on how you look at it this could be a good or bad thing and that is the game becomes quite a bit of a grind after a    while.The business model of this game is fairly good as you really cant Pay to Win you can buy premium planes with real money but they serve as a way to gain exp and money slightly quicker but arent overpowered as they are just like any other plane in its tier only they are allowing you to gain money and research points quicker there is a premium account which offers bonuses to Money and Research points and allows you to add more decals to your plane.+Stunning Visuals+Great flying mechanics+Great with historcal accuracy+/- Can be a bit of a grind later on-Slight Bias towards the developers country (Russia)Overall i'd give this game a 9/10 The graphics are great the flying is fantatic, it's definetly worth a try and will most likely change your view on Aviation games and hopefully will make you like them.

												OK, so sure, there are a lot of child trolls and adults with personality disorders playing the game, especially in arcade mode, but that's one of the great things about War Thunder, you can evolve beyond that and leave all the miscreants behind.Simply learn how to fly in simulation mode, where the majority of players are mature and far too busy perfecting their art to bother with raging at or insulting other players.It's not DCS but it's accessible and it's fun, you can pay for premium toys or you can earn them, it can be a giant sinkhole for cash and/or time, but how you progress is up to you.7/10			",2,0,0,1,5,0,12

It sure takes a lot of time to grind stuff open, but I've had fun with just a few planes. But if you want to open a lot of new airplanes, then you need to invest some money.			",263,52,11,28,17,4,24

												War Thunder is a free to play massively multiplayer online game for the PC and PS4. Developed by Gaijin Entertainment, it started off as a World War 2 air combat game, but has already added tank combat, which this review will focus on. Just like the Aircraft mode all the vehicles are from World War 2. If you’re familiar with tanks from that era, or play World of Tanks then you’ll recognise most if not all the tanks.The game play, just like the aircraft mode, is based around capturing and holding territory. Think of it as one big 15 vs 15 king of the hill match with tanks. Each team has a health bar. If one team has more captured territory then their opponents health bar begins to decrease. A team wins by reducing the enemy teams health to zero. There are two main variations of this mode. One has multiple points (usually three) on the map to capture, and the other only has one point on the map. Regardless which game type is on, almost all matches are won by the team who controls the center of the map.The vehicle physics are great. Tanks move like tanks. Unlike in World of Tanks where the tanks move as if they are slow heavy cars, tanks in War Thunder behave like tracked vehicles. This mean that they slide around, struggling to get traction, especially if you are traveling at speed. This can be used as a good tactic when attacking an enemy tank, skidding around them to get a clear shot of the less protected back of the tank. You can also embarrassingly flip your tank upside down if you’re not driving carefully. Graphic wise the games mostly looks great but there are a few areas that look dated. The tanks and other vehicles look amazing. The developers have put a lot of detail into the tank models, from the detailed textures, weld marks on joints, and just little imperfections on the tanks. These give the impression that the tanks were hand-built in a factory like their real counterparts, rather than crafted using a 3D modeling tool. However the terrain looks a bit dated and can sometimes look very angular. Some of the ground textures also look blurry and stretched.The game’s audio is top-notch. It sounds like a living battlefield. Headphones are a must as you’ll hear every creek and sputter your tank makes, and more importantly the sounds your enemies will make. The best sounds are the ones made when firing your tanks cannon. No other game has weapons that are as satisfying to fire than these!As with War Thunders air combat a lot of people will compare this to World of Tanks. Comparing the two though is a bit like comparing Counter-Strike with Battlefield 2. Both share the same weapons/vehicles and on some maps have similar objectives, but they are different enough that playing both will give two different experiences. World of Tanks is more like a team death match, while War Thunder plays like large game of King of the Hill. The most obvious difference is that in World of Tanks you only get one tank per match, while in War Thunder as long as you have spare tanks and crews you can keep respawning. This makes a big difference as people are more cautious playing World of Tanks while players are more willing to take risks to grab objectives in War Thunder. Overall War Thunder tank battles are great.The combat is exciting and rewarding.One shotting a higher tier tank is a great feeling. War Thunder is free to play, and while you can play this game without ever needing to spend a single penny, if you get into it then there are plenty of tanks to buy.  Don’t worry if you don’t plan on paying for anything though, as the game is balanced enough to stop people from paying to win. If you’re a fan of World of Tanks or enjoy tank combat check this out. War Thunder plays different enough for you to happily play both.			",2267,868,87,236,310,22,349

												I do not wish to recommend or discourage people to play or not to play. All I know is the game has to have an extreme overhaul in balancing of the game. To the develoopers of the game, Russians where not all-mighty and glorious as you make them out to be, as they were EXTREMLY behind in WWI. When you make a war game, make the vehicles like they where back during that period of war. Also please take recommendations from people who have played the game, for they know more about how the game plays than you do. Making a game extremely grindy like you have makes it not worth it to pay any money, unless you no-life the hell out to this game. Just listen and look through the ALL of your NEGATIVE reviews to see what must be fixed to bring players back into the game. Encouragement is a great way to have people buy in-game items, like ""Spend 30 dollars on these virtual planes and get a free WarThunder T-Shirt!"" Listen to your players if you wish to extend the longativity of your game and bring in more revinue, and offer for companies to put ads when a player starts to log in to the servers with a message ""Sorry for the problem, but we need money to keep the servers running! Don't want to see ads? Buy a silver no-ad premium!"" and sell that premium for $5 USD or something. Thank you if you read this review.			",79,2,1,11,4,0,9

												Very good game overall. Graphics & sound is exceptionally well done. FREE to play & indeed it is, but, it is cleverly structured to induce you to go for a premium account perks. Your in-game Experience is used to upgrade your planes & also to purchase new ones, which, this would take forever without the premium bonus. But the Dev's have more than earned it with all the content delivered plus the continual updates to the game.  Solid 9/10 rating. Would love to play it more however if you have a flaky internet connection, you WILL suffer the frustration continually of firing at enemy planes with little effect. Using a fast mobile broadband connection fixes the issue but is helluva expensive.			",116,8,3,7,3,0,6

												This game used to be great, the graphics are wonderfull and the gameplay is easy and good.But, Gajin is messing the game up quick. Matchmaking just sucks, you'll get uptiered systematicly, meaning u are fighting planes much stronger, thus making the game not fun anymore.Also the killing system is completely messed up, when you shoot a plane completely out of order, but someone lands one shot before the plane goes down, you don't get the kill.When you are playing longer this means there are 100's of kills stolen from you, which is very annoying.The worst thing is that Gajin doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the players and their opinions, there are countless topics with very good ideas to fix the problems, completely prepared and ready to be inserted in the game, but they just won't do it without giving an explanation.

												Fantastic WWII based flight sim, for the great price of free.Currently there's 5 nations available to play (and you can swap at any time) with a whole host of iconic aircraft to play with in any of 3 different play modes which are designed to cater to those that want a fully immersive simulation experience, a quicker, faster and easier to control arcade experience, or for those who find themselves in between.Tanks are due in the near future, with naval combat planned for later on in the games development cycle.  The game run's well on pretty low end systems, and looks absolutely stunning on more powerful gaming rigs, and can be played with mouse and keyboard or joystick well (in fact, mouse and keyboard is actually easier than stick for arcade mode)An RPG style progression system means that you are always able to work towards either improving the planes and crews you have, or unlocking new ones, whilst having a very active developer means that there is always something fresh to try, and some new event or map, etc to try out, plus there's various in game achievements and decal/skin unlocks to work towards to give you a sense of direction when you want it.Freemium unlocks are well balanced, and typically provide a better range of options to a player, than any kind of ""pay to win"" scenario you can find with some other titles.If you like flight combat sims, you need to give this a try.  If you're a fan of FPS style games, take a look anyway, it's surprising how much fun tearing chunks out of aircraft, instead of people, can be. ",483,137,28,88,107,8,96

												Note: I have never flown, I have only played War Thunder for Ground Forces.This game has turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Much like World of Tanks, if you are driving a German tank, you are not allowed to hit anything. Regardless if you have the most accurate gun in World War II, you will miss and an ISU-152 or KV-2 will just kill you while it's on the move from over 500 yards away. Despite this obvious innaccuracy, Gaijen still REFUSE to add an anti-spawnkill system for when the hordes of Russian hackers steamroll you and your team. This♥♥♥♥♥♥should be illegal, it is the only product in the world that people can't stop using and paying for because it sucks.I used to like this game - World of Tanks too. Until the statistics of the tanks made no sense when compared to the actual performance of the tanks in battle. I don't care how strong the HE in the 152mm gun is, those guns were horridly innacurrate and should NOT be able to outshoot a Panther at ranges in excess of 1km. I get it, the German tanks can't be invincible and the game needs to remain competitive. But if the way of balancing the game out is to breakdown historical accuracy, then you're just admitting that you are being bias. Russian tanks were inferior to German engineering, that's why a Tiger takes up all of your spawn points in a realistic battle. If Gaijen is all about historical accuracy, why don't they fix this? I wouldn't get so frustrated if my gun - let me stress the MOST ACCURATE guns of World War II - would actually hit their target.InsteadI shootMissEnemy tank turns their turret towards meI shootHitDo no damage to a Sherman with an 88mm gunSherman shoots at me with 76mm gunHits and kills my gunner and driverCan't shoot backSit and wait for crew to switch outSherman shoots againKills me by penetrating the most heavily armored part of the tankThis is infuriating and is the overall reason why I uninstalled this game and World of Tanks. I hope both of these companies eventually go out of business.			",62,4,0,2,14,0,16

												Used to play this game every day despite the frustration of trying to tier up non Russian tanks. As has been said many times in these reviews, the dev is russian and their bias towards Russian tanks in the game is obvious. You can also fight in the sky in this game, but i never bothered much with that part of the game because the tank sim side was so well done. I enjoyed running circles around enemy tanks in my T-50 and blowing them all to bits (lower tier russian tank that was still op in that Tier)However the latest patch just broke any will i had to play the game anymore, actually in my opinion it broke the (tank sim) game completely and turned off a lot of long time players from wanting to play it anymore. (me included) Forcing lower tier tanks to fight the highest Tier removed any fun factor from the game. Essentially, if your not a top tier Russian tank, but from the lower tier you will be forced into this match making system where you are as good as cannon fodder (does not matter how skilled you are, your shells will simply deflect off the higher tier tanks and do 0 damage. ww2 tanks vs. cold war tanks. Only play the ground game in war thunder if you plan on only ranking up Russian tanks, since devs seem to want to hinder the growth of their own game by creating over powered russian tanks and the recent update of the matchmaking system completely broke the later stages of the game. Otherwise graphics are great, sound effects and being able to fighter bomber missions against opposing tanks during the round makes war thunder a unique ww2 tank sim that is worth the try, just beware of the broken match making system in higher tiers.

												In Soviet Russia, game plays you.This game is quite an amazing one. I am a huge history buff, so I guess that makes it a little better for me. But, on the down side, the matchmaking sucks, the community moderators are complete DonkeyHoles who were born on Pluto, but the actual WT community itself is awesome. There is, however, one really helpful and nice moderator, his name is MaximeDelaroux. If you have any questions or advice about WT, I highly suggest messaging him.Going back to that mod thing, I got banned for 5 days for saying ""grammar nazi"" in a chat jokingly. I mean, WTF? This is a WW2 game for goodness' sake. Oh yeah and I think that the absolute most important thing that needs to be said to any prospective new players is that this game requires SO SO MUCH grinding. You start the game with beginner planes that don't cost much and you're like ""huh. pretty fun"" then like two months later you realize that it's taking you like 4 days worth of time in game just to get one plane, and the cost of each plane just goes UP and UP.Now for the conclusion. Basically if you want to have a good experience, play the game, rank up, try to avoid fighting commies, better yet play as a commie, don't say anything in the chat, and always say something pro communist in the forums in order to gain the favor of the mods. ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭ How to have a bad experience: Use common sense in the forums, say something anti communist in the chat, and try to give the devs useful advice.Thumbs up for the WT players and the game itselfThumbs down for the stupid matchmaking and the Soviet moderators.8/10 Would argue with drunk communists again			",42,1,0,7,10,0,20

												Well, this game used to be very fun and very interesting.  However, the recent changes to the economy, including the tier/research revamp, have caused the people I play with and myself to stagnate horribly.  Now, I feel like I am not getting any closer to a high-tier fighter.  That is because I am not.  On average, I have received about 500 points towards a new plane, which costs about 120,000.  That's about half a percentage.  Granted, before the XP system was flawed similarly, but you unlocked every plane for a level once you leveled up, and there were times when I got 10,000-20,000 XP, so now I have to play approximately 4 times as many games to unlock just ONE PLANE.  Not to mention, I then have to pay for it with lions, the game's currency.  So, while the early tiers seem to be pretty much the same, more or less, after about tier 3 the game becomes an unbearable grind.  So, if you feel like grinding for hundreds of hours, feel free, and obviously there are casual options.  However, I would suggest purchasing premium/eagles or waiting until they fix the economy.

												Wanna play a real World War 2 flying simulator then give War Thunder a go. The air combat is fantastic and amazing. The new patch 1.39 has definitley helped the progression system. While it is a free to play game, Gajjin though have still things to include and it is dissapointing that tanks have not been released. It is still a grind to unlock planes at later tiers, but at lower tiers its excellent. While the graphics are great, and at lower tiers this game is great to get into. Though I hope tanks are realeased soon, but Gaiijin isn't getting my money for the tank packs. This game is addicting and fun, and with the new customization of skins and such, I have reasons to play this game again. I have always loved World War 2 aircraft, and this game has improved in 1.39. With the addition of skins I can enjoy playing again, the low tier is easy to gain rp, but to get 6 planes in tier 4, just to unlock jets its absolutley ridiculous. Its a grind, unless you have premium to unlock tier 4. If you are just starting, this is a great game, but for those in high tier 4......The grind is still there, and now its worse.Gaijin sucks at MM, and crew lock enabled. Game went from great, to down the toilet.			",70,2,0,8,8,0,9

												I  used to play this game every single day for hours upon hours at a time. During it's hay-day this game was a masterpiece of near perfection. All factions were inherently treated equally and they all had their notorious drawbacks.... That was until the last two years. Gaijin is notorious for doing very dumb things to really good games. This particular one is a perfect example. This isn't the game I used to play. This is a game where the Russians are still salty over losing to the west in every single aspect for the last 80 years. Maybe they'll turn it around, but with the release of ""Sekrit Dokumentz"" inspired vehicles.... It's unlikely... Save yourself the trouble and don't play this game, don't support it's terrible business practices, nor should you support the blatant Soviet-Tier disregard for facts and authenticity. Go play Armored Warfare. Atleast there they have legitimacy given to their vehicles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yeah, I'd recommend this.  1, It's a free to play game that's actually good,  damage caused by area of hit, possiblitily to repair, replace crew, believable enviroments.  2, It's NOT an MMORPG!!!!!3, Graphics 9/10  (but this depends on your system of course), low is pretty good quality, I play on high with frame rate of 60+, and although it says not to play in 'movie' mode, I did, and still got average of 35fps!   VERY OPTIMIZED if you ask me!4, Great system for purchases and research, yes you can buy the Golden Eagles, but play and you'll get enough RP and Silver lions, just not the premium tanks.(They're pay for items, but they gotta make money somehow!)Overall I have enjoyed this so far, okay, sometimes you get hit and that's it for that tank, but smile, watch the kill cam, and start afresh in your 'super tank'!!Go on, give it a go, you maybe surpised!!

If you have money, you will get some op tanks or planes easilyand also russian bias everywhere. If you killed a T-34, KV-1, or KV-2, you should be proud of yourselfthis game would be amazingif they listen to community and fix all in-game problemsBTW, sorry for my English, peace!

												Very fun game.. At first. The first few planes and tanks you play are quite fun. And then you start to unlock more planes and tanks and this is were the fun ends. You see there arent enough players to fill a battle in a timely manner so they squash tiers together to make things move along faster. In theory this may sound like a good idea. Until you get repeatedly 1 shot killed by the higher tier over and over again. And at the higher tiers there arent enough players to fill a battle so the highest ranked players go to the lower tiers and smash the new players with their fully upgraded planes and tanks with fully upgraded crews. Basically this means the newer players get frustrated and quit so there are no new players making it to the higher tiers. Its a vicious circle I guess. You cant get a game in a reasonable time at the higher tiers so they play lower tier games crushing and frustrating the new players so they dont make it to the higher tiers so there arent enough players to play in the higher tiers. The solution the moderators give in help chat, spend real money to upgrade your stuff, lol. So yeah thats pretty much War Thunder in a nutshell.			",2,0,4,2,1,1,2

												What to say about War Thunder, well.....hummmmoverall the game as potential, but at the same time it will drive you nuts, between game physics issues, glitches and crashing.after playing for a while and working my way up to tier 3 tanks i still wasn't able togo head to head with any tier 5, would take 3-5 shoots to take him out while he wouldput my tank down with just ""1""and don't even get me started on the Russian bias of the game, just leave it at that.Pros:overall game playavailable tanks and aircraftregular updatesCons:Matching system: (tier 2 fighting tier 5)game physics: (nothing like shooting a tank and watching the shell pass right through or getting shot through buildings and solid rock cover.)cost of upgrades, and new tanks.if your looking for a time killer and nothing more, then go for it.but be warned about the grind your facing just to get to tier 3 or 4 tanks without opening your wallet for the premium account and or golding eagles you need for the premium tanks.you've got a long road ahead of you!if this game also had some kind of single player campaign option or missions that you didn't have to shell out real money for to aid in yourrank and tanks, that would be a plus.overall rating: 4/10 if it wasn't for the graphics, sound, and collection of tanks, rating would have been much lower.i am however curious to see just how long it would take too get up to the very top tier 5 tankswithout opening my wallet even once.Edit: Nope I'm done, it's just pointless			",10,0,0,0,5,0,0

												Note: I have never flown, I have only played War Thunder for Ground Forces.This game has turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Much like World of Tanks, if you are driving a German tank, you are not allowed to hit anything. Regardless if you have the most accurate gun in World War II, you will miss and an ISU-152 or KV-2 will just kill you while it's on the move from over 500 yards away. Despite this obvious innaccuracy, Gaijen still REFUSE to add an anti-spawnkill system for when the hordes of Russian hackers steamroll you and your team. This♥♥♥♥♥♥should be illegal, it is the only product in the world that people can't stop using and paying for because it sucks.I used to like this game - World of Tanks too. Until the statistics of the tanks made no sense when compared to the actual performance of the tanks in battle. I don't care how strong the HE in the 152mm gun is, those guns were horridly innacurrate and should NOT be able to outshoot a Panther at ranges in excess of 1km. I get it, the German tanks can't be invincible and the game needs to remain competitive. But if the way of balancing the game out is to breakdown historical accuracy, then you're just admitting that you are being bias. Russian tanks were inferior to German engineering, that's why a Tiger takes up all of your spawn points in a realistic battle. If Gaijen is all about historical accuracy, why don't they fix this? I wouldn't get so frustrated if my gun - let me stress the MOST ACCURATE guns of World War II - would actually hit their target.InsteadI shootMissEnemy tank turns their turret towards meI shootHitDo no damage to a Sherman with an 88mm gunSherman shoots at me with 76mm gunHits and kills my gunner and driverCan't shoot backSit and wait for crew to switch outSherman shoots againKills me by penetrating the most heavily armored part of the tankThis is infuriating and is the overall reason why I uninstalled this game and World of Tanks. I hope both of these companies eventually go out of business.			",62,4,0,2,14,0,16

												Bugs, balance, broken vehicles. Don't bother wasting your time on this game, once you get to the higher tiers balance is completely gone and the bugs(disappearing/invisible tanks, sparking, lots of desync and hit detection issues). Gaijin's strategy to get you to pay for premium or premium vehicles is to make you want to pull your hair out while you are driving a stock tank. Unfortunately money will not fix the aforementioned problems, it'll just make your wallet lighter and stress levels higher. Skip this one until somebody makes a decent competitor, right now they have no competitor so there is no real incentive for them to fix the game.			",36,7,0,2,3,0,7

Gaijin doesn't want to fix things, it wants money and for this they've made the game so unbalanced, so grindy... that if you want to progress you HAVE to throw money at the game.

So it's basically getting worse and worse, people get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at how unbalanced it is, they leave, Gaijin then instead of fixing things and hoping people come back, compresses the matchmaker even more so it gets even more unbalanced, so more people leave... Try it if you must, it's pretty much unique in it's genre, but whatever you do, no matter how nice you think those premium tanks look, DON'T EVER put any money in this game, you'll regret it.

												In Soviet Russia, game plays you.This game is quite an amazing one. I am a huge history buff, so I guess that makes it a little better for me. But, on the down side, the matchmaking sucks, the community moderators are complete DonkeyHoles who were born on Pluto, but the actual WT community itself is awesome. There is, however, one really helpful and nice moderator, his name is MaximeDelaroux. If you have any questions or advice about WT, I highly suggest messaging him.Going back to that mod thing, I got banned for 5 days for saying ""grammar nazi"" in a chat jokingly. I mean, WTF? This is a WW2 game for goodness' sake. Oh yeah and I think that the absolute most important thing that needs to be said to any prospective new players is that this game requires SO SO MUCH grinding. You start the game with beginner planes that don't cost much and you're like ""huh. pretty fun"" then like two months later you realize that it's taking you like 4 days worth of time in game just to get one plane, and the cost of each plane just goes UP and UP.Now for the conclusion. Basically if you want to have a good experience, play the game, rank up, try to avoid fighting commies, better yet play as a commie, don't say anything in the chat, and always say something pro communist in the forums in order to gain the favor of the mods. ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭ How to have a bad experience: Use common sense in the forums, say something anti communist in the chat, and try to give the devs useful advice.Thumbs up for the WT players and the game itselfThumbs down for the stupid matchmaking and the Soviet moderators.8/10 Would argue with drunk communists again			",42,1,0,7,10,0,20

												Very fun game.. At first. The first few planes and tanks you play are quite fun. And then you start to unlock more planes and tanks and this is were the fun ends. You see there arent enough players to fill a battle in a timely manner so they squash tiers together to make things move along faster. In theory this may sound like a good idea. Until you get repeatedly 1 shot killed by the higher tier over and over again. And at the higher tiers there arent enough players to fill a battle so the highest ranked players go to the lower tiers and smash the new players with their fully upgraded planes and tanks with fully upgraded crews. Basically this means the newer players get frustrated and quit so there are no new players making it to the higher tiers. Its a vicious circle I guess. You cant get a game in a reasonable time at the higher tiers so they play lower tier games crushing and frustrating the new players so they dont make it to the higher tiers so there arent enough players to play in the higher tiers. The solution the moderators give in help chat, spend real money to upgrade your stuff, lol. So yeah thats pretty much War Thunder in a nutshell.			",2,0,4,2,1,1,2

												A bit too grindy. And a lot of the early tanks have paper armor that machineguns can penetrate, so a lot of the time you fell more that you are driving a cab than a tank. A lot of camping also removes a lot of action from the game. Doesnt help that there is a bit of a wonky matchmaking and a lot of players seem to play at a lower tier than they should to farm newbies.			",77,23,1,36,36,3,80

												What to say about War Thunder, well.....hummmmoverall the game as potential, but at the same time it will drive you nuts, between game physics issues, glitches and crashing.after playing for a while and working my way up to tier 3 tanks i still wasn't able togo head to head with any tier 5, would take 3-5 shoots to take him out while he wouldput my tank down with just ""1""and don't even get me started on the Russian bias of the game, just leave it at that.Pros:overall game playavailable tanks and aircraftregular updatesCons:Matching system: (tier 2 fighting tier 5)game physics: (nothing like shooting a tank and watching the shell pass right through or getting shot through buildings and solid rock cover.)cost of upgrades, and new tanks.if your looking for a time killer and nothing more, then go for it.but be warned about the grind your facing just to get to tier 3 or 4 tanks without opening your wallet for the premium account and or golding eagles you need for the premium tanks.you've got a long road ahead of you!if this game also had some kind of single player campaign option or missions that you didn't have to shell out real money for to aid in yourrank and tanks, that would be a plus.overall rating: 4/10 if it wasn't for the graphics, sound, and collection of tanks, rating would have been much lower.i am however curious to see just how long it would take too get up to the very top tier 5 tankswithout opening my wallet even once.Edit: Nope I'm done, it's just pointless			",10,0,0,0,5,0,0

												I personally like this game dispite the fact that russian Tanks are op as sh*t.Since the Developers are russian, they promote their nation as hell and make other nations such as america useless and underpowered.When I was chatting with a guy in the game, I called out a russian OP tank as was to f'ckin overpowered. After that game I got banned for 15 Days from the chat for ""xenophobic remarks, foul language, verbal abuse, rude to other players""Seriously? Is the Support that dumb??? I called out a tank OP and get banned for offending other players?!I am not racist or anything but most likely when you talk to russians they just insult the fak out of you! I realy just dont get the point... I am ""xenophobic"" by calling out russian tanks as OP, meanwhile a other guy in the team called me a ""Fa60t German kid."" That sure is some community right there.I wouldnt reccomend playing that game in the moment since russians are way to OP in the game and the gameplay is way to unbalanced.I do love this game.

												Yeah, I'd recommend this.  1, It's a free to play game that's actually good,  damage caused by area of hit, possiblitily to repair, replace crew, believable enviroments.  2, It's NOT an MMORPG!!!!!3, Graphics 9/10  (but this depends on your system of course), low is pretty good quality, I play on high with frame rate of 60+, and although it says not to play in 'movie' mode, I did, and still got average of 35fps!   VERY OPTIMIZED if you ask me!4, Great system for purchases and research, yes you can buy the Golden Eagles, but play and you'll get enough RP and Silver lions, just not the premium tanks.(They're pay for items, but they gotta make money somehow!)Overall I have enjoyed this so far, okay, sometimes you get hit and that's it for that tank, but smile, watch the kill cam, and start afresh in your 'super tank'!!Go on, give it a go, you maybe surpised!!

												This game, how can I describe it... is an above average game. Do note I said above average, not wonderful or perfect, since it is RIDDLED with problems.First, the community. Ever since the game has first been released publicaly, especially to Steam, the community has began to die down. More and more people carrying their incompetence is spreading like a disease. But even so, there is still many people, veterans, who are still friendly and ready to help out our fellow gamers. The forums of War Thunder is a rather friendly place; IF you follow the rules, or the moderators will start bannin'. Second, the gameplay. The gameplay is very good, but for the most hardened pilots, isn't enough. The flight-models are just inaccurate, damage models are tweaked against their historic counterpart, and many, many more. But even so, I believe the gameplay can compensate for this problem.Finally, the economy. ""HUFFF"". With many other reviews and posts complaining about the grind of this game, I must disagree with the. The grind is really, really damn long, but it helps you too. It makes you learn your aircraft, become ""part"" of it. And also, the GAME doesn't owe you anything, it's a free to play. It also isn't a pay-to-win game, as the premium aircraft are more so regular planes that's either lend-lease, captured, or just prototypes. But later on in the game, you might have to buy premium to succeed and not waste your entire summer break grinding dat highest-tier F-86. In conclusion, the game is a rather nice to waste and spend your time on. Though it has it's problems, sometimes you have to get over it. All in all, I can recommend this game to anyone who loves airplanes or tanks, (and the soon ships :DDDDD)			",36,1,0,1,4,0,4

												This game look very good and the gameplay is okay but they broke it along the way. As time went by, the economy became more and more centered on lotery and bonus random pack in game and this did not suit my taste.Also there was a lot of weird decision by the developer made to try and help the match making system compensate for the diminution of the player base.  I will not go in the details around those.I have also lot of time invested in this game and I only have a tier 5 in my list because I dumped close to a 100$ in one night to unlock it.  If you are a casual player looking for a free game you can but you will never get passed tier 3 unless you spend every nights playing and each and every weekend of the rest of your life. (the grind is this bad at late tier 3 and up.)I will come back to this game from time to time because I have so much time invested.  But save your time and money there are other games around.

												Do you want to have fun playing a nice all rounded WW2 gaming experience with fair balance and good matchmaking? Then don’t bother with War Thunder. I’ve played a ridiculous amount of this game with about 100-200 hours to add before it came to steam. And so as a long time player of this game I cannot recommend this game at all. If you are a new player then get ready to get dumped on in aircraft as your Bi-plane gets shredded by a mono-plane with 2x your armament. With tanks it’s not as bad but not ether when you get stomped by a tank with 2x your armour and penetration. And the Bias. It’s highly debatable whether or not there is in fact 'Russian Bias or if it’s a realistic representation but either way you will often find yourself screaming in rage as your killed by another T-34 or you fail to kill on. The game also makes very little effort to try and explain how ammo works, how different nations play or the roles of each tank and can make it extremely intimidating for new players. To top it off the grind past tier 4 is absurd though this is unfortunately part of the 'Free To Play' market. And my biggest vice with this game is its match-making. You roll the dice whenever you enter a ground battle. Sometimes it may throw you in a match where you are evenly tiered. Alternatively it can also throw you up against tanks you have almost no chance of competing with. This is probably more to do with the shrinking player base but it can still ruin you gaming experience.To conclude I would not recommend you get this game unless you are willing to put alot of hours into it in order to get where you want to be or you can simplify pay to advance. Whatever suits you most. ",66,3,0,4,5,0,14

												For those of you who don't want to read the long version- War Thunder is a good looking game with inconsistent gameplay and a laughably slow in-game economy. It gets questionable changes often, and lost my interest at tier 3 (out of five, for the uninformed) because of its janky and unbalanced matchmaking. [EDIT: I just looked through my SteamApps folder- and War Thunder was still there! And it doesn't even have an uninstaller! A game that actively denies the uninstall process should automatically bring to mind some red flags.]For those of you who want a little extra, here's my two cents further- I picked up War Thunder after having seen the air forces on SideStrafe's YouTube channel. I had that newbie phase, where I was still learning the ropes  (after picking Japan as my first nation- turns out they're not noob friendly) but after that I ended up having a good deal of fun with the game. I'd switched to Russia, you see, and just like that, I went from struggling to dominating! I was knocking people out of the sky in seconds, and I had Ace runs with about seven planes on the Russian tree. But that's part of War Thunder's problem. The developers rig the game in favor of their home country to an unreasonable degree. From what I've heard, this is true for tanks too, but I've played exactly two games of WT Tanks. Now, it was about when I got my first tier 3 plane (a LA-5 of some description) when I unlocked the planes that ended up making me quit the game. I hadn't given up on Japan, you see, and I had had a lot of fun in my A6M2-N. So imagine the horror I felt when I unlocked the A6M2 mod. 11... and the combat rating of my squadron went up by a full point. Now, that might not seem like much to someone who doesn't know the game, but that means that the plane I added made the planes I had only been having moderate success in match into games featuring planes an average of one whole tier higher! As if that wasn't bad enough, I got introduced to the other half of this ragequit combo, the Ki-61. That plane was a nightmare to fly! And considering its opposition- it was hell. Now, the A6M2-N and the A6M2 mod. 11 both still brought in good results, but every other plane in that part of the tech tree was so pathetic that if those two died, I might as well leave the match. And so I did. After one such letdown, I shut off War Thunder for the last time. There was no fanfare, no particular event of note marking it, just another dejected Alt-F4 to the record. But I never went back. About a month later, I uninstalled War Thunder for hard drive space. My honest opinion of War Thunder? I might reinstall it someday, and I'll regret it. Because for all its looks, it's amazing damage models, its feel of aerial warfare- there's just twenty thousand little nagging missteps that will eventually get on your nerves.			",17,1,0,2,2,1,5

												I had a positive review here before, but after playing the game for a bit more lately, I've realised how overpowered the USSR is. No way in hell a La-9 is as fast as a Tempest MK V in a straight line, climbs above it, and can manouver with it. The  Hawker Tempest is according to Wikipedia over 20kph faster than the La-9. One little detail about the two aircraft as well: The La-9 was introduced in 1946, and the Tempest V was indroduced in 1944. the La-9 did not even see combat ffs, why should we have to fight them As a conclusion, the game is broken to an extent, with many russian planes being ridiculously overpowered and/or tiered so far down that they crush all opposition. If the game had no russian bias, it would be 8/10, as it is, it's a solid 4/10. I'm kinda addicted to this game though, so I'll keep playing it. I hope Gaijin gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together soon, since the rest of the game is actually pretty good and they have a nice concept here.Edit: Now the game is also plagued with an issue where the clouds are constantly flickering to the point it's unplayable. Seems like an AMD-only issue, but it's clearly the game's fault considering it used to work fine. The game even managed to crash the drivers a couple of times. My R9 380 is clearly capable of running the game, so the only way this is happening is that the devs were lazy and didn't test the patch before releasing it. My advice is to stay away.

												Still wondering why this is still in the Free to Play section. This is Pay 2 Win all the way.This game has incredible potential to become a great game, but due to the fact that this game forces to buy a time-limited account for a number of days (and the length of this account will also count even if you're not playing the game). Planes and Tanks that are bought with real money (Golden Eagle Currency), are op, it's a pain to even encounter them. If your considering about downloading this game, note this, after a couple of hours you'll notice an annoying amount of grind in order to get a plane (or tank). With a premium account, this game CAN be ""fun"", but without it, it's gonna be painful to get a single vehicle. 2/10			",39,1,0,6,4,0,0

												Do you dream of flying a B-17 dropping bombs and coming back all beaten up.  Or go down in a blaze of glory while your gunners are firing at the enemy as your engines are shutting off while on fire and your doing your best to keep it in the air.. Or maybe fly in a huge formation over enemy territoy.Well keep moving this is not the game for you..  Bombers last about two seconds in the air. My last match literally 2 mins ago i lost 5 bombers, from 3 b-17s to a b-24 and a b-29 to a single bullet, and not pilot death no, as in my entire plane exploded,  5 different times, same match. And thats what this game is, over and over. No real team work at all. Bombers literally spawn and dive to go as fast as they can to the targets to bomb before they go 1 shot out the sky and hopefully just hopefully they can turn around after they drop the bombs.  So ya to get points you have to hell dive as a b-17.  Tier system is  horrible, the grind is so bad, bombers are useless.  Im serious a b-29 with no bombs in bay,  exploded one shot from a spitfire. And its really becoming play to win now.. Dont let the past reviews with the thumbs up fool you, this is not the same game.			",83,7,1,5,9,0,17

												I've been playing War Thunder on and off for roughly 2 or 3 years now. Everytime I leave it, it's due to 2 reasons and 2 reasons alone. The grind, and just BS that happens. The grind for one is, well, big even for an ""MMO"". It's only worse for tanks and I'm going to go ahead and assume ships will be just as bad. Just for an example, you need about 50-55k rp for the Tiger H1. You're lucky to get more than 2k rp a game in Realistic Battles without premium. I've literally had 10+ kill games with battle activity of 90%+ and only got 2.3k rp in ground forces rb.As for the random BS that happens, just google images of the il-2 ground attacker. I've been in a turn fight against them with a zero, and have been out turned. IN. A. ZERO. Just think about that, although I must say Sim is rather nice, no markers (which is also random in my experiences), meaning full element of surprise.			",69,3,0,4,7,2,3

												Game is greatGameplay is greatMatchmaking sucksWhy?Just join as a newly created account and go for battle and get rekt by prosThe developers seriously should make something like what WoT did, if u are using a tier 1 tank, u will be in a match with tier 1/2 tanksNOT LIKE THIS GAME WHERE U FACE PRO PLAYERSSecondly, once u face pro players, you could hardly get research points! The main currency is no problem, since if u suck every match, u get at least 1k but when u wanna go for RP, you get <300 when u suck, and what i mean is when you suck in a match with many pro/longtime players. Therefore, that makes getting parts, and better tanks/aircrafts harder as well as making the game a little ""p2w-ish"" as you need golden eagles (aka premium currency)  to complete researches faster.Then, you need to grind forever, till u get the perfect tank which is most likely up in tier 4+.

Product received for free
												        After playing this game for two years I sadly must give it a poor review. Although, let's keep it in perspective it is a ""free"" game with options to ""pay"" for upgrades. So is it really free then?         I have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes...blah blah blah....try the ones you like don't drive the ones you don't like, move on.  So my complaints aren't about the game when it works.         The key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows:         1) War Thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer, and continues to date, which drives my maleware detector crazy. Why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me. My question is this, why would Steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site.         2) War Thunder sends out daily downloads. Is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates? Really! I understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day! Come on.         3) The straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the War Thunder server. I checked my own settings to ensure it wasn't on my side and it wasn't. But after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects, it has finally driven me away from War Thunder.         The moral of the story is this. You get what you pay for. If ""free"" game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isn't really free. Oh and by the way, yes I did ""pay"" for ""golden eagles"" to improve my upgrade performance. So it wasn't really free for me.  ",2,0,0,1,0,0,0

												This game is absurdly biased towards the Russian vehicles. I would not recommend it to anyone based on the fact that the developers will not admit that, and chose to cite sekret Russian dokuments as the reason why Russian vehicles are so absurdly OP.A prime example is the new TU-4, a Russian copy of the American B-29 with larger engines, cannons, and payload capacity. But is is impossible to shoot down compared to the B-29 which can be shot down simply by looking at it. Instead of removing the bias from the TU-4 they bumped it up to a 7.0 BR from a 6.3 BR. This does absolutely nothing, as the games horrible match making as of late will still put the 7.0 TU-4 against the 6.3 B-29 which may as well be made of card stock. Do not play this game unless you want to play Russian vehicles and be hated by everyone. You will get addicted and angry, and be posting a review of why people should not play this game.

												Game mechanics are rough and not very responsive, which makes the combat very anticlimatic and removes the immersive feeling of being in a war. The visuals are decent, but also doesn't create the immersive environment and look very fake. I'm not saying that every game has to be realistic, but since the creators have taken this route, they should put more work into that. I have to say the developers have left quite a few settings to suit your needs, but for my opinion there are more cons than pros.			",51,8,2,2,7,0,0

Now, it was about when I got my first tier 3 plane (a LA-5 of some description) when I unlocked the planes that ended up making me quit the game. I hadn't given up on Japan, you see, and I had had a lot of fun in my A6M2-N. So imagine the horror I felt when I unlocked the A6M2 mod. 11... and the combat rating of my squadron went up by a full point. Now, that might not seem like much to someone who doesn't know the game, but that means that the plane I added made the planes I had only been having moderate success in match into games featuring planes an average of one whole tier higher! As if that wasn't bad enough, I got introduced to the other half of this ragequit combo, the Ki-61. That plane was a nightmare to fly! And considering its opposition- it was hell. Now, the A6M2-N and the A6M2 mod. 11 both still brought in good results, but every other plane in that part of the tech tree was so pathetic that if those two died, I might as well leave the match. And so I did. After one such letdown, I shut off War Thunder for the last time. There was no fanfare, no particular event of note marking it, just another dejected Alt-F4 to the record. But I never went back. About a month later, I uninstalled War Thunder for hard drive space. My honest opinion of War Thunder? I might reinstall it someday, and I'll regret it. Because for all its looks, it's amazing damage models, its feel of aerial warfare- there's just twenty thousand little nagging missteps that will eventually get on your nerves.			",17,1,0,2,2,1,5

												I had a positive review here before, but after playing the game for a bit more lately, I've realised how overpowered the USSR is. No way in hell a La-9 is as fast as a Tempest MK V in a straight line, climbs above it, and can manouver with it. The  Hawker Tempest is according to Wikipedia over 20kph faster than the La-9. One little detail about the two aircraft as well: The La-9 was introduced in 1946, and the Tempest V was indroduced in 1944. the La-9 did not even see combat ffs, why should we have to fight them As a conclusion, the game is broken to an extent, with many russian planes being ridiculously overpowered and/or tiered so far down that they crush all opposition. If the game had no russian bias, it would be 8/10, as it is, it's a solid 4/10. I'm kinda addicted to this game though, so I'll keep playing it. I hope Gaijin gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together soon, since the rest of the game is actually pretty good and they have a nice concept here.Edit: Now the game is also plagued with an issue where the clouds are constantly flickering to the point it's unplayable. Seems like an AMD-only issue, but it's clearly the game's fault considering it used to work fine. The game even managed to crash the drivers a couple of times. My R9 380 is clearly capable of running the game, so the only way this is happening is that the devs were lazy and didn't test the patch before releasing it. My advice is to stay away.

												The game is doing pretty well and is pretty fun, they improved the russian bias situation a while ago by improving the ricochet mechanics. Now if they would just stop adding so many rocket/guided missile tanks, and get rid of some of the chat modderators that bully the players of the game (the people that usually get punished are giving constructive criticism).I still recommend it (if you really want to play a game in this genre) only becuase it is one of the only games in this genre and is the best that I have seen in this genre. If you do decide to play it don't spend any money on this, because the devs really are not that great and the game is getting more pay to win every update.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really want to like this game but theres not that much to it. I played it when it was plane warfare game now it has tanks. So you scratch around in mediocre maps with so so game play, no real incentive for team work. But the grind up to different machines is long and boring and its not that obvious what the new machine is going to bring. There is no wow factor in this game for me. In this genre there are different and better games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There is no doubt that this game is an excellent simulator. However, its pay-2-win mechanics and Russian bias ruin the experience. Can't even play this for the graphical value anymore. Being killed over and over again by people who spend WAY too much money and hours on this game makes it unenjoyable. It could be a great game, and I would gladly pay $60.00 for it, but no, it's a free-to-play, which, at this point, is just a light term for ""You want to progress and see what this game has to offer?

												This game is absurdly biased towards the Russian vehicles. I would not recommend it to anyone based on the fact that the developers will not admit that, and chose to cite sekret Russian dokuments as the reason why Russian vehicles are so absurdly OP.A prime example is the new TU-4, a Russian copy of the American B-29 with larger engines, cannons, and payload capacity. But is is impossible to shoot down compared to the B-29 which can be shot down simply by looking at it. Instead of removing the bias from the TU-4 they bumped it up to a 7.0 BR from a 6.3 BR. This does absolutely nothing, as the games horrible match making as of late will still put the 7.0 TU-4 against the 6.3 B-29 which may as well be made of card stock. Do not play this game unless you want to play Russian vehicles and be hated by everyone. You will get addicted and angry, and be posting a review of why people should not play this game.

												Where can I start with War Thunder? Well, I'll start with the basics. I stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. When I stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. This meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. What this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. Now, you have this 5 tier system, which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ No other word for it, it's just♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seeing it on Steam, I redownloaded it and played in what is now called Tier 2. What happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. This means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. For instance, you could be in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bi-plane just out of WW 1 and someone in a Mk 1 Spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. I really did love playing the short time I played. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT! But the problem is, I can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't think♥♥♥♥♥♥through. I cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. If you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. It's f2p and good fun and the start. But after the 2 hours I played it as a Tier 2, I cba with War Thunder anymore.			",44,8,2,6,19,1,5

												I would highly reccommend this game because simply it is a load of fun! What's great about it is that you can either play in arcade mode or in realistic and simulation modes for a greater challenge. New updates every 2 months or so with new aircraft and vehicles to try out. Great for people with a low budget (it's free!) who want to drive or fly vehicles from the Second World War and early Cold War. Although this is, in my opinion, a very fun and realistic game to play, it has moderately slow update speeds (for me anyway!) and some players  who are annoying if you wish to play the game properly and they are not. Also great for playing with friends!			",10,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Played War Thunder on and off for over a year.  Advanced in the German armour levels, when it just became too unrealistic in favor of Russian heavy tanks.  For example, five shots from a Tiger II at point blank range against a JS-II.  No effect.  That was it for me.  I unistalled the game and haven't played in over six months.  It was good when it came out, but now not worth my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall: a good game, but it is the textbook definition of pay to win. You will get absolutely RAVAGED BY people that put money into the TANKS THAT CAN ONLY BE PAID FOR (most notably the Sherman Calliope and Panzerwerfer).Also, there is an extreme bias towards German and Soviet tanks. In the lower teirs, British and American tanks are simply no competition for Soviet T-34s and KV-1s and the Wehrmacht Panzers and Marders. To be fair, it is historically accurate, but in bad taste for a game that should be roughly equal opprotunity to all factions.			",44,5,0,1,8,0,17

												I do not recommend starting this game. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, but almost everything else about it is frustrating, borderline infuriating atleast half the time. Its perversion of the MMO model, with ludicrous amounts of grinding, handpers most of its gameplay goals. The sunk value falacy will hit you very hard, Especially because it will take several hours before you can play anything beyond a pre-war biplane with a lawnmower engine or a tank that isn't just a sardine can. The damage model mechanics are a definite plus, But seriously I do not recommend starting this game. The balance of the game is extremely annoying, their system of intense uptiering and downtiering shoots shemselves in the foot in terms of actually acheiving consistent balance. High tier tank combat is FUBAR, the balance is ridiculous, and makes it not fun to play.Dont bother with this game unless you want to spend large amounts of time and money, but if you want to spend invest in a game just to feel sunk value, go ahead.Yes this review used to be a lot more scathing, because about a year ago the game felt like it deserved it. It still rustles my jimmies every other day, which is dissapointing because this game is the most polished turd I have ever played.			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is doing pretty well and is pretty fun, they improved the russian bias situation a while ago by improving the ricochet mechanics. Now if they would just stop adding so many rocket/guided missile tanks, and get rid of some of the chat modderators that bully the players of the game (the people that usually get punished are giving constructive criticism).I still recommend it (if you really want to play a game in this genre) only becuase it is one of the only games in this genre and is the best that I have seen in this genre. If you do decide to play it don't spend any money on this, because the devs really are not that great and the game is getting more pay to win every update.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really want to like this game but theres not that much to it. I played it when it was plane warfare game now it has tanks. So you scratch around in mediocre maps with so so game play, no real incentive for team work. But the grind up to different machines is long and boring and its not that obvious what the new machine is going to bring. There is no wow factor in this game for me. In this genre there are different and better games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is still good simulator game but two years ago was better. Spending money for this game is like buying broken product and manufacturer dont wanna repair this (bugs, crash reports, rng, mm, br) and give you news bells and whistles (new patch, new vehicles(70% premium) but game is still not so good). For free playing is good game however grinding (4/5era) without premium vehicle and account is mission impossible.

												By the time you grind your way to get to your dream tank (for instance i love the tiger) you will realize armor is quite useless in the game and the best tactic is to just rush the enemy and hope they die first. Matchmaking blows. The good games you have is when your actually paired with tanks the same rank or lower. But never the case for me always a tier higher so just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ The rewards you get for trying to make it through a match are non existant. 500 RP with 10 kills and three tank deaths? get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here.... The game even slaps you for loosing. you dont get barely anything when you loose which is quite often. All in all, the game is amazing when you first start out, but as soon as you get to the rank three tanks, game over. Im off to see the next tank simulater. There has got to be a good one out there......			",23,5,0,5,9,0,16

												Exceptional. Excellent realism (despite the few bugs being beta :P ) Takes a lo tof grinding if you are not premium, but it is rewarding. High recomend to war sim/gamers (it could almost pass as a simulator, especially the simulator settings (be warned you need a joystick and quick fingers for that bit) Arcade and realistic are perfect for the casual player. Someting for everyone. You'll get over the Yak 9 series soon enough. Tanks has been rolled out (Germany and USSR only for the moment) and has improved much since their addition to the game. Planes still remain fantastic. Personal advice: avoid investing in the Japanese unless you are observant and know how to exploit their turning ability. Their planes are paper mache...

												Game mechanics are rough and not very responsive, which makes the combat very anticlimatic and removes the immersive feeling of being in a war. The visuals are decent, but also doesn't create the immersive environment and look very fake. I'm not saying that every game has to be realistic, but since the creators have taken this route, they should put more work into that. I have to say the developers have left quite a few settings to suit your needs, but for my opinion there are more cons than pros.			",51,8,2,2,7,0,0

If you are a russian fans, you may enjouying in it. but if u playing japanese plane. you will know what is unfair, overranked, paper plane. even russian and british wooden planes are much harder than japanese aluminium alloy plane. The  data of the planes thay showing you are completely fake. For example, according to the data, a japanese 三式戦 rotation is 20.7s, but if you try it in game, it may take 30+s to make a rotation. Also fire power are totally unbalance in this game. If you have  conscience, don't play this game that made by stalin's fans.			",69,5,2,1,6,0,9

Posted: September 27, 2016
												For those of you who don't want to read the long version- War Thunder is a good looking game with inconsistent gameplay and a laughably slow in-game economy. It gets questionable changes often, and lost my interest at tier 3 (out of five, for the uninformed) because of its janky and unbalanced matchmaking. [EDIT: I just looked through my SteamApps folder- and War Thunder was still there! And it doesn't even have an uninstaller! A game that actively denies the uninstall process should automatically bring to mind some red flags.]For those of you who want a little extra, here's my two cents further- I picked up War Thunder after having seen the air forces on SideStrafe's YouTube channel. I had that newbie phase, where I was still learning the ropes  (after picking Japan as my first nation- turns out they're not noob friendly) but after that I ended up having a good deal of fun with the game. I'd switched to Russia, you see, and just like that, I went from struggling to dominating! I was knocking people out of the sky in seconds, and I had Ace runs with about seven planes on the Russian tree. But that's part of War Thunder's problem. The developers rig the game in favor of their home country to an unreasonable degree. From what I've heard, this is true for tanks too, but I've played exactly two games of WT Tanks. Now, it was about when I got my first tier 3 plane (a LA-5 of some description) when I unlocked the planes that ended up making me quit the game. I hadn't given up on Japan, you see, and I had had a lot of fun in my A6M2-N. So imagine the horror I felt when I unlocked the A6M2 mod. 11... and the combat rating of my squadron went up by a full point. Now, that might not seem like much to someone who doesn't know the game, but that means that the plane I added made the planes I had only been having moderate success in match into games featuring planes an average of one whole tier higher! As if that wasn't bad enough, I got introduced to the other half of this ragequit combo, the Ki-61. That plane was a nightmare to fly! And considering its opposition- it was hell. Now, the A6M2-N and the A6M2 mod. 11 both still brought in good results, but every other plane in that part of the tech tree was so pathetic that if those two died, I might as well leave the match. And so I did. After one such letdown, I shut off War Thunder for the last time. There was no fanfare, no particular event of note marking it, just another dejected Alt-F4 to the record. But I never went back. About a month later, I uninstalled War Thunder for hard drive space. My honest opinion of War Thunder? I might reinstall it someday, and I'll regret it. Because for all its looks, it's amazing damage models, its feel of aerial warfare- there's just twenty thousand little nagging missteps that will eventually get on your nerves.			",17,1,0,2,2,1,5

												I had a positive review here before, but after playing the game for a bit more lately, I've realised how overpowered the USSR is. No way in hell a La-9 is as fast as a Tempest MK V in a straight line, climbs above it, and can manouver with it. The  Hawker Tempest is according to Wikipedia over 20kph faster than the La-9. One little detail about the two aircraft as well: The La-9 was introduced in 1946, and the Tempest V was indroduced in 1944. the La-9 did not even see combat ffs, why should we have to fight them As a conclusion, the game is broken to an extent, with many russian planes being ridiculously overpowered and/or tiered so far down that they crush all opposition. If the game had no russian bias, it would be 8/10, as it is, it's a solid 4/10. I'm kinda addicted to this game though, so I'll keep playing it. I hope Gaijin gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together soon, since the rest of the game is actually pretty good and they have a nice concept here.Edit: Now the game is also plagued with an issue where the clouds are constantly flickering to the point it's unplayable. Seems like an AMD-only issue, but it's clearly the game's fault considering it used to work fine. The game even managed to crash the drivers a couple of times. My R9 380 is clearly capable of running the game, so the only way this is happening is that the devs were lazy and didn't test the patch before releasing it. My advice is to stay away.

												Still wondering why this is still in the Free to Play section. This is Pay 2 Win all the way.This game has incredible potential to become a great game, but due to the fact that this game forces to buy a time-limited account for a number of days (and the length of this account will also count even if you're not playing the game). Planes and Tanks that are bought with real money (Golden Eagle Currency), are op, it's a pain to even encounter them. If your considering about downloading this game, note this, after a couple of hours you'll notice an annoying amount of grind in order to get a plane (or tank). With a premium account, this game CAN be ""fun"", but without it, it's gonna be painful to get a single vehicle. 2/10			",39,1,0,6,4,0,0

												Game is greatGameplay is greatMatchmaking sucksWhy?Just join as a newly created account and go for battle and get rekt by prosThe developers seriously should make something like what WoT did, if u are using a tier 1 tank, u will be in a match with tier 1/2 tanksNOT LIKE THIS GAME WHERE U FACE PRO PLAYERSSecondly, once u face pro players, you could hardly get research points! The main currency is no problem, since if u suck every match, u get at least 1k but when u wanna go for RP, you get <300 when u suck, and what i mean is when you suck in a match with many pro/longtime players. Therefore, that makes getting parts, and better tanks/aircrafts harder as well as making the game a little ""p2w-ish"" as you need golden eagles (aka premium currency)  to complete researches faster.Then, you need to grind forever, till u get the perfect tank which is most likely up in tier 4+.

Product received for free
												        After playing this game for two years I sadly must give it a poor review. Although, let's keep it in perspective it is a ""free"" game with options to ""pay"" for upgrades. So is it really free then?         I have read the reviews about the different tanks and planes...blah blah blah....try the ones you like don't drive the ones you don't like, move on.  So my complaints aren't about the game when it works.         The key issues that have driven me to this poor review are as follows:         1) War Thunder downloaded many maleware files onto my computer, and continues to date, which drives my maleware detector crazy. Why would this gave try and install maleware on my computer unless it was trying to steal something from me. My question is this, why would Steam even allow a game that installs malware on its site.         2) War Thunder sends out daily downloads. Is their software so buggy they have to send out daily updates? Really! I understand wanting to fix bugs and add new feature but every day! Come on.         3) The straw that broke the camels back for me was constant drops from the War Thunder server. I checked my own settings to ensure it wasn't on my side and it wasn't. But after getting booted from a number of games because of servers disconnects, it has finally driven me away from War Thunder.         The moral of the story is this. You get what you pay for. If ""free"" game performance is lousy and frustrating then it isn't really free. Oh and by the way, yes I did ""pay"" for ""golden eagles"" to improve my upgrade performance. So it wasn't really free for me.  ",2,0,0,1,0,0,0

												MAJOR EXPLAINATION!Okay I played this game...alot..it is a semi-realistic [depending on game mode] Multi-player war vehicle combat game. the combat is kinda fun, HOWEVER vehicles can be unbalanced. and the match-making is HORRIBLE. It pains me to say that it is such a GRIND I've played this game off and on for about a year and i STILL haven't got to Rank IV vehicles yet. the ONLY way I can recomend this is if the following criteria are met -MAJOR Match-Making Changes-Less Grindy-Slight Balance FixesThe Devs need to stop focusing on how may vehicles there are and fix what they have already.

												I would highly reccommend this game because simply it is a load of fun! What's great about it is that you can either play in arcade mode or in realistic and simulation modes for a greater challenge. New updates every 2 months or so with new aircraft and vehicles to try out. Great for people with a low budget (it's free!) who want to drive or fly vehicles from the Second World War and early Cold War. Although this is, in my opinion, a very fun and realistic game to play, it has moderately slow update speeds (for me anyway!) and some players  who are annoying if you wish to play the game properly and they are not. Also great for playing with friends!			",10,0,0,0,1,0,0

												Where can I start with War Thunder? Well, I'll start with the basics. I stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. When I stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. This meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. What this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. Now, you have this 5 tier system, which is♥♥♥♥♥♥ No other word for it, it's just♥♥♥♥♥♥ Seeing it on Steam, I redownloaded it and played in what is now called Tier 2. What happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. This means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. For instance, you could be in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bi-plane just out of WW 1 and someone in a Mk 1 Spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you. I really did love playing the short time I played. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT! But the problem is, I can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't think♥♥♥♥♥♥through. I cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. If you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. It's f2p and good fun and the start. But after the 2 hours I played it as a Tier 2, I cba with War Thunder anymore.			",44,8,2,6,19,1,5

												Played War Thunder on and off for over a year.  Advanced in the German armour levels, when it just became too unrealistic in favor of Russian heavy tanks.  For example, five shots from a Tiger II at point blank range against a JS-II.  No effect.  That was it for me.  I unistalled the game and haven't played in over six months.  It was good when it came out, but now not worth my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder provides the player with extremely thrilling and exciting gameplay that you can expierience in the air or on land.In the air you will encounter enemy planes ranging from german planes all the way to japanese aircrafts that can and will shoot you down.The multiplayer mode in the air consits of destroying all the ground targets while fighting off enemy players. It sounds quite basic but it can get very addictive after you recieve your first reward for completing challenges.The upgrade system can be confusing at times, but when you get used to it, you will have a beast of an aircraft at your disposal.The tank battles are very slow, difficult and requires alot of strategic thinking and manouvering to succeed in battle.There are also a wide variety in tanks ranging from small and fast tanks to large and powerful tanks.The upgrade system is also confusing with the tank mode, but like i said, you just need to get used to it.War Thunder is free of charge and deserves your time since it does a better job than many paid products.It simply is worth it.

												To start off I would like to say that I've played this game for close to 1000 hours over the course of several years (at the time of writing). After the official release I have decided to review it.War Thunder is an overall great game that is worth playing if you don't mind not having ultra realistic flight and damage models, and if you don't mind a bit of grinding to unlock planes. There is a great variety of aircraft, tanks and now ships being added in. I don't play tanks much and I haven't touched the naval battles but I can speak for the planes. They are easy to pick up with a mouse and keyboard on mouse aim mode but hard to master when using a joystick on simulator mode. Even after the hours I have played the game is still very enjoyable.Score: 7/10 ",31,1,1,4,7,0,4

												Could be the most fantastic historical aviation combat game, if it wasnt developed and maintained by the most obnoxious, stubborn and biased russian programmers of the whole software industry. Sometimes you will love this game, but soon you'll find the developers prepared somehting to make you fell frustrated, bullied, and scammed (if you spend some money in their premium stuff). Their official forum is a glimpse of soviet era stalinism: They delete and block threads when theres is too much complaints about the ilogic decisions they made, or they simply ignore any community feedback about the negative effects of those ilogic decisions. Its impossible to reason with them. You will be banned, blocked or ignored. The new ground combat mode is absolutely unplayable with german tanks, as russian tanks are way beyond you can call overpowered and undertiered. My advice: Play only for free. This company does not deserve your money.			",1895,649,84,141,271,26,308

												I've played a decent time, almost 500 hours on steam and double that amount of time before this game was lauched in steam. This game used to be fun, but then some bad developer decisions made it rather unplayable. I've quit many times, only to try it again, hoping for some glimpse of it's former glory, but it's heydays are looong gone. Grindy, unbalanced, and quite a few terrible moderators. I recommended it alot during the beginning, but now i'd never recommend it to anyone. Very dissapointed in it overall.			",30,5,0,5,7,0,7

												I've spent some hours in this game and wont recommend the game to anyone.Sure there are some Pros:- Graphics- Details- Variety- CustomizationBut there are some Cons that are to heavy to ignore:- Hitbox: the Hitboxes are kind of a joke. You can hit the same point over and over, it wont mess up a tank or plane. That's kind of bullsh... You can empty your complete Ammo into the other plane or tank. They're still flying/driving without any problems. You get two or three hits and you're down (not all the time but most of it)- Aiming: you can aim however you want, if the rng don't say you hit, you wont hit.- Progress: Progress is so slow and takes way too long.- Exclusives: Some planes or tanks are only available for money. And this doesn't make any kind of fun. Customization and money okay,but that with planes/tanks is a no go. It's more like a DLC in a f2p.- Controls: Sure, controls are in arcade and ""realistic"" good, but in Simulatorbatlles (what is the true realistic) the plane controls are complete messed up. I died lot of times in planes flying in circles and couldn't do anything.- Balance: Balance in this game is horror. Some tanks and planes are so unbalanced, that's kind of joke.- Matchmaking: Some people say there is something like matchmaking. In my opinion it's more like: Put some Tanks together on a map and let's have a look what will happen.If you're looking for a WW2 game this is a good game. For anyone else this game is nothing for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I pretty much exclusively play the Tanks now, but you'll probably see in many other reviews a common theme: Russian bias. The dev's are so offended by the fact that their technology was far inferior in WWII they feel the need to buff the s h i t out of them to make it ""fair"". Don't you think it's great when you shoot at something with 45mm of armor, only for your shot to bounce (even though it's rated to penetrate over 100mm)? sure you could argue ""sloping armor"", but sloping armor only applies when im SHOOTING THEM FROM A POINT WHERE IT ISN'T PERPENDICULAR TO MY SHELL'S TRAJECTORY. It's utter bulls hit, everytime you survive a russian shot, you should put a penny in a jar, that way, in 10 years, you will have 1 penny in a jar. The bias is ridiculous to the extent where the german captured KV-1 (a god d amn russian tank), where the ONLY change the germans made was putting a SUPERIOR GUN on it, will lose in a head-to-head fight with a regular, inferior, russian KV-1. The stats they show on the tanks when you hover your mouse over them may surely well be accurate, but that's just what they SAY the tank's stats are. For russian tanks, you can pretty much reduce the chance of fire to zero, double the armor, increase the penetration, all while nerfing the f uck out of all the other, far better tanks, and then you'll get a taste of that good old War Thunder ""Realism"". Historically accurate my a$$. Yes, I've had fun with this game, and a majority of that was spent far away from the tank battles so I could shoot down planes. might be fun for a while, but you'll really start to get sick of it pretty quick.

												So..  Here we are again.  I've come to update my rather bad reveiw of this game to something more appropriate.This game has been a great experience for the most part.  The initial design and gameplay can be quite enjoyable at times.   But recently the developers have taken a turn for the worse.  I read through fourms about recent updates and I can see some patterns emerge.  Most players are unhappy about the game's current state and demand a change.  The developers have not done a single thing the community has asked for.  For example; the community wanted some better matchmaking to balance out the game.  Most were hoping for a higher BR spread.  Alas the developers decided it would be for the best to implement a smaller BR spread making it more difficult to enjoy the game as my propeller aircraft were being shot down by sabres.So...  Here we are again.  Nothing has changed.  And untill something does this reveiw will stay here.  We all wanted a change but not in this way.			",97,3,2,2,14,0,9

												- World of oneshots- LOTS of grind- Lack of skill balance, 1lvl noob plays against 100lvl pro- Game has like 3 modes on 3 maps (there are more maps but you almost always will be playing on the same ones)- Repetitive gameplay- You have to put vehicles in slots BEFORE you know which gamemode you will be playing. Set the bombers in all slots and watch the game throwing you on a map without ground targets- You can't collect international team of your favorite warmachines. Everything is divided into nations and unlocking everything in every nation takes an eternity or lots of money. I thought this game was about military vehicles not about nations- You can't even try the vehicles you haven't unlocked yet, even in the singleplayer maps. You can try the next one to unlock, but you can't try rank 5 if you are on rank 1- The game is like 3 years old and there are no descriptions to a lot of vehicles yet- Cheaters (The devs say there are no cheaters but you can google cheats for Warthunder videos and find out yourself :))This game is really fun when you are just starting out, when everything is new and unlocks fast, and I had a lot of fun playing the first few ranks with friends. But then it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. Vehicles take ages to unlock, you are playing the same modes on the same maps, and it takes way too much time (and luck) to master your skill. I would recomend trying it since its free, but don't expect too much from it.			",153,18,11,5,11,0,4

												Unlike some of these other reviews, I thoroughly enjoy this game. I came in post 1.37, which is when most are saying the game went to complete and utter $#*%, But I enjoy it. I'm not a russian pilot and instead stick to the under dog (Germany). Germany is the under dog due to the fact that you have to be very tactful with the planes when you first start working with them. The early BF 109's such as the E and F series require you to ""Boom 'n Zoom"" at lone targets, but once you are past them you begin getting the ability to attach R-5 and R-6 Cannons attachments which allow you to have more 20 or 30 mm Cannons. This allows you to become the master at head to head dogfights in which you will entirely obliterate almost anyone who dares to attempt to Head to Head fight you. What i've seen from experience, Russian planes will almost always dominate wether it be the Yaks, the La's, or the Lagg's. Even their bi-planes are forces to be reconed with carrying rockets and loads of MGs. Britain has the spitfires and and tempests which will no matter what always out turn you. Their Jets, the meteors, are described as suckish, but under the right hands are complete monsters. I would describe Britain as an under dog as well. Japan has very impressive planes with beatiful turn time and excellent firepower. They are almost as rage inducing as fighting russian planes. America is highly OP in its teir 2 fighters as they fly with 37 mm cannons where as all others except russian are stuck with 20 mm cannons. They stick to the term 'Murica and gain tons of ""small"" calibre mgs which are quite effective. Planes such as the corsair, hell cat, and bear cat carry 6-8 12.7 mgs. They are quite formidable in turning and such. P-39's, P-63's, and P-400's are amazing at boom and zoom tactics but horrendous on turn time. Their bombers are armed to the teeth and carry massive payloads.With that as a bit of back ground and help to players, the gameplay suffers quite a bit. As you get into teir 3 and 4 battles you will begin to notice bomber spam which can end a game in a matter of minutes if not dealt with (Which it probably wont), due to the fact that players are just grinding away and trying to get better planes, they ignore trying to win and mainly try to rank up as many kills as possible. This is only in arcade though. When you play realistic, you run the risk of poorly matched battles where in whuch you are a teir 2 being destroyed by teir 3s. In realistic. You are forced to use certain planes that are ""Historically Accurate"" for the battle that you are fighting in. I havent tried sim battles due to the fact that I dont own a joystick. Tank battles are quite horrendous and unbalanced due to the fact that Russian tanks are Sooooo much better in the starting teirs. There are only 2 sides in tank battles; Russia and Germany. So in essentia, you either become Russian or scrape by until you get ahold of better tanks.The community is quite varied. You have your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags who team kill and talk a lot of trash towards team mates, You have the vets who fly Jets and are quite level headed and fun people to be around, you have your common player who is often times tryig to get every kill they can just to help scrape by, the team players who try and do everything they can to help the team (These are my favorite kinds of people), and you have those who rage because They arent very tactful with their planes or are upset with the game. I havent seen much from the moderators, but from what I have heard they are horrible at what they do. This is trouble some because who wants to play a game where they run the risk of getting banned for little or no reason?The Currency/RP system is a huge center of controversy. My only advice on this is that most things are very expensive, so dont buy anything unless you absolutely need to or you want to.I am going off of memory/experience on my guide and I only fly German planes in the late 3rd teir. Please be open minded about that and fix it in the comments if you deem necessary. All in all, I Love the game and recommend it, but it does have its flaws and seems highly biased towards russian planes, but that can be overcome by joining them or developing strategy against them. Either way I hope to see any new comers out there in the battlefield.~A_German_Muffin			",34,1,0,2,4,0,1

												War thunder is a very fun and entertaining game. It has a variety of planes and tanks, along with upgradable crews for each vehicle. The turtorials will really save you if you don't know the basics of using keys for different weapons and always try out the vehicles your having trouble with in the test drive mode. Also there are multiple nations you can play as ranging from USA to even Japan. Although I have only tested USA I can only assume for the other nations.War thunder also allows the use of a campain mode, where it takes place from WWII to the Korean War (I think that's what it said) and even allows your friends to play those missions with you. The game also doesn't seem like it needs to really use real money in order to get ""better"" or ""stronger"", because you can actually unlock almost every vehicle you really need. Even though you may start out with a light tank in the first place the servers are all catagorized in different ranks and levels so you'll always be facing a player that is equal with you. Although as you get on your first steps into the game you may not be so good at first, but as long as you keep on trying you'll get better eventually. That is after all what happened to me.Overall the gameplay is nice with a fun use of the combat style, variety of vehicles to chose from, and a game system that can even you out with the rest of the community. Plus it's free! 10/10    :3			",113,3,0,13,6,0,8

												Walrus sums it up in a way I totally agree. Sadly I've spent enough money to justify me staying for a little bit longer since I don't want that ""investment"" to go to waste. I wish it could've been better..""Nearly impossible grind (mostly the top two tiers, 4 and 5) for both unlocking aircraft/tanks and the aircraft/tank modules. Forget progressing at any decent pace without a premium account, and even with a premium account, tier 5 vehicles are near impossible to upgrade without dumping money into the game. This ""grindy"" element adds a pay to win mechanic.Horribly F'd up matchmaker system that is based solely upon player statistics. For a game that prides itself on historical accuracy and authenticity, it's a bit odd to me that it doesn't even take history into account when creating matchups for the vehicles. This in addition to the fact that Gaijin's system also does a horrible job at creating balanced matchups, so we now have a game that's neither historical, nor is it balanced ."" .

												So..  Here we are again.  I've come to update my rather bad reveiw of this game to something more appropriate.This game has been a great experience for the most part.  The initial design and gameplay can be quite enjoyable at times.   But recently the developers have taken a turn for the worse.  I read through fourms about recent updates and I can see some patterns emerge.  Most players are unhappy about the game's current state and demand a change.  The developers have not done a single thing the community has asked for.  For example; the community wanted some better matchmaking to balance out the game.  Most were hoping for a higher BR spread.  Alas the developers decided it would be for the best to implement a smaller BR spread making it more difficult to enjoy the game as my propeller aircraft were being shot down by sabres.So...  Here we are again.  Nothing has changed.  And untill something does this reveiw will stay here.  We all wanted a change but not in this way.			",97,3,2,2,14,0,9

												- World of oneshots- LOTS of grind- Lack of skill balance, 1lvl noob plays against 100lvl pro- Game has like 3 modes on 3 maps (there are more maps but you almost always will be playing on the same ones)- Repetitive gameplay- You have to put vehicles in slots BEFORE you know which gamemode you will be playing. Set the bombers in all slots and watch the game throwing you on a map without ground targets- You can't collect international team of your favorite warmachines. Everything is divided into nations and unlocking everything in every nation takes an eternity or lots of money. I thought this game was about military vehicles not about nations- You can't even try the vehicles you haven't unlocked yet, even in the singleplayer maps. You can try the next one to unlock, but you can't try rank 5 if you are on rank 1- The game is like 3 years old and there are no descriptions to a lot of vehicles yet- Cheaters (The devs say there are no cheaters but you can google cheats for Warthunder videos and find out yourself :))This game is really fun when you are just starting out, when everything is new and unlocks fast, and I had a lot of fun playing the first few ranks with friends. But then it quickly becomes repetitive and boring. Vehicles take ages to unlock, you are playing the same modes on the same maps, and it takes way too much time (and luck) to master your skill. I would recomend trying it since its free, but don't expect too much from it.			",153,18,11,5,11,0,4

												I've spent some hours in this game and wont recommend the game to anyone.Sure there are some Pros:- Graphics- Details- Variety- CustomizationBut there are some Cons that are to heavy to ignore:- Hitbox: the Hitboxes are kind of a joke. You can hit the same point over and over, it wont mess up a tank or plane. That's kind of bullsh... You can empty your complete Ammo into the other plane or tank. They're still flying/driving without any problems. You get two or three hits and you're down (not all the time but most of it)- Aiming: you can aim however you want, if the rng don't say you hit, you wont hit.- Progress: Progress is so slow and takes way too long.- Exclusives: Some planes or tanks are only available for money. And this doesn't make any kind of fun. Customization and money okay,but that with planes/tanks is a no go. It's more like a DLC in a f2p.- Controls: Sure, controls are in arcade and ""realistic"" good, but in Simulatorbatlles (what is the true realistic) the plane controls are complete messed up. I died lot of times in planes flying in circles and couldn't do anything.- Balance: Balance in this game is horror. Some tanks and planes are so unbalanced, that's kind of joke.- Matchmaking: Some people say there is something like matchmaking. In my opinion it's more like: Put some Tanks together on a map and let's have a look what will happen.If you're looking for a WW2 game this is a good game. For anyone else this game is nothing for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When u have a 4.7 BR tank going up agaisnt a T4 6.0 and a team of them? Like really, This has been an issue EVER sense i started playing this game, I do not get why you would release a game that has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MM system that it is not even balanced.Even in games where it is T4, You will be in a game FULL of t5's the SECOND you get you're T4 its just so stupid.

												I pretty much exclusively play the Tanks now, but you'll probably see in many other reviews a common theme: Russian bias. The dev's are so offended by the fact that their technology was far inferior in WWII they feel the need to buff the s h i t out of them to make it ""fair"". Don't you think it's great when you shoot at something with 45mm of armor, only for your shot to bounce (even though it's rated to penetrate over 100mm)? sure you could argue ""sloping armor"", but sloping armor only applies when im SHOOTING THEM FROM A POINT WHERE IT ISN'T PERPENDICULAR TO MY SHELL'S TRAJECTORY. It's utter bulls hit, everytime you survive a russian shot, you should put a penny in a jar, that way, in 10 years, you will have 1 penny in a jar. The bias is ridiculous to the extent where the german captured KV-1 (a god d amn russian tank), where the ONLY change the germans made was putting a SUPERIOR GUN on it, will lose in a head-to-head fight with a regular, inferior, russian KV-1. The stats they show on the tanks when you hover your mouse over them may surely well be accurate, but that's just what they SAY the tank's stats are. For russian tanks, you can pretty much reduce the chance of fire to zero, double the armor, increase the penetration, all while nerfing the f uck out of all the other, far better tanks, and then you'll get a taste of that good old War Thunder ""Realism"". Historically accurate my a$$. Yes, I've had fun with this game, and a majority of that was spent far away from the tank battles so I could shoot down planes. might be fun for a while, but you'll really start to get sick of it pretty quick.

												Was a great game about a year ago.  Ground forces is horribly balanced and gets old very quickly.  German tanks are no match for Russian tanks on any tier.  German guns have great penetration but do very little damage to anything inside the hull.  You can penetrate the hull and turret of a russian tank with 5 or 6 rounds and it will do nothing.  Blow through his engine block, transmission, gun breach, radiators, and he'll blow the turret off your Panther I with his first shot.  The game is beautiful but is extremely unbalanced, biased, and glitchy.  If you play air war, stick to tier 2-3.  Endlessly grinding jets from tier 4 gets old very quickly, even with a premium account.  Tier 4 matches usually last less than 5 minutes with dive bombing heavy bombers 1 hitting all the bases and then all suicide diving the airfield.  I think i'm done playing war thunder until a major rebalancing has been done, which is doubtful considering the game has gotten worse the last couple of major updates.  I'm tired of the all the lowlifes and being banned from russian-hosted custom games on the US server. I was going to start playing another Gaijin game until I found out it was a Gaijin game.  Its amazing how a russian company does everything it can to alienate western players considering that westerners are their primary market.  ""Please play my game and pay me money, you American scum.""  Not  a really good sales pitch.			",8,0,1,5,7,0,22

ATGMs, AMIRITE.But more seriously, I've had this game in my account for a long time and have put a decent chunk of time and money into it. However, of all the time I have in the game (which is more than steam lists, I've played it before it was on steam and was semi-good), maybe 10 hours of this time is me actually enjoying the game. HOWEVER, THE DEVS DON'T GIVE TWO ♥♥♥♥♥ (NOT EVEN ONE) ABOUT YOUR ENJOYMENT. THEY ACTIVELY CENSOR ANY NEGATIVE FEEDBACK (ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE AMERICAN).   Also, (sorry for the rant, but this needs to be noticed) take a look at the pictures they have posted for the game. Funny; new updates and stuff, US bombers, then the GODLIKE Russian tanks. The T-34, the IS-2, the Su122. Please, for the love of god and all that is holy, realize that those tanks are to be feared. The armor that they are suited with is some magical♥♥♥♥♥♥and the guns are Harry Potter. If you want a chance to beat them, then time to sink 150$+ into this game (and then get banned for something stupid, like talking about the upcoming presidential debate between Hillary and Trump (both of them are terrible) )TLDR; DON'T SUPPORT THESE DEVS UNLESS THEY CHANGE THEIR ATTITUDE. Do yourself and your SSD/HD a favor and don't feed it this crap. Now, watch this recieve downvotes from the steammods in place by Gaijin. Or, better yet, it may even be removed for negative comments against them. ;)			",112,6,3,8,9,0,22

												I grantly recommend this game. Everything is great about it. Firstly, the hitbox and damage following the location of the shot are really realistic (in my opinion). The game is beautifull visually, if you have a good enough CG. But the main reason I recommend it is for the fun you get by playing with friends. Flying with your friends is so satisfying in this game, covering each other and take down other players with tactics. I really enjoy this game even though I wasn't a fan of piloting with the keyboard and mouse control in aviation games.This is one of the best WW2 planes game so far, so go try it you have nothing to lose (not even money 'cause it's free).

Boy was I wrong, and apperently so was all those history books I've read.  Before I get started I would like to say that most of my gametime has been in the Tank combat because everytime I try to fly a German plane, my bullets just bounce off planes or I just get Hit markers for days and my planes are somehow just made of paper.  Most of my experiance has been me entering a match that has russian tanks that are upwards of 2 tiers ahead of me.  If anyone has played this game they should know that 2 tiers is enough to make you a god on the battlefield.  I kid you not when I say that no matter what tier of a russian tank you verse, the russian will take all the punishment and still one shot you, whether that be a shot in the track or just a shot to the barrel the games balance is so incredibly one sided that i would liken it to WoW's horde fetish.  So basically if you want to play this game you need to play as a russian or you're going to have a bad time.			",91,3,0,13,4,0,5

												Great game. Complete crap developers. Ever since the high point just after they released tanks, Warthunder has steadily gone downhill with every patch and concept unleashed by the developers. It's a testament to how great the engine itself is that the community continues to play this game in spite of the developers very best efforts to ruin it. Do not play.			",24,2,0,4,1,0,9

												What can one say about War Thunder other than its epically fun and its FREE:). But on a more indepth note War Thunder is a very addictive game and one of the best flying games out there it gives you a massive variety of planes to choose from ranging from the early 30's right through to the mid 50's also there is 5 nations to choose from America/Britain/Germany/Russia/Japan.And of course in future they shall be realeasing Tanks and Ships which by the looks of things on youtube will be absolutly epicpick up War Thunder and you will find yourself with an extrmely enjoyable game giving you plenty of entertainment. The game provides 3 modes Arcade for simple straight forward playing and exciting battle experience then there is Historical mode which is much more realistic taking into effect more historical details of the planes you use limited fuel and ammunition becomes a factor as well aim assists are no longer in effect in historical making it much more challenging. Finally is full real mode which basically means what it says its as real as possible and by far the most challenging requires a joy stick			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a veteran player of this game with over 1200 hours before finally throwing in the towel... it's full of development bias, a salty community and very questionable business practice. They've hired research consultants who generally make up their own facts and have no background in historical research, treat their players more like cattle than consumers and have two separate development teams; one for Russian vehicles, another for everything else. That alone raises a few red flags.I really tried to like this game and sunk a lot of time and effort into it and it's community, but all I have to show for it is the company banning both myself and dozens of other users for critical thinking of their product and business, and have received everything up to and including death threats from community members solely because I have differing interests and views.The game was once fine, but Gaijin has been progressively ruining it by pandering to their home nation rather than the international market and feels that their player base is disposable, milking them for a few bucks and then kicking them aside for a few new players rather than trying to maintain the interest and respect of their veteran users.Play at your own risk.Spoiler: Russia wins.

												Gaijin did a fantastic job on the graphics and research, but the gameplay is frustrating.  there is a major problem with their servers where hits you score in air battles dont even register.  You could literally light up another players aircraft like a christmas tree, but out of those 300 some bullets shot, only about ten would register as hits.  the matches are also horribly unbalanced. One can expect to enter a match with the starter airplanes, and come against a tier 3 (good) aircraft. The tank battles have absolutely no level balancing at all, which is frustrating.  Limiting the amount of respawns is also a huge turn off for me. i dont like the pay-to-win aspect of it either. Its turned into a massive grind, match after match. You also have to unlock the campaign and solo missions, which takes alot of grinding to get to.  I would rather buy the game, rather get it for free, and have to pay to get anywhere.On a positive note, the graphics are outstanding, even on the lowest settings. Every plane and tank looks amazing, and they are incredibly detailed.  The guns also have a rather satisfying sound to them.  I also thoroughly enjoy watching an enemy plane explode into tiny bits. Customization of your vehicle is also a nice feature.Overall its a great concept for a game, but the multiplayer needs a major upgrade.			",42,2,0,5,1,0,3

												EDIT UPDATE 12/21/16: War Thunder has not changed for the better in the few months since I first wrote this. In fact, in my opinion the issues I adressed have been exacerbated. I am finally at the point of uninstalling, so many hours invested to be ruined by bad development and a poor attempt at a FTP system. This game used to be fantastic. Unfortunately now its a FTP cash cow in the hands of some extremely greedy developers.I've sat in on their teamspeak events as well as been involved in the forum community, the lack of attention or care to the core gameplay mechanics and fixing them is abhorrant.  The paid vehicles outperform the non-paid ones at every level. Matches are horribly imbalanced (have been for about a year now) with no fix in sight even with huge uproars in both steam and their forum communities. Beware having critical opinions on the forums as you will potentially be squelched or banned. Their answer to the problems as of the last year: add more graphics/ physics, add more vehicles, add more content. Thus making it even more difficult to balance their game for themselves. Seems like backwards logic to me. Once they prove they care about their audience and listen to their playerbase I will continue to recommend this game to people as I have for the past three years.Until then I remain a very dissapointed fan of a once great game.

												I mostly play for free and at times it seems a bit grindy to unlock new planes but this game is totally worth spending $30 to buy gold eagles. I spent $30 on the game and with the gold eagles, I buy myself a 7 day premium pass which makes leveling up your planes go by much faster. My reccomendation: Play the game for free, if you like it, spend a couple bucks for gold eagles (and to support this awesome dveloper), and whenever you play, buy a premium account.

												While I will put the disclaimer that this game is still in beta at the time of writing this review, it will likely still be in beta 2 years later. I have put so much time into liking this game, but the redeeming qualities don't outweight the cons of this game.So, let's begin.My first major pain point with this game is the dev team. They've pulled some pretty great things out, don't get me wrong. The game looks great and /sometimes/ runs well. Then you get times like when Ground Forces was first released. Back then you can turn almost all the foliage off. This took them over a year to fix, and that's after they stopped waiving it as ""Normal competetive play"". The second thing is balancing. Holy crap is balancing bad. For instance, the Valentine MK 1, in the British armored tech tree. You're only driving it to serve as points for the enemy team. Your armor means nothing, you have no mobility, and your gun is awful. That's just one example of tanks that are not worth driving because they're overtiered.Second point, the community. While the community has good points as well, there is a lot of bad to sift through to find the good. If you make any complaint at all, you will be bombarded with insults. If you ask for help, you will be bombarded with insults. Don't like a certain tank? Guess what? More insults. You'll be lucky to find meaningful conversation or anyone who's willing to say anything other than something concerning your mother.The final nail in the coffin is when I opened up Warthunder at the time this review was written to find that the update released today severely broke resourrce management in the game. My computer has 16GB of RAM. Warthunder was using 12. I'd never seen my RAM maxed out before.Conclusion: It has ups and downs, mostly downs. If you're willing to ignore the community, you might find something of value in it.NOTE: I mostly played ground forces, I didn't like air and was kinda trash at it, so your milage may vary if you play it for air.

												It's hard to review a game you've spent hundreds of hours into as it's developed, with only the choice between ""yes"" and ""no"". I'll do it a bit different this time and look at what the game actually is rated: 85%. Does this game deserve 85% rating? No.There's still plenty of good in the game, but here's why this game isn't worth what everyone seems to think it is:Russian bias: This is more of an opinion, but MANY people share it. Russian planes, in arcade, are simply too good (ie: too low of a BR).Progression nerfs: They've happened, more than once. Way to milk players for money gaijin.Premium-cost doubled: Guess what the most cost effective method of premium days used to be? Buying 1 day for 100GE whenever you liked and grinding it out all day when you had time off to. Guess what it costs now? 190.Stale mechanics: There are no mechanics here that perk my ears after a couple hundred hours. Games are ""blow up units and shoot planes to win"". Ground battles though? Capture the point. Literally the exact same as World of Tanks, only now there are 3 of them...whoop de do. Either way, actual grinding in the game consists of killing as many players as you can within the shortest time frame, just like world of tanks.Pay to win?: This is mostly gaijin's fault for deciding to make every unique plane with no good comparison premium-only...Nonetheless, XP-50? Thing climbs ridiculous and has two of the best cannons in the game, nose mounted to boot. d520/521? These things turn ridiculously, and had totally broken flight models for, at least, some time, paired with another nose mounted cannon? You guessed it, no comparison.Would've given you a bonus screenshot, but that is a bonus in and of itself! War thunder is such a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that I can't even take steam screenshots of my hangar...SMHNot worth 85%. End of review.			",81,3,0,14,4,0,5

												I grantly recommend this game. Everything is great about it. Firstly, the hitbox and damage following the location of the shot are really realistic (in my opinion). The game is beautifull visually, if you have a good enough CG. But the main reason I recommend it is for the fun you get by playing with friends. Flying with your friends is so satisfying in this game, covering each other and take down other players with tactics. I really enjoy this game even though I wasn't a fan of piloting with the keyboard and mouse control in aviation games.This is one of the best WW2 planes game so far, so go try it you have nothing to lose (not even money 'cause it's free).

												Planes, Tanks, and soon to be Ships. whats not to love? gameplay is fantastic, as how you get kills depends not on another players HP, but where your shots are placed, distance, and what ammo your using. I would say the best part about this game, is the fact that its not just an arcade style flight game. It is so much more then that, as its a full on flight simulator too! Add on the absolutely stunning graphics, and youve got yourself a winner. With a vast array of aircraft, and land based vehicles, plus fantastic graphics with many game modes and types, this game is a well deserved 10/10			",127,5,7,8,3,0,10

The matchmaking system is slow and puts you up against very experienced players.3. Unlocking new vehicles takes absolutely forever because you get killed so easily by experienced players.4. Learning curve is insanely steep.5. Games take a long time for the exp and silver given. (silver is the common currency, and gold is the premium)6.

The flying with its G-tolerance, manuevers, and bombing is so unique and immersive, and then the tanks with knocking out crews and tanks having weak points is awesome as well. The one isssue that this game has, theres no ships! The trailer shows ships, and even in the war thunder logo there is ships! Thats the slyness level of Bungie with Destiny 2!

												Back in the days this game had a lot of potential with the mechanics that they had in-play but with every 1 step forward that they made they just fell 4 steps backwards, the state that this game is at right now is unplayable.If you would like to spend 2 years of playing this game just to get the first jet and then realise that you need a full month of gameplay just to unlock a single part.. all of that would be fine if the progress was fun but it's not. You'll face jets that are either fully upgraded(probably by premium acceleration) or just a superior jet in every prespective.The fact that it's free doesnt mean that the devs should block the end content even to players who play their game for years only because they want to make the grind last longer. Yes the russian bias is real and they will block you in the global chat/forums if you say so, thankfuly Gaijin doesnt have that kind of power on the Steam reviews.			",99,20,2,9,16,2,15

												This♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game is barely playable now a days. It has so many hackers it is going like APB back in the day. And dont get me started about the armor on these tanks, you would be better off with tricycle wrapped in tin foil. This game has only two things going for it 1) Graphics. 2) Physics.The devs of this game have gotten so greedy that almost all new tanks are premium tanks that cost at least 25$ to 40$ each and to top that they are not that great. Back in the day you could have 2 to 4 great battles(and had fun, which is non existence now) and get the next tank you are researching or complete research of few moduels on the tank that you are on or have. But now you need to get at least 10 battles and those battles need to be really good ones to be able to do the half you could do some time ago.

												I can not recommend this game if you want me to be honest.Yes the game has its awesome moments, that keeps me to come back once in a while but there are just to much bad in it that I simply cannot recommend others to play it.The good:-lots of difrent tanks/vehicles and planes gives difrent experience to how and what to do e.g. In a M24 you might not wanna get head on against heavy tanks, better flank etc.- Some events are just brilliant can sook in lots of hours doing them. -Great grapichs, cant say how many times I have simply looked at the details on the planes when flying to an objective, simply to get lost in the atmosphere and details.*The Bad:-The MM system is awfull, nothing less. can only talk from own experience, but far FAR to often am I simply put in Tiers way above me. (and yes I do know how it works)-The graphics are just a obstacle, If you like me loves RB and SB its simply a must to play on low Quality settings to be competitive. and I hate it to my bones. I have to turn off one of the most immerive things simply to be able to see the enemy, in the beginning I was baffled over why I get spotted constantly untill a teammate asked what settings I played on, and when I said High the entire chat started laughing. That is simply broken feature that Devs but time and effort to make a game pretty just to make it null and void if you wanna have a fighting chance.-Immersive breaking prototype weapons in SB (and RB) I got drawn to the idea of a WW2 game, but what I get is Prototype tanks/planes put into matches that should never have them, sure in AB or costum battles sure, but when I wanna Fight REALISTIC or SIMULATION battles I kinda expect to fight vehicles that where fighting against eachoter, not Blueprint tanks or Korea/coldwar stuff. its so immersive breaking to drive your Tiger 1 and get face punched by coldwar tanks in a SB where you should expect maybe IS1/2 etc, but nope not in this game.-The premium disparity, not only is it immerive breaking to see US fflying in Bf 109s, but the amount of premium stuff is highly onesided when it comes to certain faction getting otherfactions special vehicles. E.G You would think a iconic P47 would be US exclusive, but you would be wrong. Not only does GE get it but so does SU and yes you will face against them in RB and SB battles.So if you like me wants a ww2 themed game where you get to feel like fighting an iconic T-34/sherman/tiger against their respective iconic enemies you will be very disapointed, you will more then often fight against higher tiered enemies with Prototype/coldwar/premium vehicles on low quality settings making sure that if you wanna be able to see him aswell you better dump your settings aswell.There is as I mentioned some events that are just brilliant, but to get to play them you often have to have a certain vehicle and to get to it it takes time to grind, and that is simply not funny if you constantly  experience the above mentioned situations.

												After a couple hundred ours of gameplay its fair to say that all russian vehicles in this game are stupidly OP. and by op i mean using german and american tanks to kill russian tanks is like trying to dent a police riot vehicle with a ♥♥♥♥ing tennis ball. Even the russian planes handle like Jap Zeros and have the fire power of German Foch Wolfs.  The team balancing is comeplete♥♥♥♥♥♥ they real took after hitler designing it since they split the superior players on one team and the inferior players on the other. Either youre doing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or your getting♥♥♥♥♥♥on, and about %95 of the time its the latter if you play any other team than russia. If youre having trouble envisioning in your mind how russia could be so powerful in this game, go watch the avengers scene where Hulk slams loki around like a pool noodle and youll get a pretty good idea of what i mean. Also if you play hardcore and you get killed during the start, you dont get your vehicles back till the round ends. So if you havent rubbed one out all day now would be the perfect time to do that, othwerwise youll be sitting at the hangar menu with your rhumb up your♥♥♥♥♥for a good 5 minutes. If i had a choice of having only this game to play for the rest of my life or using internet explorer for my default browser. Id choose to kill myself. 5/7. Trump for President.			",22,1,0,4,0,0,0

												This♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game is barely playable now a days. It has so many hackers it is going like APB back in the day. And dont get me started about the armor on these tanks, you would be better off with tricycle wrapped in tin foil. This game has only two things going for it 1) Graphics. 2) Physics.The devs of this game have gotten so greedy that almost all new tanks are premium tanks that cost at least 25$ to 40$ each and to top that they are not that great. Back in the day you could have 2 to 4 great battles(and had fun, which is non existence now) and get the next tank you are researching or complete research of few moduels on the tank that you are on or have. But now you need to get at least 10 battles and those battles need to be really good ones to be able to do the half you could do some time ago.  Your time is better spent on something else than this♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Realism is taken to the extreme on this one. Not just graphics, but the smallest of details in plane mechanics.I'm a huge fan of planes, and simulators. Even more so of plane simulators. I also like action. So why would I not like a game like this?Oh, I hate in-game-purchases.Not only that, but the systems included for plane customization and the menus in general are too bloody complicated. The in-game currency and having to buy thing to progress to the higher tiers is just stupid.Basically, it's TOO COMPLICATED.Simplify the game, make it purchasable, remove the microtransactions,then I will play it again.If F2P & P2A games are your thing, go for it. I don't like it tho.			",223,60,8,52,29,6,38

												The game is extremely fun to play at first, but after a while all it becomes is grinding. And it's not just the game. The company itself refuse to change the game, they refuse to admit that there is russian bias in the game, which there evidently is, and they cant take criticism, oppressing people who criticize the game and them, even going so far as to threaten to ruin Realistic Battles, a gamemode that most of the community plays, if we dont give them permission to give youtubers who criticize them a COPYRIGHT STRIKE.

												Very fun WWII era fighter simulator which you can play in simple arcade style or punish yourself with full simulator mode. Warning:  If you don't own a flight stick, simulator mode is basically instant death.  Control with a mouse and keyboard had a bit of a learning curve but I'm pretty used to it now and it's very playable in arcade and even realistic mode.  My only quibble is that  with a mouse, when you're trying to save yourself from an uncontrolled dive, your view becomes an under the plane view and you're flying completely blind...  which for arcade mode doesn't make sense.  In terms of the F2P stuff.  I just started playing recently and I guess it used to be less grindy based on other reviews.  But what others are saying is true, you will spend a lot of hours even getting yourself to even the mid tier planes unless you focus on one country only (or pay money of course).  I expected a certain level of grind since it is free to play but I think if I choose never to put money in, I'm looking at several months of work to unlock one country's planes.  Still, all told I recommend it since even at low tiers, dogfighting is pretty darn fun.   ",38,10,0,4,12,0,2

												This Game WAS a good game, but since a few patches the quality decrease hardly. 1) Russians Bias (Tu4 anyone or IT1) with totally wrong Battleranks. And unpenetrable Armor of Tanks. 2) RNG is a basic gamemechanics!! Thats poor for a ""realistic"" game.  With every Patch RNG increase hard. So if you     shooting on Flat areas, your tankgrenade wouldn't penetrate, even if you have double of penetration.3) totally ♥♥♥♥ed up Desyncs, even with lowping and packetloss.4) Not you Skill counts, only Luck and MM.5) The devs...say A and do B.6) Matchmaking (yesterday they changed it to totally stupid. Why? no answer)7) Ultra low quality graphics. Gaijin said they fixed it, but sadly its works well. you be able to spotted over 2km through bushes and trees.The Game was great. Cerca one year ago, but today its only frustrating.My Statistics:Germany: T5 Air and GroundforcesUSA: T4 Air and T5 GFUK: T4 Air and T4 GFSU: Didn't play.

												UPDATE: HOLY CRAP THIS GAME IS AMAZING!! I have close to 1,000 hours on this game for a reason. The simulators and realistic battles are on a whole new level and feel like a complete different game comapared to Arcade Battle. If you have the space in your computer to download this I highly recommend it! Yes this game is a ""Free to Play"" but that does not stop you from unlocking a lot of powerfull planes easily with out having to pay. Once you get to tier 4 its become quite harder to unlock your planes, and that is where the pay to win comes in. All in all i only spent $20 on the game and have almost every single plane unlocked, the $20 really made a big difference in researching and unlocking rest of the planes through premium mebership.DOWNSIDE: The developers in my opinion are kind of stupid, they nerfed the crap out of bombers because the people complaining about them being ""OP"" I have a whole fleet of [B-17] Bombers and it really sucks getting shot down after 3 hits. They made the ""B-17 Flying Fortress"" (historically indestructable) into the ""B-17 Flying Paper Airplane""IN THE END I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME 10/10			",57,5,3,1,6,0,4

												Yes. I give this game an  8 / 10. All of these reviews that are giving it a downvote since 1.37 don't fully understand the contents of the update. The matchmaking is no longer based upon the tiers, but by the individual aircraft's Battle Rating. As for those complaining about damage models (sparking), the low velocity cannons they are using sometimes bounce (spark). Quick fixes after 1.37 significantly smooth progression. After 1.41, Ground Forces have been released. Currently, as of June 4th, 2014, only Soviet and Wehrmacht tanks are available (and still not the full tree). The devs have stated that they are focused on fleshing out tech trees for OTHER countries before finishing the current tech trees (along with the possibility of completely new trees, such as French or Italian.) My only complaint is that currently, people running computers with enough power to be used at NASA still turn grass draw distance to minimal, along with particle effects, just so that they can get the edge in simulator battles. I'm fine with those who can't run those settings with their current potato. Even I get the occasional studder on the Kuban tank map. As for pay to win, it's more like... Pay for less grinding. I would not recommend those who have severe motion sickness, but for anyone else into action games, I would recommend very[/u] highly.People have to realise that this game is still a work in progress... If something is messed up in an update, have patience. It will eventually be fixed.NOW with GROUND FORCES! ",40,9,0,5,5,0,1

 War Thunder  It is a multiplayer / mmo game released as a free title, where we are fighting with other players in the air and on the ground but also soon on the sea. This production gives the opportunity to play in different modes: arcade, realistic and simulation. Each differs in the level of difficulty as well as varied gameplay. The game has micropayments, premium accounts but they do not interfere in the game (perhaps only at the beginning). In the game we develop crew that they are in a better use of our war machines, you can use real money which is not really that expensive, or develop them by playing the game. To unlock another machine, you have to play a lot to gather a certain amount of points, or once again use real money to unlock immediately (which is not profitable). In addition, after each unlocking we have to buy them and train our crew to use it. The game offers several nations such as Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan. Each of them has a lot of number of machines to choose from (Japan does not have tanks). War Thunder has a very powerful, realistic physics and damage system. Controlling planes and tanks is very realistic. Destroying enemies is about eliminate the crew or give critical damage to machine. This game is a really great production except for a weak balance the machine, while playing I had a lot of fun destroying vehicles enemy players. Great sound system, nice gameplay, beautiful graphics convinced me to play for hours. I highly recommend this production, however, I warn that, for me, the game began after unlocking Tier 3.

												War Thunder...oh, where to start....Firstly, I have 1000+ hours on the game, as the steam version launches a launcher, and i have a new account, hence the 100 hours i have right now. Anyway, this game has a tonne of potential. It can be super fun and rewarding...BUT... the developers are gaijin Entertainment. Yes, the game has potential, but said potential will never be seen unless somehow the game changes devs. There is a heavy Russian bias in the game (Particularly the Tu-4 right now. They don't nerf the plane, they want it to stay op so reduce number of bombers per game to seem like they are trying when it makes no difference). Gaijin know there is a heavy Russian bais, and they know we know, hell theres even a title in-game about it, but nothing will ever be done about it. My advice is, if you want to play a ""free to play"" game where you play as Russia pwning the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of others, go ahead!! Used to be fun though, if you have a time-machine handy, go back about a year or so and you're good!			",14,2,0,0,2,0,12

												War Thunder is one of those rare free games that is better than you could ever expect for being free. It has a massive amout of aircraft and newly added tanks, not to mension that navy forces will be added later.Now before you guys start yelling about it have tons of IGTs, they are what keep the game free to play. Plus none of the ""Premium"" vehicles are over powered compared to the normal ones; if anyhting they are worse than the vehicles that you research. But if you were going to pay in the game I would highly recommend purchasing the Premium account, being that it vastly accelerates the researching of the vehicles.9.5/10			",137,17,15,10,22,0,6

I know the reviews for the game look very bad and can be deterring at times, but don't let it deter you from playing. If you want to play this game with relatively decent people and get out of the cancerbarrel that is the War Thunder steam community, Go to the warthunder live website, there people are more tolerable as well as you can get custom missions and skins there too.

												First lemme clear something up. Gaijin has done their very best. While most people complain about Gaijins seemingly 'infinite' wisdom, I will skip past it like the last time you skipped class and get to the point. The game is well done. The physics are pretty damn good. The models are well done. We seem to ask simple things of them, but guys, you have to remember, keeping a game like this running is neither cheap nor quick, it is very slow and very expensive. But Gaijin does their best, in my opinion.Part two is about the in game experiences. IT IS ALL ABOUT HOW YOU PLAY. If you are a guy who likes heavy tanks, of course you gonna think Japanese, British and American tanks are bad. If you a guy who just like to go balls deep mode and pray for the best, America all the way. As stated its all in how you play. Once you learn to be flexible, the grind becomes a bit better.The grind is hell tho. Will not lie.My rating: 8/10, would sell soul to snail lord again for T29. ",29,5,1,5,7,0,4

												This has become pay to play, this is because of the extreme level of grind of reasearch and credits, origionally when I started playing, the in game economy and reseach was great with a good of set between time spent grinding the levels and match reward, but now its more of a choice of spend real currency or spend a far greater amount of time on it. Shame really.......			",36,2,1,8,8,0,11

												I played many hours of this game and loved every minute of it. When the patch came out changing the game from experience to ""research"" I lost about 5 planes. I proceeded to talk to gaijin and ask to unlock the planes they took away. Mind you, I continued to play this through the whole issue. They told me there was ""no record"" and offered me an account upgrade for my trouble. I told them I wanted the planes back or enough currency to buy them back. They outright refused and became very rude. So I and many of the people I played with left. Graphics were great but the customer service was absolute crap, if you don;t care about your customer then you don't deserve to have me as a loyal player.			",124,8,3,8,9,2,12

												This game is fun in many aspects, but is flawed in MANY aspects. Pros: -The graphics are great.- fps was great as well, never diped below 60 for me. - Many options for planes, which includes modles, ammo, etc. (see cons for more detail)- Loading time wasn't too bad for me, but experience may differ.- Animations are interesting. - Its 'free'.Cons:- Progresstion is slow as f**k.- There appears to be no balancing whatsoever. (Level 4 vs. Level 17). <--- Happens every game.- First fews hours, the progresstion is fine, then it dips and the pay-walls become more appearent.- You can pay money to advance everything in this game, p2w.- Planes can be brought down with only a few shots, somethimes.- Game becomes a grinding really fast.- Few game modes (dosen't really bother me, but others may be bothered).- Did i mention that team are often not balanced, buecause it's kinda a big issue. Most games with a large amount of people have some sort of blanacing system, but not this game (which has been out for a long time).Other Conserns:- Voice chat appears not to work (no indications).- Can only custimize ammo and decal (which you can have only 2 decal unless you have a premium account).

												I love this game, despite what some people say in the other reviews, some people just aren't thinking. Balance in war? Is there such a thing? Lets look at Battlefield Vietnam, the Vietnamese did not have tanks, helicopters and such but they could spawn anywhere and had anti tank weapons. Who cares if some things are out matched by others in War Thunder, there is always a way to kill something, learn how to play it rather than rushing in like an idiot and dying. I do agree the grind for some things is ridiculous, but I have been playing this game for about 4 years now and I do not regret it, I have had a lot of fun and the long grinds can be fun when you do it right. I intend on playing this game for a lot longer (Steam does not represent my actual play time, I got the game before I knew it was on Steam, my game time should be around 2500 hours at this point), this is a good game when played with the right attitude and knowledge.

												This game is very hard to advance in. No matter which tier of tanks I'm in,  at least half of the tanks are the next tier which a majority of them my tanks barely damage while they can 1 hit mine and destroy them. I was in tier 2 with 5 tanks to choose from. I was fighting tier 3 tanks the majority of the time. Finally I managed to get 3 tier 3 tanks and when I go to battle I'm fighting tier 4 tanks. There has been many times where I've hit the other tank 7 or 8 times and not crippling it. If you cant get kills you cant advance your tanks hardly at all.			",33,3,2,9,3,0,2

Posted: December 26, 2013
												I UNINSTALLED THIS IN FRUSTRATION AFTER MY 2ND DAY OF PLAYING. The match-making in this MMO combat flight sim is brutal and unfair, and I'm already fed up with being cannon fodder for the veteran/paying players.It started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade, so I'm experienced with them. This one has nice graphics and gradual levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to fly, customize, and tinker with.When I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era bi-plane - and so were pretty much all the other players in my first dozen or so matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. It was fun and challenging. I even found myself sometimes ranking among the top players on my team (this, due to my experience with other combat flight sim's).But after I attained level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At level 3, then 4, I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20+, level 30+, and even level 40+ players. Not only were these players way more experienced with this game, their planes were way better too! I had to painfully line them up with my slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons.Oh, sure, I was able to upgrade my planes with the points I'd earned from my earlier matches, but the increments of those upgrades were painfully slow, small, and relatively insignificant. Yes, I knew that I could spend real-world money for a bunch of credits to accelerate my progression and buy better planes and weapons, but... No thanks. I *hate* pay-to-win MMO's. And I especially hate the ones that appear to be free-to-play, only to lure in bunches of newbies to provide cannon fodder for the paying/veteran customers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beware this is a long review that could've been 3 times longer easily, sorry for things i haven't mentioned and skip to bottom for short.OK, now i spent lots of time (>1000hrs) to this game, got in the first 500 in pvp and first 50 in sheer kill number (monthly) at leaderboards, i must say i am still learning a lot and a newbie in many aspects, so take this review with a grain of salt. Also for reference, i play Arcade Plane Battles the most but am a simmer with enough time in games such as il2 series, started playing this game around march 2016 and had a break in summer for 3 months, flight tag ""Radira"". In contrary to popular belief , this game is not pay-to-win, nor there is a case where soviet vehicles unnaturaly dominate (a.k.a russian bias), and this is coming from someone who plays with USSR vehicles the least, and mostly encounter them as opposition. The matchmaking pits you against comparable aircrafts through a system involves BR (all players average efficiency in said plane) and Tier (loosely based on historical first flight dates and improvements on same planes) for each plane,  so unlocking a better aircraft,  spending money to unlock new aircraft or buy a premium plane DOES NOT net you a win. There are ofcourse some planes too low tier or BR because of the misuse of majority of players, but this only means when you get proficiency to understand how to use them, you can still use them in upper BR battles rather than take them to bash newbies (well, most of the time). The reason people insists on some planes are OP , is mostly because lack of understanding flight dynamics, wrongly assessing the given situation, forcing their planes to do what they are not meant to do, thinking they can do any maneuver, win any encounter in specific ways just because plane flies and shoots at where their mouse is pointing, but mostly lack of understanding that there is no such thing as equal conditions or honorable fight in aviation, you always try to get most advantage to your side and keep the enemy away from using its advantages, only then use the initiative to swoop in and even then the kill is not something guaranteed and you have to fight for it, except some lucky shots.The best part of aviation games imo, is that it always ends up in pilot proficiency. There will always be a way to defeat that guy, you only have to find it. Situational awareness, enemy recognition, patience and initiative are the most important skills in this game and you have to be very calm to understand the reasons why you succeed or fail in each instance of dogfight. Community is full of ragers and thrash talkers mostly in arcade, and that rage is coming from not understanding the dynamics involved correctly. When i get beaten by someone after fighting 5 mins just to get and keep that altitude, i dont feel frustrated, i feel respect, awe and return back with my new experience to use it next time.Your biggest asset is your wingman, unless you have someone over a VoiP, you don't have a wingman. Two dedicated, communicating players are usually enough take out, at least stop the opposition's 25 kill monster, two is usually enough to defend against 8 attackers, two is usually enough to win a game. If you are alone, no matter who you are, one mad newbie can be enough to critically injure you and downplay your game. One dedicated attacker is a risk, potential loss resources, but two is certainly loss of time the least. Always bring backup if you can. Equal conditions, fair-play, honorable fight, these concepts are lies and were lies even back in late ww1.I must add here that realistic is a great game mode that can teach, very effectively, dynamics of aviation and combat flying for upcoming simmers, but besides that, there is no real reason to play it over simulation except the reason that you don't own a joystick. It is harder imo, but still much more arcadish than simulation, and simulation mode in this feels awkwardly easy for reasons i do not know, for ex landing, i've tutored many in other sims, from taxiing, tower comm to basic flight maneuvers and formation flying, but i never saw this many succesful first time short landings from newbies in any other.The game Meta is the worst part that i can tell, there is not enough variation of game mods or maps to use the strengths of each plane and some nations takes the short end because of this, though said some nations generally do have some other unusual ways of being useful. This is a fantasy game that involves planes that are never flown or never fought together nor against some        never even left the design stage. I sometimes feel a bit downplaying for axis, like there are no german pilot avatars and allied nations get SALES 4 times more than axis, japanese repair costs ffs, but who can blame them since germans have Minengeschoß shells and have massive fun with them anyways and japs can stop a plane in mid air and turn back (jokes aside , we need you to check repair costs for nippon GAJOOON, srsly).The graphics and performance are marvelous, there are/were some wrongs in models both visually and in-game dynamics wise but they keep updating it for better historical accuracy. Lag is not that a big deal (interestingly, in sims , you usually need low latency because everything happens so fast, split second shooting windows and such) i regularly play in servers from EU, RU, SA and US  , its not that big a difference. Addition of new equipment or losing some old ones changes the status quo but thats a good thing, no comfort zone in MP game is always a good thing.In short; This is a good f2p game, with good graphics, constant updates, massive fun with friends and as a way to understand aviation and a training for other simulation games. The grind is real, if you are so obssessed unlocking new vehicles, which is not required to enjoy the game. I strongly advise getting a premium account but to be honest i didn't until i get to the jets tier, the game deserves it and it will make your life easier after your early months of addiction level fun rush ended. So just be versatile, keep calm, have patience, work on your problem solving skills and have fun. Speed is li..... ehh you know it.~S~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was a good game that got ruined by a greedy Russian developer and their insane F2P business model. The game was originally a ""pay 2 win"" title, but the flying was fun enough that I was willing to overlook it. Then came patch 1.73, where Gaijin increased the grind and expense to unlock your favorite planes by over 600%. I put $50 into this game and am still nowhere near being able to fly a single jet. They dangle the jets in front of you like a carrot to keep you grinding and spending money. The problem is that when you unlock the jets, there isn't much game left to play anymore. There aren't many active players at the high ranks, so you end up playing games with 4 players and 4 bots on each team. Instead of adding late game content, the developer just decided to move the carrot back another 100 yards to delay the inevitable. This game will die before Gaijin finishes making it.The worst part is that I can't even research the plane I want because I have to ""buy"" all the other planes that I've unlocked in the tree before my XP will even apply to the planes I want. You don't earn enough ""lion points"" to buy these planes from normal play, so your only choice is to grind for a month or give them a ridiculous amount of money (seriously, we're talking $100 or more to unlock the jets for each country now). People who open threads about this on the official forum just get their threads locked by moderators. The developer has spoken, and their answer is ""♥♥♥♥ you.""Do not waste your time with this game.			",117,3,2,2,7,1,11

												Absolute grindfest with 0 promise of better vehicles. You get a supposedly heavily armored tank but you still get one shot easily in the thickest places cause the enemy has a bigger gun. So basically there's no point unless you have the last vehicle for each tree, and you have to spend rediculous ammounts of time just to get ONE of those vehicles on ONE nation. A big part in the feel for unbalanced gameplay is the matchmaking. From what I can tell it pairs you with people 1 rank above and below yours, so sometimes you'll have a breeze killing everyone with one shell, but when you're on the recieving end it's ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you see a heavy tank 1 rank above yours the only option is to run, they're impenetrable. It's fun with friends but not worth it in the long run.			",38,3,0,3,3,0,3

												This game is easily (in my opinion), one of the best war/sim/WWII/Vietnam War multiplayer games out there in the market with its vast amount of planes added all the time in updates and patches and, it is also FREE to play! I am absolutely in love with this game. I love the realism and great realistic aspects of the game, even though it may be buggy or irritating some times, this games makes my day when i see that great killcam when i finish off a target with a T-34. The great and passionate devs are always working on ways to improve the game based on feedback such as, youtube video comments which players leave in their channel were, they have their own great shows featuring great in-game clips that the players themselves create and submit to War Thunder. They also have really helpful guides on tanks and planes and how to play them efficiently. They also have a show named ""The Shooting Range"" were they show off planes, tanks, history of either a famous aircraft or vehicle and also true stories of war which inspire me even more to play the game, they also have a segment in every last ""Shooting Range"" episode named ""Hotline"" in which players leave comments and developers reply to either a player's question or the host of the show makes an awesome joke out of an unexpected comment, last but not least they also have update videos about new additions to the game or changes due to a major update or patch. All this hard work put into a free-to-play game just blows my mind on how much the developers in this game really care about this great game that many people really, REALLY enjoy. Of course, this game has its downsides which I am going to be honest about. First, the match making and balance most of the time is really mediocre, for example, I had a tier 3 P-47D which has a ""battle rating"" of 3.0 in arcade battles and, got put with a P-51D-5 in my team although he was in my team doesn't really mean it is fair at all, the rest of the enemy team simply could not catch up to the greatly maneuverable American plane, this always happends to me as well, i too get paired up with really high ranking planes that outrun, outperform, or simply outgun me straight up. This harsh reality goes for tanks ESPECIALLY TANKS which happens way more times than in planes. Tank battles require knowledge, patience, precision, and a great trigger finger, but when you get put against a HEAVY tank that you cannot penetrate at all, even with your high penetrating non-explosive shell (APCR/Armor Piercing Composite Shell) then you get blasted in the face and easily one-shoted by an outright better tank. Another reason is that sometimes the game can be really buggy and glitchy sometimes A.K.A. you spam your left-click to shoot and then the shell lags out and never hits the target, and then get blasted AGAIN. These complaints really are all i have experianced playing this game for 200+ hours, I know that many other people have MANY more problems with the game and I 100% understand. I run this game at ultra-low quality and I have great frame-rate in a home computer that can barely run Minecraft at 60fps, but this game can run plane battles at almost 40fps depending on the vast amount of detailed maps that this game has to offer, well in tanks i can barely run 30fps again, depending on the map, to summarize this game's developers really have been working hard to optimize the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game so any person with a below decent computer like me can run it. I have VERY, VERY high hopes for this game and to where it is headed, sure it needs some polishing here and there, but the game is simply stunning at max graphics which would be something i would hopefully see with a new computer. I really enjoy playing this game and all the realism and historical value it has for you to experiance, this game is World of Tanks, World of Warplanes, and World of Warships put toghether all in one game that is WAY better than any of those 3 in my opinion, also the long awaited naval forces are coming soon with an already out pre-beta testing, and soon to come beta and then the FULL RELEASE which is going to kick this game into high gear. If all this wasnt enough the game is compatible with popular VR devices that can let you experiance the greatness of the game VR! I have taken about an hour and 30 minutes to write this review for this game, even though i NEVER write reviews for any game. But you ask me why i chose to write one now on this one, well, BECAUSE THE GAME IS THAT GOOD!!!			",31,1,0,0,6,0,2

												I personally adore this game despite it's flaws, many planes lacking proper flight models, also many of them not preforming as they should especially annoying with the famous iconic planes, and imbalanced nations and bias. A lot of the community enjoy griefing and rave like delusional CoD, WoT and WoWP players, but except for all these issues, I highly recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												beware the german menace they have 360 degree rotating 99mm ball turrets that can shoot you from any possible angle no matter what, they also use teleporters to get behind your plane and watch out for Thach's F2A space buffalo because it can travel to the moon and back with its devastating 50. cal. 30. cal. combo or destruction. this game ruins lives and keyboards. 10/10			",63,3,2,7,14,1,10

												After all these hours in this game, I've found out there are many problems about this game from the russian bias to the BR compression. But, on top the that, the devs dont listen to the community. If you look on the reviews you will see everybody complaining about this game and the devs, but i'm here to upvote this game. I will say that I do not respect the devs whatsoever. This does not mean that this game is all bad. Some pros of this game would be the graphics. Its undeniable that the devs spend lots of time on the aircraft, ground vehicles, and maps on this game. Another reason is that this game isn't pay to win at all either. The devs also have a realistic damage model with important parts in planes and tanks (cooling systems, wing spars, even guns) which adds an interesting touch to combat. Some bad parts of this game : gaijin literally has down syndrome, russian bias, terrible brs, nerfing of americans and germans, and the list goes on.From a person who is in T5 German planes, T3 German tanks, and has spent about 100 dollars on this game.

												This game has been now ruined by the Devs taking the change of mind to being bias...There's been controversy about the bias Russian tanks & planes and In my opinion I believe that it's a true concern and IT IS ruining the game. I used to play this game last year when everything was balanced and nothing was bias. Recently I have decided to play again and was thinking of maybe even spending money (USD) for Lions (In-Game Currency). Thankfully I decided that I wasn't going to spend any money when I started to noticed how twisted and how OP the Russian tanks are now. I've went to the discussions page and other websites and apparently this problem has been existing for a while (possibly at the time after when I started to not play the game anymore)Honestly I think Gaijin has had more than enough time to fix this bias problem with the Russian tanks.Yes I will still play the game (Possibly) but will most certainly not spend money till this is fix which I doubt since I've seen on the discussions pages being locked when there's a title called Russian Bias.Gaijin hears us but will not enact on this problem.Good job Gaijin you have completely ruined this game...====Update 4/14/16====I have started to lose interest in this game to the point where I would play this once every week or two.Before I started losing interest in the game me and my friend did an experiment where we played Russian tanks starting the experiment from tier 2 for about two hours mostly using the T series from the Russian side since those are the most op kind of tanks you can use from them (Russia).The Result was of course without surprise the Russian tanks are still ridiculously op. You literally don't have to try with Russian tanks. You don't even have to find weak spots on enemy tanks. Just shoot and win. I can see why people support the Russian side saying stuff like ""There is no Russian bias"" or ""get good there's no Russian bias"" they use Russian tanks or planes to level up faster and get more in-game money. While many Russian tank users call people out and telling them to ""get good"" instead. Maybe they should look at themselves and tell themselves to get good since they use Russian bias to their advantage.			",28,3,1,0,8,0,0

												Gaijin Read-This game used to be good. It still is without a doubt.War thunder boats, not satisfied, spaa on water, gj gaijin.Edit- As i go through the chat the only positive reviews i see are the ones where people have played 5 hours then thought to themselves...""Oh time to review this amazing game"".News flash this game died. Edit- Game is very lively again.EDIT- Yes my review stands at bad, but i have played it recently and it has some very good improvments. I'm not one of those people that will judge it for it being historically wrong, and yes im still waiting for ships...but that is beside the point, I would recommend this game to some...but not to everyone.It is a good game overall, but as i said before review remains bad. The devs are nowhere near as money hungry as Wargaming devs. Vehicles are super easy to unlock and you dont have to research every modification just to get the next one. You are not pushed to use money is this as I feel I have to in World of etc....Yes get this game and see what you think about it, don't judge the game by other people's reviews and find out for yourself this game's true potential.Edit- I am reviewing this game with a thumbs up. I dont judge this game for it's historical accuracy, if you want to ruin games for yourself by judging them like that go ahead. But i reccomend just enjoying the game and having as much fun as possible. Don't forget to lose yourself in the designs of these tanks. Yet again overall I love this game and super easy to unlock next tier of vehicles. Try it out.EDIT- Now War Thunder has the first version of ships for us to test!!!! This game is going to be the perfect mix of Air, Land, and Sea combat and i am so excited to see what they have in store for us next. I STRONGLY reccommend this game to anyone that is a fan of realistic warfare. And Gaijin if you see this review I would like to know when ships are EST. to be on the tech trees. Please and Thank You.EDIT- So I was looking into the ship deal....and all i saw were wooden ships...this is mainly a WW2 era. What do wooden ships have to do with that in any way. I really hope the wooden ship deal is just for testing only and they will come out with proper WW2 era ships.EDIT- Ok so I hope that it is just an April fools joke on the wooden ships and they actually come out with real ships that were dated in WW2 times.EDIT- So alot of people out there are complaining about this wonderful game. But did you know Gaijin are working on another game as you read this. It is another free to play MMO of course but it is a mix between robocraft and Mad Max and I think it looks wonderful so far. But since they are working on 2 games at once maybe 3 if they still work on star conflict. They can't do everything at once. But since they are working on these 2 games at the same time they can only do so much to satisfy everyone. Be happy with what the game devs have now and play with that until they come out with more. Be positive, negativity only ruins everything for everyone. Keep playing and having fun, ;)EDIT- (Message to Gaijin)- My email is Fizbeminecraft@gmail.com and I would be honored to be let into Crossout.Contact me and maybe I will even record it and post it to youtube. But I dont have proper recording equipment so :| . But I can get a free recording software until I can scrounge up enough money to get a proper recording software. I already have a mic (Headset). But im not pushing this on you. I am just saying I would be very grateful if you would let me in the closed beta.EDIT- So I was going through the comments and reviews and I am seeing people saying that the matchmaking is unfair. Ever since i started playing this game I found out that it does not matter what tank or plane you are taking on it is all fair for you can take that tank with one precise shot. And people buying premium and getting premium tanks and planes is nowhere near unfair to anyone and it does not make them OP. And Gaijin just added a new system for Warbonds. You can buy premium tanks with them! And the warbonds are earned for completing challenges.Without a doubt is this game one of the all time best games. Never have I seen a game like this before this game came out. And yes for a long time I did not even know about this game. I started playing war thunder when tanks were newish. But this game has great potential that is still hasn't lived up to. But I am not saying this game is not good. It is excellent. It is extremly good but it can still be better. And that is what Gaijin is trying to do now.EDIT- Ok so i was just looking through the reviews again. And I see that most of the negative reviews are people who have played the game for over 500 hours. I see why they don't like the game. They need to take a break from playing it. Playing too much of something can really make you bored of it. And most of the negative reviews in there are probably from people being in one bad match then raging and reviewing the game bad.As I have been playing more, at 6.3 BR area, germans are just too over powered. Their guns have a super fast reload. Their guns are super powerful, They have a ton of armor, at time I wish I was facing russia instead of germany, And the tiger spam, gaijin please fix it.

												In the past I enjoyed so much this game but now the bad decicions of Gaijin are destroying the game.There are some cons of the game:- Bad matchmaking- Huge trophy: In the past you won surely Golden Battles Wagger. In the present Huge tropy gives you only test drive for 59min (crap) .  - Now they have pay to win tanks :First pay to win released - Its name ? IS-6. Surely there are coming a lot more pay to win tanks.- The german tanks was good in the past and now they are so bad.- Raising prices of buying vehicles:- Look this crazy example: Price of German Mig-15bis is $990000, Soviet Mig-15bis is now $1470000 (was $1750000, they lowered). The exact same jet has 2 prices. Yes Gaijin thinks user is stupid and make us to pay.- The sucessor of Soviet Mig-15bis is Mig-17 price was $990000. Less than Mig-15bis ($1750000). Gaijing then raises Mig-17 to 1750000 for getting the maximum profit and lowered Mig-15bis to $1470000. Thanks again to Gaijin for raising prices. - Raising prices of repairing tanks or airplanes:- Max repair cost of Tu-4 over $23000 ? You Gaijin are crazy?- The max repair cost of Tiger II (H) is now $8100. This tank was so good in the past and Gaijing turn this a crap. This high repair price for this bad tank that dies in the first shot in battle? StupidI'm so frustraded with this way that things going I have no words to expresse it.			",25,4,0,0,0,0,0

												It was great, I caught the rise of the russians in full glory.It was a struggle to get to the next panzer while getting shrapnelled or ignited by russians and americans, but after some updates the americans followed, and it was hell.Let me tell you why you shouldn't bother anymore:- Me and a friend got the game on the same night, he chose russian tanks, i chose german ones, he got to the IS-1 pretty fast and a week later I was able to get the Tiger H1. He got more kills and died harder(I know this was not my fault because in 1v1 it was pretty equal).-If you don't like the reds you're dead-Like American and German tanks?

												I do not recommend this game if you are going to download it to play ground forces, however, if you wish to play air forces, then I do recommend this game, as the air combat is sublime, and it every pilot shot down feels like an accomplishment based on skill. On the other hand, in ground forces, every tank destroyed is merely a lucky shot to the ammunition rack or a shot that hits the suspension and bounces upwards at a 90 degree angle, either destroying the cannon breech or fragmenting inside the tank, killing the crew. There are many things that need to be sorted out in this game before I will get more into ground forces. For example, the games are rigged, where the team with more russian tanks will always prevail over the other, as I find it near impossible to penetrate the front of a BT-5 or BT-7, and their 37mm cannon can always seem to penetrate the angled front armor of a M3 Stuart, regardless whether I am in diamond formation or not. I also noticed that my tank has been abandoned before due to the crew being killed, however most of these instances was a result of the loader being hit in the leg with a 20mm round, and the round didn't fragment, killing anyone else. Artillery shell shrapnel also seems to have the same penetration value as the shell itself, as if a shell lands near your tank, the shrapnel will shred through your armor like it is made of butter. There are many other things that need to be fixed, but the list is far too long. Air Forces 9/10. Ground Forces 5/10.			",55,4,0,5,9,0,11

												Played 500+ hours. It is a beautiful game, but it could be great! The russian tanks and planes are way to strong, unrealistically strong. The post WW2-tanks fighting the WW2 tanks is just silly. And also there the russian tanks are far to strong. No way that a standard T54 from the 50's could defeat a leopard 1 from the 60's that easy... It is a pity, because this game could potentially could kick World of Tanks's♥♥♥♥♥..I don't believe that the last update made things better either...			",150,8,3,12,25,1,47

												After all these hours in this game, I've found out there are many problems about this game from the russian bias to the BR compression. But, on top the that, the devs dont listen to the community. If you look on the reviews you will see everybody complaining about this game and the devs, but i'm here to upvote this game. I will say that I do not respect the devs whatsoever. This does not mean that this game is all bad. Some pros of this game would be the graphics. Its undeniable that the devs spend lots of time on the aircraft, ground vehicles, and maps on this game. Another reason is that this game isn't pay to win at all either. The devs also have a realistic damage model with important parts in planes and tanks (cooling systems, wing spars, even guns) which adds an interesting touch to combat. Some bad parts of this game : gaijin literally has down syndrome, russian bias, terrible brs, nerfing of americans and germans, and the list goes on.From a person who is in T5 German planes, T3 German tanks, and has spent about 100 dollars on this game.

												all mouse aimers are noobs. Theyve really turned this game into a World of tanks copy tier wise as well. High tiers only play with high tiers even in historical and simulator battles, which that shouldnt be because if they were historical they would have king tigers and me262's fighting weak allied vehicles. Also they have dumb cold war vehicles because allied technology blew, overall i wouldnt play the game its too boring now this is coming from someone with rank 5 jets and tanks			",115,2,5,12,13,1,21

												To anybody thinking of downloading this game for tanks; don'tthe game is okay for planes however tanks are extreemly painful to play. As germany and Britain you have to endure a ♥♥♥♥♥torm of terrible tanks to get to any good tanks and its an absolute farm to get anything worth your time. the game promises loads and gives you just rage, it makes you feel♥♥♥♥♥♥and inferior as you are constantly one shot when playing as skillful and playful as possible, landing all your shots and killing nothingan example of ""balenced gameplay"" Sherman firefly: battle rating of 5.0 61000 research required,the tank is made of butter and your 17pdr will go through anything but wont kill it KV 2: battle rating of 5.0 16000 or something research required, difficult to kill and a 152 which one shots anything.the game is tipped towards russia tremendously.apart from the horrific rage game this is its pretty and the sounds and terrain are done amazing, just a shame about everthing elseIf you ask me they should make a second warthunder where it is the same except against bots with teamplay and a campaign for each country. i would not mind paying like 30 quid for something like that with the standard WT multiplayer inbuild.To conclude if you are looking for tanks game this isnt the one if you want to have fun.i wont be playing this game until the devs make the game actually fun to play.

												Umpteen thousand hours of game time. Yea really.  Just did not do it through steam. Had to many issues that way. Game was much better stand alone.When the game first came to be - as most other negative comments state - it was a very fun game. Yet as time has passed I have to agree on the money factor. For one, a player should not get frustrated when playing a game. Granted I know people do. And yes I do as well. But, when it is a frequent emotion then ... well time to stop playing the game.Oh, the money factor. If you want to really advance fast just so you can get into a top level tank then spend the hard earned cash and buy your way to the top. The vehicle, the modules, even the crew can be taken all the way to the top with your money. But, when your premium tank is taken out with one shot from a player who barely has 45 hours into the game (yes that player is in a top level tank also cause he paid to play) and is in a lower tier tank that by normal physics that the rest of the world understands could never damage your high level vehicle ,,, well I told you that frustration happens way to often in this game.Now to catch my breath. So yes, if you are in a Soviet tank or aircraft, 8 out of 10 times you have the advantage.And yes, some joker can install the game and be a super star in 10 minutes if he / she wants to spend the money or add cheats to his / her game. Ganjin will never admit thier product is flawed - that means client side autobots -. And yes, if you bit** in chat or the forums you will get banned - no warning. However, I admit most of the time your post are just removed. Oh did I mention that money was a factor? Never use to be. But it is now. I use to have allot of fun with the game and some mates I met in the game. Sure we got mad at the crappy physics but the fun factor was well worth it. Then the changes came in 1.5 something and that all became obsolete. A new player could now install and be a pay to play superstar in minutes. Oh and yes, you can spend hours building your economy up, or so you thought. Then you look at your Silver Lion total and think WTF, where is my lions? Well you did not earn enough cause either the ammo was way to much for each round that actually did damage or your repairs cost so much that you went into the negative allot after each match. I chose to play German and American tanks. One cost way to much to repair but did good damage, the other was not to expensive to repair but the ammo was very expensive. ie. 10 rounds HEAP @ 320 lions per round = 3200. Now do that 3  times in one match.Well that is just the start and I will stop here, just be ready if you play the game. Do turn off all chat there is allot of insecure whiners in the game, and dont spend any real money. It really is not worth it any more.DCS 1.5 here I come. Oh snap, I have to buy a joystick.

												this game is for people who thought battlefield hardline was balanced . the battle rating system that they use for ""fair"" matchmaking is absolutely terrible. half the time your matched with people who have tanks 1-1.5 higher BR and you die instantly. not to mention that most of the russian tanks are ridiculously overpowered. and the a43 black prince is so broken it hurts. every single shot you land on the thing just bounces off. its unbalanced, frusterating, and the worst part is that its such an easy fix. but the devs are either too stupid or too lazy. the flying part isnt too bad but it has its issues as well. although altogether the flying is a much more enjoyable experience. last but not least its a pay to win/grind fest. and the premium system is terrible. heroes and generals does it too. just make premium a one time buy. nobody wants to have to subscribe to some BS that you have to pay for every month. edit:war thunder is still good game and has lots of potential to be a lot of fun. i like the concept of the game, and they do a lot right. at its current stage, the tank portion of the game has a few very large issues that makes gameplay a painful experience. i  hope that the devs will fix the balance issues at the very leastupdate: for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a noticeupdate:  for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a notice			",28,3,3,1,6,0,0

												AWWSOME GAME. handsdown this is a great game have nothing bad to say except for probly the key feature of an online game. server locations.... kinda crucial.  i have not been a die hard  fan i am just a casual player. though as everyone with any sense would now this refelcts 80% of most gaming communities, ( If you arn't getting payed to play your a casual)now i dont know the amount of players in my country being australia. but myself being on the best internet possible,( aus server 20- 50 ping) find this game frustrating with consistantly sitting on a 300 plus, put when ia activate premuim, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥its magic my ping is now under a 100 Dont expect to have any enjoyment factor out of top tier tanks, most trees, expecially german, are just filled with panthe variants, with no difference in stats just the name, also refective in the other countries, no italian tanks yet, or french. the game tank wise has hit a lull, with new tanks, being placed at the top end of the tree, but the research model is not reconfiged, just added. the late tier grind is so rediculous, even with premuim. dont spend gold eagles on converting that, pooled xp, it is well not worth it. awsome game, but the money, and time over leveling tanks and unlocking tanks, scheme set for this game is riduculous. premuim should be a one of purchase.get the game its free but dont spend any money its not worth it, go buy a carton, youll have more fun with that, $50 trying to play this game smashed, than you would sober, and rolling premuim.

												105mm howitzer can't kill a halftrack head on, lmao. This game is really bad and has no historical accuracy. nothing like watching a flakpanzer take out a sherman tank with spray and pray.realistic battles my A°$s. watching a MiG jetplane fighting a bunch of props is the dumbest junk ever. i feel bad for the people who actually spent money on this. but the reviews say it all.oh yeah and to the cuck mods who love watching their women get rammed by black bulls: you can inject sh°t into your d°ck with a syringe, catch aids, and then take a c°ck up the A°$s to prep the black bull since you love getting a creampie in your boipussi. have a terrible day, choke on your vodka or coffee whatever you drink, then fall face first into a cactus and die painfully from liver cancer, you stupid mitre wearing mongoloid slavsh°ts.Do you like fighting motherf*ckin' MiG29 jet planes that shoot you down with missiles while you're in a p26 wooden peashooter propeller plane? If so, then war thunder is for you. Enjoy as you watch your useless 7.62 machine gun fire slowly at a grounded YaK and do nothing after an entire belt of ammo. Then watch as the Yak farts exhaust fumes on takeoff that cause your engine to catch fire and explode into tiny flaming balls only to realize that you have no parachute.But wait, there's more! You may be thinking to yourself ""Maybe just the aviation sucks! I'll go play the tanks instead!"" and then you realize your in for a special kind of surprise when your tank flips over from grazing the corner of a tree. Then it randomly explodes.You start to get frustrated and then angrily drive at the enemy forces, all of which shoot you simultaneously and it causes your game client to crash, your video card to overheat, and then your processor to blow up and send motherboard shrapnel flying at your face, the results of which leave you blinded with impotent rage when your failures called team-mates fly into you on takeoff and then blame you for it. In Russian. Cyk*a ♥♥♥♥♥.WAR THUNDER YES			",16,0,0,1,0,0,0

												Hello all, I write this review with my personal experience. I loved this game, played it for a year. BUT, my account was frozen perma because SHARING your account is agaisnt their rules, I asked if I could change my email, because I had shared my account and wanted to make it safe. I mean c'mon, how is that minor rule worth a PERMA BAN?????????? I tried contacting their Game Masters for help with unfreezing it..... They have yet to respond even after 2 DAYS. Heres my review:PROS:+ Great flight models+ Good Graphics + Fun to play (in short bursts read more in cons)+ Jets are very fun.+ Multiplayer never gives me ping, never experienced a bug.CONS (Oh boy):- I can only play tanks on ultra low, and I just bought a new computer meant to run games with ease.- Battle Rating is utter crap, B-17s with jets???? Fw-190s placed in jet battles??? No thanks.- Staff takes forever to reach- p2w, I meant pay 2 progress.- Wheres Germanys Heavy Bombers??- B-29s, I have waited for 9 months, you released artwork for in months ago...- Alternate History.... WTF is this garbage???- Breaking a rule like sharing your account with a friend to test an plane of yours and contacting support will get you banned PERMA- Slow progression. If you want to prgress pretty much you have to buy it.- Premium aircarft so expensive. I bought the American Spitfire FL. IX, back in the 2000GE range, now its in the 6000GE range???Summary: It may look like aalot of cons, but I truly love this game. I wasted over $300 on that account that got banned.... I played this for a year, loved it. The game is overall good. I would recommend it. Just never tell gaijin you shared your account with a friend, the ban hammer is strong with this one.

												The diversity in the planes and ability to change a match by playing distinctively well while working with your team gives this game a great atmosphere. The beaty of the landscape as you go screaming by and blow a bunker up, showering the landscape with debris and a cloud of dust, is so satisfying. Your teammate will call out for cover as he goes on a bombing run, you see an enemy plane turning around to take him out as he descends, so you fly up on his♥♥♥♥♥and lay fire onto his tail, whether it be with MGs or cannons, and watching him try to roll away from you is extremely addicting. Put some holes in his wings and he can't escape your wrath. Update after update this game only gets to be more exciting.			",101,11,3,7,11,2,22

												Now this first part is and addition to my following review and is based on the current developments! Lately, more than before Gaijin has become very ignorant on the whished of the community and started implementing new vehicles/Matchmaking which virtually breaks the gameplay. They seem not primed on changing their very bad community support and forum moderators. The game is still fun on occation but the company really seemes set on to break the good experience for many players. If you dont beleieve me just go to Reddit or the more controlled forums and see what the playerbase is about. I will leave this preface to my review untill Gaijin moves in a direction which will benefit the game and the playerbase! I do like the game quite a lot, I came from WoT back in the day when tanks were announced as the more realistic damage model with internal components and no dedicated pool of health appealed to me... This is how I started to love planes! Comming for the tanks in closed beta it was inevitable to not fly planes and I got hooked fast, starting out with arcade and moving on to realistic and eventually staritng to enjoy Simulator with my HOTAS I bought.The game is facinating. With the amount of vehicles and ammo types it offers, once the initial flying and shooting for fun has reached a threshhold one can immerse one self in learning maneuvers, planes, tanks, ammo, and team-play this game really unlocks its potential and challenges me on multiple levels.As the game officially still is in open beta there is a lot of change happening and not all of that change is always good. Balancing and bugs just being the normal thing to see in games in general to sometimes more critically view decisions by the developers and the compulsive need of adding vehicles even though many current vehicles still suffer from imbalance or faulty fight models. To be fair though many of these issues are getting fixed after some time and as it theory still is bata I am able to accept it as part of the development.As many free to play titles, war thunder features an ingame shop to finance development, it includes cosmeticals, premium account, and premium vehicles. The latter adding planes that do not feel overpovered for me (as they use to be variants of non premium aircraft, or novelty vehicles with strengths and weaknesses). However there are a couple of nation crossover/captured planes which have gotten some critic as this decreases the nations variety and it has been observed that many of these planes sometimes get spammed into battles. Another big point seems to be the matchmaker and the battlerating system which workes in ""mysterious"" ways (as a lack for the actuall knowledge as how it works) matching both tanks and planes up against vehicles way beyont the fighting power (and time era) they actually fought in resulting an an explicit imbalance of power.   To make a little round-up for you guys that dont want to get stuck in a wall of text and points that I did not elaborate on:-Large variety of vehicles both ground and air (naval to come)-Three distinct game modes that make the game feel like three different once (arcade, realistic, and simulator) -Combined arms events where both planes and tanks can be used in the same battle-ingame store whith cosmeticals and veicles (vehicles seem balances but many crossover nation vehicles seem to blurr the lines between nations special appeal)-Big mata game and real life tactics to learn to improve gameplay -Currently Beta, bugs and dev. changes do not always resonate well in the community but on the big picture the game seems to work well and its fun and engaging to play-Battle rating and matchmaker seem to sometimes make unfair matches (to get in to a match there must be certain consessions to keep the waiting within acceptable limits, however an option for players that would rather wait longer time to get in to more balanced battles or 1 nation per team only battles could be nice)			",71,10,2,17,11,1,25

Posted: March 20, 2016
												Gaijin Read-This game used to be good. It still is without a doubt.War thunder boats, not satisfied, spaa on water, gj gaijin.Edit- As i go through the chat the only positive reviews i see are the ones where people have played 5 hours then thought to themselves...""Oh time to review this amazing game"".News flash this game died. Edit- Game is very lively again.EDIT- Yes my review stands at bad, but i have played it recently and it has some very good improvments. I'm not one of those people that will judge it for it being historically wrong, and yes im still waiting for ships...but that is beside the point, I would recommend this game to some...but not to everyone.It is a good game overall, but as i said before review remains bad. The devs are nowhere near as money hungry as Wargaming devs. Vehicles are super easy to unlock and you dont have to research every modification just to get the next one. You are not pushed to use money is this as I feel I have to in World of etc....Yes get this game and see what you think about it, don't judge the game by other people's reviews and find out for yourself this game's true potential.Edit- I am reviewing this game with a thumbs up. I dont judge this game for it's historical accuracy, if you want to ruin games for yourself by judging them like that go ahead. But i reccomend just enjoying the game and having as much fun as possible. Don't forget to lose yourself in the designs of these tanks. Yet again overall I love this game and super easy to unlock next tier of vehicles. Try it out.EDIT- Now War Thunder has the first version of ships for us to test!!!! This game is going to be the perfect mix of Air, Land, and Sea combat and i am so excited to see what they have in store for us next. I STRONGLY reccommend this game to anyone that is a fan of realistic warfare. And Gaijin if you see this review I would like to know when ships are EST. to be on the tech trees. Please and Thank You.EDIT- So I was looking into the ship deal....and all i saw were wooden ships...this is mainly a WW2 era. What do wooden ships have to do with that in any way. I really hope the wooden ship deal is just for testing only and they will come out with proper WW2 era ships.EDIT- Ok so I hope that it is just an April fools joke on the wooden ships and they actually come out with real ships that were dated in WW2 times.EDIT- So alot of people out there are complaining about this wonderful game. But did you know Gaijin are working on another game as you read this. It is another free to play MMO of course but it is a mix between robocraft and Mad Max and I think it looks wonderful so far. But since they are working on 2 games at once maybe 3 if they still work on star conflict. They can't do everything at once. But since they are working on these 2 games at the same time they can only do so much to satisfy everyone. Be happy with what the game devs have now and play with that until they come out with more. Be positive, negativity only ruins everything for everyone. Keep playing and having fun, ;)EDIT- (Message to Gaijin)- My email is Fizbeminecraft@gmail.com and I would be honored to be let into Crossout.Contact me and maybe I will even record it and post it to youtube. But I dont have proper recording equipment so :| . But I can get a free recording software until I can scrounge up enough money to get a proper recording software. I already have a mic (Headset). But im not pushing this on you. I am just saying I would be very grateful if you would let me in the closed beta.EDIT- So I was going through the comments and reviews and I am seeing people saying that the matchmaking is unfair. Ever since i started playing this game I found out that it does not matter what tank or plane you are taking on it is all fair for you can take that tank with one precise shot. And people buying premium and getting premium tanks and planes is nowhere near unfair to anyone and it does not make them OP. And Gaijin just added a new system for Warbonds. You can buy premium tanks with them! And the warbonds are earned for completing challenges.Without a doubt is this game one of the all time best games. Never have I seen a game like this before this game came out. And yes for a long time I did not even know about this game. I started playing war thunder when tanks were newish. But this game has great potential that is still hasn't lived up to. But I am not saying this game is not good. It is excellent. It is extremly good but it can still be better. And that is what Gaijin is trying to do now.EDIT- Ok so i was just looking through the reviews again. And I see that most of the negative reviews are people who have played the game for over 500 hours. I see why they don't like the game. They need to take a break from playing it. Playing too much of something can really make you bored of it. And most of the negative reviews in there are probably from people being in one bad match then raging and reviewing the game bad.As I have been playing more, at 6.3 BR area, germans are just too over powered. Their guns have a super fast reload. Their guns are super powerful, They have a ton of armor, at time I wish I was facing russia instead of germany, And the tiger spam, gaijin please fix it.

												I do not recommend this game if you are going to download it to play ground forces, however, if you wish to play air forces, then I do recommend this game, as the air combat is sublime, and it every pilot shot down feels like an accomplishment based on skill. On the other hand, in ground forces, every tank destroyed is merely a lucky shot to the ammunition rack or a shot that hits the suspension and bounces upwards at a 90 degree angle, either destroying the cannon breech or fragmenting inside the tank, killing the crew. There are many things that need to be sorted out in this game before I will get more into ground forces. For example, the games are rigged, where the team with more russian tanks will always prevail over the other, as I find it near impossible to penetrate the front of a BT-5 or BT-7, and their 37mm cannon can always seem to penetrate the angled front armor of a M3 Stuart, regardless whether I am in diamond formation or not. I also noticed that my tank has been abandoned before due to the crew being killed, however most of these instances was a result of the loader being hit in the leg with a 20mm round, and the round didn't fragment, killing anyone else. Artillery shell shrapnel also seems to have the same penetration value as the shell itself, as if a shell lands near your tank, the shrapnel will shred through your armor like it is made of butter. There are many other things that need to be fixed, but the list is far too long. Air Forces 9/10. Ground Forces 5/10.			",55,4,0,5,9,0,11

												I'd recommend War Thunder too anyone who likes to take at least a little ownership over their weapons of war because you can add different decals to any plane in the game and that level of ownership makes it feel more like the plane is in fact yours. It's just a great addition to the emmersion of the title.

												War Thunder is an enjoyable WWII based aircraft (and now tank) combat game, which I highly recommend to anyone with spare herddrive space, however, it does have more than it's share of problems, which sometimes seem to crop up faster than the fixes. Never the less, it works as a game for all types of gamers. Want to screw around in a more relaxed mode? Try arcade. Want a total flight and combat simulator? Give the aptly named simulator mode a go. Want something in between? Realistic's got you covered.It has an extensive list of planes and tanks, which are almost all of which are available to gain without spending a single dollar, and pleanty of premium content, for those who aren't afraid to fork out a few dollars. It also contains a large collection of maps in which you can fly said vehicles, and events for those who want to play in (close to) real history.Like I said earlier, I highly recommend this game which, considering it's free to play, is absolutely phenominal. (and if you're obsessed with good graphics, this game even has you covered in that department)			",32,1,1,5,7,0,3

												I've been through a lot with this game. I've played it through and through, I've got almost every single vehicle I want, and I still come back daily. I never liked Tier I. It's abysmal. But getting past it to real monoplanes and tanks that feature 'armor' is so worth it in my opinion. There's a lot of BS in this game when it comes to you getting rekt from 1400 meters by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ defilade behind a hill you could never have expected to see, but you learn. You get better. You form relationships with vehicles. As for Gaijin itself, I think they've worked very hard to make the game better, and I honestly think they've succeeded. The grind is long, especially for tanks, but the game as far as quality-of-life goes, is as good as it's ever been. I think it's worth the dive. It's an absolute joy to be able to fight in your grandpappy's war machine.			",176,18,11,24,44,6,46

That is the only problem I will ever have with this game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ free to play model. If you dont spend money it'll still be a good experience but I can tell you right now. Do not plan on getting tier 5 planes without spending money. It'll take an eternity. Spend your money on a premium account and enjoy.			",147,3,5,8,11,0,7

												War Thunder is an enjoyable WWII based aircraft (and now tank) combat game, which I highly recommend to anyone with spare herddrive space, however, it does have more than it's share of problems, which sometimes seem to crop up faster than the fixes. Never the less, it works as a game for all types of gamers. Want to screw around in a more relaxed mode? Try arcade. Want a total flight and combat simulator? Give the aptly named simulator mode a go. Want something in between? Realistic's got you covered.It has an extensive list of planes and tanks, which are almost all of which are available to gain without spending a single dollar, and pleanty of premium content, for those who aren't afraid to fork out a few dollars. It also contains a large collection of maps in which you can fly said vehicles, and events for those who want to play in (close to) real history.Like I said earlier, I highly recommend this game which, considering it's free to play, is absolutely phenominal. (and if you're obsessed with good graphics, this game even has you covered in that department)			",32,1,1,5,7,0,3

												   War Thunder is an ok game, but was a fantastic title from Gaijin in the past year. I joined the community in patch 1.25, and I must say that it was a splendid experience. Now, it seems like everything is all packed up like boxes, and that makes it boring.With the addition of tanks though, I sort of felt that nostalgic feeling of playing a ""new"" game, fresh from scratch. Yes, I was a CBT Tester, but not for a very long time, and I kind of think that in CBT everything was nice and smooth because there weren't so many players (propably), and they were (sometimes) more skilled than newcomers that gained access to the OBT Test.   To conclude, War Thunder is still an ok game, but if Gaijin starts screwing around like messing up the MatchMaking system, I will stop recommending this game to people, unless they bring back the 20 Tiers, or at least make it 10 (We all know you ""copied the World of Tanks Matchmaker, but incorrectly, so fix it please).

												A fantastic game once you get past the Russian bias, occasionally strange balance issues, frequently strange matchmaking issues, awkward monetizations, (Paying ~$4 for a nation's flag to plaster all over your tanks in a horribly spectacular way,) vaguely pay-to-win mechanics (premium accounts give tremendous boosts over non-premium players,) and largely Russian server demographics. (Which wouldn't be noticed if it was viable to exclusively play on your region's server, but queue times are multiple minutes long in some cases, unless opening yourself up to joining in-progress games on all regions)The arcade mode appeals to casual players, realistic mode appeals to people with a lot of time on their hands, and simulator mode appeals to masochists!

												War Thunder is one of those games that ceases to get boring, no matter how much time you spent in it. Excellent combat, decent player rewards from the devs, constant sales, events, and updated, and the distant prospect of the Naval warfare portion of the game are all things to look forward to, and the depth of research put into the games is far superior to the other leading games of the genre.

												I don't always post reviews about games/gamers but this one will do1000/10This game is just badass. The first time you install the game, you would probably guess ""Oh this is gonna be like World of Tanks/World of Warplanes."" Well it's not, sure you get a choice to be in an arcade battle mode, but that doesn't stop you from having fun! Here's your three choices: Arcade Mode (For Beginners) Realistic Mode (For Intermidate/Advanced Players) and Simulator Battles (Advanced/Unicum Players). I (as I've played this game for 2 years) will reccommend this game to anyone who has a taste in Combat Flight Simulators/Tank Simulators. Trust me, you'll fall in love with the overall graphics and eye candy in this game. Trust me, I'm Russian.			",27,0,1,1,3,0,1

												I would like to start off this review by saying you will put money into this game, even though it is free to play, theres no way around it. You'll get addicted and want to grind through the tech trees as fast as you can by the time you reach teir 3,  so you decide to speed up the process and buy a steam pack.  (If you're going to buy one, get the Ace advanced pack, dont get the mustang pack.  I made that mistake and regret it, its not the Red Tails special.) After your premium account runs out, you think you've had a good run and will go back to the slow road.  3 days later you cant take the agonizing pain of countless games to get that one plane you dream about and you buy eagles for more premium days.  You finaly research all of the vehicles in the game and look back at your warthunder career, you get this sinking feeling that it was a waste of time and money, and wonder if it was worth it.  But then you remember that time you bombed a guy on the runway and he cursed you out.  Oh, it was so worth itAll jokes aside it is a very fun game, dont sink to much money into it though.

												After spending lots of time with this game, watching videos and the like, I will say that this is a good game. Much better if you can play with friends in a squad though. Admittedly , the grind to unlock higher tiered vehicles can become strenuous and a little repetitive (made easier with premium if you so choose), but if you're able to focus and REALLY try to become good at all stages of this game, then you can play this for HOURS on end. It's really satisfying when you know EXACTLY where and when to shoot to guarantee a kill, but that can only come with playing the game. Different countries' vehicles play differently so you can try out each to find the style that suits you best. And pretty much everyone will be able to find something that they will like.

												now my review of the game is that the game has some shiny bells and whisles but ive been playing war thunder almost along as the game has been out and the path gajin is taking with the game has been more on a downwards slope for a free to play game.  just one exemple would be the devauling of the gold currency and making the grind for items in game 4 to 5 times what it was but if your just getting the game u will not notice. but if your a hardcore flight sim player you will be dissapoint with the game in its current state, but alas this game is still in beta things could and hopefull change. but the censor ship that this company enforces on its forums or anything is redonkless , so any critzising or anything negitive even offering fixs  to the problem were shoved to the side but enough about that this is a great game if your just if your coming from a propeller head or  are a history junkie like me the game is lacking in its current state the game is still in beta but i hope this isnt the vision gijin has for this game but this is not a super well written review but just take to heart that if your just looking for a game to play is pretty great for a regular gamer and the games bell and whistle are nice and i have to give cuddos for the minimal pc parts needed to run the game but its free to play dont take my word for it just try it for yourself it is free to play but hopefull this review gets you an idea of what your getting			",23,1,0,2,2,0,4

												War Thunder is quite possibly the best WWII Combat simulator out there. It has stunning graphics, a vast variety of Planes to fly, and is a Great way to dive back into history for a few matches.That being said...-As with any free to play, you best be ready to grind the **** out of the game to unlock the later tier planes-There is some Russian bias (Gaijin is a Russian company) towards the Russian planes, they are much better in this game than they were historically-Ramming (The game has to have it, but it something that just hurts)-If you like bombers, don't even download this game. Bombers were nerfed, and because of that they can barely take a punch.-Planes with only MG's are essentially useless, as cannons are the primary punch.-Premium Planes are usually overpowered-Flight Models fo some planes (Esp in Arcade) match those of UFO's- If you are around the top of the leaderboards in a match that lasts about 10-15 minutes, you will most likely recieve around 1000 rp. Congratulations! You are already 1/320 done getting your new plane!-Did I mention there was a grind?-Tiers really don't matter in a matchmaking system reliant on battle rating (In other words, if you are flying 1 tier 3 plane, you will probably see a few late t4 planes in your match)-Premium players get 2x rp and lions per matchThis game has a lot of potential, but most of it is suffocated by the ""Pay for Advantage"" concept			",24,2,1,1,4,0,8

												EDIT: Bellow my new review  is the old review that is still quite valid.NEW REVIEWI quit playing this game a while back due to huge balancing issues, I cam back to the game with it being perfectly balanced, Tier 1 and 2 planes, I start getting quite good KD (like 6-0 or 5-1) And I start to see NO tier 1 planes, just Tier 3 and some Tier 2. But I have at this point almost unliked myself a tier 2 plane, I am quite excited as I will finally have a chance against the enemy planes again. I unlock it and, suddenly tier 4s and 3s everywhere, I understand putting someone with a kd of like 5-0 with more planes of a higher level but this is insane, I can't even stand a fighting chance, I get nearly instant killed and it takes several minutes of constant grinding to actually kill an enemy fighter, Love the controls great game, but 100% ruined by a lack of balance.OLD REVIEWI would like to reccomend the game. It is a lot of fun, but it has fatal game breaking flaws.(Aviation Based)First off the first four hours were great, my only deaths were an occasional pilot being kocked out or me crashing. Usually about 8-1 KD. Then after about rank four, top tier teir 2 planes are the only planes I fight against, my poor tier one plane cannot take out enemies who can be faster, turn better, and are better armed. Of course whenever I am about to kill one, my own team member swoops in and steals the kill. Now I get 2-3 KD with about 4-12 assists (and some ground targets). I see the occasional tier one plane, they usually are the kill stealers on my own team. Fun game, bad balancing ruins the fighting.PROS+easy+fun+minimal cheatersCONS-Unbalanced battles-Pay 2 win-Slow to progress (hours of grinding.)4/10 would be a 7/10 but the unbalanced battles take it down, because the games are frustrating rather than fun.

												I've been through a lot with this game. I've played it through and through, I've got almost every single vehicle I want, and I still come back daily. I never liked Tier I. It's abysmal. But getting past it to real monoplanes and tanks that feature 'armor' is so worth it in my opinion. There's a lot of BS in this game when it comes to you getting rekt from 1400 meters by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ defilade behind a hill you could never have expected to see, but you learn. You get better. You form relationships with vehicles. As for Gaijin itself, I think they've worked very hard to make the game better, and I honestly think they've succeeded. The grind is long, especially for tanks, but the game as far as quality-of-life goes, is as good as it's ever been. I think it's worth the dive. It's an absolute joy to be able to fight in your grandpappy's war machine.			",176,18,11,24,44,6,46

												It was good, at some point. Gaijin has slowly strayed from the sense that this game used to make, and now you see germans and russians fighting against the Japanese and Americans in RB battles. I wouldn't reccomend this game... Not to mention the grind is so unreal now. I have twice as many hours on this game on my other account and I've seriously put a lot of money into this game just to get ahead. It's just becoming unbalanced and starting to fall to pieces... WT doesn't feel like it used to.			",91,4,3,6,7,0,16

												Game is great but: The mechanics of the game are great with options for upgrading crews, parts and the variety of vehicles, however you'll always be behind the curve - when you finally have a decent tank your matches are sent to the next tier where tactics take a backseat to these one-shot-your-dead adversaries			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good game.I'd however like to see Realistic battles with airstarts and multiple planes. Basicly Arcade, but with realistic flightmodels et cetera.----------The russian bias in this game is strong. If you don't drive a Lada and drink vodka, you won't enjoy it m8.There's such few players playing bombers in Arcade.Broken Battleratings (Ex on the Japanese tree you go from like a 3.0BR to a 4.3BR, making all your other planes♥♥♥♥♥♥.)The trees also gets very grindy VERY quickly. You may only need 5k-15k RP per plane for a good time, then suddenly you need 30K, 50K, and then 120K. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing wall you suddenly hit.----If the game was proper, it'd easily be a 7-8/10 from me.I'm gonna say it's 4/10 right now. if you wanna play Russian & spend cash to speed up the grind, about 4½/10..

												This game is great for beginners. Simple, fun, enraging. Not alot of pay-2-win types on the earlier levels. Then around tier 2, also known as Battle Rating, the modes change to something horrendous. The most broken, time consuming ""air domination"" where even with 10 friendlies and only 1 enemy, they can win by having altitude control? Then there's domination - where you land your plane (or fly low with gear out) over hostile territory and get shot down by 30 planes plus ground units. So dumb, useless, and annoying. Once you get higher though, you can choose to pay for better campaign access (through planes), or continue forever selecting low level planes and hope other experienced players don't do the same. Game is cute, interesting, and broken as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I've invested the time. Even got my friends hooked. We all hate it. Find a different game, or do what I did. Invest 10-15 free hours and move on.ALSO, the developers and mods are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm sure you've heard that. Got perma muted for roleplaying. No warning, didn't even tell me. Had to find other players with that issue.			",83,10,0,15,2,0,3

												Don't let the ""time played"" fool you, was playing this long before it came out on Steam.I'm afraid i'm going to have to agree with everyone else here, the latest patch has taken one of the best f2p MMO's on the market, and turned it into one of the worst p2w MMO's to date.Should of seen this coming as they did exactly the same thing with their previous title ""Star Conflict"". The core of the game still exists though, the flight mechanics are awesome, and the action is breath taking, but its the new leveling system that's c0mpletley ruined any chance of this game ever showing its head from the swampy bog of fail that is F2P models.Thumbs down Gaijin, thumbs down.. I'm sure your servers will be nice and stable now, due to the lack of players.			",271,35,7,22,36,4,23

												As you can see i have a decent amount of time in this game, for quite a while i loved this game, and in fact i stopped playing WoT for a while, a game which i have thousands of hours in.Now you can scream that im just garbage for what im about to say, but its the truth.Russian bias, broken physics, broken economy, gitchy and buggy updates, and pay to do anything.Russian tanks are the only thing youre ever afraid of of, im an American player, and in air combat, it was brits and ruskies, on ground, it was ruskies, and now i hear its the brits to.My dad also played this game, and he mained russians, i would get good preformance when i got onto his profile almost every battle, and most tanks couldnt pen me, i would one shot everything.    Now on to the P2P aspect, it takes forever to do anything, almost everything in the game takes grinding to unlock, and its not easy grinds either, its long, hard, tedious♥♥♥♥♥♥ or you can pay gold for it right away.there are numerous tanks that are premium, and not like in WoT, like, ALOT OF THEM are premium. when it comes down to non premium tanks, most are the same as the previous tanks, just with a better gun or some stupid tedious♥♥♥♥♥♥that makes you want to buy your way through the line.    the physics in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, shots disapear, shots that should pen dont pen, and shots that shouldnt do. tanks fly around, unrealistic damage models, shrapnel from shots are ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, everyhing about the physics in this game, are ♥♥♥♥ing broken, unless youre a russian, and then you get that russian bias plus and you one shot everything bounces off of you.some guy went into the game files and found♥♥♥♥♥♥that showed the ammo from russsian guns and the russian armor is far better than it should be.    Finally the economy, things cost way to much to research and buy for what they are, a slightly updated model of the last tank is what it is 9 times out of 10. You also make so little money and Exp per battle its ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, unless you have premium in which case its something that i can deal with.  It seems that everytime they update this game its got new bugs or glitches, its almost like they dont even ♥♥♥♥ing care and they throw the♥♥♥♥♥♥to the general public before even fixing them, and most of the time these issues go unchecked until the next big update, if ever.   There is also a toxic♥♥♥♥♥comunity, as is with most games.         As an after thought I think i should mention what the mentality of each nations player base seems to be.      with the Americans youve got people who expect their machines to be the best (cuz muh murica burger tank best tank), or at the very least preform the way they should, but nope, you get unangled tiger ones bouncing 90mm shells, the same with the panther.         Germans are all wheraboos who think theyre  lone tiger aces and that theyre some kind of hero of the third reich, theyre wrong, they get out flanked and ♥♥♥♥ed hard because theyre using their tanks improperly. at higher teirs youll see germans sniping in tiger 2s, which is the most infuriationg thing in the ♥♥♥♥ing world. you should also note that from teir 3 up they will somehow sneak around all of you and sit at your spawn and think theyre good players.         Russians are generally commie scum who are under the assumtion that their T34 is the best tank ever and that it never failed. in the game this belief seems to be true as theyre invinsible despite the fact that they should get stomped by the tanks they see at times. no joke, my jackson will consistantly bounce off the T3485 no matter where i shoot it, and the M6 and hellcat bounce shells off the early T34 tanks no matter where they get shot.         i cant really say what people are like in planes, because i ♥♥♥♥ing hate the things, but i imagine it translates over the same way.DONT GET THIS GAME			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Extreamly time consuming game, which wouldnt be bad but it is mainly made that way to ""encourage"" buying vehicles with real money that not only have significant experience boosts but also, in some cases, are blantly imbalanced and overpovered (currently Calliope, a premium US tank with enough missles to kill everyone else five times over). I dont like playing a game that claims to be F2P but only if you are willing to spend hundreds of hours over a paying player to get anywhere close to end game. I plaid some MMO's bvefore that were less grindy than this game, and a lot of the times you start the grind blindfolded with your hands tied behind your back. To repair your damaged tank during battle you have to first reaserch ""parts"" that, depending on the machine, can take several games. Sufficient to say that a strey bullet or artillery shell exploding nearby might damage your engine for instance, now you wont be able to repair it without the said parts, so have fun sitting in a broken tank untill someone mrecifully finishes you off. Did I mention that premium vehicles have most upgrades unlocked automatically? This might be a fun F2P game but I dont think it's worth the enormus amounts of time required to do anything that way and with the current balancing issues and russian favoritism I dont really feel like spending money on it. I kind of wish now I could get all those hours back and play something fun that is actually F2P instead of getting one tier 3 tank after playing way over 100 battles.			",95,25,0,24,7,0,27

												I'd recommend War Thunder too anyone who likes to take at least a little ownership over their weapons of war because you can add different decals to any plane in the game and that level of ownership makes it feel more like the plane is in fact yours. It's just a great addition to the emmersion of the title. ADDED 7/25/2014: Even more awesome with tanks added in i cant wait to get plane versus tank battles in arcade because i have a mouse and the plane flies all wacky in the realistic mode.

												War Thunder is an enjoyable WWII based aircraft (and now tank) combat game, which I highly recommend to anyone with spare herddrive space, however, it does have more than it's share of problems, which sometimes seem to crop up faster than the fixes. Never the less, it works as a game for all types of gamers. Want to screw around in a more relaxed mode? Try arcade. Want a total flight and combat simulator? Give the aptly named simulator mode a go. Want something in between? Realistic's got you covered.It has an extensive list of planes and tanks, which are almost all of which are available to gain without spending a single dollar, and pleanty of premium content, for those who aren't afraid to fork out a few dollars. It also contains a large collection of maps in which you can fly said vehicles, and events for those who want to play in (close to) real history.Like I said earlier, I highly recommend this game which, considering it's free to play, is absolutely phenominal. (and if you're obsessed with good graphics, this game even has you covered in that department)			",32,1,1,5,7,0,3

The bugs in this game are incredibly annoying, such as random ricochets even though the surface is slightly sloped( a jagpanther who was directly infront of me bounced my almost point blank 122mm IS-2 round which is more than capable of penetrating its armor). Not to mention the broken BR system that is horribly outdated, you have WW2 era tanks facing off against Cold War Era tanks that have cHEAT AMMO.

Posted: September 17, 2016
												It's garbage... Just full of cheaters and broken game balance ideas. I have be a ton of hours into this game, I love WW2 history and the tanks which is why I started this game. At first it wasn't so bad but with the updates and figuring out how thing work I have to admit this is a garbage game now. The main game mechanic/gmaeplay issue that just ruins the game is the air planes. Now any half whit knows a tank can not fight a plane given that it is a ground unit where as a plane was designed for air combat and strafing/bombing of ground unit deppending on the type of plane. Realistically in war the planes rely ground forces to radio in the positions of the enemy to them but war thunder thinks that all the ground units for both sides should be marked with big name tags. This kills balance once someone gets into a bomber since you literally can not hide and the person will just drop the bombs about where you will try to run from said bombs. And no ally players in fighters do not go for bombers they strafe and suicide on enemy tanks for easy kills. Also SPAA is by no means a true threat to bombers or fighters since most are either killed by tanks or bombed themselves. This is not some much the issue in sim battles since all the hud stuff is removed so you are not constantly spotted for the planes forcing them to actively look for targets and in sim and realistic not everyone is given the chance at a bomber run. How ever sim mode is very challenging and takes some practice to get used to and ultimately not that fun to new players or most players for that matter so long que times for that mode. And realistic (I roll my eyes at that title for the mode) is not that great either since the enemy planes still have everyone spotted and they have the added bonus of being able to land and re arm in a game mode that makes it even harder for SPAA to hit them so they are effectly useless as a reliable counter to them. Lastly you have arcade mode the mode everyone starts with, everyone gets a chance at a bomber run so basicly everyone gets a bomber at some point but thats only a help if you can fly them. You are constantly spotted for the bombers SPAA are normally bombed first so they are pointless and no one really plays it since they don't lead to fun tanks down the line. This pattern of being killed three times in a row by bombers or seal clubbers just drives new players away pretty quickly I have to say and is not at all balanced since you don't see any player controlled tanks in the plane arcade battles since the game dev's know it would be pointless since they couldn't do anything anyway. Lastly is the cheaters, oh the cheaters... Aimbots, armor mods, ammo mods... You can and will run into one guy with am aimbot or an ammo mod at some point in every game. That alone can ruin a game but oddly enough its not as bad as the afore mentioned planes. It is still an issue though when you are shot through a hill and the round bounces perfectly around the cab of the tank hitting all your crew in one insane trip in the tank. Or you are hit and the shrapnel only hits your crew like it is homing in on them. Well it is, there are a few mods than alter the workings of the rng of the crew meating hot metal mechanics. Nothing is ever done about it though. All in all it has some fun bits like seeing WW2 tanks lumbering about fireing at stuff but with the planes and dev's lack of giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the players cheating I would strongly reccomend you pass on this garbage.

												Love the whole concept of the game, that sure is great and the graphics are lovley. The one reason I dont recommend this game is simple, it is  so unbalanced. Russian planes and tanks will out gun and out tank any other vehicle. Some people who live in denial will rage and not agree but it is the truth and it brings the whole game down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game if you can get it to download. I'll never understand why companies use their own 3rd party launchers instead of just updating through Steam. Literally on my 5th try now, the launcher just stops at ""Preparing to download"" randomly and you have to close it to get it to start downloading again, which normally wouldn't be an issue except it doesn't close when you close it, the process continues to run. So you have to use the task manager to actually close it.Decent gameplay, technically a mess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The developers claim that this is a ""free-to-play"" game but after the most recent update, awards have been adjusted to the point where it is impossible to play for free & make enough ""lions"" in games to repair your vehicles. Glitches galore and since it's based in Russia, they pretty much turn a blind eye to hackers and cheats if they're in Russia or Europe. There are better multi-player war games out there, I'd keep looking if I were you, I certainly am....			",3,0,0,0,0,0,2

												War thunder used to be good, back in 1.29-1.35. now War thunder in an RNG fest that takes the fun out of flying! A single round will take your wing off, in any plane if it is a gunner. In the last 100 or so matches of HB, i have not been able to land a plane with dammage, mostly because if you get hit you die. Weather it is your wing getting clipped or your plane turning into the reincarnation of berlin burning in 1945, you will not be able to land your aircraft. War thunder past 1.35 was a mistake. Its a shame, really, that such a fun game tunred into what it is today.			",36,3,7,0,10,0,3

												I keep wanting to like this game, but it's gotten worse and worse over the updates. I've looked through the messages log and for every win my team gets, I'm placed on a team that ends of losing between 7 to 10 times in row. There's no way the teams or maps are balanced. Even if I'm totally a bad player, I'm only 1 of 15 people on the team. It's statistically impossible for me to keep getting placed on so many poor teams, so there must be some other factor. There's simply no fun any longer when playing is just one beating after another so many times in a row.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No. Not this game. 350 hours played and nothing but frustraytion. Balance once you're out of tier 1 is joke especially with American tanks. Want historical accuracy? Well! You got it. One of the most broken tank, T-34, is broken in alll aspect compared to reality. Ever see a T-34 bounce an APDS from the Conqueror? This game literally says ♥♥♥♥ You to players with non-russian vehicle.Also Gaijin seems to release new contents A LOT, but misses out on fixing current balance and bugs currently ingame. Things that exist years ago are not fixed. Not to mention their horrible server. In Battle.net I get 50 pings playing in American server from Asia. In War Thunder I get 100 ping playing in Asain server.I can keep ranting for a lot longer, but this is enough.			",7,0,0,0,1,0,0

												After almost 400 hours of this game I finally decided to uninstall it. Obviously it isn't a horrible game, it's just got so many problems that I can't bear with them anymore. This game has so many problems that it is hard to fully appreciate it, which I really hate because it could be such a good game.Pros:*The artwork done on this game is just brilliant. I love how the maps and tanks look, and the little details they have put into everything.*The sheer number of different tanks and airplanes you can drive is so large that it takes tens of hours just to try out them all, and that is after you've finally unlocked them.*The details you can add to your tanks and the customization you can do is pretty sweet.*If you don't think of it as a realistic WWII simulator, the concept of the game is pretty good.*There are few pay-to-win elements to this game, except for a couple of tanks which are just broken.Cons:*The game is pretty buggy. Sometimes your shots will just dissapear somewhere between your tanks and the enemy tank, and even though you can see your bullet hitting the enemy tank the game gives you no info on what happened like it usually does.*The balancing of the game is just horrible. The maps are not balanced, the teams are not balanced, the different nations are not balanced, and so on. On most maps one side has a huge advantage over the other. In many matches one team totally dominates the other, and there it is clear from the start what team will win. This would be an even bigger problem if the teams were not as unbalanced.*The rating system of the game is broken. If you have a new unupgraded tank and meet a tank of a whole rating higher than you, you might as well just quit the game and rejoin later. This is especially true from 5.3 and higher ratings. An unupgraded tank and a fully upgraded tank should really not be the same rating.*Ratings are readjusted way too slow. When new tanks are added, it takes way too long before they get a new, more fitting rating.*Once your team is loosing it is very hard to regain the advantage because the enemy will have the points for artillery and airplanes, and they will often get all the advantage points, making it very hard to push for the capture zones.*Too many maps more or less completely without cover.

												Any one who loves aircraft and dogfighting, or has a passing knowledge of tank warfare between 1936-1960s will love this. Lots of tanks and aircraft. But ultimately the game gets boring due to the very long grinds.You start with nerfed vehicles and need to play to unlock more efficient ammo, airframes, crew etc via game play. Meantime you are often facing players with fully upgraded tanks or aircraft in the same tier so are going to have a pretty miserable time of it. In the lower levels you can get upgrades fairly regularly but when you start getting to the really interesting aircraft like Lancasters, B17s, Me262s, Tiger tanks and JS2s and 3s you are in for a very long and boring grind. Hours and days can be spent just to unlock a little extra performance so you can maybe get an edge over others. In the end you realize you have put many 100s of hours in on it. Then there are the maps. There are VERY few of them. You rehash the same scenarios again and again and again. This is where the game can really be improved. More maps please. A campaign system that travels across Europe or the Pacific would be very nice, but instead its the same old repetitious maps that are tiny compared to something like Skyrim.Victory Scenarios: battles are usually revolving around who destroys the oppositions ground units faster. Fighters can't. Bombers can...and usually this means flying British heavies or American B17s like fighter bombers. When a scenario requires hitting factories there is no bomber stream or formation...you are all alone against swarms of fighters. Very unrealistic. The few capture the flag scenarios for fighters pop up randomly so if you have already selected your normal all bomber squad expecting the usual bomb AFV or bomb base scenarios, you are stuck with totally inappropriate aircraft. A briefing before the scenario starts would certainly help with selecting whether you want to field bombers or fighters.Realism: For land battles there are no infantry....so urban combat is totally unrealistic. For Air battles 4 engine heavies doing dive bombing runs totally counter to all the realism built into the combat models,Would I recommend it? Its a yes/no answer. Sucked up a lot of my time. I love the vehicles from this era however I keep thinking it is a shell of what it could be. There are ways of randomising terrain. There are ways of better balancing teams. There are ways to put in a meaningful campaign. So ultimately I have very mixed feelings. The other thing is I am not a memember of any squad so maybe that makes me feel its a fairly hollow game. Kudos to the developers for the beautiful aircraft and tank models. In conclusion: play it casually. Play the lower tiers as these are lots of fun. If you play AFVs play realistic...its tougher but more satisfying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I reached the 1,000 hour club, I think I know enough to review this game. Pros: Looks fantastic, feels realistic, great engine, tons of vehicles. Cons: TERRIBLE balance (mainly in tanks), Pay to win bush camo, massive grind fest (tanks), smallish player base (mainly planes), questionable balance and design decisions (such as crew lock). Overwall the game is great, but there are so many flaws under the surface the really hold it back. Its not really worth getting invlovled in, unless you are a hard core plane and tank person.

												A fun game to waste some time in with good plane simulation of WWII. You can be any faction and the planes stretch from early WWI planes to cold war era jets. However, the time to grind your way to jets or even the WWII classics is really, really long. This is kinda of expected for a free to pay game and you hit the pay wall pretty quickly. Understandable, but annoying when you cannot pay a one time cost to unlock everything. For the ludicrous amount of time you have to invest for some really cool stuff I have to not recommend it past the first few hours flying your crate.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have 530 hours at the time of posting this and highly recommed it to anyone looking for a good WWII tank/plane game. While War Thunder does have its issues (such as a broken BR system, excessive grinding, the occasional invisible tank, etc.) it is one of the best WWII vehicle games out there. The individual modules are coded into the vehicle and can be damaged causing performance issues on your vehicles, crew can be killed which will either render your vehicle combat ineffective or lower the performance of yor vehicle. Both things which many other games similar to War Thunder lack. With the newest update, Firestorm, premium British tanks were added meaning that only Japanese tanks remain untill all five nations (US, Germany, USSR, Britian, Japan) have both planes and tanks. After which we can only hope that Gaijin will implement naval trees into the nations (The W in the War Thunder logo has a battleship gun in it so it is probably a safe assumption that ships will be added eventually). After that infantry could be implemented and this game would be CRAZY AWESOME. But I digress. In its current state War Thunder is thousands of hours of fun as with 530 hours played and a premium accounts activated for all of those hours (premium account = double RP boost) I still don't even have half of the available vehicles. If grinding ins't for you there is an option to buy Golden Eagles, the premium currency, and boost through research which does help with some of the more dull parts to the game. Another bonus is how well the game runs, even on low performing rigs. Overall I would give War Thunder between an 8.5 and a 9 out of 10 and would highly advise you to play, it has a steep learning curve that is dealth with by implementing arcade, realistic, and simulator modes, so don't worry about skill level, it will all come with time. Hope this helped. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But moving up teirs, past teir 2 gets really slow really fast. When I started playing it was an OK speed to get to your next new vehicle, but they slowed it to a crawl shortly after that in a patch...I have a lot of gripes with the game, at this point I would not recomend it at all.

I ran into one with my Spitfire Mark IIa and it looked like there wasnt a scratch on it. Well ♥♥♥♥. Planes other than russian might as well be made of tissue paper and be flimsy as ♥♥♥♥. The forums are bad too. Any complaint is quickly shot down by loyal fanboy moderators ( probobly russsians being paid in vodka and potatoes). They deny any historical accuracy by saying its Western Propeganda or some♥♥♥♥♥♥and never give other countries aircraft and tanks whats due. I find it harder to find a channel actually giving a ♥♥♥♥ about this game(ive looked beyond jingles too even though he has the rare WT vid from time to time). TL;DR: Run. Just run. dont even think about downloading this game if you have a brain. If youre a russian. PLAY THIS GAME AND DRINK ALL THE VODKA YOU WANT!			",19,2,0,6,2,0,1

												It was good, at some point. Gaijin has slowly strayed from the sense that this game used to make, and now you see germans and russians fighting against the Japanese and Americans in RB battles. I wouldn't reccomend this game... Not to mention the grind is so unreal now. I have twice as many hours on this game on my other account and I've seriously put a lot of money into this game just to get ahead. It's just becoming unbalanced and starting to fall to pieces... WT doesn't feel like it used to.			",91,4,3,6,7,0,16

												Game is great but: The mechanics of the game are great with options for upgrading crews, parts and the variety of vehicles, however you'll always be behind the curve - when you finally have a decent tank your matches are sent to the next tier where tactics take a backseat to these one-shot-your-dead adversaries			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty good game.I'd however like to see Realistic battles with airstarts and multiple planes. Basicly Arcade, but with realistic flightmodels et cetera.----------The russian bias in this game is strong. If you don't drive a Lada and drink vodka, you won't enjoy it m8.There's such few players playing bombers in Arcade.Broken Battleratings (Ex on the Japanese tree you go from like a 3.0BR to a 4.3BR, making all your other planes♥♥♥♥♥♥.)The trees also gets very grindy VERY quickly. You may only need 5k-15k RP per plane for a good time, then suddenly you need 30K, 50K, and then 120K. It's a ♥♥♥♥ing wall you suddenly hit.----If the game was proper, it'd easily be a 7-8/10 from me.I'm gonna say it's 4/10 right now. if you wanna play Russian & spend cash to speed up the grind, about 4½/10..

												For a realistic mode ground forces player, this game is awful. Gaijin have a fantastic concept with tank module damage modeling and I really wish someone more competent (/less of a prick) had picked up on the idea. The spawn system causes players who get eliminated early before they have a chance to do something (which is a very real possibility in this game) to be completely removed from the match, while players who 'earn' their spawns by fighting and killing are allowed to respawn should they die later. That means that almost every single match is decided by which team got more initial kills, and losses are then compounded.This is a game where the poor get poorer.If you wanna fly aircraft, go for it, but the tanks are pure♥♥♥♥♥			",34,4,0,2,3,1,1

												I didn't play for long. Maybe it was a newbie mistake but I thought that this game had teams. Supposedly it does. Blue, Red and a few Greens. I was on the Blue *ahem* Team. I mentioned that one specific player on the opposite team had singled me out a few times. No reponse unless you count a bunch nonsensical letters.I might play again. Then again, maybe not. Got a few good shots in though.UPDATE: I did the airplane fight first. That was where I was singled out. Almost every time.Returned to try the tank fight. Interesting. But still wouldn't recommend this game. I have my reasons which I will not state here.Now, while this is a free to play game, I think too many people are complaining that in order to run a great fight you need to buy certain packets. Well, I think that you can probably get pretty far if you work hard at the game. And have patience. If not, then buy the packets. Stop whining about that. There are other games where you have to sit through advertisements. Why? That is how the devs/companies make money. So this company has a more direct approach. The prices may be a little steep for some, like me, who can't afford to buy even a little packet ($9.99). But, hey, that is their right.			",7,3,0,1,2,0,1

												Your game is extremely flawed.Maybe you guys should figure out how to place people in the correct tier.Or does an opposing team of jets vs prop planes sound like a fair fight?I'm incredibly tired of wasting so much time with this very unsatisfying game. I thought that perhaps if I got better and rode it out, the game would become a overall OK experience.I was SO WRONG.Examples:Spawn camping exsists in this ""flight simulator.""Arcade mode confuses damage to plane with ""uber over the edge damage.""Paper planes. Specifically American planes don't seem to hold up against air being blown the wrong way. I have used all countries; negating the experience that I've obtained will always ring a response.I hate this game.The only arugment posed against my experience: ""Leave, git gud, it gets better, the mods or devs are bias, blah blah blah, snap a head""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game WAS great; this game is not that good anymore.  The way the management team acts (don't bother me with facts, we do what we want!), and has run this product into the ground should be a business model of what NOT to do when you manage a company.  Read some of the other posts for reasons, they've been stated plenty already.Avoid.  Certainly don't put money into it; that just feeds the greed and stupidity.			",11,1,0,2,15,0,23

												I used to love this game, I really did... But over the years, they have done more and more to completely ruin it for me. I may not have much time with it on steam, but I played this game since back when it had 20 different tiers for planes and tanks were still a dream... They really don't care about making the planes the way they should be, but rather making them idiot proof. People who complain about a balanced game because they don't know how to fly/drive their vehicles rule here. If something has an advantage that it can use, don't expect it to remain for long, becuase as soon as people complain about it, that advantage is wretched away from an otherwise skilled pilot/driver to appease the people too impatient to learn.1.53 though... that's a new low for this game that I didn't expect. Aside from them completely ruining all jet battles in their quest to make this game idiot proof, numerous graphical and gameplay glitches have shown up. Planes jump around the sky for seemingly no reason, making aiming at them a guessing game over skill, having low shadow settings completely breaks the landscape into a mess of coloured stripes and black ones, and higher settings have glitching shadows across everything, distracting from the game and breaking any sense of immersion it had left... And I could go on all day listing the bugs.Until they decide to stop appeasing the lowest denominator and fix these bugs, I cannot in good concious recommend this game, and bring my years long playing it to a close.

												I simply can't recommend War Thunder any longer...after you've played for a brief period of time it becomes straining and the fun of the game is replaced with pure grind. I recommend playing the game until tier III or even early tier IV because in my opinion and the sake of this review, that's where the butter zone is of War Thunder. Pros:Unique with its Arcade/realistic combat style and allowing the player to use a mouse and keyboard instead of a joystickBeautiful graphics and the planes are outstanding with their detailed exteriors and cockpitif you're a World War II lover then you'll enjoy this game...up until jetsit features late WWI planes and tanks to Cold War Era jets and tanks...cons:The player base is entirely made of Russians it feels like...I guess this wouldn't be a con if you could speak their languageThe Devs do not listen to the community hardly and they add things that are completely unexpected and useless in their own right e.g. Rocket Artillery...It's completely a grind once you pass Tier IV and when you give up your self dignity to buy premium, you'll then be sucked into their money making black hole (yes, they're a company and they need to make money, but not by making the gameplay unenjoyable unless you buy their ""premium"" to boost RP gain)Overall the game is very unique and I enjoy playing it at lower tiers, but once you pass the tier IV mark, things become VERY unenjoyable.I'll change my review once I see improvement in the game community and the Devs.Seeya!

I am able to have 2 50 cals on my plane and a couple of 7.7s, but yet, when i shoot an enemy and i keep on hitting him, he doesnt go down.

												Sorry for the metaphor, but damn war thunder is literally going down in flames in the review section as well as a game.  A better game I would recammend is Air Combat team match OL on mobile. similar to war thunder, but has a modern feel instead, using modern jets and shizzle.fast foward say 2 years. the game hasnt changed all that much, grind is still there, and besides the new beta tests coming later this year for FREAKIN NAVAL BATTLES, nothing else much there. tho i think the game has gotten slightly better, but that might be just me from switching and starting over on a steam login. I dont think ill be changing the recammendation on this game, but you can give it a shot.Fast forward to March 2017. I decied to look and play again, and it seems my account has been deleted. dont know by who, but im going to assume the devs. there goes all my work on the german line. bummer. oh well, time to switch to world of tanks blitz. lets see how that goes.

												War Thunder is a game about Russian medium tanks one shotting everything regardless of their armor or angle, while themselves being all but invulnerable, and a bunch of fanboys defending this mechanic because they seen a WW2 ballistics manual once which they translated from Cyrillic.The Russian bias in the game is laughable. All the fanboys claiming otherwise are likewise laughable. Get the game if you want to see WWII vehicles drive and fly around with some nice graphics, but unless you play as Russia you will lose most games - the devs even hide the victory stats of the different nations to conceal this fact.If you want a tank combat game that's actually fun for the most part, give Armored Warfare a try, it's also free, and free from bias toward any particular fighting force. War thunder on the other hand, has sadly gone down hill since launch - the missions for realistic air battles are the same broken pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥they were three years ago, and the tank combat is becoming more and more like WoT with toybox sets designed for point-blank street fights that favor Russian tanks over everything else.But whatever you do, don't point this out to the fanboys, you'll get told to 'get good' 'l2p' etc. I did learn to play - I played Russia with an 80% win rate. Germany? About 30%. America? About the same as Germany, maybe a bit better. But I guess for some reason I'm only good with Russian tanks, and that reason has nothing to do with them being far superior in the game to their counterparts.Also; you think artillery in WoT is annoying? Imagine having player controlled aircraft dropping bombs directly on you with an actual crosshair that shows exactly where they'll land while they're in third-person view. Thought the spotted indicator from WoT was annoying? Well, same thing here now - added in a recent update you can now see the enemy through solid objects once their spotted. And all of this in Realistic Battles, which used to actually have SOME simulator aspects. Just got a shiny new heavy tank with good armor? Too bad, you'll be pitted against tanks from between 3 to 18 or even 30 years in the future using Vietnam war era ammunition against your WW2 solid shot shooting♥♥♥♥♥thereby making you nothing more than an easy target. Unless you're playing as Russia, of course.Not to mention the various pay to win vehicles, which are actually available to every nation, but I guess that's how you're supposed to win against Russia, amirite? And my god, are they ever pay to win. Especially the planes. But especially the tanks. But ESPECIALLY the planes. Want an american rocket ship armed with cannons that climbs as good as the actual german rocket fighter but 2 tiers earlier? They have you covered. Want a tank with practically the same armor as even the absurd German designs which never actually even existed evan as a fully built prototype - the maus - but are still in the game because otherwise German endgame would have nothing to fight the 70's era Russian bs outside of 1 medium tank? Just $50! I mean, they have the me 262 fighting the mig 17. That should tell you everything you need to know right there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a tank game that is totally ruined by stupid♥♥♥♥♥cod-esque kill streaks then this is the game for you.  Playing an entire fair and balanced TANK ARCADE BATTLE then all the sudden a plane crashes into you killing you.  Its entirely broken, unfair, and ruins tank gameplay when the other players get their kill streak and can just essentially guide a missle into your tank because kill yourself as a pilot has no negative effect.  So people just kamikazee your tank like they are a ♥♥♥♥ing v2 rocket. So if you want an absolutely broken unfair piece of trash game get this.  Otherwise go play world of tanks where the developers are not a bunch of greedy money ♥♥♥♥♥s. If you go on the forums and ask if the developers are addressing any of these issues or just making more micro transactions for the game you will be banned.  The refuse to addresse the problems and anyone who talks about the probelms in any way are banned and censored.  Do not support this game and do not support facists that censor the INALIENABLE right to free speech.  These are facists pigs who do not tolerate anyone disagreeing with them on their forums.  Do not support facism unless your some sort of neo-nazi hitler lover, then this game is for you. Pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Absolutley no balance.  You have all t1 tanks and you are matched against t3,t4, and t5 tanks because the developers can't program a decent matchmaking system because they are too busy making money of pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  There is absolutly no spawn protection so after you die once you can't take another tank onto the battlefield because you are instantly killed by someone with a tank they spent 100$ on and its 3 tiers higher then your best.   The game is not balanced, its not fun, and its entirely pay to win♥♥♥♥♥♥  Developers like this are scumbag human beings whos goal isn't to create a good game or sharpen their skill its soley to steal money from suckers.  They are pure scumbags.The developers are absolutely shtty at game development.  They made it so AA guns that shoot tiny tiny tiny little BULLETS can take down a heavy tank that is made to resit tank shells that weight the same weight as the entire AA gun.  Its a ♥♥♥♥ing joke and the developers deserve to have a tank round shoved right up their asses for being so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												War Thunder started out as a great game. It was at the time probably the best free to play air combat game available. Unfortunately it has over the years become progressively more about Gaijin's desperate quest for cash than creating a worthwhile experience for the players. The original economic model was challenging, but progression was possible at a reasonable pace. That is to say you could see the light at the end of the tunnel as a casual player with or without a premium account. In its current state, the economy is if not pay to win then at least absolutely punitive to people not willing to spend large amounts of real world money on the game. The experience you pile up for researching new aircraft and tanks is vastly outpaced by the pile that sits behind the pay wall. Worse, the cash payouts for those unwilling or unable to constantly have a premium account and boosters active are at best insufficient to maintain a reasonable progression pace. To add to the fun Gaijin has decided that game breaking premium vehicles are not just acceptable but desirable for their game. Vehicles like the Sherman Calliope and other rocket tanks for instance completely break any semblance of game balance or free to play model by being litteral expressions of a pay to win mentality in the parent company. Further there are mechanics detrimental to actual functional gameplay rife throughout the game. These  mechanics mean you spend as much time worrying about how things work or don't work as you do playing. Worse than that, these mechanics are poorly realized at best, inconsistent for the most part and sometimes absolutely crippling. As an example take the mechanic of the game marking aircraft as shot down. It would not be unreasonable to think that this means the aircraft is no longer a threat, you would be wrong, dead wrong. A shot down aircraft, unless the pilot and all the gunners on board are dead can and will kill you. There is no indication whatsoever as to whether a shot down aircraft is actually not a threat or is just missing a wing and slowly descending but ready to tear you a new one. This is just one of a sea of such problems.Finally there is the cheating. Those who say there is none are in denial, a quick google search will turn up several well known hacking companies that will happily sell you tools that play the game for you and ruin the life of anyone who dares to play legitimately. Worse are the countless free versions of the same tools that carry with them only a pricetag of a slightly increased chance of detection. Not that Gaijin is looking, they have implemented no anti-hack or anti-cheat functions of any real value. It is a shame to see that this game has fallen so far. Hopefully some other company will make something like what War Thunder once was.			",64,7,2,17,15,3,23

												It's garbage... Just full of cheaters and broken game balance ideas. I have be a ton of hours into this game, I love WW2 history and the tanks which is why I started this game. At first it wasn't so bad but with the updates and figuring out how thing work I have to admit this is a garbage game now. The main game mechanic/gmaeplay issue that just ruins the game is the air planes. Now any half whit knows a tank can not fight a plane given that it is a ground unit where as a plane was designed for air combat and strafing/bombing of ground unit deppending on the type of plane. Realistically in war the planes rely ground forces to radio in the positions of the enemy to them but war thunder thinks that all the ground units for both sides should be marked with big name tags. This kills balance once someone gets into a bomber since you literally can not hide and the person will just drop the bombs about where you will try to run from said bombs. And no ally players in fighters do not go for bombers they strafe and suicide on enemy tanks for easy kills. Also SPAA is by no means a true threat to bombers or fighters since most are either killed by tanks or bombed themselves. This is not some much the issue in sim battles since all the hud stuff is removed so you are not constantly spotted for the planes forcing them to actively look for targets and in sim and realistic not everyone is given the chance at a bomber run. How ever sim mode is very challenging and takes some practice to get used to and ultimately not that fun to new players or most players for that matter so long que times for that mode. And realistic (I roll my eyes at that title for the mode) is not that great either since the enemy planes still have everyone spotted and they have the added bonus of being able to land and re arm in a game mode that makes it even harder for SPAA to hit them so they are effectly useless as a reliable counter to them. Lastly you have arcade mode the mode everyone starts with, everyone gets a chance at a bomber run so basicly everyone gets a bomber at some point but thats only a help if you can fly them. You are constantly spotted for the bombers SPAA are normally bombed first so they are pointless and no one really plays it since they don't lead to fun tanks down the line. This pattern of being killed three times in a row by bombers or seal clubbers just drives new players away pretty quickly I have to say and is not at all balanced since you don't see any player controlled tanks in the plane arcade battles since the game dev's know it would be pointless since they couldn't do anything anyway. Lastly is the cheaters, oh the cheaters... Aimbots, armor mods, ammo mods... You can and will run into one guy with am aimbot or an ammo mod at some point in every game. That alone can ruin a game but oddly enough its not as bad as the afore mentioned planes. It is still an issue though when you are shot through a hill and the round bounces perfectly around the cab of the tank hitting all your crew in one insane trip in the tank. Or you are hit and the shrapnel only hits your crew like it is homing in on them. Well it is, there are a few mods than alter the workings of the rng of the crew meating hot metal mechanics. Nothing is ever done about it though. All in all it has some fun bits like seeing WW2 tanks lumbering about fireing at stuff but with the planes and dev's lack of giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the players cheating I would strongly reccomend you pass on this garbage.

												Yeah no this is a good game thats run by one of the worst companies that ive ever seen. They never listen to the people that actually play the game. They release vechicals that nobody wants. The bugs in this game are incredibly annoying, such as random ricochets even though the surface is slightly sloped( a jagpanther who was directly infront of me bounced my almost point blank 122mm IS-2 round which is more than capable of penetrating its armor). Not to mention the broken BR system that is horribly outdated, you have WW2 era tanks facing off against Cold War Era tanks that have cHEAT AMMO. Unfortunatly there really isnt any other alternative to this game.(WOT does not count)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 200+ games and 24 hours within a week I highly recommend this game.I saw many arguments against the devs being greedy about money but it's a free to play, people shouldn't expect anything from this. For the balancing I doesn't have any issues neither (but I play with the USSR)There's a lot of grinding but at least Rank 1 planes can kill Rank 3 planes.			",460,94,5,31,48,5,30

												Great game if you can get it to download. I'll never understand why companies use their own 3rd party launchers instead of just updating through Steam. Literally on my 5th try now, the launcher just stops at ""Preparing to download"" randomly and you have to close it to get it to start downloading again, which normally wouldn't be an issue except it doesn't close when you close it, the process continues to run. So you have to use the task manager to actually close it.Decent gameplay, technically a mess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have a LOT of time and even a fair amount of $$ into this game and there are a few things to take away from it. 1, In it's very basic form it feels like a scam. It doesn't feel as if the devs actually cared about the history or about the player enjoyment as much as they cared about profit. The game constantly asks you to buy things as it is the definition of a pay to win game.( actually you aren't even gaurenteed a win if you pay so think of it as ""pay to play better""). 2, I love the flying mechanics and the feel of the game. It can easily make the inner kid of anyone come out. 3. THIS GAME IS SUCH A GRIND! This game is the longest game knowen to man. Not in a good way because if you every invest time into one of the really nerfed nations such as America, then you end up in a grind that will last 10000 hrs+ before you even finish the first tech tree. I wish the game was faster so you could constantly be moving through the progress of the tech tree and onto other nations. 4. It feels as if some nations are nerfed so that the nations with large and new playerbases such as america wish attracts younger and less experinced audineces to be less equipped and thus spend more money. In total, this game is very fun, it is also very very agrovating as whenever you start to have fun, you get held back or the moment gets ruined by some pay to win/unballenced aspect.

												To be honest, I really don't recommand this game if you are looking for a fun f2p game. Why? First, its time consuming to unlock veichles. You got to spend $$ on either ge or boost. Second, this game is historically bais, how? you first start with with the Germans, Americans then Britts and finally Russians. You will recongize that how the Russian completely dominated everyone, no matter on tanks or planes. In the end, you are gonna stick with the Russians in order to own other players. Finally, the company is a total bollock. They are trying to stick to ""flying simulator"" yet most aerial models doesn't even match to the reality. Any critical comments in the forum will cause you to get warned or even ban. Also, the ge planes are getting more expensive than before and the lease system just cancers me.The game: 9/10Company: Suck my♥♥♥♥			",22,1,0,2,2,0,3

												Umpteen thousand hours of game time. Yea really.  Just did not do it through steam. Had to many issues that way. Game was much better stand alone.When the game first came to be - as most other negative comments state - it was a very fun game. Yet as time has passed I have to agree on the money factor. For one, a player should not get frustrated when playing a game. Granted I know people do. And yes I do as well. But, when it is a frequent emotion then ... well time to stop playing the game.Oh, the money factor. If you want to really advance fast just so you can get into a top level tank then spend the hard earned cash and buy your way to the top. The vehicle, the modules, even the crew can be taken all the way to the top with your money. But, when your premium tank is taken out with one shot from a player who barely has 45 hours into the game (yes that player is in a top level tank also cause he paid to play) and is in a lower tier tank that by normal physics that the rest of the world understands could never damage your high level vehicle ,,, well I told you that frustration happens way to often in this game.Now to catch my breath. So yes, if you are in a Soviet tank or aircraft, 8 out of 10 times you have the advantage.And yes, some joker can install the game and be a super star in 10 minutes if he / she wants to spend the money or add cheats to his / her game. Ganjin will never admit thier product is flawed - that means client side autobots -. And yes, if you bit** in chat or the forums you will get banned - no warning. However, I admit most of the time your post are just removed. Oh did I mention that money was a factor? Never use to be. But it is now. I use to have allot of fun with the game and some mates I met in the game. Sure we got mad at the crappy physics but the fun factor was well worth it. Then the changes came in 1.5 something and that all became obsolete. A new player could now install and be a pay to play superstar in minutes. Oh and yes, you can spend hours building your economy up, or so you thought. Then you look at your Silver Lion total and think WTF, where is my lions? Well you did not earn enough cause either the ammo was way to much for each round that actually did damage or your repairs cost so much that you went into the negative allot after each match. I chose to play German and American tanks. One cost way to much to repair but did good damage, the other was not to expensive to repair but the ammo was very expensive. ie. 10 rounds HEAP @ 320 lions per round = 3200. Now do that 3  times in one match.Well that is just the start and I will stop here, just be ready if you play the game. Do turn off all chat there is allot of insecure whiners in the game, and dont spend any real money. It really is not worth it any more.DCS 1.5 here I come. Oh snap, I have to buy a joystick.

												this game is for people who thought battlefield hardline was balanced . the battle rating system that they use for ""fair"" matchmaking is absolutely terrible. half the time your matched with people who have tanks 1-1.5 higher BR and you die instantly. not to mention that most of the russian tanks are ridiculously overpowered. and the a43 black prince is so broken it hurts. every single shot you land on the thing just bounces off. its unbalanced, frusterating, and the worst part is that its such an easy fix. but the devs are either too stupid or too lazy. the flying part isnt too bad but it has its issues as well. although altogether the flying is a much more enjoyable experience. last but not least its a pay to win/grind fest. and the premium system is terrible. heroes and generals does it too. just make premium a one time buy. nobody wants to have to subscribe to some BS that you have to pay for every month. edit:war thunder is still good game and has lots of potential to be a lot of fun. i like the concept of the game, and they do a lot right. at its current stage, the tank portion of the game has a few very large issues that makes gameplay a painful experience. i  hope that the devs will fix the balance issues at the very leastupdate: for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a noticeupdate:  for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a notice			",28,3,3,1,6,0,0

												105mm howitzer can't kill a halftrack head on, lmao. This game is really bad and has no historical accuracy. nothing like watching a flakpanzer take out a sherman tank with spray and pray.realistic battles my A°$s. watching a MiG jetplane fighting a bunch of props is the dumbest junk ever. i feel bad for the people who actually spent money on this. but the reviews say it all.oh yeah and to the cuck mods who love watching their women get rammed by black bulls: you can inject sh°t into your d°ck with a syringe, catch aids, and then take a c°ck up the A°$s to prep the black bull since you love getting a creampie in your boipussi. have a terrible day, choke on your vodka or coffee whatever you drink, then fall face first into a cactus and die painfully from liver cancer, you stupid mitre wearing mongoloid slavsh°ts.Do you like fighting motherf*ckin' MiG29 jet planes that shoot you down with missiles while you're in a p26 wooden peashooter propeller plane? If so, then war thunder is for you. Enjoy as you watch your useless 7.62 machine gun fire slowly at a grounded YaK and do nothing after an entire belt of ammo. Then watch as the Yak farts exhaust fumes on takeoff that cause your engine to catch fire and explode into tiny flaming balls only to realize that you have no parachute.But wait, there's more! You may be thinking to yourself ""Maybe just the aviation sucks! I'll go play the tanks instead!"" and then you realize your in for a special kind of surprise when your tank flips over from grazing the corner of a tree. Then it randomly explodes.You start to get frustrated and then angrily drive at the enemy forces, all of which shoot you simultaneously and it causes your game client to crash, your video card to overheat, and then your processor to blow up and send motherboard shrapnel flying at your face, the results of which leave you blinded with impotent rage when your failures called team-mates fly into you on takeoff and then blame you for it. In Russian. Cyk*a ♥♥♥♥♥.WAR THUNDER YES			",16,0,0,1,0,0,0

												After almost 400 hours of this game I finally decided to uninstall it. Obviously it isn't a horrible game, it's just got so many problems that I can't bear with them anymore. This game has so many problems that it is hard to fully appreciate it, which I really hate because it could be such a good game.Pros:*The artwork done on this game is just brilliant. I love how the maps and tanks look, and the little details they have put into everything.*The sheer number of different tanks and airplanes you can drive is so large that it takes tens of hours just to try out them all, and that is after you've finally unlocked them.*The details you can add to your tanks and the customization you can do is pretty sweet.*If you don't think of it as a realistic WWII simulator, the concept of the game is pretty good.*There are few pay-to-win elements to this game, except for a couple of tanks which are just broken.Cons:*The game is pretty buggy. Sometimes your shots will just dissapear somewhere between your tanks and the enemy tank, and even though you can see your bullet hitting the enemy tank the game gives you no info on what happened like it usually does.*The balancing of the game is just horrible. The maps are not balanced, the teams are not balanced, the different nations are not balanced, and so on. On most maps one side has a huge advantage over the other. In many matches one team totally dominates the other, and there it is clear from the start what team will win. This would be an even bigger problem if the teams were not as unbalanced.*The rating system of the game is broken. If you have a new unupgraded tank and meet a tank of a whole rating higher than you, you might as well just quit the game and rejoin later. This is especially true from 5.3 and higher ratings. An unupgraded tank and a fully upgraded tank should really not be the same rating.*Ratings are readjusted way too slow. When new tanks are added, it takes way too long before they get a new, more fitting rating.*Once your team is loosing it is very hard to regain the advantage because the enemy will have the points for artillery and airplanes, and they will often get all the advantage points, making it very hard to push for the capture zones.*Too many maps more or less completely without cover.

												Any one who loves aircraft and dogfighting, or has a passing knowledge of tank warfare between 1936-1960s will love this. Lots of tanks and aircraft. But ultimately the game gets boring due to the very long grinds.You start with nerfed vehicles and need to play to unlock more efficient ammo, airframes, crew etc via game play. Meantime you are often facing players with fully upgraded tanks or aircraft in the same tier so are going to have a pretty miserable time of it. In the lower levels you can get upgrades fairly regularly but when you start getting to the really interesting aircraft like Lancasters, B17s, Me262s, Tiger tanks and JS2s and 3s you are in for a very long and boring grind. Hours and days can be spent just to unlock a little extra performance so you can maybe get an edge over others. In the end you realize you have put many 100s of hours in on it. Then there are the maps. There are VERY few of them. You rehash the same scenarios again and again and again. This is where the game can really be improved. More maps please. A campaign system that travels across Europe or the Pacific would be very nice, but instead its the same old repetitious maps that are tiny compared to something like Skyrim.Victory Scenarios: battles are usually revolving around who destroys the oppositions ground units faster. Fighters can't. Bombers can...and usually this means flying British heavies or American B17s like fighter bombers. When a scenario requires hitting factories there is no bomber stream or formation...you are all alone against swarms of fighters. Very unrealistic. The few capture the flag scenarios for fighters pop up randomly so if you have already selected your normal all bomber squad expecting the usual bomb AFV or bomb base scenarios, you are stuck with totally inappropriate aircraft. A briefing before the scenario starts would certainly help with selecting whether you want to field bombers or fighters.Realism: For land battles there are no infantry....so urban combat is totally unrealistic. For Air battles 4 engine heavies doing dive bombing runs totally counter to all the realism built into the combat models,Would I recommend it? Its a yes/no answer. Sucked up a lot of my time. I love the vehicles from this era however I keep thinking it is a shell of what it could be. There are ways of randomising terrain. There are ways of better balancing teams. There are ways to put in a meaningful campaign. So ultimately I have very mixed feelings. The other thing is I am not a memember of any squad so maybe that makes me feel its a fairly hollow game. Kudos to the developers for the beautiful aircraft and tank models. In conclusion: play it casually. Play the lower tiers as these are lots of fun. If you play AFVs play realistic...its tougher but more satisfying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I reached the 1,000 hour club, I think I know enough to review this game. Pros: Looks fantastic, feels realistic, great engine, tons of vehicles. Cons: TERRIBLE balance (mainly in tanks), Pay to win bush camo, massive grind fest (tanks), smallish player base (mainly planes), questionable balance and design decisions (such as crew lock). Overwall the game is great, but there are so many flaws under the surface the really hold it back. Its not really worth getting invlovled in, unless you are a hard core plane and tank person.

No way that a standard T54 from the 50's could defeat a leopard 1 from the 60's that easy...

												Great game if you can get it to download. I'll never understand why companies use their own 3rd party launchers instead of just updating through Steam. Literally on my 5th try now, the launcher just stops at ""Preparing to download"" randomly and you have to close it to get it to start downloading again, which normally wouldn't be an issue except it doesn't close when you close it, the process continues to run. So you have to use the task manager to actually close it.Decent gameplay, technically a mess.			",241,24,6,27,12,0,9

												War thunder used to be good, back in 1.29-1.35. now War thunder in an RNG fest that takes the fun out of flying! A single round will take your wing off, in any plane if it is a gunner. In the last 100 or so matches of HB, i have not been able to land a plane with dammage, mostly because if you get hit you die. Weather it is your wing getting clipped or your plane turning into the reincarnation of berlin burning in 1945, you will not be able to land your aircraft. War thunder past 1.35 was a mistake.

												I keep wanting to like this game, but it's gotten worse and worse over the updates. I've looked through the messages log and for every win my team gets, I'm placed on a team that ends of losing between 7 to 10 times in row. There's no way the teams or maps are balanced. Even if I'm totally a bad player, I'm only 1 of 15 people on the team. It's statistically impossible for me to keep getting placed on so many poor teams, so there must be some other factor. There's simply no fun any longer when playing is just one beating after another so many times in a row.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Umpteen thousand hours of game time. Yea really.  Just did not do it through steam. Had to many issues that way. Game was much better stand alone.When the game first came to be - as most other negative comments state - it was a very fun game. Yet as time has passed I have to agree on the money factor. For one, a player should not get frustrated when playing a game. Granted I know people do. And yes I do as well. But, when it is a frequent emotion then ... well time to stop playing the game.Oh, the money factor. If you want to really advance fast just so you can get into a top level tank then spend the hard earned cash and buy your way to the top. The vehicle, the modules, even the crew can be taken all the way to the top with your money. But, when your premium tank is taken out with one shot from a player who barely has 45 hours into the game (yes that player is in a top level tank also cause he paid to play) and is in a lower tier tank that by normal physics that the rest of the world understands could never damage your high level vehicle ,,, well I told you that frustration happens way to often in this game.Now to catch my breath. So yes, if you are in a Soviet tank or aircraft, 8 out of 10 times you have the advantage.And yes, some joker can install the game and be a super star in 10 minutes if he / she wants to spend the money or add cheats to his / her game. Ganjin will never admit thier product is flawed - that means client side autobots -. And yes, if you bit** in chat or the forums you will get banned - no warning. However, I admit most of the time your post are just removed. Oh did I mention that money was a factor? Never use to be. But it is now. I use to have allot of fun with the game and some mates I met in the game. Sure we got mad at the crappy physics but the fun factor was well worth it. Then the changes came in 1.5 something and that all became obsolete. A new player could now install and be a pay to play superstar in minutes. Oh and yes, you can spend hours building your economy up, or so you thought. Then you look at your Silver Lion total and think WTF, where is my lions? Well you did not earn enough cause either the ammo was way to much for each round that actually did damage or your repairs cost so much that you went into the negative allot after each match. I chose to play German and American tanks. One cost way to much to repair but did good damage, the other was not to expensive to repair but the ammo was very expensive. ie. 10 rounds HEAP @ 320 lions per round = 3200. Now do that 3  times in one match.Well that is just the start and I will stop here, just be ready if you play the game. Do turn off all chat there is allot of insecure whiners in the game, and dont spend any real money. It really is not worth it any more.DCS 1.5 here I come. Oh snap, I have to buy a joystick.

												this game is for people who thought battlefield hardline was balanced . the battle rating system that they use for ""fair"" matchmaking is absolutely terrible. half the time your matched with people who have tanks 1-1.5 higher BR and you die instantly. not to mention that most of the russian tanks are ridiculously overpowered. and the a43 black prince is so broken it hurts. every single shot you land on the thing just bounces off. its unbalanced, frusterating, and the worst part is that its such an easy fix. but the devs are either too stupid or too lazy. the flying part isnt too bad but it has its issues as well. although altogether the flying is a much more enjoyable experience. last but not least its a pay to win/grind fest. and the premium system is terrible. heroes and generals does it too. just make premium a one time buy. nobody wants to have to subscribe to some BS that you have to pay for every month. edit:war thunder is still good game and has lots of potential to be a lot of fun. i like the concept of the game, and they do a lot right. at its current stage, the tank portion of the game has a few very large issues that makes gameplay a painful experience. i  hope that the devs will fix the balance issues at the very leastupdate: for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a noticeupdate:  for some unknown reason gajin has changed my nickname. it was ""kim_jong_illest"" but now its ""renamed28429"" or something. wtf? ive already changed my name once so i cant change it again and im so salty about this. like they didnt even give me a reason or a notice			",28,3,3,1,6,0,0

This game is really bad and has no historical accuracy. nothing like watching a flakpanzer take out a sherman tank with spray and pray.realistic battles my A°$s. watching a MiG jetplane fighting a bunch of props is the dumbest junk ever. i feel bad for the people who actually spent money on this. but the reviews say it all.oh yeah and to the cuck mods who love watching their women get rammed by black bulls: you can inject sh°t into your d°ck with a syringe, catch aids, and then take a c°ck up the A°$s to prep the black bull since you love getting a creampie in your boipussi. have a terrible day, choke on your vodka or coffee whatever you drink, then fall face first into a cactus and die painfully from liver cancer, you stupid mitre wearing mongoloid slavsh°ts.Do you like fighting motherf*ckin' MiG29 jet planes that shoot you down with missiles while you're in a p26 wooden peashooter propeller plane? If so, then war thunder is for you. Enjoy as you watch your useless 7.62 machine gun fire slowly at a grounded YaK and do nothing after an entire belt of ammo. Then watch as the Yak farts exhaust fumes on takeoff that cause your engine to catch fire and explode into tiny flaming balls only to realize that you have no parachute.But wait, there's more! You may be thinking to yourself ""Maybe just the aviation sucks! I'll go play the tanks instead!"" and then you realize your in for a special kind of surprise when your tank flips over from grazing the corner of a tree. Then it randomly explodes.You start to get frustrated and then angrily drive at the enemy forces, all of which shoot you simultaneously and it causes your game client to crash, your video card to overheat, and then your processor to blow up and send motherboard shrapnel flying at your face, the results of which leave you blinded with impotent rage when your failures called team-mates fly into you on takeoff and then blame you for it. In Russian. Cyk*a ♥♥♥♥♥.WAR THUNDER YES			",16,0,0,1,0,0,0

												After almost 400 hours of this game I finally decided to uninstall it. Obviously it isn't a horrible game, it's just got so many problems that I can't bear with them anymore. This game has so many problems that it is hard to fully appreciate it, which I really hate because it could be such a good game.Pros:*The artwork done on this game is just brilliant. I love how the maps and tanks look, and the little details they have put into everything.*The sheer number of different tanks and airplanes you can drive is so large that it takes tens of hours just to try out them all, and that is after you've finally unlocked them.*The details you can add to your tanks and the customization you can do is pretty sweet.*If you don't think of it as a realistic WWII simulator, the concept of the game is pretty good.*There are few pay-to-win elements to this game, except for a couple of tanks which are just broken.Cons:*The game is pretty buggy. Sometimes your shots will just dissapear somewhere between your tanks and the enemy tank, and even though you can see your bullet hitting the enemy tank the game gives you no info on what happened like it usually does.*The balancing of the game is just horrible. The maps are not balanced, the teams are not balanced, the different nations are not balanced, and so on. On most maps one side has a huge advantage over the other. In many matches one team totally dominates the other, and there it is clear from the start what team will win. This would be an even bigger problem if the teams were not as unbalanced.*The rating system of the game is broken. If you have a new unupgraded tank and meet a tank of a whole rating higher than you, you might as well just quit the game and rejoin later. This is especially true from 5.3 and higher ratings. An unupgraded tank and a fully upgraded tank should really not be the same rating.*Ratings are readjusted way too slow. When new tanks are added, it takes way too long before they get a new, more fitting rating.*Once your team is loosing it is very hard to regain the advantage because the enemy will have the points for artillery and airplanes, and they will often get all the advantage points, making it very hard to push for the capture zones.*Too many maps more or less completely without cover.

												Any one who loves aircraft and dogfighting, or has a passing knowledge of tank warfare between 1936-1960s will love this. Lots of tanks and aircraft. But ultimately the game gets boring due to the very long grinds.You start with nerfed vehicles and need to play to unlock more efficient ammo, airframes, crew etc via game play. Meantime you are often facing players with fully upgraded tanks or aircraft in the same tier so are going to have a pretty miserable time of it. In the lower levels you can get upgrades fairly regularly but when you start getting to the really interesting aircraft like Lancasters, B17s, Me262s, Tiger tanks and JS2s and 3s you are in for a very long and boring grind. Hours and days can be spent just to unlock a little extra performance so you can maybe get an edge over others. In the end you realize you have put many 100s of hours in on it. Then there are the maps. There are VERY few of them. You rehash the same scenarios again and again and again. This is where the game can really be improved. More maps please. A campaign system that travels across Europe or the Pacific would be very nice, but instead its the same old repetitious maps that are tiny compared to something like Skyrim.Victory Scenarios: battles are usually revolving around who destroys the oppositions ground units faster. Fighters can't. Bombers can...and usually this means flying British heavies or American B17s like fighter bombers. When a scenario requires hitting factories there is no bomber stream or formation...you are all alone against swarms of fighters. Very unrealistic. The few capture the flag scenarios for fighters pop up randomly so if you have already selected your normal all bomber squad expecting the usual bomb AFV or bomb base scenarios, you are stuck with totally inappropriate aircraft. A briefing before the scenario starts would certainly help with selecting whether you want to field bombers or fighters.Realism: For land battles there are no infantry....so urban combat is totally unrealistic. For Air battles 4 engine heavies doing dive bombing runs totally counter to all the realism built into the combat models,Would I recommend it? Its a yes/no answer. Sucked up a lot of my time. I love the vehicles from this era however I keep thinking it is a shell of what it could be. There are ways of randomising terrain. There are ways of better balancing teams. There are ways to put in a meaningful campaign. So ultimately I have very mixed feelings. The other thing is I am not a memember of any squad so maybe that makes me feel its a fairly hollow game. Kudos to the developers for the beautiful aircraft and tank models. In conclusion: play it casually. Play the lower tiers as these are lots of fun. If you play AFVs play realistic...its tougher but more satisfying.			",41,7,0,18,6,0,19

												As I reached the 1,000 hour club, I think I know enough to review this game. Pros: Looks fantastic, feels realistic, great engine, tons of vehicles. Cons: TERRIBLE balance (mainly in tanks), Pay to win bush camo, massive grind fest (tanks), smallish player base (mainly planes), questionable balance and design decisions (such as crew lock). Overwall the game is great, but there are so many flaws under the surface the really hold it back. Its not really worth getting invlovled in, unless you are a hard core plane and tank person.

												A fun game to waste some time in with good plane simulation of WWII. You can be any faction and the planes stretch from early WWI planes to cold war era jets. However, the time to grind your way to jets or even the WWII classics is really, really long. This is kinda of expected for a free to pay game and you hit the pay wall pretty quickly. Understandable, but annoying when you cannot pay a one time cost to unlock everything. For the ludicrous amount of time you have to invest for some really cool stuff I have to not recommend it past the first few hours flying your crate.			",37,13,0,13,5,0,20

												This is my favorite WW2 vehicle combat game for a variety of reasons.Cross platform: I played this game for hundreds of hours on PS4. Now I've got a new PC and play it through Steam. Both options are enjoyable, and the expanded player-base is great!Number of vehicles: There are more tanks, planes, and soon-to-be boats in this game than any other. There are the expected vehicles as well as unique and rare ones. The variety is great.Modes of play: There are three modes. Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator. This allows people to play at their desire level of realism. Personally, I stick to Realistic as it offers a mix of historical realism with some concessions for gameplay.Price: The game is free, and the grind is not the worst out there. I don't get bored as I enjoy playing the low and mid level vehicles. You can get a premium account to level up faster, but I don't do this. I spend my money on vehicles that I find interesting or unique. They are not badly priced and there are occasional sales.Replay: At the different tiers of vehicles, there is different gameplay styles. So even if you are a high level player who is used to late game matches of slow movers with long range guns, you can still go back to tier 1 for a completely different experience with the little agile tanks found there. Same with late game jets vs early biplanes.The community around this game is pretty good, and there are a lot of people willing to answer questions and help you out on the forums.Gaijin might not have a perfect record at fixing issues, but they update the game regularly, offering both cosmetic and practical changes. You get a couple of new vehicles to research for free each month and now there are PVE modes! (Planes now, tanks soon)This game is, without a doubt, one of my favorites of all time!

												Knowing that naval is coming around the corner this will probably make War Thunder one of the best WWII MMOs out there. Knowing that at one point we'll have all three branches of vehicles clashing with each other, this will make the upcoming battles very intense and that is what a game such as this should be like.

												Extreamly time consuming game, which wouldnt be bad but it is mainly made that way to ""encourage"" buying vehicles with real money that not only have significant experience boosts but also, in some cases, are blantly imbalanced and overpovered (currently Calliope, a premium US tank with enough missles to kill everyone else five times over). I dont like playing a game that claims to be F2P but only if you are willing to spend hundreds of hours over a paying player to get anywhere close to end game. I plaid some MMO's bvefore that were less grindy than this game, and a lot of the times you start the grind blindfolded with your hands tied behind your back. To repair your damaged tank during battle you have to first reaserch ""parts"" that, depending on the machine, can take several games. Sufficient to say that a strey bullet or artillery shell exploding nearby might damage your engine for instance, now you wont be able to repair it without the said parts, so have fun sitting in a broken tank untill someone mrecifully finishes you off. Did I mention that premium vehicles have most upgrades unlocked automatically? This might be a fun F2P game but I dont think it's worth the enormus amounts of time required to do anything that way and with the current balancing issues and russian favoritism I dont really feel like spending money on it. I kind of wish now I could get all those hours back and play something fun that is actually F2P instead of getting one tier 3 tank after playing way over 100 battles.			",95,25,0,24,7,0,27

												A fun game, but it is far too difficult to grind through the tiers and planes.  Even when you unlock a plane, expect to grind out the upgrades for it.  Also, the tiered matchmaking system could use a little work.  It really is not fun to consistently go up against planes at a higher tier, which is very common.Overrall, I do recommend the game, but with the warning that the game becomes a vertiable grindfest once you get to tier 3 planes and above.

												I used to love this but now..I find it hard to recommend. This game was great, I played it a fair amount and enjoyed it but now I have no drive to play it. I mainly played tanks but now it's pop out of cover to shoot and bang you're dead. The problem is the game mechanics, your guns are perfectly accurate at extreme ranges and guns that should have poor accuracy are derp guns. The developer sees no problem with this and continues let it eventually hurt the game. If you thought PGI was bad at handing game balance with regards to Mechwarrior Online, these guys are in their own leauge.This game used to be easy to pick up and get into, even after taking a break but now it's extremely punishing and very hard to get into again.Pros-Great detail, the tanks look great-no real pay to win (paid vechicles are usually a prototype, rare varient, or famous historial vechicle like the Cobra King Sherman)- UI is better than average, coming from a MWO player here- grind is not that bad until tier 3Cons- game balance does not feel right- some tanks feel down right usless but you are forced to grind through them, resulting in only a small slection of vechicles being widely used beyond tier 1 thus rendering large slection of vechicles rather unimportant- enviroment texture look like from 2002- steep learning curve when trying to get into somthing other than arcade battles, to the point of being punishing- the grind goes from feeling okay to being extreme in high level tier 3, low level tier 4So in summary this game started out fun but became more an excercise in bashing your head against the desk than a actual video game. Heck I even used to spend money on this game but not anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR:Previously stated Russian bias (by other reviewers) holds true in a game that is plagued by purposefully bad grinding in order to frustrate you into spending money to ease the pain. War Thunder would otherwise knock Wargaming.net's IPs out of the park with stunning visuals, complex and deep controls (optional) and a genuine satisfaction for making the perfect shot on an enemy vehicle. If only Gaijin would get their act together.------------------------------------------Compared to other players? I have nothing in the way of hours. I have a general philosophy when it comes to war games like this.German tanks,U.S./British planes (Mostly U.S.),Japanese ships.This is mostly due to the fact that these countries tended to excell in these respective categories. You may have noticed that in no instance did I pick the Russians. Why? Because their involvement in the timeperiod(s) generally covered by these wargames was minor at best. They participated mostly on the eastern front, taking up countries that eventually became the U.S.S.R. at its height.Now, one might argue one way or the other about the Russian involvement, or about my choices with my tech trees, but I'm mostly going on historical involvement in the war. The Germans spent most of the time on the ground, the U.S./Britain in the air, and the Japanese at sea.What I ultimately desire is historical accuracy. Armor, handling, traverse speed, armament, etc. Gaijin doesn't appear to do that. Like with Wargaming.net (WoT, WoWs, WoWp), they favor the Russians. The difference being that Gaijin appears to do so with great fervor. I have a hard time believing that a Russian light tank had better/thicker armor than a German medium tank, but it's in the stats in the game. Maybe I'm wrong.Another problem is the monetization, mostly due to how one gains experience. Gaijin not only creates a big grind, but they taunt you with convertable experience that you gain boatloads of, but can't actually use unless you use premium currency. Meanwhile, the actual spendable experience gain is miniscule at best, even if you do well in a match, or are the top player on the winning team.Then, in order to increase the grind further (beyond the point of comfortableness, which is by design, I would guess), you have to research and buy 6 vehicles in the current tier in order to research a vehicle in the next tier. This forces you to not only waste time trying to unlock extra vehicles, but also forces you to waste normal currency to buy them. Result? You waste time, experience, and money to unlock a bunch of vehicles you probably don't even want, or won't ever use. To my knowledge, you can't even sell them to get part of your money back.When compared to wargaming.net, it's almost sad. Wargaming.net manages to make the grind annoying enough that some people will buy currency to speed it up, but not so annoying that people who don't want to spend money will just give up on it.Both graphically, and aesthetically, however, War Thunder beats Wargaming hands down. Vehicle handling is far more advanced in War Thunder, and it even gets you to try and check your aim and pick your shots, due to ricochets, penetration, and placement of vehicle interiors (with the tanks) where one well placed shot will wipe a tank out because you managed to blast the whole crew and detonate the munitions.If Gaijin were to get their act together, make the grind more like WoT, and actually make all of the vehicles historically accurate to all released specifications, then I'd probably jump ship. (Though maybe not, because I'd probably like both.)Right now, however, unless you are really keen on being patient, and want a fairly advanced battlegame with inaccurate specifications and bad monetization/grinding, I'd recommend any of Wargaming.net's games.If Gaijin does (someday) gets their act together, then I would completely recommend War Thunder. Until then, if then ever comes, which doesn't seem likely, you decide. I'll still be playing though, because I like battlegames in general.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most unbalanced game I personnaly know. In tank battle, once you get your first tier-2 tank, it's close to impossible to do♥♥♥♥♥♥ since you're match up with way too powerfull tanks. You keep getting destroyed before having time to attack, and even if you manage to attack first, either your shell do not do much damage, either it does not penetrate, even regarding your ammo type.The first reserve and tier-1 battle are pretty cool and balanced tho'. But passed this point, it's just an unbalanced and raging game. Too bad it as potential, but there really is no more fun in keep raging on and on.			",71,0,0,3,3,0,5

												It's a great game at it's core, but the repair costs at the higher tiers begin to become more than the payout, forcing players to either play in lower tiers or pay real money to get premium, allowing them to get more of the free currency per game.

												I enjoy this game, a lot, the graphics are outstanding. However it's very rare that you're going to play with a team that actually works as a team. This game is based on the fact that if you fight as a team then you win as a team. But to some people that doesn't apply. For most people it's every man for himself. And you can see how that has a major effect on the game. So no i don't recommend this game. Not unless you want your team to just leave you to fight 3 spitfires on your own.			",77,5,1,4,9,0,11

												This game was good like 2 years ago, untill they brought in their own point of view on the vehicle performances. This is the only game, where a bf 109 G2 can fly faster than a p51-d, at any altitude and angle (current version 1.55). The flight models in this game have nothing to do with the real life counterparts. If you played some real flight simulators, this game will seem like a joke (even in SB).  Granted the graphics are good, but I give it a 4.5, 5/10 at most in it's current state, and that is only because tanks are a little bit better (or so i've been told). Sorry gaijin you had something good but ruined it in the past year beyond anything imagined. (Pretty sure at least 9/10 guys will agree.)			",43,0,0,4,2,0,3

												New Review:Nearing 700 hrs. and planning to stop. It is not fun anymore. I am tired of being rolled over by all the more advanced planes due to the new matchmaking system. I know it is a game of skill, but in order to get to the newer planes to actually matter, one has to spend tens of hours to unlock one plane at a time. It used to be fun before patch 1.37, but now it is a grindfest that gets boring. Did I mention that the GE currency was devalued big time after that patch? And I feel that the new 1.39 patch did not fix anything. **Original review:**Fiercely addictive game. I am nearing 500 hours  spent playing it and I am barely scratching the surface. Highly recommended!			",17,0,0,1,6,0,13

												Excellent game, just watch out for rammers ^^   - this was pre 1.37Post 1.37 the game is utterly ridiculous. Weeks of grinding to get newer planes - I pity those that are starting out fresh after 1.37 hit - and a matchmaking system that punishes you if you do well by putting you up against planes vastly superior to your own.Whilst I'm glad I got some of the packs during a Steam Sale I can not recommend that anyone spends a single penny on this game especially with the tanks being released soon (at a cost of £30 for a tank and access to closed beta) and can only see the ridiculous grind and conversion rates of Golden Eagles to Reasearch Points getting far far worse.All in all I loved this game and happily played several hours a day - that has now changed to possibly playing once or twice a week for a total of maybe 2 hours gametime :/ (I do like to fly the planes in single player / mission mode a fair bit more but multiplayer is mostly a waste of time)Edit again: Now that ground forces have been released (at least for Russia and Germany) I've started to enjoy the game again but it's still far too grindy on the plane side to recommend for new playersEdit some more: Tried it again recently. Naval stuff is incoming but you have to pay to be able to test it (might be able to 'win' your way into it also by paying) and it looks as unbalanced as the rest of the game...I sort of reccomend the game but more often than not I don't :p			",189,23,11,27,34,5,52

												The problem with this game lies not with the game so much it self as it does with the company itself. Any problems that require their help meets resistance and if it is a billing issue all you get is pass the buck. This however does lead to the f2p problem of you can play for free but get no where in the grind unless you constantly maintain steady gold to buy premium at a high end of monthly fees even with their discounts. If you do play make sure you play russian cause every other nation is nerfed to them.Have a nice daybest regards			",46,2,0,14,11,0,16

												     Coming up on 500 hours, I thought that it was time I wite a review for this game. I am not here to complain about any of the game's issues, nor to attack the devs at Gaijin, although there are some disturbing stories about them. The puropose of this review is to state my thoughts on the game itself, describe it to people who haven't played it, and discuss it with people who have.     If you are thinking about playing this game, know that there is a bit of a learning curve. Should you decide to play, you will have to learn realistic strategies for piloting aircraft and driving tanks. That is not to say that the game is a history class, however. I consider myself a fairly casual gamer, and I got into the game without really a huge problem. There are currently two branches of the game, as I mentioned earlier: planes and tanks, with boats scheduled to be added soon. There are also three modes to play- Arcade, Realistic, and Simulater. Arcade is for extremely casuall players who don't really know how to play the game yet. Arcade mode also has reduced physics, as planes will turn faster, tanks will drive quicker, things like G force are not taken into account, players can respawn, and every vehicle is much easier to kill. Realistic is what the majority of average players play, as it offers (as the name suggests) more realistic phisics and in depth gameplay. Every plane and tank becomes different, and each get their respective roles more prominently (eg. turn fighter, light tank, etc) Simulater is for players who REALLY get into the game. In sim mode, you cannot go into third person view, and are locked into your cockpit or tank. They also attempt to recreate historical battles, such as the Battle of the Bulge. Personally I have been too scared to play simulater, and I feel like if I did, I'd need to invest in a joystick. In realistic, though, mouse aim works fine. Tanks      At the moment I don't reccomend tanks. The way the game works, every vehicle is sort of modular, made up of parts. So for example's sake, say we are driving a tank- If that tank's engine or suspension is hit, the tank will no longer be able to move. This is fine at a glance, and even makes the game very interesting in some cases, as you can be damaged heavily and still fight. However, in tank battles, it is quite annoying, and I will explain why. Crew members also count as parts of the vehicle, and they can be killed quite easily. In a tank, if your loader is killed, you will no longer be able to reload your main gun, and you are essentially a sitting duck. That's right, you get to sit and watch as other players slowly kill every peice of your tank untill finally they happen to hit your last crew member and finish you. Like i said, this is only my opinion. Many people find ground battles to be perfectly fine, even the main draw of the game. But personally I hate tank battles, and the only way I will ever join one is to bomb tanks from the cockpit of my attack plane. Aircraft      Aircraft are the main draw of the game for me. I have loved flight simulaters scince I was a kid, and this is one of my favorites. In Air Realistic Battles, you must learn about the plane you are flying, and about your enemy's planes as well. Each plane is good for something different, whether that is killing fighters, killing bombers, high altitude fighting, low altitide fighting, ground attack, the list goes on. There are several different ways to win air battles. Typically, you will be put into a Ground Strike mission. Killing ground units, bombing enemy bases, or killing every player on the other team are all ways to win. Some people will complain that Russians are fairly overpowered. While this may be true in tank battles, which I do not play much, or Arcade battles, where victory can come down to whoever has a bigger gun, I find that Russians are not extremely hard to deal with in Air RB. Russian planes tend to be the Jacks of All Trades, which can be bad if you don't know what your plane is good at yet, but that also means that they are the Masters of None, so if you do happen to know what your plane can do, you can win through strategy and planning typically. Grinding      The main grinds in this game respectively for air and ground battles are early cold war era jet fighters and main battle tanks. As of right now, the aircraft tech tree only goes into the late ninteen-fifties, while the tank tree goes a little farther, into the early seventies. It is unclear whether the developers intend to go farther into the cold war, or expand thier existing World War Two theme. Getting to the top tiers of the tech trees is a long trek. Many people complain that this ruins the game for them, as by the time you get to the final jets and tanks, you literally have to play hundreds of matches to unlock new ones. I personally do not mind the long grind, because it makes every tier more enjoyable to play, and it adds a sense of accomplishment when you finally do unlock a new vehicle. If you do not intend to play the game a lot, though, grinds like this may turn you away. The developers make money off this game by selling Golden Eagles, a type of premium currency which allows you to boost your research so you can get the next vehicle faster, or buy premium vehicles. These vehicles come with a large booster, allowing you to get that research faster, and reduce your grinding time. Many people believe that these vehicles are better than normal ones, but they don't make people invincible, and they can still be beaten even if it is harder in some cases. However, if you are patient, sometimes you can be rewarded with a tailsman for a vehicle that you already have without paying for premium. A tailsman will pretty much double the research you get from a vehicle, but they are very rare unless you buy them, and usually if you don't buy them, the game will give you one for a vehicle that you hate/don't use. Conclusion      If you took the time to read this whole review, thank you and I apologize if it seems long and disjointed in parts. Like I said, this is literally my thoughts about this game. In conclusion, this game can be great, but it isn't for everybody. Like I said, if you want to get into the game, you will have to learn about actuall millitary tech and realistic tactics to correspond with that tech. If you don't like that sort of thing, this may not be the game for you. If you read the old Tom Clancy books, like me, and you like that sort of thing, than it's actually pretty fun to read about the different vehicles and how to use them. Keep in mind that there are info pages for most of the vehicles in game, and there are countless guides here on Steam on how to play. It seems to me that the people who complain most about this game are the ones who either keep playing Arcade mode, or people who don't know a particular tank or plane's strength or weakness, which is not to say that those complaints are not legitimate. But if you're complaining because you just aren't good at the game, it doesn't ruin your skill, or make you a noob in any way if you have to look up a guide. One of the main goals in this game really is to learn about how to play, what style suits you best, and, above all, learn from your mistakes- if someone manages to kill you, instead of raging at Gaijin you should ask yourself why. I have 500 hours and i still look at guides all the time.			",66,4,0,7,5,0,7

												not for the feint hearted - I play the planes most often as I dont like the tank mode. Once you get behind someone, aslong as they have no tail gunners you have an almost guaranteed kill. However if someone gets on your butt, then its almost guaranteed you will get killed. Very frustrating, but im a crap pilot :) 10/10 would die again			",19,2,1,2,6,0,3

												The battle physics are really realistic. I love the combination of armored vehicles and warplanes in a battle, but there is one problem: why the hell can a tank drift? The tanks are so drifty that the tracks seem to provide minimal friction and I kind of lose control everytime I try to turn in full speed.			",12,1,0,1,0,0,6

												If you're going to play this game, play as russia or you won't enjoy it. The developers went to quite some length to make the game historically accurate, however they used WW2 military documents from Russia which blatantly lies about the effectiveness of their vehicles (this was very common during during WW2 because of new generals being afraid of a second purge by Stalin)However Gaijin will continually deny the games bias (even mocking people like me by adding titles for players like ""Master of Russian bias"") over and over and continue to let Russian tanks use post-war ammunition against overtiered German Tigers making their thick, but flat armor completely useless.That said, it is a fun game and a hella lot more realistic than anything Wargaming has spewed out, and its loved by masochists everywhere who enjoy getting let down by their team match after match. If I died tomorrow, I would want them to let me down one last time... into my grave.			",78,1,5,3,5,0,2

Warthunder is a great F2P game, and in most cases is not P2W in any way. However, It may be advisable (if you are playing anything other than Russia) to avoid all T-34s, YAKs, or any other Russian aircraft. They will kick your a@# win if you do encounter them without knowing a proper  GTFO evasion tactic.			",60,4,2,7,11,0,6

												This game has great mechanics, amazing graphics, and awesome potential, but it's a grind-fest unless you muster up enough dough to progress. The plane and tank mechanics are spectacular, and the integration of planes in tank combat missions gives this game a edge over similar titles. The objective system is well thought out and put together nicely, and the upgrade trees are thoughtfully designed as well, but with the amount of time you have to put in in order to get to the later levels and become truly competitive you may instead want to consider shelling out some cash to progress and get to some of the real fun. This game is totally playable as a free title though, but do not expect to get past WWII era tech quickly unless you buy micro-transactions. I recommend downloading and trying it out, and if you like it go ahead and spend a bit, the developers deserve it.			",238,24,21,18,27,5,25

												this game would have been brilliant exept for the company that makes it be warned if u play this on pc u have to make a new account if u want to play on ps4 and if you have a ps4 account u cannot play it on the pc version this game is a giant con in an alright wrapper and its only a beta with a active store if you like long grinds with aircraft that you lo0ve then play this as it should be free dont pay money in to this beta half of the aircraft dont even have there proper flight models mainly the russian aircraft which handle like ufos most obvious is when a mig 3 out turns a spitfire which could never happen as the mig 3 was an awful aircraft in real life and the amount of people spamming rockets at other aircraft is rage inducing and the russian bi planes which infest the lower levels and make the whole game uninjoyable. after switching to playing only realistic battles i am enjoying the game alot more dont play tanks World of Tanks is for that but play planes in realistic or sim only and the game is fun but the BR system is horrible and messed up. i am supporting the art team and the people who make the planes but i do not support gaijin as a whole they try pushing premium way to much and when it runs out if you got some for free they will bug you every 2 seconds and as i said the people behind the BR can stick it.

												Airplanes Side Review:      The Game has 3 modes to play with the airplanes in a big vereity of maps and modes. You can play Arcade mode, Realistic mode, and Simulator mode. I strongly recomend this game for any level of dogfighters because the Arcade is to easy for everyone to learn and the Realistic/Simulator mode is so good fitting for Veteran Players of dogfighting simulators.Tankdriving Side Review:     Again There are 3 modes to play the only difference is the simulator of the Tanks has a limmited amount of different tanks as its to be a Historical mode so to say you wont see a Mouse Tank on a simulator or any cold war tanks. Except if you play on a special event that happens every few weeks/monthsIn a nutshell this game is all about realistic fights (you might die in a 1 hit but you might get hit like a thousent times). For all those players looking for a better game then WoT That there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ammo that some tanks didnt even carried, an Engine that will block shots if you lay your tank correct in the battlefield. Then I Strongly Recomend this game for you!!! Have fun and enjoy this Beautiful game!!!P.S. If you get mad sometimes dont worry continue playing after a while you get better and it will get fun eventually			",164,30,2,20,16,0,22

It has great graphics and a fun play style. My only problem is that you can only have tanks and planes to use. You can't use a boat or even your own character. I do hope Gaijin add that in future updates. Besides that this game is a great MMO. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a good action game. ",96,11,1,17,8,0,6

												     Coming up on 500 hours, I thought that it was time I wite a review for this game. I am not here to complain about any of the game's issues, nor to attack the devs at Gaijin, although there are some disturbing stories about them. The puropose of this review is to state my thoughts on the game itself, describe it to people who haven't played it, and discuss it with people who have.     If you are thinking about playing this game, know that there is a bit of a learning curve. Should you decide to play, you will have to learn realistic strategies for piloting aircraft and driving tanks. That is not to say that the game is a history class, however. I consider myself a fairly casual gamer, and I got into the game without really a huge problem. There are currently two branches of the game, as I mentioned earlier: planes and tanks, with boats scheduled to be added soon. There are also three modes to play- Arcade, Realistic, and Simulater. Arcade is for extremely casuall players who don't really know how to play the game yet. Arcade mode also has reduced physics, as planes will turn faster, tanks will drive quicker, things like G force are not taken into account, players can respawn, and every vehicle is much easier to kill. Realistic is what the majority of average players play, as it offers (as the name suggests) more realistic phisics and in depth gameplay. Every plane and tank becomes different, and each get their respective roles more prominently (eg. turn fighter, light tank, etc) Simulater is for players who REALLY get into the game. In sim mode, you cannot go into third person view, and are locked into your cockpit or tank. They also attempt to recreate historical battles, such as the Battle of the Bulge. Personally I have been too scared to play simulater, and I feel like if I did, I'd need to invest in a joystick. In realistic, though, mouse aim works fine. Tanks      At the moment I don't reccomend tanks. The way the game works, every vehicle is sort of modular, made up of parts. So for example's sake, say we are driving a tank- If that tank's engine or suspension is hit, the tank will no longer be able to move. This is fine at a glance, and even makes the game very interesting in some cases, as you can be damaged heavily and still fight. However, in tank battles, it is quite annoying, and I will explain why. Crew members also count as parts of the vehicle, and they can be killed quite easily. In a tank, if your loader is killed, you will no longer be able to reload your main gun, and you are essentially a sitting duck. That's right, you get to sit and watch as other players slowly kill every peice of your tank untill finally they happen to hit your last crew member and finish you. Like i said, this is only my opinion. Many people find ground battles to be perfectly fine, even the main draw of the game. But personally I hate tank battles, and the only way I will ever join one is to bomb tanks from the cockpit of my attack plane. Aircraft      Aircraft are the main draw of the game for me. I have loved flight simulaters scince I was a kid, and this is one of my favorites. In Air Realistic Battles, you must learn about the plane you are flying, and about your enemy's planes as well. Each plane is good for something different, whether that is killing fighters, killing bombers, high altitude fighting, low altitide fighting, ground attack, the list goes on. There are several different ways to win air battles. Typically, you will be put into a Ground Strike mission. Killing ground units, bombing enemy bases, or killing every player on the other team are all ways to win. Some people will complain that Russians are fairly overpowered. While this may be true in tank battles, which I do not play much, or Arcade battles, where victory can come down to whoever has a bigger gun, I find that Russians are not extremely hard to deal with in Air RB. Russian planes tend to be the Jacks of All Trades, which can be bad if you don't know what your plane is good at yet, but that also means that they are the Masters of None, so if you do happen to know what your plane can do, you can win through strategy and planning typically. Grinding      The main grinds in this game respectively for air and ground battles are early cold war era jet fighters and main battle tanks. As of right now, the aircraft tech tree only goes into the late ninteen-fifties, while the tank tree goes a little farther, into the early seventies. It is unclear whether the developers intend to go farther into the cold war, or expand thier existing World War Two theme. Getting to the top tiers of the tech trees is a long trek. Many people complain that this ruins the game for them, as by the time you get to the final jets and tanks, you literally have to play hundreds of matches to unlock new ones. I personally do not mind the long grind, because it makes every tier more enjoyable to play, and it adds a sense of accomplishment when you finally do unlock a new vehicle. If you do not intend to play the game a lot, though, grinds like this may turn you away. The developers make money off this game by selling Golden Eagles, a type of premium currency which allows you to boost your research so you can get the next vehicle faster, or buy premium vehicles. These vehicles come with a large booster, allowing you to get that research faster, and reduce your grinding time. Many people believe that these vehicles are better than normal ones, but they don't make people invincible, and they can still be beaten even if it is harder in some cases. However, if you are patient, sometimes you can be rewarded with a tailsman for a vehicle that you already have without paying for premium. A tailsman will pretty much double the research you get from a vehicle, but they are very rare unless you buy them, and usually if you don't buy them, the game will give you one for a vehicle that you hate/don't use. Conclusion      If you took the time to read this whole review, thank you and I apologize if it seems long and disjointed in parts. Like I said, this is literally my thoughts about this game. In conclusion, this game can be great, but it isn't for everybody. Like I said, if you want to get into the game, you will have to learn about actuall millitary tech and realistic tactics to correspond with that tech. If you don't like that sort of thing, this may not be the game for you. If you read the old Tom Clancy books, like me, and you like that sort of thing, than it's actually pretty fun to read about the different vehicles and how to use them. Keep in mind that there are info pages for most of the vehicles in game, and there are countless guides here on Steam on how to play. It seems to me that the people who complain most about this game are the ones who either keep playing Arcade mode, or people who don't know a particular tank or plane's strength or weakness, which is not to say that those complaints are not legitimate. But if you're complaining because you just aren't good at the game, it doesn't ruin your skill, or make you a noob in any way if you have to look up a guide. One of the main goals in this game really is to learn about how to play, what style suits you best, and, above all, learn from your mistakes- if someone manages to kill you, instead of raging at Gaijin you should ask yourself why. I have 500 hours and i still look at guides all the time.			",66,4,0,7,5,0,7

												not for the feint hearted - I play the planes most often as I dont like the tank mode. Once you get behind someone, aslong as they have no tail gunners you have an almost guaranteed kill. However if someone gets on your butt, then its almost guaranteed you will get killed. Very frustrating, but im a crap pilot :) 10/10 would die again			",19,2,1,2,6,0,3

However, I wish I could say something negative about this (like the fact that it's supposed to be one of the most realistic games), but Dialn911 already took the cake on that one! Overall a good game, I'm just a little disappointed.			",108,20,0,33,7,1,4

												I've played War Thunder since it started it's beta. It has had its ups and downs but it is a good game. High tier planes/tanks are very grindy though. You will either need to put a lot of time/money into it if you want to get anything above tier IV. I would recommend this game!			",81,12,0,0,10,2,16

												My Warthunder Reveiw-Warthunder is a WW2/ Korean War  Plane and Tank ""simulator"" with an arcade style mode. its fun and has a relitivly nice  community. but many negative  reveiws point at issuses that arnt really issues. ie. late WW2 tanks in matches with korean tanks, jets with certain prop planes in the matches, and the devs not listening to their players.now here are some statments:-late WW2 tanks were in fact used after the war during korea as well as some prop planes from WW2 .-sloped aromour is a thing, watch a documentary about it, the devs tried their best to balance out the tanks.-the devs do listen to some player imput but not all of it, remember kids it is not your game. if you dont like it find another game.- its free to play there will be a grind.Otherwise have fun and enjoy .

Warthunder is a great F2P game, and in most cases is not P2W in any way. However, It may be advisable (if you are playing anything other than Russia) to avoid all T-34s, YAKs, or any other Russian aircraft. They will kick your a@# win if you do encounter them without knowing a proper  GTFO evasion tactic.			",60,4,2,7,11,0,6

												This game has great mechanics, amazing graphics, and awesome potential, but it's a grind-fest unless you muster up enough dough to progress. The plane and tank mechanics are spectacular, and the integration of planes in tank combat missions gives this game a edge over similar titles. The objective system is well thought out and put together nicely, and the upgrade trees are thoughtfully designed as well, but with the amount of time you have to put in in order to get to the later levels and become truly competitive you may instead want to consider shelling out some cash to progress and get to some of the real fun. This game is totally playable as a free title though, but do not expect to get past WWII era tech quickly unless you buy micro-transactions. I recommend downloading and trying it out, and if you like it go ahead and spend a bit, the developers deserve it.			",238,24,21,18,27,5,25

												Airplanes Side Review:      The Game has 3 modes to play with the airplanes in a big vereity of maps and modes. You can play Arcade mode, Realistic mode, and Simulator mode. I strongly recomend this game for any level of dogfighters because the Arcade is to easy for everyone to learn and the Realistic/Simulator mode is so good fitting for Veteran Players of dogfighting simulators.Tankdriving Side Review:     Again There are 3 modes to play the only difference is the simulator of the Tanks has a limmited amount of different tanks as its to be a Historical mode so to say you wont see a Mouse Tank on a simulator or any cold war tanks. Except if you play on a special event that happens every few weeks/monthsIn a nutshell this game is all about realistic fights (you might die in a 1 hit but you might get hit like a thousent times). For all those players looking for a better game then WoT That there are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ammo that some tanks didnt even carried, an Engine that will block shots if you lay your tank correct in the battlefield. Then I Strongly Recomend this game for you!!! Have fun and enjoy this Beautiful game!!!P.S. If you get mad sometimes dont worry continue playing after a while you get better and it will get fun eventually			",164,30,2,20,16,0,22

												this game is on of my fav games and it will be until a better ww2 game comes out im hyped for this new naval battle thing but its not fair that you have to pay for it some of us like me cant pay and we need to wait till we can play but ppl with passes and if they bought other cool naval ship things from their websites will be able to play wich they will get to know the ships and dominate us like we are 2 yo kids over all this game is a fun game ofc there are things to fix i cant really tell but there are few glitches but its not like gta 5 that you can get rekt by it. i recommend this game if you love ww2 this is a game you should play you dont really need a power full pc even my trash book pro can handle its. game makes you enjoy it by it self. still the beta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is a call of duty thing and i dont thing a game like this should have something like this ii know i dont have much time in this game but still acting like call of duty is a bad way to everyone who cant pay atleast make some ships for free dont care bout their power just wanna test them if some one can get this to devs of war thunder that would be amazing			",60,10,0,6,11,0,1

												This is one of the best war games i have ever played. I've played this game for 170 hours. If you dont belive me check my profile. Anyway back to the game. It has great graphics and a fun play style. My only problem is that you can only have tanks and planes to use. You can't use a boat or even your own character. I do hope Gaijin add that in future updates. Besides that this game is a great MMO. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a good action game. ",96,11,1,17,8,0,6

												the game is great and tond of fun with friends. The biggest issue I have for it is that at the higher tiers its just way to grindy to get the last few planes (jets). though the mid to high tier prop planes are honestly probably the most fun in the game anyways so dont get to caugh up on grinding for those jets no matter how badly you may want that horton 229. you will enjoy the game much more if you dont go for a grind. the paid planes are all interesting but none of them are in any way pay to win but they do give a great boost to research so if you are looking to get a  paid plane get the higher tier ones before the jets to make the last grind to those planes easier. (be warned they are pretty overpriced imo)			",32,2,0,4,5,0,9

												Had the game for more than a year, each time I try to run it it crashes. For the first 3 or 4 months it worked, and after that it was nothing but crashes and error messages, to the point that it started to require I totally restart my computer. Admittedly, I'm playing on a mac (though one well within the specs and by no means an old model), but in the past, I was able to play it absolutely fine. Now each time I try to run it it crashes on the launcher, and this has been the case for more than a year. Tried uninstalling/reinstalling over and over again. No luck. Still not able to play. Other than this, it was a great game. Seriously dissappointed that I can't play it, because I did actually enjoy it (although people are right that the progression if you don't spend real money takes an absurdly long amount of time, and specific countries are definitely over/underpowered). Free to play, but if you want to compete or unlock vehicles or make them actually worth using you're gonna have to drop some cash or a ton of time. Seems like they've made a ton of cool changes that I'd love to actually try, but I guess if I want to get any play in I'll have to go through the uninstall, then the long reinstall, then maybe get to play until I decide to take a break (maybe to sleep or eat), and then go through the whole process again. Maybe. Most of the time that doesn't even work.			",9,0,0,1,4,0,12

It has changed a bit since I first started playing, but War Thunder's immersive flight engine makes you feel like your smack in the middle of some of the craziest battles ever. The tank battle part of the game has evolved well since release and the mixed air ground battles are amazing when one consideres where this game started. Thumbs up.			",82,6,4,10,20,0,8

												I wanted to try this game for a long time, but was hesitant because I thought it'd probably be ridiculously hard and I'd end up not having fun with yet ANOTHER account for a game (I get sick of making accounts for everything under the sun).  The game actually is a lot of fun though, I've enjoyed every minute of it.  I primarily play with planes (the tank part of the game isn't bad, I just don't enjoy as much).  The more you play, the more planes you can get, and the more you can upgrade them and do a little bit of customization too.  You can do all of that without spending a penny, and not once have I felt like there wasn't someone who I couldn't beat.  I never come out of a game thinking, ""well, they won because they spent money on the game and I didn't.""  There are different game modes, different maps, and lots of different planes.  Has a pretty active community, and I've yet to encounter a salty player.  Definitely worth trying out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have over 250 hours into this game. I have played it a ton, i have multiple teir 4 planes and tanks, and was working on teir 5, but it just got way to bad. Gaijin has made the Russians unbeatable, the Germans impenatrable, and the UK, Americans, and Japanese ultra weak. I mean i come around a corner angled armor and everything and get one shotted from across the map by none other than a Kv-1 or a Marder II. It has gotten a worse and worse with each increasing update. Gaijin doesnt listen to their community of players and they act like children when you try to talk to a dev about a suggestion or about a problem ingame. They treat the players like crap. They claim realism, yet it gets farther and farther away from that with each update that they nerf some American plane, or tank from the UK... and increase the Russians and German planes and tanks.And then their is the maleware that is installed on your computer when you install the game, and good luck getting rid of it after you decide everything from the first paragraph is true. You will have to go deep into your hard drive to get it out. So my recommendation for this game is a do not play, unless you enjoy maleware, Massive Russian and German Bias, and children for Devs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												this is a time consuming game that you can play with friends or alone, you will also need to know about ww2 and onwards tanks and planes or be ready to learn more but it is a fun game, the damage engine works as it would in real life but the crew will stand in the tank and fight, the only non-realistic part because it make some tanks useless but again it is a fun tank and plane game i would suggest gathering a few friends(2-3) and playing the game.

												One of the best F2P titles, and one of my personal favorites.I don't get the cries over grinding, you can grind up to 150,000 in a couple of hours. Isn't that enough ? Do you just want to play for 5 minutes and get your desired vehicles ? Now this game has some ups and downs, like the unbalanced BR system and some ""Unrealistic"" realistic battles such as T-54 vs Tiger II. Everything else is good. Oh did I mention, with premium account/vehicles its very easy to grind.Stop thinking of premium content as ""P2W"" because it really isn't. It's a bit like pay to grind faster, but in the process you're funding the continuous development of the game.Edit: This isn't a fully detailed review, it's just a point of view.

												EDIT: =MOD= WolfMan thanks for giving me tips how to break my keyboard. Printscreened.If you love Mother Russia then you'll have a blast flying replica Russian UFOs with stalinium armour, if flying isn't to your taste then take to ground forces and stomp out tigers with your pre-war Russian tank (totally historically correct), but make sure not to have a flag on your tank else you might get teamkilled (oops!).In all honesty though, this game has become so unbelievably broken in recent patches that it isn't worth downloading. There are so many problems that Gaijin just out right ignore because it's a 'beta'.... which has had that title for multiple years now.If you like:Terrible match makingIncredibly long waiting timesTeamkillers/trollsHuge grind to get even low level tanksRepetitive maps/gameplayRussian bias that cripples every other nation that goes up against themThen you'll love this game!

												I only played it because it's the only game that has tanks that's even remotely realistic that I've found.I discourage playing this game because of the developer, Gaijin.German late (1944-45) Second World War tanks fight post-war (1946-53) Soviet and American tanks. You can see how that turns out. (There's also aircraft. Same deal.)Tiger Is and Panther ausf Ds face IS-3s on a regular basis.Oh, and the Russians get prototype aircraft which never saw service because the guns broke the aircraft.

												I just wanted to start off saying I had this game for three years, but only the steam version for one year, Keep this in mind. This game is such an amazing game, the graphics are beautiful. The dog fighting is amazing, and the planes, tanks, and soon naval ships are all from WW2! The game currently has a whole bunch of planes, and tanks from WW1 (which you start out with) all the way to the end of WW2. Now I know not every vehicle isn't in the game currently, but atleast Gajin is actually trying all the time to put more and more vehicles and content into the game. Although.. The game requires a lot of grinding. Ouch. If you don't like grinding, or dishing out money to unlock things. This game probably won't be for you. Yeah you get a little bit of Golden Eagles (Premium Currency that can fast unlock things, allow you to fly more planes during a match. Etc Etc) for doing the tutorials, but it's not a lot so spend them wisely, because once they're gone. you'll either have to invite a friend to earn more Golden Eagles or pay IRl $$$ to get more, but one thing that makes it a little bit better if you don't feel like playing money, is you just got log in every day you can unlock a crate for free to get a booster. You can get either a Silver Lion Booster (Silver Lion's is the currency you use for buying vehicles.) or XP. Now the graphics. The graphics are amazing. they look very realistic for a free to play game. The game even looks great on low end computers (don't worry I've been there) I used to play on a garbage laptop, and the graphics are good, and the performance was good too! on lowest I would get atleast 40+ FPS on a crappy laptop. So optimization is great on this game.All in all I would recommend anyone this game to those who like a realistic WW2 vehicle combat game. It may not suit everyone as there is a grind, but atleast the gameplay makes up for it.			",94,1,0,2,7,0,6

												Tank mode is♥♥♥♥♥♥because of Russian Bias, people who target you for calling Russian bias out, salt farm, and kids are all the reasons why you shouldn't play this mode. Air on the otherhand is good if you have fast planes, but bombers are underpowered and get 1 shot by most cannons. I don't remember cannons blowing the whole plane up when you shoot its tail. Would have to downvote it until bombers are better, or have less flame damage.Edit: Bombers are useless for your team unless you have 3 escorts because they still target you even though the escorts can shoot them down, unlike you.Edit 2: People are so desprate they follow you 10KM out of the fight just to get 1 kill and most of the time they have a * in their name which means they are a PS4 user, which most of them are under the legal age to play this game.

												Ground forces:>play german tank (Tier II, Pz III)>sneak up to a hostile tank (T34)>shoot him in the back 4 times, no penetration/no critical damage>guy turns around and oneshots mePlanes:>play german plane (Bf 109's)>have terrible maneuverability>feels like a flying schoolbus>get easily killed by pretty much everyone (especially russians and except for other germans, kek)1933/1945, if you have suicidal tendencies you better choose the Reich.

												Great battle mechanics, gameplay, realism.Personally I enjoyed playing arcade most of the time. The quick but fun battles are great. If you'd rather have uber realism then go into simulation mode. It is a pain in the *** but well worth it. ",81,24,1,13,3,0,11

												War thunder is getting better and better. It has Surpassed World of Tanks in many ways. It has Blown World of Warplanes out of the Water, and is probably going to desimate World of Warships once War Thunders Ships are released. Bug there are some downsides to this. Ground Forces tends to be laggy as hell, air to air combat is hard if your Tier matchups are incorrectly placed, and packet loss occurs way to often (its the result of having slow internetz) but otherwise best WWII and beyond simulator to play if you are a free to play WWII enthusiast ",6,0,3,0,5,0,2

												War Thunder is one of my all-time favorite games, and its free! War Thunder stands out among f2p's. You will have a great experience regaurdless if you throw in the entire treasury or not.  If you pay and think it will be so much better and fun and yay then you are WRONG, unless you have (or think that you have) skill. Your spitfire will be thrown into a match with a bunch of mindless Fw freaks that rip wreck all that moves intantly and grinds your pilot to dust with 20mm nuke shells. It can be frustrating.  Tier IV and V dont have super ideal matchmaking, but are still fun.  Arcade battles are great for beginners or anyone at all really. Realistic is very fun provided that you have the time, and Sim is so entirely a different experience. Do not play Sim with keyboard and mouse and expect anything good. Keyboard and mouse works flawlessly in arcade and the controls surpass any other flight controls known to man by worlds. The ""Russian Bias"" thing is really a stupid argument in my opinion.  People that say that they cant do any thing against the russian killing machines just are too bad at the game to defend themselves from something with good firepower, but im not saying that The early Ruskies are equal to the other low tier planes. The Russian tech tree has so many planes that it will take a very long time to progress, but it is rewarding.  There are many imbalances in the game, sure, but that changes nothing and I could care less about a Tigers in low tier III tan battles.  The Tiger takes 61000 rp to get so that is rewarding for players that use wallet or skill to get the tank. Also ramming is only a problem in low tiers when players have the idea that ramming is they key to world domination and also somehow world peace. If you are so picky about bullets in your windshield then just avoid head on engagements. War Thunder never requires money to progress, but Tier V is not for the weak or casual player. Tier I is where most players spend their time including experienced players. You will often find wolves amoung the noobish sheep.  Many level 30's and high 20's will play along and dominate the poor noobs. I play in Tier I on occasion and most of the time i place second to a lvl 50 hardcore tactical noobslayer.  War thunder never asks for your money or threatens to grind you into the ground unless you want to grind your way through all of eternity and more.  I made it into Tier IV without paying and then i just gave up on my attempt to get to tier V without paying and threw in some money to buy a tempest and some spits. If you spend money dont convert rp please dont put yourslef through that please. Just buy premium for a day and find a way to get as much rp out of that day as possible. The single player missions are meh at best but who cares thats not what war thunder is. The multiplayer is the only thing to do.  Before you ever play multiplayer deselect the russian sever ASAP it lags like a Po-2 and the players will smash through  [american] teammates to get a few shots towards n enemy fighter. About half of them can type english words into chat less that half can assemble something understandible and even fewer are the russians that speak perfectly good english, but spam the chat with russian cryllic chaos. Your tank will be flipped about 50% more often on the ru sever and almost every time (with very few exceptions) your tank will be flipped by a PS4 player.  When I play most of the US is sleeping besides PST and the only server that has players is the ru server.  Nothing feels better than ammo-racking a Tiger or oblterating an FW or just killing any enemy at all ever in a Yak9T. The game will run at good speeds on most any not garbage computer on horrific graffics, but with a good computer the visuals can be breathtaking. Avoid the forums at all cost! There is nothing good about them unless you speak Russian. The title updates are always packed with content and it seems that the game improves every time. There are about just as many glitches as there are patches in an update, but hey, thats just the fun of open beta. The communications to the English speaking community is separated by an iron curtain. I have heard of ""scouts"" that will try to salvage something from their infinite Russian info and tell the English speaking-ers about it. Being involved in a clan is good. Im not exactly in an active clan and im the highest ranked player on the clan and i joined the clan on the second day of its birth, but im still a private. I single-handedly carried us onto the leaderboards to about 180somethingth place. It does earn you some cred and a little (little) respect in game because most of the non grunt players on a clan are significantly better than everyone else. Try to get into an ACTIVE clan if you are good enough. War Thunder needs more skill to balance out the noobs and to stop people complaining about rammers. It doesn't matter if you like simulator games or flight or historical games or whatever, if you like fun then the chances are you will like War Thunder. I hope this helps and if you managed to read this block of text good for you I guess. If you aren't downloading the game by now then what do you think that play button is for?			",34,5,1,8,9,0,1

												I do love this game and i have spent a lot into it without using any money, im in tier 3 in all of my countries with planes and tier 2/3 in tanks. It says that i have spent like 2000h into this game but i mostly just have the game on when im gone. this game is very fun but i have to say that some trees are underpowered like the japs, all there early planes are♥♥♥♥♥♥ there is one hevy fighter that can acctualy kill anything. The russians are overpowered and in real life there where getting shrekt by the germans Fw and bf 109. The time it took for me to get to tier 3 i germans took double the time than it did for me with the russians, even if they have a little bit more planes. They are the fastest planes in tier 1 and 2 and they have alot of ammo, good manuverbilty and there guns are overpowered, the I-16 type 24 is overpowered as♥♥♥♥♥♥and it has a pritty low battle rating if you ask me. the Yak-9K is deadly as ♥♥♥♥, they one kill almost every plane and if you miss, you can just hold the mouse button and you will hitt for sure. The russian two enginge plane has the biggest bomb-load, like for real 5000kg. and they have the fastest jet in the game when they didn't have any good jet tec until the fiftys... I whould run around on the street asking people to play this game if it wasn't balansed. The russians use tanks from 10 years after the war against german late war tanks. And they think its the only way to even it out....			",66,1,0,1,9,0,11

												Plane Ramming Simulator 2013 is the lastest and greatest in ultimate ramming technology. Your objective is to prevent the other planes from completing their objectives by colliding your plane with theirs (a bonus is rewarded if it's a teammate).There are 5 different nations to play as but I almost always pick the japanese because they are the only planes that actually have ramming incorporated in their design, all the other nations include weird mechanics such as ""shooting enemy aircraft"" and ""bombing ground units"" Features like this don't have a place in Plane Ramming Simulator 2013There is a diverse list of planes to fly such as the P-39N-0 Ramcobra, the Ramfire mk II and my personal favourite the G8N1 Ramzan (for its size and ramming capacity). Unfortunately there're certain aircraft in this game that don't live up to my expectations, one particular example are all the reserve russian biplanes that are just too damn difficult to ram, hell I can't even hit those things with my PBY-5 Ramalina, it's almost as if they're made for dog fighting or something...Nevertheless, Plane Ramming Simulator 2013 is a very joyful experience, no game has ever had me yelling ""BANZAI"" so loud as I complete the objective and hear my teammates yell encouraging support like ""stop ******* ramming"" and ""you ******* rammer""I give this game a 12 out of 9For all you new players out there, Dont use 37 mm cannons! there's no skill involved and no one likes it...

												I try to keep this review as simple as possible.I have literally spent 3 years of my life with 1300 hours of gametime to favour this game. Because I'm essentially a plane lover, history lover especially one dated back to World War 2, and when I found out about this game I was so overhyped that I can play and piloted my one of the most anticipated aircraft, P51, along with other planes in Germans, Soviets, Brits, and Japs.Back then, 2-3 years ago, before the Ground Forces came in, the game was literally balanced. Without the Battle Rating (BR), the match are meant for those aircrafts within that tier. For example, the B17 was and always meant in tier 4, but with this new BR system, you have to literally face the jets from tier 5 from Germans. I understand in real life the B17's are indeed have to face the Me262 but does in any way you can nerf the 30mm guns? People are complaining about this BR system and Gaijin seems to unaware about this situation. For those who want to try out this game, I can asure you, you will have fun to play this game for your whole life, but that's only limited for lower rank AIRCRAFT. After that, you will have to grind up the lion currencies just to get to tier 4. Tier 5 will take forever for you to research.Oh, not to mention the tanks are awful in lower tier. If you're not experience enough, you'll instantly get one-shot-killed especially when you want to take cover after the enemy's rushing to cap the points. You will not know where the heck the shot was came from and you respawn another lower tier tank and BOOM, one-shot-killed. You will finished under like 10 minutes of gametime and you'll instantly rage quit because of that. I recommend to do some practices and keep grinding experiences.Enjoy the game before Gaijin f this up.			",28,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hopelessly biased towards Allied aircraft. Pointless to play Axis aircraft at all, as their merits are few and unredeeming. The most enjoyable matches I had were in the reserve aircraft, but once you get past that initial hook it becomes glaringly obvious that the game is completely unbalanced in favour of the Allies. The one and only quality this F2P game has that perhaps differs from others is that there appears to be no P2W features and the grind itself is not as lengthy as the (few, in my experience) other F2P MMOs I have played. PS: Never played the Ground Forces component, but from what I hear it is not dissimilar.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing this game for almost two years now, almost everyday, for the most part. Don't let the 27.9hrs lie to you, because I obviously played it before it was even on Steam, by downloading it directly from their website and utilizing their launcher.Let me just give you the general idea of my opinion. I liked it, it was good, very good, and now it's worsening, every day, every update, and it might just keep going that way, unless they change that, of course. At first, there we tiers, and loads of them, from 1-20. You gained experience to unlock more tiers, which granted you more planes, as long as you played the desired nation. By default, they granted you at least, each time you leveled up the nation, more than five planes (including attackers, bombers, fighters and others). You had Arcade Battles, which I started off playing first, just to get the feel of it, and then I moved into Historical Battles (known now as Realistic Battles....bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s ruined it...). In Historical Bttles, I had loads of fun with role-playing with others, pretending to only have one life, achieving the objective, and what-not. Full-Real Battles, I never played, but they were on a separate match-making, unlike now, where they are EVENTS. So, in general: NO GRIND, 20 TIERS, GOOD ECONOMY, NO P2W. I won't indulge you all with the Russian Bias that supposedly envelops the game, as I don't believe in it, but that's my opinion. Anyways, it was a marvel. I'll leave it to there, so you all have an idea of what made the game good. The game first attracted me when I saw a video of FrankieonPCin1080p about the game, as he was introducing it and it literally caught my attention very quickly, given the fact that I have always loved avaition and I had been looking for a GOOD, EASY-TO-ADAPT-TO simulator that include the general satisfaction of flying a plane, shooting down others, and what-not. This game delivered it. His video was released on March 3, 2013 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaUTarnCHeQ&ab_channel=FRANKIEonPCin1080p), and I started playing around after April or so, because I know I missed that year's April Fools (My Little Pony 'Planes'). It was a good experience, and I leveled up fast, gained planes fast, and I DIDN'T need to pay in order to get good planes. It was all about Silver Lions and Experience Points, and nothing more. There was no grind, and it seemed nice. Then the Fire Nation atta--... I mean, then came a patch that ruined it all, condensed those 20 tiers into 5 Ranks. Yes, you heard that right,...from 20 to 5, and then they added Battle Ratings, which basically decides the way the matchmaking plays out by 'rating' each plane and tank. 1.0 is for biplanes and reserves, and up goes the numbers as you ascend with the ranks. 1.0 goes gainst 1.0 and 1.3's, I presume, so it's a stretch, and it just doesn't work. Historical battles were changed to REALISTIC battles, which held the altered physics model and behavior of the plane, but removed the HISTORICAL part from the scenario, as you now get into mixed battles (Japan against Germany, USSR with Germany against USA) and it just ruins the immersion. Full-Real Battles, now named Simulator Battles, are now EVENTS, and it restricts everyone wanting to play it if you don't have the right tanks, or planes. The economy went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Pardon me for the words, but it did. Now you don't need Experience Points, now you need Research Points, because now you unlock ONE plane, or ONE tank, at a time, by researching them first (GRINDINNGGGGGG that ♥♥♥♥♥) and then buying them. So, yea, it's worse. Thank God for the 20 Tiers, because if it hadn't been for that, I wouldn't have Rank IV in each Nation with Planes (with Rank V in USA with the F2H-2). Tanks is another story...  I wouldn't recommend this game, but you should give it a try, and see if you like it. I am an old player, and don't like it anymore as much, but I still play it when I get the urge to fly, every so often. I haven't played it for days now. Give it a try.Edit 1: Grammar.

												loved the game at first but as time went on ( a very short time )I guess I went up in level, does not tell you by the way. and I guess I am up against very good player I played one tank battle had 42 hits in tank battles but no kills, but was killed 3 times with just 3 hits, I would say something is very wrong with this game. I have other thing to do then to be very frustrated with a game. Its suppose to be fun not something that I get disgusted with. Same thing with the air battles I keep hitting the other player with hits but never shoot them down but I go down with just a one hit... They say no cheating going on in game but just played a game. me and a T34 we were facing off a wall between us I got of 2 shots one hiting his tracks the second shot hits his track again. Then he pokes his head around and I go to take the shot again and the gun will not work he slowly comes around knowing I can't shoot squares the tank around and shots me dead. don't tell me cheating is not going on in this game. I was not shot I had no damage and the gun was reloaded.			",38,0,0,1,15,0,15

												I've been playing this game for a while. I've spent money on tanks and premium. Now they have upadated the game, everything I have purchased is now♥♥♥♥♥♥ So unless I pay even more money, I wont be able survive long each round. Think of the developers as Mafia, they will always look to extort money from you. As of 2016, War Thunder is an average game that offers nothing new unless you pay way over the odds to allow it to let you win.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want a game that never fixes bugs and adds in ridiculous premium vehicles to steal your money, this is the game for you, but not for me. I am very sad to see this game die because this game used to be amazing, but now its just a shell of its former self. In the past updates they have buffed airplane models so they are a flying tank, and hit reg is a complete disaster. But dont worry about this because you will have a shiny new toy to play with when the next update rolls out.			",29,1,1,1,8,0,2

												loved the game at first but as time went on ( a very short time )I guess I went up in level, does not tell you by the way. and I guess I am up against very good player I played one tank battle had 42 hits in tank battles but no kills, but was killed 3 times with just 3 hits, I would say something is very wrong with this game. I have other thing to do then to be very frustrated with a game. Its suppose to be fun not something that I get disgusted with. Same thing with the air battles I keep hitting the other player with hits but never shoot them down but I go down with just a one hit... They say no cheating going on in game but just played a game. me and a T34 we were facing off a wall between us I got of 2 shots one hiting his tracks the second shot hits his track again. Then he pokes his head around and I go to take the shot again and the gun will not work he slowly comes around knowing I can't shoot squares the tank around and shots me dead. don't tell me cheating is not going on in this game. I was not shot I had no damage and the gun was reloaded.			",38,0,0,1,15,0,15

												For me, this is one of the most entertaining games out there.  I come from an Xbox 360 background and IL-2 Sturmovik and Birds of Steel were some of the best flight experiences that I've ever had.  No none of these games are considered a ""simulator"" but that doesn't mean anything really.  Most simulators have an incredibly daunting learning curve, and so does War Thunder, but you don't need to know everything about an airplane to go about dogfighting and having a blast.  The thing that makes this game stand out is the graphics.  Some of the most incredible graphics I've ever seen in ANY game.  I'm also getting well over 120 frames per second and never anything below 120.  I've never experienced ANY lag what-so-ever and this is a big plus for me as some of my favorite games just break when it comes to online experiences.  The community on War Thunder is pretty spectacular as well.  I've always had good relations with those who chat online.  I'd like to say that I haven't played much of the tanks side, but when it comes to the airplanes there's one special feature that makes me warm and cozy inside...  that's the SINGLE PLAYER aspect.  Unlike a lot of free-to-play games out these days, War Thunder offers an entirely customizable single player experience that helps with the learning curve.  You're able to test flight any plane you are currently researching.  There are a large amount of single player missions which allow you to fly some of the higher tier planes you haven't unlocked yet.  Dynamic campaigns.  The list goes on... but lastly, most if not all of these single player missions and campaigns can be played cooperatively as well.  There's just so much to be said about these features because a lot of free-to-play games make you play online therefore never getting any real time to learn and train yourself for online encounters.  For example simply landing your aircraft is not something you want to learn how to do in online gameplay.  You will not only hurt your stats, but your team's stats as well and the community may not be so spectacular to you if you do such things.  Learning your airplane before taking it into battle is important as each plane behaves differently especially when shooting your machine guns and cannons.  Some target practice is definitely in order.  There's always a huge amount of players playing especially on arcade but I prefer the Realistic modes at the moment because I do like a bit of third person flying.  If War Thunder was more like Birds of Steel though I'd be happier because in BOS you could play in simulator (full real) and play third person... but Realistic in War Thunder is much harder than Realistic was in BOS so I'm fine with that.  Plus there's just not many people playing on Full Real so the wait times can be a pain.  Furthermore, this game does have ground units and does seem pretty awesome and I'll give them a shot someday but until then I'll stay in the air where I'm best suited.  Give this game a shot if you are at all interested in World War 2 weaponry.  I do recommend at least mapping a controller with this game but the game is very well optimized for keyboard and mouse but I just can't stand that.  I'd really love if my Hori EX2 flight stick worked with Windows 7 but an Xbox 360 controller will have to do for now.  Overall:  VERY recommended.			",86,8,19,1,29,1,20

												I'd say I've played this game too much, but I feel that isn't actually possibleWar Thunder is the fantastic WWII vehicular combat 'pseudo-simulator' made by Gaijin Entertainment. This isn't the developers first rodeo with WWII vehicle simulation. They also made the older IL-2 Sturmovik games, Wings of Prey and Wings of Luftwaffe.I can say with certainty that the good qualities from those games definitely transfered to War Thunder, namely their extremely realistic flight and damage models (specifically in the 'simulator battles' game mode). Another quality that has transfered is the minimalistic combat UI, that doesnt crowd your screen, but still conveys all of the important information about your aircraft, and what isn't shown on the UI, is shown on the in-game gauges in the cockpit.Even though these qualites that transfered are awesome, these aren't all that make War Thunder absolutely epic. Another important quality is the absolutely stunning and beautiful graphics and surprising attention to detail in their physics engine.The biggest, and most important quality (for me anyway) is the impressive immersion the game drags you into. Now, I have a TrackIR from playing ARMA, and that in simulator battles makes the entire experience amazing, and I imagine a joystick would only aid in this immersion (I intend to get one!).Not only is the aerial combat impressive, the game also has extremely fun ground-based combat consisting of primarily tanks, and they intend to add naval combat in the coming years.Now the obvious ""elephant in the room"" is it's main competitor. World of Tanks / Warplanes / Warships created by Wargaming.net. Personally, I feel that the 'Ground Forces' component of War Thunder and World of Tanks are too different to be directly compared, and must be viewed separately.War Thunder GF is for fans of accuracy, physical realism and more realistic combat and vehicular behavior, where World of Tanks is a more competitive, fast-action, timing / strategical placement game. Different strokes for different folks, pick your posion, etc... The aerial component of World of Warplanes isn't even worth mentioning, but it has to be refferenced... War Thunder's aerial combat crushes WoWP in it's fingers... The final component of both games is the Naval component. World ofWarships is only in early alpha, but is looking pretty damn great. I can't help but wonder how Gaijin's counterpart will hold up to WoWS...Regardless (TL:DR): Play this damn game... It's free, it's fun, it's epic...			",230,25,7,8,47,3,39

												I use to love this game, until i got to tier 5 and start seeing all HEATFS shell users penetrating anything even my IS-4 gets penned frontally and one or two shotted. Sloped and bouncy tanks like t54 versions dont work very well as everyone know every single weak spot so as long as ur not moving ur dead. Backing up aka pickaboo tactics dont work with medium tanks as their reverse speed is 5kmph which is horrible.Heavy tanks that should be able to soak some dmg and take beating before going down can be one shoted without problems and even if not you will be heavily damaged, not being able to move or shoot, turn turret or you name it. Repairs take way too long to work while ur engaged in combat.Biggest problem with this game is developer Gajiin not listening to their players. While everyone is asking for additional tier matchmaking tier from 8.0 to 9 or higher and lowering MM spread from 1.0 to 0.7 for monts they do oposite and shrink tiers from 8.0 to 7.7 making cold war era tanks like T-10m and Leopard fight against IS2, Tiger 2 etc, its literaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move from developer proving not just that they dont listen to their playerbase but that they are clueless as♥♥♥♥♥Problems with this game could be solved quite easily if developer would separate tanks that use HEATFS shells, increase battletiers and shrink MM to 0.7. Game would be sooooo much more enjoyable and fun for everyone.Game is not p2w in any aspect, yes you can pay to get faster progress and stuff like that but nothing that non paying user cant get. Well i got max tier veliches and i didnt pay more then few euros just for fun. But it can be tedious and very grindy on tier 5 tanks, to get them and expecially to upgrade them to point where they can be useful, as most tier 5 tanks stock are pretty much usless.Now im seeing new big patch that introduced some fancy things but they all stay in shadow of new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move by developer to nerf zoom optics by half, now i did not have chance to test it in game as i already unistalled it until, or better say IF its fixed. But looking on other player comments its yet another step back in runing this game.			",20,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because I'm essentially a plane lover, history lover especially one dated back to World War 2, and when I found out about this game I was so overhyped that I can play and piloted my one of the most anticipated aircraft, P51, along with other planes in Germans, Soviets, Brits, and Japs.Back then, 2-3 years ago, before the Ground Forces came in, the game was literally balanced. Without the Battle Rating (BR), the match are meant for those aircrafts within that tier. For example, the B17 was and always meant in tier 4, but with this new BR system, you have to literally face the jets from tier 5 from Germans. I understand in real life the B17's are indeed have to face the Me262 but does in any way you can nerf the 30mm guns? People are complaining about this BR system and Gaijin seems to unaware about this situation. For those who want to try out this game, I can asure you, you will have fun to play this game for your whole life, but that's only limited for lower rank AIRCRAFT. After that, you will have to grind up the lion currencies just to get to tier 4. Tier 5 will take forever for you to research.Oh, not to mention the tanks are awful in lower tier. If you're not experience enough, you'll instantly get one-shot-killed especially when you want to take cover after the enemy's rushing to cap the points. You will not know where the heck the shot was came from and you respawn another lower tier tank and BOOM, one-shot-killed. You will finished under like 10 minutes of gametime and you'll instantly rage quit because of that. I recommend to do some practices and keep grinding experiences.Enjoy the game before Gaijin f this up.			",28,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ok now dont get me wrong i love this game i really do and im still going to play it because i love tank and air battles but this game is by no means realistic gaijin themselfs stated they made the russian planes and tanks more powerful than other countrys because they didnt want to anger there russian players and because the russians apparently had better technology during ww II which we all know is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so gaijin refuses to fix there game and thats sad because that makes this game a missed oppurtunity but if you are ok with being ass♥♥♥♥ed as anybody besides the russians then this is a great game but if not well dont bother downloading it			",67,3,0,10,4,0,1
