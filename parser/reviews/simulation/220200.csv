								One day my daughter came home from school and asked me ""Have people actually travelled to the Moon?  How is it possible?""Two years ago, I would have answered ""yes, but I don't really know how.  It's very complicated, with lots of math and science.  You might learn about it in a physics class in 10 years time.""Instead, I answered ""Here, let me show you."" and fired up Kerbal Space Program.  We built a moon rocket and launched it, me steering and she hitting the separation detonation buttons when needed.  30 minutes later we had landed on the moon.Thank you, Squad, for enabling me to give that answer.

												My 8 year old son broke away from Minecraft today. He sat on my lap while we made a rocket. He asked questions about rockets. We made it into space and he asked, ""Are we in space?"" We came down and the friction caused our heat shield to glow. His eyes were wide open as we slowed down. We pressed the space bar to deploy our parachutes but were going too fast and our chutes failed. We crashed and he asked if the kerbal was OK. I said yes as I hit ESC and went back to the VAB and changed a few things. A few minutes later, we landed our capsule safely and he had the biggest smile on his face. I haven't heard a word about Minecraft since! Thank you for making this wonderful game!!!			",33,5,0,9,12,0,12

												Words alone cannot express how amazing KSP is.To be honest, this is not a game for everyone.  If you are in the market for some fast-paced ""space combat sim"" with all kinds of weapons and big explosions, then this isn't what you are looking for.  (Except for the big explosions... KSP has you covered there).However, if you ever dreamed of actually being an astronaut, this is definitely for you.  If you sometimes forget to breath when watching recordings of the Apollo moon landings, this is definitely for you.  If precise, measured flying; careful planning; and delta-v budgeting are what drives you, this is definitely for you.  If you want to learn about Orbital Mechanics and are dying to know what the Oberth Effect or a Hofman Transfer Orbit are, this is definitely for you. If you like Physics, this is definitely for you.Optionally, if you just like building rediculously large rockets and watching them explode with glorious comedy when they fail catastrophically because you forgot ONE PART... then this is also definitely for you.Kerbal Space Program is challenging, fun, frustrating, mind boggling, huge, hilarious, complicated, deep, and just plain awesome.

								1st hour playing: WHAT DO I DO WHY IS IT BLOWING UP400th hour playing: If my calculations serve me right with this T/W ratio It will take me 1 minute 43 seconds to burn at my periapsis to reach duna insertion at which point I will get into an eliptical equatoral orbit and perform an aerobrake at 16km to get into a steady circular orbit and then I will descend with one of my 4 spaceplanes I took to go to the north pole at which I will set up base at my already existing rover while getting TAC resources to monitor life support and make sure my colony of 212 kerbals can live.11/10Edit because for some reason this gained popularity, proper review:Pros:Endless fun, so much to do. Bored of building rockets? Build a space plane! Fed up of the mun? Go to Duna! Don't want to leave the atmosphere? Build whatever you want! The list goes on!Fantastic modding community and fantastic mods. So much more expansion on an already amazing game.Fantastic community in general, some of the nicest people I've met have came from this game. They are such a helpful bunch and I'm glad I'm with them! They'll most likely love to help you. There's also a bunch of fantastic YouTubers such as Scott Manley and others... (too many to name) :)YOU CAN LEARN STUFF FROM THIS AND GAIN NEW INTERESTS! Before I played this I had no interest in space or space exploration whatsoever but now I actively follow space news and am quite knowledgable on the subject. I have also learnt a fantastic deal of orbital mechanics just from playing and learning the game.Cons:The engine and optimisation. This game uses Unity and it only uses 1 CPU core. This can be a major problem if running a multicore with low clock speed. The 32bit version of the game is a whole lot more stable but limits your RAM meaning that if you have a ton of mods you can run into a lot of crashes but thankfully there are mods out there such as ATM (Active Texture Management) and texture replacer to limit the amount of RAM the game uses. 64bit as of now is still pretty unstable with mods.The learning curve and tutorials. The learning curve on this game is huge, I'm not complaining much about this one as rocket science isn't exactly easy is it? You can learn from trial and error and it's how I learnt alot but some things you just have to read up about or watch a tutorial on youtube. There isn't really much of a tutorial in game either.Conclusion: Buy it. It's really fantastic.			",218,30,12,22,34,1,18

To remove any doubts, this is by far THE best space simulator out there. The Good Amazing learning experience Choose where you want to go, with what, when, and how. HUGE planets to discover, literally, thousands upon thousands of kilometers to walk, drive, or fly your epic creations (or, if your not very creative, preset or other players' ships) Create awesome rockets, landers,ore collection/ astronaut housing bases on other planets, and spaceplanes, the way you want them Fun science mode to work your way up, earning ""science"" in order to get better equipment and rocket parts (I recommend for newish players who know at least basic orbits / how to get to the Mun) ""Creative"" mode where all parts are unlocked (great for testing and trying new things) ""Career"" mode for those really wanting a challenge (balance economy, science, and reputation for your own space organization, I recommend having a little more experience before jumping right in) The Career mode adds A LOT of purpose to the game, as well as adding new challenges such as having to make landings in certain locations, sending satellites in specific orbits, making space stations at specific altitudes, placing a flag on a certain body, collecting ore from a planet, etc. They are still adding to this game... Additionally, there are several user created mods that really expand on the experience, adding new parts or game mechanics. Built off of real physics! One doesn't just lop space junk up into the sky; one must deliver that space junk the realistic and correct way, thus rendering Kepler and Newton proud!!! (generally speaking, it allows one to see how actual launches and orbits work in the real world) Many other great aspects to this game (however, this would be a long list with all of them)The Bad Graphics aren't the best, however, they are still good and create a real sense of depth and can deliver a ""lost-in-space"" kind of a feel... It makes me feel so small compared to the vastness of our world. Plus, the graphical style really fits the style of the overall game.  Somewhat steep learning curve- It took me a while to learn to get to the ""Mun."" After this achievement, it was a lot easier to get to Minmus after this. It was difficult to get to Duna, however, once I got there, I have gradually learned enough to go pretty much anywhere and have made a permanent base on Laythe complete with science lab, crew pod and a brand spanking new air breathing engine jet transport, as well as a souped up Rover for them to drive. I have been to almost all of the planets. So basically, it takes time to get ""good"" at this game, but I assure you, it's rewarding and so spectacular to see how huge this world is (And this one is scaled down, too!). However, new tutorials should be very helpful for the beginner.  not too much music (it's still good, just gets repetitive sometimes) (*ahem* devs please add more music)  Getting to further out planets can take a long time, because it is a little more difficult and takes more resourcefulness... (several hours if your like me and really take your time, especially if you send a 3 manned mission to Eeloo... [you'll get faster the more experience you get though])Overall, this is a wonderful simulator offering a lot of real science with fun, providing lots of hours of engaging gameplay. I am so happy the developers have successfully brought this amazing game out of beta. I have purchased this game so long ago, and the updates have vastly improved the game and have solved many of the problems I have dealt with. Thank you for reading this book of a review, and I hope this really helps. Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions, I have over 400 hours logged and played the demo for several hours. I will try to get to them as soon as possible. Happy Kerballing!!! ",57,0,0,2,11,0,3

								This certainly was the best 20 Euros ever spent on a game. I love this game, its learning curve and its modability.Here a few pointers to help you decide:1. If you love astronomy and space exploration, this game is for you!You can do everything you have read and fantasized about. Build any rocket, no matter how stupid the concept may look at first and then try it out in the cold hard reality of space.2. The game has a very steep learning curve and will constantly challenge you.You will learn a lot about orbital mechanics, why staging is absolutely necessary and how to conserve fuel. If you don't, you probably won't make it into orbit, much less to the Mun or even other planets. Even after more than 600 hours of playing Kerbal Space Program, I'm learning stuff the hard way by losing vehicles and Kerbals.3. The game developers actively encourage modding and the modding community is breathtakingly awesome.The modability of this game is the hidden strength of this game. Without it, I wouldn't have played it half the time I actually did and wouldn't have enjoyed it as much at the same time.The first time you play through the career mode (meaning you unlock all the technologies) you should play it without any mods, just to learn the basics, look how the game behaves, etc., but after that you should really check out the Kerbal Space Program forums mod section (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/forums/35-Add-on-Releases-and-Projects-Showcase ), KerbalStuff (http://beta.kerbalstuff.com/ ) and/or the Curse Mod Page (http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal ). There's mods for so many aspects of the game...Want to play in more realistic solar system where it's harder to even get into orbit? Check.Want to have more realistic (= punishing) aerodynamics? Check.Want to have rocket parts for even larger rockets? Check.Want to have some autopilot capabilities to assist you with repetitive tasks? Check.Want to mine for fuel and ores on distant celestial bodies? Check.Want to have a warp drive? Also check.There's so many more which you should probably explore for yourself. The replayability of this game is great, thanks to all those mods. The community forums are also really great and helpful.If you play this game, please make sure you don't forget to mod it at some point, really!You should not play this game,  - if you don't like space sims to be too realistic. Again: You will have to learn at least basic orbital mechanics which means the strongest force around is not your ship's drive, but gravity. And a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥ she is indeed... - if you don't enjoy learning stuff the hard way by explosions, disintegrations and death. There is no perfect rocket. At some point stuff will blow up and you will have to start a whole mission again. - if you don't like games that are still in development. There will be new versions released every now and then, so things change from time to time. For example, when the game was upgraded from 0.22 to 0.23, the whole science system got a rework and a lot of my rockets that were built specifically for science grinding became useless. The update was great though, since it got rid of grinding altogether.I hope you enjoy this game as much as I still do. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is an incredible game, I've almost got 300 hours into it and I'm still looking forward to firing it up nearly every day.There's a lot of reasons to buy this game:* if you love space, this game will get you there, first hand, and let you have your hand at designing space crafts (and planes), flying them, and of course, crashing them in big glorious explosions* you will learn a lot about space, physics, orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, etc... this really happens, I have two friends that are rocket scientists (one does ion drive research, the other designs micro-satellites, I work at a large university), and after playing this game for a few months, I could easily talk to them about their work, where they drop terms like ISP, TWR, retrograde, normals, etc, terms that I now fully understand* the game is very approachable, you can play in ""career mode"" which walks you though the beginning steps of putting a rocket into space, to orbiting, to visiting the Mun and beyond. If you need more help, the YouTube scene is quite impressive, with people like Scott Manley producing really professional (and charming) video tutorial series. I am not a lover of simulation-type games, I play mostly FPS's and RPG's, but I found this game quite easy to pick and up get into.* while approachable, this game is certainly not easy, for example, landing and returning from Eve (the Venus-like planet in the Kerbin system) is one of the hardest tasks in the game, and while most of the game is fairly non-stressful in its nature, landing spaceships is a tense experience, especially when Jeb's life is on the line! For those that find it difficult to master some of the more difficult tasks, there are impressive control mods like MechJeb2 where you essentially point at a spot on a planet and press the ""Land There"" button, MechJeb does the rest.* the game has a unique charm to it, in the game you are progressing through the space race for the people of the Kerbin panet, you'll get to know and love the kerbalnauts that will fly your craft, especially Jebediah Kerman, pilot extraordinaire and fearless hero to the Kerbin people* the community for this game, is active, organized, and quite friendly, mostly found on Reddit and the Squad forums, you can get any question answered, or read mission reports from someone's latest mission, or get news on upcoming updates for the game. The only time you see people getting belligerent on these forums is when some is misbehaving toward othersSquad is actively developing this game, each release (every new months) bringing a lot of new features and parts to build with, and just this week the update to KSP brings many new rocket parts built in collaboration with NASA plus a mission to save Kerbin from killer asteroids!* the mod scene for this game is extremely impressive, from new real-life inspired rocket parts (so you can build your own Saturn V), to impressive new systems that enable for example planetary mining (so you can get more fuel on route to your target), to just plain fun mods like the nuclear pulse rocket, which explodes varied-sized nuclear bombs behind a large plate to produce thrust (scientists actually design this beast in the 50's)* the endgame is rich and deep: once you've completed career mode, many KSP players switch to the realism mods, which give you the real solar system, truly deadly reentries, realistic communication constraints (that require building satellite networks), more realistic aerodynamics modeling (e.g., Ferram's amazing FAR mod), real life-support constraints, etc. that make for a significantly more challenging and rewarding experience; if that doesn't trip your trigger, the forums have organized challenges with leaderboards, to see who can, for example, get to the Mun with the least number of parts, or eject the most Kerbals out of the solar system, all great fun with the competitors meticulously documenting their missionsIf these things sound interesting to you, get this game! It was the best $25 bucks I ever spent! ",559,194,25,92,66,9,126

								Kerbal Space Program is essentially NASA by trial and error. All the fun of building things and launching them into space, without the hassle of acquiring funding or the responsibility of having to return people to Earth safely.The Kerbals are a race of little green humanoids who love space. More than anything else, they want to go to there. You can get them there by designing rockets and space planes of near-unlimited complexity (read: convolutedness), and testing them out. Some of your designs will succeed, and some will experience a ""rapid unplanned vehicle disassembly."" But that's half the fun.Once you get the hang of getting things off the ground, you can really start to see how incredibly in-depth this game is. There is an entire solar system modeled here, with 7 planets and a bunch of moons orbiting them, giving you tons to do -- enough for hundreds of hours of play. As of this writing, I'm over 100 hours spent in-game, and the furthest I've gotten from Kerbin (the Earth-analog starting planet) is Eve, one of the nearest planets (and even then, I was forced to watch helplessly as the craft crashed into the surface, having spent all of its fuel on the voyage there). The game's physics are -- while scaled down for difficulty's sake -- actually fairly realistic. I never realized how little I knew about the physics involved in orbits until I started figuring out how to save fuel during launch by focusing more on horizontal velocity. Before long, I was looking up how to do gravity assists to get to other planets, and looking up actual rocket science formulas, trying to understand the principles behind them in order to improve my designs.The game is still in Alpha, and as such it's a little rough around the edges (the most obvious to me is that the surface of Kerbin is devoid of any kind of structures besides the space center), but new updates are coming out with decent regularity. Most recently added is the career mode, which starts you out only with a handful of parts, requiring you to perform experiments and generate reports around the solar system to gain ""science"" -- a currency you can use to unlock new part selections. The part limitations give a new kind of challenge, and obtaining science gives the game a more objective focus, which I found very refreshing -- especially just as sandbox mode was starting to lose some of its draw.TL:DR;If designing and flying rockets, space planes and/or whatever ridiculous contraption you can think of sounds fun, it's a safe bet that you'll enjoy this game. Despite still being in alpha, it's already more than worth what I paid.			",221,42,1,31,32,3,66

								3... 2... 1... Aw shi-If your parents have ruined your life by pumping your head full of overt positive reinforcement of all the great things you will accomplish in life, and have a shrine of your Academic Team, Little League and Girl Scout trophies and awards, and you live in the shadow of their crafted image of potential you know you will never fulfill, then KSP is for you. You will spend hours engineering great and mighty rockets, planning to launch humble little Kerbals (in game human analogs, because kerploding simulated HUMANS isn't politically correct in gaming unless it's portrayed in war, murder mysteries, alien invasions, war, zombie horror, war, armed rebellion stories, humorous ciminal empire sandboxes, war, over the top armed racing games, war, Valve circlejerk physics engine display pieces, war, or the kitchen sink) into space...Wait. What was I saying? Oh, right, you slap random aeronautic components with names longer than a West Coast Rapper's discography (what did you think I was going to say?) and plot a course for the very stars themselves! And then promptly cry tears of relief that your parent's were always wrong about you, and you actually CAN'T do anything right, all along - when you realize you forgot to put adequate battery banks on board, so now your little astronauts are floating through the hostile void forevermore, committed to the lonely depths of space, never to set foot on green Kerbin again. THIS. IS. YOUR. FAULT.Just kidding. They kerploded on the launch pad like your freshman fall semester career plans when you realized ""Intro to College Biology"" was the EASIEST class your degree required. But it doesn't matter, because trial and error in this game is so much fun, you'll completely forget about your dead end job and/or unemployment!But getting to the meat and potatoes of the game, you have about 15-20 celestial bodies to explore, and all the components you need to get there, not to mention very easy to add mods to fill in any gaps in equipment. Each body, moons, planets, even the local star can be explored and your engineering options are endless. One can make: crappy unmaned probes, crappy unmanned rovers, crappy space stations, crappy single stage to orbit launch vehicles, crappy shuttles, crappy rockets, crappy planetary bases, crappy space boats, for the odd moon with liquid surfaces. The possibilities are as countless as the stars, in that, the number could probably be calculated, but if you spent time doing it, no woman will ever touch your pe- Moving on. KSP is hours of fun, offering both structured career mode, and stupid anarchist sandbox mode for rebellious teens that hate rules. The game is still in development as of this review, and thus new content is constantly being added, not that there is any lack of stuff to do - KSP is massively replayable and tremendously enjoyable.Final score: 293/299 superfluous boosters.Protip: This game currently constitutes the entirety of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea's space program, despite the state's lack of hardware capabe of running it, even with its undemanding specs.

												There are no other games really like this. You will, in a terribly entertaining way, learn some fundamental of orbital mechanics, rocket science, aerodynamics, astrophysics and even a bit of mechanical engineering and straight physics. There is nobody to shoot, no zombies, no monsters, no combat. No grand conquests and raising flags over captured enemy bases. Yet you have never and will never play a game that will challenge, entertain and reward you like KSP will. The learning curve is stiff but not terrible. You play it at your own pace because, well, there is no other pace you can play it at. Games like Dark Souls are 'hard' because you've got to have the right mix of luck and muscle memory and you have to throw yourself at it again again. KSP can be hard because calculating the right setup for the right injection burn to put you in a viable position to get past Ike into a stable orbit around Duna with enough fuel to get you home is a staggering undertaking, a lot of planning and forethough. This is one of those games that changes gaming. You will kick yourself, repeatedly, when you look back and realize you didn't have a chance to play KSP. It is a complex, indepth, engaging, well balanced and changing but simplified to make it fun to play simulator for building and deploying rockets and ships to go into space, visit and explore other worlds and travel a solar system. The developer is a big part of this success. One of the first trail blazers on 'early access' they have been amazing for involving the community. Several of the top modders for KSP (they love and support modding in KSP - not to fix bugs but add content) were engaged and used in building content for the 1.0 release even. They are still engaged in improving and adding content to KSP. I've got close to 800 hours in at this point and still haven't really played swaths of the game, there are dozens of mods I want to try but haven't had the chance. This is the kind of game that's fun and engaging for years and years. Sometimes you need to step outside the regular run of the mill and see why a game like this has tens of thousands of reviews that are almost universally positive.			",79,9,0,13,17,0,13

Early Access Review
								I was able to learn and actually understand far more about orbital mechanics by playing this game obsessively for 2 weeks than doing an astrophysics course for a year at university.This was originally a neat little rocket building and exploding simulator that attracted a couple of hours' worth amusement before being returned to the ""may play again later"" shelf. After many updates, it has grown into an immensely satisfying personal sandbox space programme simulator.The first time I landed a Kerbal safely on the Mun was a historic moment, and very emotional... until moments later when I wondered how Jebediah would possibly get back. Swiftly, a rescue mission was devised. Hours were spent meticulously over-engineering an overly capable craft, until I realised I felt quite hungry. I couldn't decide what to eat, when I noticed the name of the planet Mars equivalent. Seeing it as almost divine inspiration, I went out and got a Duna kebab. Very satisfied with the food the game chose for me, I spent the next few hours trying to fly the monstrosity that could only barely be called a ""return vehicle"" without: 1) exploding on launch. 2) tipping over and exploding whilst landing. After many reverts and quickloads, it was finally successful. A celebratory viewing of Apollo 13 ensued, followed with feverish design work on the next, more ambitious project. And then it was 6am.The game is far too addictive.I now wish I had studied aero engineering instead.There is a full solar system to obtain science on explore, with lots of ways to do it. Contraptions which can only be described as ""adorably ridiculous"" yet surprisingly effective may be constructed to your heart's content. As with many other sandbox games, you provide your own amusement - set yourself ridiculous tasks and restrictions, be efficient or over-engineer the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything such that the Littoral Combat Ship looks like a very sound and practical design.With or without mods (of which there are many), you can build almost anything from planes and land vehicles to giant flying space horses and bananas.Official multiplayer support in the future was announced a while ago, and there is currently a multiplayer mod that allows you to build space stations or conduct joint missions with friends and partner agencies.It is still currently in development, with more and more features being added with each major update. Even in its current state, I would be more than happy to pay double its current full price based on how much enjoyment I have gotten out of it.TL;DR: Spectacular failures, decided what I should have to eat one day and now I regret my key life decisions. Would buy again.			",2077,777,72,172,319,16,321

												If you have a deep longing to attempt landing on the surface of a star, or the gumption to fling countless people into space without any consideration toward their lives, then this may be the game for you. Failure is the only option.Most of your best stories will have nothing to do with what went right on a standard planet-to-planet maneuver, or how you really nailed that Hohmann transfer. No, it'll probably be the flaming wreckage you created where no one should have survived, but somehow did. My game once glitched as a Kerbal was falling from the upper atmosphere and he bounced on the surface. He bounced! And not in the crumpled heap of flesh and bone matter way. He bounced off the ground and appeared to be coming in for a graceful finish to a mission gone horribly wrong--the only type of mission that truly exists. He fell from space! And lived! Forget space, erect a statue!My first manned mission to the Mun ended in predictable failure. I tried landing without any sort of landing gear. How, you might ask? By landing on the engine so it was primed for vertical takeoff. I forgot about my horizontal velocity, however, and ended up ripping the engine apart. I had all the fuel I needed for a return mission, but the broken engine was left kilometers away. Oops. At least I could plant a cool flag.I attempted a rescue mission, because that is the first irresponsible thing everyone always thinks to do: stranded person in space? Send more people to help them! The first mission collided with the Mun at 600 m/s. Rough landing. The second mission landed, but I was probably 50km away--which isn't all that bad, all things considered. I had the stranded Kerbal run toward the landed ship, but it was taking forever. So I started using his little jetpack to expedite things. Lemons and lemonade. As it turns out, you can actually disintegrate a Kerbal if you get too much forward momentum and collide with something solid, like the surface of the Mun. You will forever be in our thoughts, Mac Kerman.So much for the rescue. I may as well have the rescue team return safely. Remember that landing gear part? Yeah, I still hadn't updated that section of the ship. Instead I landed on my side and planned on using elevation as a natural ramp. Bulletproof logic. At least this Kerbal had the dignity of a fiery, fiery death. An honorable death. By my own hands.In KSP, your little Kerbal guys can die and be listed in the ambiguous ""Lost"" column. It was with great sorrow that I saw Mac Kerman's name in there. I didn't care so much about the other guys. Who cares about the second guy on the Mun? But here's the thing, several years into my career mode Mac magically reappeared and was ready for action! He came back from the dead! And what was the first thing he wanted to do? Go back into space! To die again!In conclusion, yes to this game. Just yes. I currently have a Kerbal orbiting the second moon, Minmus. Yes, he is in a stable orbit without a ship. Just him. And he's been there for close to 30 years now. I'll get around to that at some point.Update: Still in orbit.			",99,18,1,17,22,1,23

												I score this Simulation game 12/10, just hit the buy button! It exceeds all expectations. The game isn't finished yet, but I don't care. They can't fail anything anymore. Just buy it. Or wait for a sale and then buy it. Whenever you buy it, you won't feel ripped off! I guarantee you that! Kerbal Space Program is pure MAGIC! On the facade it comes across as something with the depth of Angry Birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled. However, there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions! There's a reason I'm scoring this game 12 out of 10. I find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library. I even try NOT to play it, but when I do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores...KSP, like the name might have hinted, is a Space Program Simulator Game. There is the career mode, involving missions and research, and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it. The game is in early access and the career needs work (I find the missions redundant and confusing, but it's already fun), and this review is more about the sandbox mode.You run the show, so you set out your own missions, like fly to the moon or another planet. Then you have to build your lander, rover, satelite or whatever, the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space! Then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space, you also need to learn to make an orbit. Then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around. There are no concessions! By the time you've figured out how to get where you want to go, you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight! You don't need a science degree to do this and to understand this, the game is brilliant this way. You can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too.I recommend this game to all people that like simulation games, tycoon games, Lego (the plastic bricks), science fiction in general, science in general, rockets and blowing stuff up, real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn.As you set out your own missions, you send your Kerbal individuals (they all have names) on grand adventures. Their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons. The bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse (really a fun and beautifull feature). In the Kerbol (name of the star) system you will also find the planets Moho, Eve with it's moon Gilly, Kerbin with Mun and Minmus, Duna with Ike, then a gas-giant called Jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet Eelo. The distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space. It may be a scaled down planetary system, but that doesn't mean it's small. I have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world. Each planet and moon comes with it's own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you'll busy for hundreds of hours before you've done it all. Everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother, you know what the other player is talking about.When I started playing, I had little expectations. It looked like a mod, but then I reached space. It was like the opening of the movie 2001: a Space Oddisey. The ""space whales"" ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin, ever going higher and higher, kerbin getting smaller and smaller, I passed the Mun... lost kerbin, then found the ""eva"" button.. I found out stands for ""Extra Vehicular Activity"", or ""Go play outside"".. so I lost my Kerbal. Hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called KSP, while drooling over my keyboard.This game is not done yet. I'm not sure when they aim for a release candidate, but they can't fail this anymore. Nasa has made an addon for it, so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed. Nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new Space-X rocket, how awesome is that! And the developer has even announced multiplayer!!! I don't know how this will work and what we could do in an online game, and It's already more fun if a friend plays this game too, but it's anticipated by me nonetheless. The educational value of this game is through the roof! I thought I understood the principle of orbits, but boy did I learn a lot. I understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically, but putting it to practice requires more then just going. So, I watched Nasa do it. They pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed, so ok... I built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try-outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with. At this point the concept that Isaac Newton put down of ""every action has a 'pose and equal reaction"" gets a whole new meaning in orbit (you'll see :KSmiley:). Every run you make in Kerbal, you get more advanced. Your rockets become more stable, because you know how to make them, you get to other planets faster, because you know how to get there. My rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander, of which I built a new version every night, to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck I landed on Duna, which took me 2 weeks to build! It went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind-boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc (or the game's engine) found hard to process when launched.There comes a point where you get stuck on something, like how to dock in space. There are several things to do, but I warn you: this can make or break your experience. Try as hard as you can if you're stuck, play with a friend (you know, together on one pc thinking and building) and if all else fails, then try youtube or a guide. Letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience. But when you've reached this point it just means a whole new world of Kerbal opens before your eyes. I think every KSP player has posted screenshots, videos, guides both online and private to friends. The ammount of material you can dig up is staggering.Also, don't install mods as you just start playing, exept for scan-sat perhaps (but don't, the other mods will lure you). Mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy. I've reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and I had seen all the parts ingame. I've reached the point of not getting my ships docked. This was the point where I looked on youtube, read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods, mods like MechJeb (in flight telemetry and autopilot options, use at your own risk), advanced cockpits (cockpit screens, buttons to press, external cameras, awesome!), more parts, graphical addons, scan-sat (scans planets, awesome!), etc. But with all games in early access, mods can be broken when the game is patched. But when you've reached that point, KSP can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities, as realistic as you want it to be.This game is 100% quality, dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get. When it's done, it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game. With more standard parts, more physics, more career, more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now. From that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and I don't think this game will die out soon. Just buy the game, you'll have fun for years to come I promiss!!!Now years after release, I stand by my review. This game will stand it's ground.If it's not on sale, check out Steamhookups.com if there's a good deal in it for you!			",56,2,4,9,19,0,14

Early Access Review
								Imagine the most intricate, accurate to life space vehicle simulator you can.  Dozens of toggle switches, displays ranging from the strange and esoteric to the vague and incomprehensible, buttons flashing angrily at you and daring you to press them.  The screen shakes and aside from the roar of liftoff, the only thing you can hear is your own labored breathing and the pulse in your ears.  Do you have this picture in your head?  Good.Because KSP is nothing like that.   Take parts, attach parts, launch parts, land parts, detonate parts, survive falling parts.  KSP is learning through failure.  Unless you go on Youtube and look up the Scott Manley videos, you are going to fail.  You gonna fail bad.  But it's okay.  Failure is only data by another name.  Bit by bit, you'll learn how to do things right.  You'll realize that putting the engines under the tanks is probably a good idea.  Putting the crew capsule in a place not likely to be burned or detonated is also probably a good idea.   Parachutes seem like a logical choice, but what the heck, right?  Maybe you just need a five hundred meter long crumple zone.  Nobody's gonna stop you.  That's the great thing, isn't it?  You can put anything at all you want on the launchpad, and nobody knows well enough to try to stop you.  The Kerbish OSHA rep is permanently locked into the bathroom.  He's not gettin' out of there.  We welded the window shut, locked the door, and put model airplane glue in the keyhole.  Cell phone reception in there is sketchy.  You're safe.  So go nuts.There's places you can go.  Land at the poles, the sea, the mountains, or all three at once with a creatively timed spray of shrapnel.  There's other worlds.  A big burning thing with no surface that'll tan you for free if you check it out.  It'll tan you to the bone.  So that's a bonus.  There's other worlds.  Red world.  Purple world.  Green world with little worlds around it.  Hidden stuff everywhere.  All of these places are fit to seed with refuse.  Landers, rovers, living quarters, stations, battleships, pasteboard furniture, lawnmowers, spaceplanes, robots, scooters, springboards, et cetera.  KSP is a litterer's dream.  There's so many places you can leave stuff you have no hope of bringing home.  And it's worth doing it just to see that stuff sitting there.But I've got to warn you.  You've reached TL;DR level four, so here's a bonus.  This game has very unexpected side effects.  You will learn things.  Hoffman transfer.  Periapsis.  Apoapsis.  How orbit actually works.  Why orbit is halfway to anywhere.  Launch windows.  Free transfer windows.  Free returns.  If you make the horrifying inadvertent mistake of buying this game for yourself or your child, somebody's gonna learn things.  It's unavoidable.   Real things, even.  Newton's spectre haunts this game.  You will find no escape, and he fears no earthly garlic.Lemmie wrap this up for the TL;DR folks who check the bottom summary.  Just get KSP already.  You aren't really learning anything from my review you probably didn't know already.  Let's be honest with each other, here.  Ok?  You don't want to learn whether or not this game is worth buying.  You're looking for someone to make the excuse for you.  You're already gonna get it, you just want someone to possibly take the fall for you if you catch heat for doing it.  And to you, good sirs and madams, I say;  Yes.  Yes, I'll take the blame.  ""That fat idiot Whackjob from KSP told me to get the game, or he said he'd cut me.""  They'll believe you.  You're good.  So do it.  Hit that buy button.Thank me later.~Whackjob of KSP[i.imgur.com] ",74,9,1,14,20,0,17

												Started playing this game when I was 11, it was too complicated for me. I'd spent over 20 hours trying to reach the moon but always failed.I'm now 14 and I've finally reached the moon and back.10/10 - would wait 3 years until I'm mature enough to understand a game again.Edit: For those saying the game came out last year, the first public release of this game was on June 24, 2011. Its official release out of beta was last year (2015).			",87,10,1,7,12,0,7

												I played this game with my son, now he wants to be an austronaunt.10/10Seriously, once upon a time if my son would have asked me ""Dad, how did people land on the moon"" I wouldn't know what to tell him. But today, when my son asked me that question (awww yis!), I simply said -- ""I'll show you how"", and we fired up the game. I was able, with the help of KSP, to show my son the beauty of trial and error, the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is, and how small we are. I let him built it himself, parachutes on a moon lander, backwards engines and everything. I remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded, the look of awe as we made orbit, his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon. I remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes. Which didn't work. We crashed. Hard. After the inital shock was over, my son asked in surprise: ""Dad why don't parachutes work on the moon?"".Oh man, thank you KSP. Thank you for making science fun!			",55,15,0,8,37,0,20

												When you play Kerbal Space Program, you find yourself becoming one of two types of individuals.  Either you throw everything together and make things up as you go, or you spend equally as much time planning for a mission as actually flying it.  Either way, mission success (whatever you define that to be) is always either painstakingly earned or astronomically lucky (pun intended).  It's very hard to compare to the feeling of seeing a safe splashdown after one of your Kerbals (the characters that man spacecraft) has walked on the surface of another celestial body.  It's also hard to compare to the humbling feeling you get when you've made it halfway across the Kerbol system after significant planning and execution time only to realize that you left your landing legs at home.This game will frustrate and exhilarate you.  Well worth the purchase.			",76,16,1,7,12,0,9

												It's been quite a ride. Four long years of development, cool stuff, accidentally education, and the Kraken... and here we are. One point oh (point whatever!) And oh, are things different! But that's all the past! Let's talk about the present.This is a game in which you go to space repeatedly, success optional.Most of the entertainment value in this game is either limited or boosted by your imagination. You can just throw some bits together, hit the go button and see what happens! What's that? There are Kerbals in there? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of my massive explosion device. Conversely, you can put things together in a very particular manner and create the perfect interplanetary shuttle. It's all up to you. Your sandbox is the solar system. Go play. Due to the nature of things and such, this game would be truly incredible in a classroom environment, yet it's just as fun alone at home.Now, for the less sandbox-oriented among us (or just the people like me who enjoy progression,) there's a career mode! This time, you start out with the exclusive ability to make short range, manned, ballistic missiles! FOR SCIENCE! Seriously, you generate Science! from everything, and you use it to unlock more things to build better missiles to make more Science! Be careful though. Don't want to blow up too many bits, because you have funding to worry about now. You should also take care of your Kerbals to keep your reputation acceptable.Also the camera shakes, there's complicated aerodynamics, there's thermodynamics, there's moresodynamics, there's orbital mechanics, there's resource mining (which you can MAKE FUEL with,) there's management, there's pretty explosions, there's good sound effects that are also deafening, there's accidentally education, and so much more for only some money!However, the tutorial is absolutely useless and frustrating. Ignore it, fumble around for a while, and utilize the internet to learn what you must know when you decide that trial and error is so last era.There's not really much else to talk about... All the other details are either not noteworthy, neutral, or better kept quiet... so...Go build some intercon- advanced spacecraft.			",168,41,15,37,31,1,24

								KSP Version 0.23, Alpha. (Try the free demo if you're unsure!)An absolutely brilliant example of an open game still under development, KSP lets players explore the Kerbol system with a fleet of (mostly) operational, self-designed ships, probes, rovers, stations, permanent bases and, of course, manned missions. Although the Unity engine causes even top-end PCs to sometimes run at sub-par framerates, the game is slowly becoming more intricate and beautiful with every update. You'll quickly realise that there are no predefined goals and a lot of what you achieve on KSP is fuelled by your imagination, so if you're looking for a linear game with missions and a set storyline, this isn't for you.The game features two different modes; career mode and sandbox mode. While the (basic) career mode is currently being updated and improved, sandbox definitely contains enough content to give dozens of hours of fun, if not more! Multiplayer is due to be introduced before final release too.Outside the stock game, the community is excellent with a plethora of mods created to complement the game, easily installed thanks to developer support and an official mod-sharing website. Once you begin to look for objectives beyond scooting around the rocky surface of Moho or exploring Jool's many moons, you can introduce extraplanetary mining with the Kethane mod, orbital mapping with the ISA MapSat mod, or a host of other content packages created by the community. Just expect to crash often when you first start, and don't grow too attached to any of your impressive creations. This is an alpha-level game, after all.			",82,16,1,21,23,0,35

 This game is like a toast...  Your first attempt at toast looks pretty good, but you end up burning it. You don't give up, after several attempts you make some better toasts Those toasts taste awful and one nearly burns your entire house down Desperate for toasting glory you search for some toast videos on youtube All these people making enoromous and gloriously looking toasts make you jealous and sad One day, you discover that you sorta don't need to make overcomplicated toasts to enjoy your snack. You also notice tiny differences between toasts and their preparation You finally enjoy a proper toast, but the more you eat, the hungrier you get Your hunger for toasts gets bigger and bigger with every known recipe You start modifying your snacks and try challenges from other toast fans You achieve toasting heaven, nothing can stop you now, you have mastered the art of toast. You begin preparing your masterpiece. After several hours of hard work you end up burning it.  You look back at all your progres, and you realize that you don't have to make every toast perfect. It's in the dedication, will to learn from your mistakes and enjoying little victories on long and hard path.This game is sweet combination of pride, joy and relief you'll feel after every successful mission although you also get hours of excrutiating pain, swearing and mental breakdowns. Get this game for full price, it's worth every penny....and I like toasts.			",70,18,3,8,7,1,9

												OLD INFO AT TOP- KEEP READING. Probably one of the best games i have ever played. i have logged well over 1000 hours on this game and i still enjoy logging into it frequently. try it out, and get some mods. you need to accept a bit of instabuility at times with lots of mods (im using like 13 mods right now) but if you go vanilla (witch still allowes for Lots of unique ideas on its own) stabuility is rarely an issue. game takes a hog of a PC, and due to 32 bit Engine.... sigh, is stuck using only 1 core of your processor. but is usually sparkling on a good pc none the less.and For advanced Players, theres really no end to what you can do.a person need only look at youtube and they can get an idea of the insanity that is building your own rockets in a physics engine. you plan it all... and if you mess up, fuel levels, mistakes ect..... another kerbal bites the dust.. ""now serving #15"" a Pa announces.April 2015: 2000 hours and climbing, still have not run out of uniqe things to do.. theres always a crazier mission than you considered before... the mods have only gotten better, and with some tricks like running in OpenGL mode you can load this game up with ALOT of mods before it explodes. you can install Real solar system mod and play on a real life sized system, makes going to the moon and back something worth bragging about. thats for extremely advanced players as even i find it hard.Feb 2016 - 3000 hoursGame completed, runs great on 64 bit version, now mods arent an issue and you can load it up until the cows come home. so much more stable than ever, faster than ever and every thing. Just works better now as the last thing they did was optimize the crap out of it. still one of the best games i have ever owned. play it constantly			",73,16,2,9,41,0,27

												Truly Epic. One of those games I keep going back to (300+ hours as I write this).Being a simulation, the number of situations you can find yourself in is nearly endless.My most recent Kerbtastrophe occurred when my unmanned mapping and science probe (JoolStar1) was about to arrive at Jool after nearly 4 years in flight. Actually, it happened quite a while before that, I just wasn't aware of it.I switched to the probe, ready to fine-tune my approach so I could cut through the atmosphere, bleeding off speed without wasting fuel.Something was wrong. The probe didn't respond to inputs. That's when I realised I hadn't deployed the solar panels before leaving Kerbin orbit! Cursing, I tried to deploy them. Nothing. I mashed the button repeatedly. Still nothing. I checked the batteries... Empty!Since I didn't have a kerbal on board to do an EVA, there was nothing I could do except watch helplessly as JoolStar1 sailed straight past its destination, a failure destined to orbit the sun forever.This game is all about failing repeatedly (and hilariously) until a Darwinian process of attrition results in an understanding of how to build, fly and land rockets.I can't recommend it highly enough			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But I'll stick to pointing out the one thing that was both what got me hooked and would also frustrate me to the point of almost not wanting to play. The learning curve. It's the single most challenging learning experience I've had since I left uni! But I LOVED every second of it. The absolute highlight of this game for me? When a friend and I shared a save file and flew a mission (over 2000tons of spaceship) to the planet jool with the aim of landing and every moon and then coming home. We worked on the designs together, assembled our ship in orbit together and ran the mission. Kerbal has given me the most rewarding gaming experiences of my life... and I play a LOT of games!

								Think of Kerbal as a Do-It-Yourself-NASA, albeit less successful because you haven't a clue what you're supposed to be doing. It's all fun though, as you'll learn quite quickly and by the end of the week, along with some Scott Manley Youtube schooling, you'll be on the right track.You'll probably spend 95% of your time exploding, but that slim 5% that you actually manage to get into orbit, dock two craft together to make a space station, or land on another body (such as the Mun), will become some of the most memorable experiences in your video gaming life.As close to a solid space simulation as you'll ever get.

All we know is: he's not the stig, but he is Jebediah Kerman!This game has exerything you want in a ""space race"" game. You have explosions, the ability to build the best spacecraft you can comprehend; and best of all, you have raw power.You may first get it and think, ""what was I thinking when I got this, it's more difficult than becoming friends with Piers Morgan!"" With that, you would be correct, but what you need... is to practice with many many crafts to get the right ideas.The controls are like some kind of madness that would drive you away, but it's very easy to understand after you play for a bit.All in all, I must say: this is one of the best games... in the world, and even out of it.

												I have been playing this game for a very long time. Very easy to get into, very hard to master. It is not a simulation by any means, but that doesn't mean you won't still learn a lot about rocketry, and the things which NASA and the folks who fly in those crazy contraptions have to deal with. The Community as well is extremely nice, and extremely active. With a mass amount of mods for the game, which allows you to really customize it to your liking (Much like Elder Scrolls games are). On top of that, they are also moving it to  Unity 5 (If they havn't already at the time you're reading this in the future), meaning the limitation on mods will be quite literally... limitless. That with Multiplayer to boot! (Coming Soon as well with Unity 5). -----------------------------The game itself has 3 modes. Career: Which pits you against your mind. Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and  learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther. Science: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money. Sandbox: Like all Sandboxes.. Everything is tehre from the start, no money, science or anything else, Just build and have fun. -------------------------------What you do in the game is open ended. IT's your choice. Build what you want, and fly it anywhere you want (Or anywhere it can go). There are many many entire different planets to explore, moons, asteroids, etc. A fully open ended solar system. Taking off from Kerbin, flying through the upper atmosphere, and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding. From there, going to another planet, landing anywhere you want on it and exploring it, then coming back and hoping you have the right trajectory to burn safely through the kerbin atmosphere as flames fly up around your ship.. epic. 5 Tests launching rockets that failed: 2,000,000 Launched a rocket to the Mun, but couldn't return: 400,000 + 1 stranded Kerbal Attempted a rescue Mission with the same result: 450,000 + another stranded Kerbal Finally reaching the Mun, and returning back safely in the water: Priceless			",139,29,0,66,46,0,65

												While it's not exactly beginner-friendly, Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a brilliant game for what it achieves.  What other game can boast of accurate portrayal of orbital physics, staging rocket sequences and interplanetary travel?  Gravity is a difficult beast to tame!You're drawn in by the relatively simple ship construction aspect where you put together your ship like building blocks, attaching parts one at a time with options to make certain parts attach symmetrically.  Once you're on the launchpad though,♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real.  You will fail a lot, with your rocket exploding, or tipping over, or messing up the sequence of stages.Just leaving the atmosphere and establishing an orbit is a massive challenge, and that is still the early game!  Sending probes and landers to other planets and moons, building space stations and exploring the far reaches of the fictional solar system; these are all possible.  Beyond that, the Career and Science modes provide new tasks and objectives such as completing contracts or carrying equipment to perform various scientific experiments, and further still the Sandbox mode allows you to set your own goals.Unless you're a genius or have a huge deal of patience you will need to refer to various tutorials, wikis, guides and discussions online.  If physics scares you off you will probably find it hard to enjoy the game beyond its initial simple tasks.  You'll need to be willing to learn new things to get the most out of this game.KSP will likely give you a new appreciation of the space program of the 20th Century and what was achieved with the technology available at the time.  Any person who's dreamed of working at NASA must try Kerbal Space Program.Recommended!			",1161,450,68,160,175,13,272

								Kerbal Space Program brings you one of the most difficult, but also one of the most rewarding games I've ever played. An extensive solar system with realistic physics will give you a challenging quest to the mün and to all the other planets revolving around the Sun. Your first few attempts of 'shooting for the mün' will inevitably end up in failure (trust me, I've been there), but after a while, you'll get there! Absolutely worth the fairly high price, but if it's on sale, get your copy!			",193,41,7,32,38,3,34

								Kerbal Space Program is great fun.If you love space and explosions, this one comes highly recommended.A lot of potential players express concern at the complexity of the game, but they needn't worry if they're really interested in playing.  KSP is a game first, and a simulation second. You don't have to be Scott Manley, or even average, at the game in order to have fun. Just build stuff and fly it about! You'll learn the nuances of spaceflight as you go. Not to mention if flight and orbital mechanics elude you, there are mods such as MechJeb that assist you with flying your ship and going from one planet to another, or perform the maneuvers FOR you, that way you can focus on building and watching things go boom. The more recent addition of ""Career"" mode takes the new player experience even further, serving as a guided, but still sandboxy, introduction to all aspects of the gameplay.Reasons to buy KSP:You like space.You like explosions.You like sandbox games.You have a soul.Reasons not to buy KSP:You mistakenly think space isn't awesome.Explosions scare you.You're afraid you'll get sand in your eyes.You have no soul.

												**Based on 500 hrs of gameplay**Best game I've ever played. School grades have been sacrificed.Do you want to get addicted? Because this is how you get addicted.Build and design spaceships, rovers, or even spaceplanes, like the shuttles NASA is using. Build it, launch it, crash it, try again, crash again, build again, and eventually manage to explore the solar system.This game is for the players who enjoy challenges and small chances of success - at least at first. It's a steep learning curve, and a lot to dig into, but the fact that a lot of your coming failures will be the result of having to adjust to the laws of physics, aerodynamics, thermology and so on makes the whole experience rewarding in even real-life practical ways. Smart people play KSP. Be smart. Seriously.			",23,1,1,6,13,0,9

												Kerbal Space Program, at least to me is the king of simulation games. While I play numerous others (such as Farming Simulator) they don’t seem to hit every mark in that field. KSP, while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player, and force them to deal with it. While a game like Farming Sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops, KSP requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity, to a satellite connection back home. But the part of the game that truly shines is the feeling you get when you first land on the Mun. A friend who gave the game a shot said  Originally posted by Bacaber: “it was just...pride. So many Kerbals died in previous attempts, and I finally made it.” While the game is difficult, I can’t stop asking people to try it. To me, it’s the perfect “life isn’t about the destination, but the journey” and I think this game captures that perfectly. ",201,36,3,25,30,5,27

												This game has one of the steepest learning curves of any game i've ever played, but it has also given me the greatest feeling of achievement from any game i've ever played.When you land on the Mun for the first time, after mashing buttons trying to stabalise your craft and you barely make it due to the lack of fuel, there's no better feeling than knowing you have to do it all again and launch a rescue mission. (or you could just leave Bob there for science).....I am a big fan of space, physics and science in general and playing this game has been an education for me. Because of KSP I have watched dozens of YouTube videos on astrophysics and aerodynamics I would have probably never watched without this game and learned a ton of interesting things, and i love that.The game has a fantastic modding community with a huge variety of mods to add realism or give your game a futuristic sci-fi feel. A favourite mod of mine is 'Remote tech', I don't play without it. This game produces some stunning visuals too as you drift through the vast openness of space, orbiting moons, chasing asteroids, collecting science and designing planes, rockets, trucks, rovers, probes, boats even helecopters and mech walker/transformer type sh** thanks to mods... If you ever look up at the stars and wonder what it would be like to go there..... Well, this is as close as i'm ever gunna get.			",285,47,5,24,31,5,42

												So i told myself when i reached 100 hours on this game i would write a review. Well, here i am.So i got this game around summmer 2015, after wanting it for a long time.The game had just left early access and was in beta. (I just want to point out that i am very attatched to this game)I adore this game. Most of my summer was spent playing this. (Before you say that isn't possible, i would like to point out my hours didn't add up as I ran the game from the .exe rather than steam.) I would, and have, recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the feel of success, science, exploration, engineering, space, cute green creatures who you shall become the merciless god of as you stack them on top of each-other and use them as landing gear.The only slightly bad thing about this game is the learning curve. I know the 1.1 update added loads of tutorials, 'cuz the old ones were exeedingly bad, but you will spend around 5 - 10 hours before you can do anything useful. Needless to say though it is worth it, and soon you will conquer the solar system!Or, y'know, just abuse the various bugs the game has... that's cool....Anyway, thanks for reading this review. If it helps someone buy the game, or spread the word, or anything, then i'm glad.-- Simple Concept			",45,3,0,6,11,0,9

												It's not exactly rocket science is it?....oh wait, yes it is!Kerbal Space Program is a game about building spacecraft and, unless you're very good at the game, watching them blow up which is currently in Early Access. In KSP you design and build your very own spacecraft/rockets and spaceplanes which you then use as you leave Kerbin to further the scientific knowledge of the humble kerbal. With a vast array of parts at your disposable it's daunting at first, well it's daunting for a while, but once you get the hang of it this game is a blast, especially if you have any interest in astrophysics or aerospace engineering.KSP has four different game modes each of which I will give a brief description of. First off there's sandbox mode. In sandbox mode you have no limitations and most importantly you have access to all of the parts right away, this is the perfect way for new players to get to grips with building and figuring out what works well and how the game works.Next we have scientific mode. In scientific mode you have to generate science points from doing experiments in different places, e.g. the surface of Kerbin or low Kerbin orbit. Science points you earn can then be spent on new technologies in the tech tree which unlock new parts which help you to go to new places to complete more experiments. You begin with few parts which are basic so unlocking new technologies in imperative to progress.Up next is career mode. Career mode is scientific mode but now with money and reputation to worry about. Money is earned by completing contracts, such as putting a part on your rocket and getting it to a certain altitude and then money is spent on parts for your rocket or spaceplane. Reputation is earned by successfully completing contracts, the higher your reputation is the better the contracts you get offered are. However, reputation can be lost through either failing contracts or losing kerbals.Last, and probably least depending on what you like, are the game's pre-made scenarios. Ranging from tutorials on docking to the NASA redirect mission this game mode is what you would expect it to be, just different scenarios to try out, not much to say about this one.+Graphics are pretty nice+Lots of different parts+The building menus are good and building is relatively easy, by easy I mean straightforward to use not easy to make decent vehicles+A number of different planets and moons, each with different appearances and properties+Good controls and useful hotkeys+Good staging setup+Endless possibilities of what you can make, from simple little rockets to huge spacestations in orbit around distant planets+Reasonaly good physics but not perfect (I'll get to that later)+Plentiful explosions+Huge replayability+Great modding community and adding mods is extremely easy+Kerbals are nice little race and you can get attached to the more well known kerbals quite easily (I <3 Jeb)+/-Very basic tutorials, this game really throws you in at the deep end-Immensely steep learning curve, I'm 60+ hours in and I've only recently made it to the Mun (and successfully landed) -The physics and controls for spaceplanes are pretty bad, spaceplanes have clearly been neglected in favour of rocketsVerdict:9An outstandingly good vehicle builder/sandbox game which is perfect for anyone with an interest in space, the related physcis or anyone who likes building vehicles.El K.

								Oh boy, this game is definitely worth your money. My Kerbal Space Program story originated over 2 years ago when a friend suggested it and I quickly shrugged it off. I started watching videos, downloaded the demo, got hooked and here I am with over 960 hours and still going in this game. I never run out of things to do. Yes there is a huge learning curve but it is totally worth it. Even with the amount of time I have dedicated to this game I still cannot perfectly perform maneuvers, but what would be the fun in that? The modding community is great, as is the community in general. I have never seen a community so dedicated to ehlping others as the Kerbal community is. Now that the game is in beta I feel like we are a step closer to the final product and i would completely recommend buying this game before it's price continues to increase.			",29,5,0,6,5,0,3

												To begin, I guess I should give a short description: Essentially, KSP is a fairly realistic simulation game where you take control of and guide the nascent space program of a race of small green men and women from a planet named Kerbin. You will build your own vessels, choose your targets for exploration, colonization, scientific endeavor, etc, and blast off for space. The construction system is incredibly robust and fun to use, and, because of the level of customization available, tends to mean that no two ships will ever look or behave exactly alike. There are no food or oxygen or water needs on ships (several mods change this if you want), but the actual mechanics and physics of the game are convincingly accurate, and make for a, while unforgiving, very fun game, because the feedback is extremely consistent. A mistake will kill you EVERY time, unless something hilarious happens (this is actually one of the great parts of playing KSP). I cannot say enough positive things about this game. I purchased this originally in April of 2013, before it was on steam, and only purchased it on steam now that it has officially released. KSP has few goals, and in sandbox mode, it has none, but  goals are not the reason to play KSP. The first time I successfully put a Kerbal in orbit around his home planet, I was dancing around my dorm room, and the first time I landed a Kerbal on the Mun, I felt a sense of accomplishment I have quite literally never felt in a game before. Now, over the course of what must be at least a thousand hours of play, I have built massive colonies on Laythe, the Mun, Minmus, Duna, Eve, and even Ike, I've built huge orbital stations around various planets, and I've even built floating cities in the clouds of Jool and Eve through the use of just a few of the thousands of mods available. I've built resource collection and transport systems including storage, mining, and transport operations. I've explored hundreds of different areas with probes, landers, and vehicles, and yet, to this day, I still play this game at least two to three hours a week, and I'll go on KSP binges several hours long when I think of a new challenge to set for myself. Currently, a friend of mine and I are in a little friendly competition for who can build the most epic Duna colonization project. If you can't tell by now, if you want an 'on rails' game where everything is spoonfed to you, just leave now. This game is most certainly NOT for you. The contract system is honestly only there to give a person inspiration.But if you want a game that throws challenges at you that will test every brain cell you have, and pound your face into the ground mercilessly if you make even the slightest mistake, then KSP is your game. And when you finally put a Kerbal safely on the Mun, you just might understand why so many people write such glowing things about KSP.			",27,11,0,13,10,0,7

												Kerbal Space Program is hands down the most fun I have had with a video game in quite a while. The core premise of the game is fairly simple: build some rockets, try to fly them to places. That might sound pretty straightforward, but where Kerbal Space program really shines is in HOW that is done, and how it is done is with SCIENCE. The game perfectly encapsulates one of the best ways of looking at science.  I do not know what will happen if X.  I guess I should try it and see.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ I didn't expect that.  [knowledge gained]It really is a hell of an experience, and you can really feel it in full force thanks to the fact that there is very little hand holding in the game. In all liklihood, when you first sit down to play it you WILL mess up. Badly. You will have rockets flip over, burn up in the atmosphere, and explode. You will forget key parts, mess up staging, and accidentally deploy your parachutes at the same time as your engines. You will bolt things together at random because you have no idea what to do, run out of fuel stranded in space, and crash into moons at 2000 m/s. It will be a disaster, but you will keep at it, and eventually you will learn. As your Kerbals gain an understanding of their world and grow, so too will you, and believe me when I say that the feeling of accomplishment is tremendous. When you are flawlessly burning prograde at your apoapsis to circularize your orbit around some god-forsaken rock on the edge of the solar system, you will feel like a colossus bestriding the universe. It will be glorious.I cannot recommend Kerbal Space Program highly enough. Buy this game right now and get started sciencing your way to the stars through a series of horrific explosions.

Hey, you!Yeah, you!Want to... Go to space?Want to go to space, but accidentally end up going to the ground again, in pieces, get more determined and try again ten times until you can savour a brief victorious moment when you pass the threshold to the technical definition of space?

Good, then the game is for you!I can promise that you will have surprisingly much fun failing completely and miserably, compared to any other game, while the reward from the challenge of succeeding makes it all the more sweeter when you finally do succeed.10/10, would launch again, for science!

A game you can easily spend 2000 hours plus onOne of the best games of all times,If you are looking for action,If you are looking for fast game play.... you are completely wrong here.This game is about brains.... and has inspired many people to have a deeper look into (rocket)science or astronomy.Build the Spaceship of your dreams, but bound to the realty of physics and chemistry.And sometimes it can have fast and intense moments, e.g. if you try to land your ship on another (docking on surface) which not only needs well designed ships, but a lot of fast reactions and a high level of precision.But 1320 hours on the Steam clock alone, is speaking for itself (many player have over 1000 hours and most have several hundred at least). My would be higher if I didn't also play it without steam (own also the DRM free EDU version) a lot of times (probably another 1000 hours).And there are still things in this game I haven't done, and still wan't to do.(Next up in my career play through: Catching an asteroid before it is hitting the surface)When the game is too hard for you, then there mods that make things easierSome simply reduce the amount a math you have to do (trial and error only get you so far, so you need math to get where you want),some play parts of the game for you (not a fan of these mods, but some are tired of the launch process and automate it, some of these mods are not too bad, like kOS, which might start an interest in programming)When the game is too easy for you there are mods that makes it harder ...  a lot harder. It astonishes me every time how seemingly little changes can make a huge difference. Like adding in Life support, or a delay in research, rocket build time, and building upgrades.Bored of the stock parts? There are billions of other parts out there.(not much a fan of those either, because only little match the stock varieties, and many are over or under powered).Have a beefy PC? Though the stock game is looking good, there are mods out there that can make it astonishingly pretty. Though it has a huge impact on performance and memory use.and it might make knowlage fun!Looking for a gift that has a chance to get your child / grand child to learn physics and or math?Look no further!Update: It might also be availible in more languages than English, soon. (In case you are not an native English speaker yourself ... as e.g. I am)			",220,177,18,44,95,1,41

Although mastering the game is a quite the challenge, the rewards are unique as this game will push you to learn several subjects ranging from physics to human values as you will experience Murphy's law in a whole new level.

								Half flight simulator, half sandbox game and half space exploration; it makes 1,5 and this game counts more than just 1.My best money spend so far. You can explore from purple to green planets, from exploding on launchpad to crashing into sun, for making rockets like nasa, well, flights are less like nasa, your rockets will be more like ''manned cruise missiles''.There's not a single thing that you can cannot explore. I learned a lot about orbits and physics, you'll realy feel like a real space engineer (or an idiot) after playing this game.It is simulator, but not boring simulator like other simulators, it is very exciting in every mission you launch is unique (except routine flights to spacebases).10/10, would buy again if had enough money			",131,26,2,6,23,0,6

												This is one of my favourite games. Its simply amazing.KSP is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game.Its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning, expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own. (Watch ScottManley tutorials if you want a head start) I had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet (or keeping my rocket upright on the way there) - but now I am planing missions to other planets, landing and returning - sending unmanned rovers to explore - or even bringing asteroids back home.800 hours in and I feel like I am still just at the beginning.»Mün or bust« - unknown (prob.

								So im going to give you a short list of the pro's and cons and it will inevitably leave you with a sense of dread if this game is not already in your steam library (Shame on you!)==PRO's== Endless Fun Insane Modding Community As complex or as Simple as you want Has a career mode for those who need goals when things go just as you planned you get a giant smile on your face and when then go horribly wrong you get a bigger smile.==CON's== There is only so much in the time in a day to play this game, so if you only have 30 minutes a week to play you might have trouble getting into it. (But you should still buy it to support this awesome game) The game is not free (And it never should be.. buy it!) If you suffer from having only 2 hands and 2 eyes you may find it difficult to control and micro-manage a space research empire (Warp'ers Bewaaaaare)So thats my little list as to why everyone should own this gem of a game.

												Updated to release (1.0)[ Fun: 8 | Plot: 6 | CTRL: 7 | GFX: 7 | SFX: 7 | Stable: Yes | Replay: 9 ] [ Total: 8 ]+ Most bugs are gone+ Loads more to build and experiment with+ Feminine Kerbal's are here and they are just as dumb~ Some graphics and sound are still underwhelming~ Lacks a much needed tutorial~ Interface is still clunky, slow and filled with buttons you dont know are there~ Tough economics in Career can leave you penniless~ Still requires YouTube tutorials to find stuff out- Sponsorships are not easy to figure out- Bug sets building upgrades to $0 allowing instant upgradeWhat was already a solid game is solidifying into a final product. I'd love there to be some intro and cut-scenes to get us closer to our kerbalnauts. It's still not bug free and does have an air of indie/beta about it but this is one project that is being run correctly and has been a joy to support.-------------------------------------------------As of release (0.9B)+ Kerbal's are cute and fun to interact with (sent screaming into space)+ The complex physics of space flight is accessible+ Hugely sense of reward in achieving even small steps for Kerbal kind+ Lots to do and experiment with+ Regular updates and an active community of modders+ Sound already is fun and adds to the atmosphere~ Graphics are not phenomenal but are appropriate~ Loading times are unoptimised but nothing bad~ Some interfaces are unrefined but totally functional- Still in Beta so issues are forgiveable and probably being resolved- Tutorial leaves out useful info and needs expanding- Sponsorships are not easy to figure out and brokenWhat a hugely fun and charming game that demands your love and attention. You care about your dim lil Kerbal's and it's fun to see them flounder and succeed. The science is well packaged to be accessible and if you take the time to experiment and read around the subject it becomes all the more rewarding.Recommended for those who like space, science and being educated as they are entertained.Conclusion: 8/10. A work in progress you can invest hours of enjoyment in already.			",683,273,20,84,61,7,96

								Every once and a while I'd pick up a new videogame, play it for a few weeks, beat it, then put it down after it was over. That is the general pattern of gamers this day in age, where developers make a game with hopes that the player will get a good 7-8 hours of fun, then leave it satisfied and thirsty for more.Then I heard about a game called Kerbal space program in 2012. I watched the trailers and a few gameplay vids, and thought that this looks interesting enough to try out, maybe I'll get a weeks worth of gameplay out of it... oh boy was I wrong.KSP is an example of how a videogame can change the way you see videogames forever. It is revolutionary, it is inspiring, and it is educational; and it doesn't even have an objective! The player is given an entire solar system to explore via the utilization of their very own space program. It literally is 'Build, Fly , Dream.' No videogame seems to have figured out that the best way to keep a person engaged is to provide them with their OWN goals and the tools to reach them. You start KSP with no instructions, only a small tutorial on how KSP basically works. Then the game lets you do whatever you want. So what do players do? They invent a new challenge for themselves, like to make it into orbit. So the player keeps designing, building, testing and crashing, until they reach their goal. And OH BOY is it satisfying! You feel accomplished, like you've done something unique in your life and want to share it with the world. Then you see the Mun in the background and you say to yourself... ""I wanna go there next!"" So the player builds, tests, fails, retests etc until they get to their goal. This goes on for the rest of your gaming career in KSP. Wanna build a space shuttle? Go ahead! Wanna build a car? Go ahead. Wanna build an elevator? Go ahead. Wanna build ANYTHING you want that actually WORKS via physics, this game lets you. It is the ultimate expression of engineering, creativity and the human spirit. I cannot sing this games praises enough. I picked it up in summer of 2012 and have played it EVERY. SINGLE. DAY since then. And if the stock game becomes too easy... why not try some of the communities mods? Everytime you download a new mod, you basically get a new game with more toys to build and design with. I don't need any other game other than this one. Thank you Squad for reinvigorating my hope in videogames! 10/10 and it's not even finished yet!Bravo!			",37,4,0,3,3,0,0

Posted: May 5, 2015
												Kerbal Space Program version 1.0.2.  I've been playing the early access game for over 2 years, but now that it became official I thought I'd write a review.  My review is very positive.   (But see the caveat about version 1.0 below at the bottom).(Full disclosure: I don't work for SQUAD but I do help write one of the mods for the game, so I am personally invested in this.)Get This Game.  For once a sci-fi game that is actual sci-fi and not science fantasy.  It doesn't insult the intelligence of the player, and it speculates what-if, in a relatively reasonable way, only breaking a few laws of physics here and there where needed for gameplay, rather than breaking ALL of them constantly like most space video games do.Kerbal Space Program as history:Although the solar system in the game is artificially smaller than would realistically be possible (so it doesn't take as long to get things done as it really would), it still has all the parts and the right places to emulate historical real-world space programs.  Don't be fooled by the cute derpy-looking Kerbals - you can use the game to see what it would be like to emulate historical actual space missions - space stations in low orbit, docking maneuvers, performing an Apollo-style ""Mun"" landing, send rover probes to ""Duna"" (which is Mars-like), and so on.  All from gluing together parts and having fun.(And if you really want to go all-out, there are user community mods out there that replace the game's solar system with the real thing, so you can really try these missions out in full size).Kerbal Space Program as a 'tycoon' style game:If you like the old style 'tycoon' games where you have to come up with a means of keeping your business afloat and research new technologies to do interesting things as you move on to bigger and more ambitious projects, then Kerbal Space Program Career Mode is for you.  Start up a new game, pick ""career mode"", set Normal or Easy difficulty (do NOT use Hard until you've played a while), and you'll have the fun of trying to balance funding (for making better space center buildings, and for making the rockets themselves), reputation (for making future offers you see be better for you), and science points (for buying your way up the tech tree).  Accept contracts, and try to fufill them cheaply so your space agency makes money from them to fund the other stuff you want to do.   Don't fail them or else you'll lose funds and rep for it.Kerbal Space Program as a mod platform:From it's early access days, a user community of modders has grown, such that you can do just about anything you can think of with the game.  As of this writing, because KSP 1.0.2 is relatively new, some of those mods won't work just yet, but they will after only a week or two.  If past use is anything to go by that's about how long it takes for the modders to catch up to a new release.  As Steam is not the only means of obtaining the game, and not even the first means of obtaining it, the company, SQUAD, has chosen not to support Steam Workshop for mods due to the way it would open up the chance for people to make Steam-only mods that would be unfair to those who bought the game in its early days and supported the company before the game was even on Steam.  I support this decision, but it does mean you'll have to take a few extra steps to find the mods and install them.  Look up ""KSP"" on curse.com and look for Kerbalstuff.com.  most mods are in both places.Kerbal Space Program as ""edutainment"":The game is quite educational, but in that good sneaky fun way, where you don't realize you're learning - you're just trying to get stuff done in the game and in so doing learning stuff along the way.  If you've got a teenager or pre-teen at home, give this to them.  It does something that is really hard to do - it *demonstrates* though gameplay how a mathematical concept works, visually, without revealing the actual formulas, in such a way that the hard math can come *after* the intuitive understanding.  Usually what makes math hard is that the understanding and 'feel' can't happen until *after* you understand the numbers.  But here, it lets you play with the phenomenon first, and understand it later after its behavior has becomine intuitive to you, rather than the other way around.Get. This. Game.A caveat:My review refers to the 1.0.2 version of KSP and emphatically NOT to the 1.0 initial release that came out a week before and had a critical re-entry bug.  Had I written the review about the 1.0 version, it would not have been as kind.  The 1.0 release was rushed by about a week.  The 1.0.2 release from a week later was MUCH better, and is probably what should have been the 1.0 release.R.E. The KSP 1.0 re-entry bug:  You may read reviews by people complaining about re-entry being broken when 1.0 game out.  Those reviews weren't wrong *at the time* they were written.  KSP 1.0 was rushed out with a re-entry bug that was very unfair, and importantly, really obvious so it's hard to imagine how they missed it.  Adding a heat shield actually *caused* the ship to blow up on re-entry because adding it made the vessel flip nose-first, rendering the heat shield worse than useless as a part.  If you see reviews complaining about this behavior, be aware that they are stale and referring to an old version. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I absolutely love this game.  When I first started playing however, I did not.  I kept hopping in for an hour or so and attempted to play, never getting much done.  This went on for the first 30-40 hours I played the game.  In theory it seemed like a cool game I would like, but I could not get past the learning curve with my limited playtime.  Finally I quit playing an MMO and really sunk my teeth into KSP.  With the help of Scott Manley  and his amazing tutorials I started to really understand what in the world I was doing.  After my tutorial spree I spend time playing with different mods and ultimately unlocked the tech tree in science mode.  Then for the first time I played in career mode.  For me it was a different spin on how I played and it hooked me back in again.  As of now, I can send spacecraft to other planets, land on them, do some science, and return to Mother Kerbal without killing anyone (usually).If you think you might like it, try the demo, watch some of Scott Manley's tutorials, check out the KSP subreddits, but most importantly give yourself some time to know what in the hell you are doing!

												It's okay for a couple hours.*Update*So, all jokes aside, I felt like it would be good to give this review a little more effort to make it more useful for people considering the game.   This is a game I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone who has interest in space or exploration. You will learn how NASA and other space agencies perform maneuvers such as orbital rendezvous and Hohmann transfer orbits. Unlike some games that have been claimed to ""have potential"", this is a game where you discover YOUR OWN potential for planning and finding creative ways to accomplish tasks.    Vehicle construction works like Legos and is very intuitive. The modding community is HUGE and there are lots of tools that make designing the perfect vehicle easier, such as delta v and thrust to weight ratio calculations. This sounds educational, and it is, but it is incredibly fun and gives an immense sense of accomplishment when you learn how to reach your next milestone. The feeling of landing on another celestial body the first time is an unparalleled sense of satisfaction.    This is Early Access done right. The game is fantastic and has infinite replayability. This is the most bang (literally) for your buck you will get out of any game. In the words of Scott Manley, ""Fly safe.""			",68,11,0,11,8,0,7

												I've only had this game for a month and I've already logged over 50 hours into it. Kerbal Space Program is NOT simply a game about building rockets, launching them, and seeing where they go. Its tagline is ""Conquering Space Was Never This Easy"", and that is true, it is easy, compared to doing it in real life. But don't let it fool you- KSP actually has a pretty steep learning curve. In the month that I've had this game, I've only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of Kerbin (KSP's version of Earth). I haven't even gotten to a single moon or other planet. But don't let that deter you. Look up tutorials for the game (Side note- The in-game tutorials are actually pretty terrible. I recommend finding ones online, such as Scott Manley's, who does a great job of explaining how the game works). The sense of accomplishment you get when you do accomplish those tasks- even if it's just setting up a simple probe like I did- is phenomenal. And from what I've seen, once you do manage to master the game, you can do basically anything. Never give up.All in all, Kerbal Space Program is not just a game. It's a lifestyle.10/10			",75,21,0,7,14,0,8

PROs ""You have a solar system, a box of rocket parts and a race of suicidal green men who love exploring and explosion and your mission is to help them."" Rocket science made easy: KSP is the easiest way to understand and learn about everything space related, from designing and building rockets or planes to orbital mechanics, docking and rendezvous and the means of traveling to other celestial bodies. An overwhelming depth: Let's be honest - your first attempt at launching a rocket will be disastrous and you won't go anywhere even close to space. But from failures you will learn, to arise from the ashes and achieve more and more greater stuff. Soon you will be on your first suborbital-trajectory, have your first Kerbal astronaut in space and so on and so on; and yet you have no clue of the possibilities that await you. But with logic and lots of explosions (trial&error seems to be a leading motive at the Kerbal Space Center) you will always advance somehow. Be rewarded for your achievements: KSP does not have integrated achievements that tell you what virtual master piece of a task you just completed, and yet everything you accomplish feels more fulfilling than it ever felt before. You are behind the success or failure of whatever you do. A humorous touch: Very early in the game you will realize that those small green guys (that are somehow in the fashion of the minions of Despicable Me) you command are very keen to progress in their space program. They are also a little bit clumsy and as you can imagine the combination results in a lot of explosion, but Kerbals like nothing more than explosions and therefore failure will never feel devastating.   A devouted developer: Squad, who is responsible for KSP, is working hard to improve their game continiously. What started years ago in an early alpha version of the game has developed contionously and even now, after the official release, there is a steady flow of updates, additions and fixes. Similar to Skyrim the game is easily moddable and has a tremendous amount of mods that are easily installable and often high-quality.CONs ""We're gonna need a rescue mission""You will lose: This game is definitely no game that guides you from A to Z like many other newer games do, and on your journey there will be loss of material - parts, rockets and Kerbals. But this is just part of the experience and the process of learning. The in-game tutorials offer you a sufficient start and if you further want to increase your knowledge and limits there is always the possibility to watch videos or read guides - both of those are out there in great quality!

												The best thing about Kerbal is when your crazy plans actually pan out. For example, (before they added the claw) one of my ships was stranded in high-orbit with no fuel. It was carrying valuable science, but had no docking port. So, I built a rescue ship with a big metal butterfly net to capture the stranded ship manually, and bring it safely home. That♥♥♥♥♥♥worked.In KSP, you ♥♥♥♥ up. The fun part is thinking of ridiculous plans to un-♥♥♥♥ up.			",40,6,0,6,26,0,12

Posted: June 30, 2016
												I bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it.  I've played KSP off an on for a few years. The game has a very active mod-making fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play.  My best review of this game is anecdotal.  (I sent this to a friend when I was only a few hours into play.  I had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics. Anyone who plays KSP might find this story relatable.)""One of my test flights put 3 Kerbals into orbit. They were low on fuel so I did a retrograde burn to bring them home.  Except that I didn't do a retrograde burn, I did a prograde burn.  By the time I realized it, I had burned too much fuel to get them home.  I reduced their orbit as much as possible, even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters.   They were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point.  With no way to return to the surface under their own power, I had one option; a rescue mission.I built a new ship, one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which I dubbed ""Lost Eagle.""  Lost Eagle had been fitted with docking collar and I guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort.   The rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue.  The final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for it's relatively low weight.  This would end up being the ultimate design flaw.   It was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members, and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before re-entry.  Docking is hard.  I would say impossible but I've seen videos of people doing it and I know it can be done.   But despite many hours and multiple misses. I had got Rescue 1 and Lost Eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away.  I closed enough distance that I felt it would be close enough to 'jump.'The first crew member from Lost Eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one.  It went pretty smoothly, but in the process the ships drifted further apart.  I did a corrective burn on Rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member.  Success again.   1 left.   He jumped, this time from the furthest gap.   He too arrived successfully.  I felt a rush of success, a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in today's video games.    Plenty of fuel for the retro burn.   They were coming home.  This process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while.The design of the re-entry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip.  She wasn't pretty, but she was light and efficient.  The plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere, but I had discovered that I couldn't deploy the parachutes from the re-entry craft.  It was a problem I had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but I was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit.  The whole thing still landed successfully in my tests.At 5000m above the surface, having survived re-entry. I pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes.   I don't know if I double tapped it or if I had just had my staging backwards, but when I hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can.  Knowing full well that there was nothing I could do to save the pilot of Rescue 1 I watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival.  I quickly switched to the other part of the ship.  I tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them.  The hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs.  No controls that could be used to deploy the chutes.  Again I watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom, the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second.  The game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission, or even the assembly area where I could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals.  I chose not to.  I was angry at myself for the mistake. I had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what I knew was a flawed design.  The empty ship, Lost Eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any Kerbal that looks up, that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results.  I will be reminded of this every time I play the game."" ",61,4,0,8,20,0,28

												Possibly the best purchase of a digital product I have ever made.Pros -* Educational, but in an optional and completely natural manner.  * Makes light of a terrifying subject matter.* A true sandbox with no invisible walls or assumptions made about your competency.* A fairly accurate and interactive physics system with tools to help you use it.* Almost everything in the game can explode, melt or die, with game options to prevent it.* Might start you on a new found interest in real world space exploration.* Extensive, active and competent modding community.* Development / bug fixes continue long after official launch of the game.Cons -* The ingame universe feels a bit dead, as there are no cities or npc's. Only a scattering of easter eggs.  That said, you probably will not spent too much time actually on planets running around (the planets are about 1/10th scale, which is still HUGE) and so might not notice.*** Updated post 1.1 release ***			",42,11,0,8,18,0,4

												In my Steam library, there are about a half dozen games that are in a special category called ""All Time Greats"". Civ IV is there. Skyrim is in there. KSP is in there.Note my play time does NOT include the 50-100 hours I put in before the game was ever on Steam.Simply one of the best products in the last decade, KSP is not your typical ""game"". It's a software toy. You tinker. You experiment. You adjust. You tweak. And you have a grand time doing it. KSP is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a super-deluxe space rocket that can go to the Mun or Eve with ease. If it did that KSP would not be any fun. Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam. Instead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions. You'll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit. You'll pump your fist when you land on the Mun for the first time. And you'll continue having fun.What are you waiting for? Go buy it!

												As goofy as the game seems, you will NOT find a more in depth and accurate space flight simulation out there yet.At first, it's fun to build explosive and cobbled together monstrosities to launch into space and send crashing back to the ground, but then you learn the basics. Then suddenly a successful Mun landing becomes a point of pride and the next planet over becomes your new goal.The career mode starts you with simple parts, to be expanded through scientific discoveries and contractual financial incentives.

												Kerbal Space program is my 2nd most favourite game of all time. I always have loved building things. I love realism and I love the idea of space travel. It covers all these aspects and more! Better yet, you can mod the game to make it even more amazing. There is many hundreds of hours of gameplay to be had here. The Kerbal Space Program (KSP) game community is massive. With so many mods available, the game can easily be surpassed with more gameplay experiences such as Mechjeb or FAR (Ferram Aerospace). So when game updates, it can break your ship builds if the mod isn't updated. Some mods are not updated for months. That's about the only downer really. I would have liked multiplayer as a feature but it may be added in the future. Only time will tell.Pros:>> Building your own space ships.>> Realistic stock physics. Can be upgraded with a mod called FAR>> Exploration. Game can be played in sandbox mode a bit like minecraft.>> Game actually teaches you orbital mechanics. NASA use this game to teach people about space.>> Uses a recent build of the Unity engine so graphics are pretty decent.>> Sound track is good for an indie game.>> Many many hours of gameplay to be had.>> Flight controls are good once you get accustomed to them. You can use joystics too.>> Interface is useful, ie navball, fast forward, setting waypoints etc...>> The KSP Forums are helpful where people share designs and talk about mods etc...Cons:>> Saving and loading is a bit confusing.>> Could use a better navigation system. Ie hard to locate runway when landing or locating a waypoint on the map.>> Takes away a lot of your real life time. You could spend 8 hours on this game and not even realise the time had gone by.>> Some mods are so damn awesome that you become dependent on them. Recommended mods:B9 Aerospace parts pack.B9 Procedural wingsEngineer Redux (To show you more info as to what's going on)Ferram Aerospace Research (Adds advanced simulated flight physics)MechjebI bet there are hundreds of other amazing mods out there for this gameI give this game 9.5 out of 10			",96,8,1,11,4,0,21

												If you like space, engineering, or just building crazy things and seeing what happens, you will enjoy this game. You will love this game, and it will love you back. This is quite possibly one of the greatest games ever made. My first moon landing experience 4 years ago was life changing, and I say that without an ounce of shame. This game will inspire you, challenge you and reward you like none other. I can't say enough good things about this game. It is pure magic, and there is nothing else like it. I give it a 100% perfect score in my book, and with the size and quality of the modding community this game will keep you busy for thousands of hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A sandbox in space shouldn't technically be possible so the career mode may suit you better. If building massive rockets with a belligerent and indifferent attitude to gravity, maths and science is your thing you can do that.You might want to create sophisticated engineering marvels with all kinds of equations about dV, TWR.Discover boffin level science and pretend to be cool as the family wonders why you're counting backwards, loudly? Prefer to be a nerd on steroids?Maybe watching little green Kerbals grinning stupidly as you perform amazing feats of...... crashing is your thing. Perhaps planning a 3 day serious rescue mission to collect said crashed Kerbals is even better.Lack of knowledge about rockets, gravity, physics is helpful. Comprehensive knowledge about rockets, gravity, physics is also helpful.Only your imagination can stop you!  Oh, and gravity, fuel shortages, poor orbital transects, hard surfaces and bad designs.If you know what Skylab was, what Voyager is and you are fully aware that ISS is not some new FPS shoot-em-up, Kerbal Space Program is for you.

								This game will teach you more about physics than any bloody school.Starting off, my ships all exploded on the launchpad. Eventually, though I managed to get a ship to 10.000 meters up in the air before it fell back on the ground, killing everyone within. ''That'', I thought, ''was the greatest thing I have ever done.''Fast forward a week or two later, and I have already mastered orbiting, have landed on the Mun, Duna and Eve and am ready to set up my first refueling space stacion and send a rover to Duna.This game pumps more adrenaline into my veins than any FPS out there, and is probably the most rewarding game I have ever played. Landing your first ship will make you jump, I promise you that.The only downside is that there are some fairly annoying glitches, for example, warping time in atmosphere ♥♥♥♥s your ship up badly, but they don't appear all that often. Definetly a must buy.			",80,9,4,0,6,0,1

												Kerbal Space Program, AKA ""One Thousand Ways to Definitely NOT build a rocket.""Coming from a physicist, I love this game, and all of my physics/math/CS/engineering friends love it too.  Granted that's a pretty narrow selection of people, but judging from all the other good reviews, I'd say our opinions reflect the general consensus.You should buy this game.  Then you should go tell everyone you know about it.  Then maybe public opinion on space exploration will get a bit of a nudge back toward where it belongs.			",81,14,1,8,18,1,14

								At this point I have dumped 445 hours into this game, and I don't regret a single minute of it. I absolutely love this game even though I can still be considered bad at it. But that is exactly why this game is fun. No matter how good you get someone else will show you something simple and it will just massively expand gameplay options for you. I would recommend this game to anyone that has any interest in space travel. As far as I'm concerned this game does it the best.			",69,8,1,14,11,0,4

Lots of pretty corkscrew contrails in the sky. Rocket crashed. Bob survived.3) Third rocket was a repeat of second rocket. Still hadn't learned.4) Fourth time everything worked and Bob still survived.5) Several rockets later I reached low orbit. Beautiful!6) Enjoying the game very much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I consider KSP a staple of my collection - and one of my favourite games of all time. One of the first (maybe the first) games I backed as an early access project, before that was even really a thing.If you love to build, simulate and generally enjoy space - then you'll enjoy KSP. The building is fantastic, and there's a healthy modding community that make it all the better.There are things I don't like about it though. I think that it could be prettier. I think that the UI could be slicker. Generally it could do with more polish. I'm OK with the fact that it's a fantasy (for want of a better term) setting, it's probably a better game for it, but it won't be for everyone. I know I'd prefer Elite Dangerous meets KSP - but had that been the ambition it'd likely have fallen short - maybe KSP 2 :)			",157,44,13,15,40,2,21

												This game is nothing short of amazing. While seemingly simple at first, the game quickly shows how much it has to offer. There is a whole solar system for you to discover, planets to land on (and attempt a return from) in the stock game, and with a large and active modding base, the combinations for rocket types and adventures are endless. The game also gives you a far better appreciation of the difficulties, challenges and indeed triumphs of actual space programs, past and present. From various types of custom built rockets, space planes, space stations, and installations on other worlds that can be constructed, Kerbal reminds us how good games can be, and is a game that will definitely not leave you disappointed and keep you coming back for more and more, as the amount of sleep you get dwindles away.

Kerbal Space ProgramI started off with this game quite some time ago, back in the days when Kerbin was still neon green and all the fuel tanks were an ungodly blue color. I feel like the time has finally come for me to offer some decent feedback on this title, so that others know what to expect.GraphicsThis game isn't very impressive visually, and while its art style is mostly consistent that doesn't change the fact that it suffers from both somewhat low resolution textures and a general lack of detail. For example, the lack of settlements on the Earth-analogue planet. I won't criticize it too heavily, though. While orbiting a planet or moon, the game does shine quite nicely - literally, as the sun rises over your celestial body of choice. Despite its flaws, it definitely gets the job done better than its closest relative Orbiter[orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk], and one should keep in mind that it is an indie title. There's enough detail here to be satisfied, and that's without installing modifications.


High Speed, Low Drag 
A Screenshot of Kerbal Space Program
By: Lavernius Regalis




AudioThe in-game audio design is decent, but it gets repetitive eventually. The explosions are particularly satisfying. The music is calming, but also gets extremely repetitive after some time. I would suggest modifications, or to mute it and put your own music on instead. There isn't a ton to talk about here.PerformanceThis game's performance has improved considerably lately. Previously, I would've had a bone to pick with Kerbal Space Program, but it has made a turn for the better in the past year or so. It still won't run on just any PC, but even unimpressive laptops can run it on low settings fairly comfortably. I should note that performance is highly dependant on what is currently happening in-game. If you construct a large ship, the framerate will drop due to physics calculations. Also, the newest version of the game has some issues with regards to bugs and glitches, so you might want to wait for another patch or else revert back to an earlier version via Steam Beta.GameplayThis title is in a league of its own with regards to gameplay. I'm still not sure that I've ever played anything like it. It features (mostly) realistic orbital physics and revolves around a sandbox building experience where you construct virtually anything - ranging from space shuttles to fighter craft to rovers... even to boats - out of rocket and aircraft parts. Some people will spend all their time using aerodynamics mods to create realistic aircraft designs, others will recreate historical rocket missions. Some might colonize another planet, and others might just spend most of their time crashing into the ground or fumbling as they try to understand how space really works. No matter what you like doing, there's almost certainly something for everyone with Kerbal Space Program. If you're up to the challenge, you can even begin a career managing a space program, accepting contracts and missions to fund your launches. In my opinion, the only game that comes close to rivaling this title's gameplay is Orbiter, and that title is a much more in-depth space flight simulator that does not allow building your own ships out of different parts. Note that the game has no multiplayer as of this review's publishing.


Kerbal Space Program

Community ContentThis game is absolutely phenomenal with its community content. From its humble beginnings, the aeronautical parts in-game were directly inspired by a modification, and the author of that mod was later hired by Kerbal Space Program's development team. There are now mods for everything. Realistic aircraft engines. Weaponry, ranging from machine guns to ballistic missiles. Careful recreations of historical spacecraft. Complete remakes of the physics system to be extremely realistic. In-game computer systems that will do things for you. Audio and visual modifications that completely change how the world looks. And, of course, complete overhauls to the Solar System, bringing things to the scale of real life. The game doesn't even have multiplayer, and someone took the time to code a fully functional mod to make it happen. The possibilities for community-driven content are endless in this game, and more is created every day.VerdictThis game is a perfect example of everything right in PC gaming, and is probably one of my favorite titles on Steam. I gained a better understanding of orbital physics from it than I did by reading about orbital physics in textbooks and encyclopedias, and I still marvel at all the possibilities in this game. It is simply incredible how it has progressed from its Early Access days, and despite its flaws, and the questionable decisions made by its publisher, it is a fantastic title that I recommend everyone try.I recommend Kerbal Space Program.

												""Kerbin, We have a problem...""                  -Bill Kerman in the command pod next to Jeb, who opened the hatch during re-entry. First of all, I played this game for a LONG time, way before the 1.0 release (not on steam, no)To be honest, the is probably the best game I ever played in my whole life. I mean, I'm an astronomy nerd for almost 9 years and trust me... This is real space travelling. This game will entertain you for the rest of your life and if you like astronomy/airplanes or looking at a star during night at all, this game can't go wrong. This game allows you to play in 3 different modes and the ultimate goal is to explore different bodies and complete researches. However, the 3 different levels has their own way of fun too. So, the basic mechanic of the game is you put together a craft in ANYWAY you want and with ANY PARTS you want! Then, you do the calculations for a specific mission (or not). They you fly it! You can build a plane and fly around, or build a rocket to go visit the different planets and the moons in the system! You can actually do anything you want in the game, capture and asteriod, dock to make a station or go mining on the Mun. So, learn REAL rocket science by starting this game!Now... 11/10 would complete a Jool all-moon landing mission and forget to bring parachute when going back to kerbin12/10 would attach a solid booster to a VTOL13/10 would unorbit a space station that I built for 10 month just to see the solar panels snap14/10 would spend 200 hours of the game calculating and design a ship so that it will glich through Jool15/10 would spend 2 hours trying to make a kerbal dance on the Narrow-Band Scanner (you can do that)16/10 would blast a kerbal with a kerbodyne engine to let it fly 17/10 would script edit and make the sperators have 10,000,000 ejection force and name it ""velocity injector""18/10 would slingshot around all the moons in Jool and glich through Jool, launching yourself at 5,144,255,345m/s19/10 would build an aircraft carrier then attach a F22 to it and build a aircraft catapult using the ""velocity injector"" (it crashed, the plane, not the game!)20/10 would 9/11 the VA... I mean nothing 21/10 will play kerbal for the rest of my life!Now, with the new update of 1.2, new communication networks and etc. The game got even better and even cheaper! So, with the 1.2 update, IT'S WORTH YOUR 23 BUCKS! And I think I made myself LOUD AND CLEAR!haha... okay... get it?			",20,2,0,1,2,0,1

												You know, when I first saw this game way back in early access, I thought, ""Cartoony, throw away game, not worth the effort."" But, then I researched a little, and watched a couple of episodes on youtube detailing game play.I was more than intrigued. I bought the game in what was called early access beta, but it was already pretty polished. I think that was in versions .6 or so? I became OK and landed on Mun and Minimus several times. Many, many times, actually, and maxed out science just by going to Mun and Minimus and getting every biome.But, then I set the game aside. I didn't want to be burned out on it before it actually left Beta. I recently returned and almost ragequit. Many things have changed. Everything I thought I knew, I had either forgotten or didn't work anymore. I have played it a lot the last few days. I have had a lot of successes and a lot of failures, but I am essentially back to where I was before I quit. The learning curve is pretty steep. Do you want to just fly out of the atmosphere? Fairly easy to figure out. Do you want to fly to one of the moons, land, and then take off with the expectation of getting back to Kerbin (Kerbal's Earth)? It's going to take a lot more knowledge.I do recommend this game, but I have to agree with someone else. Unless you're an engineer by nature, you're probably going to need help at some point, because this game is not a child's game. It is tough, but rewarding.I try not to look at too much on youtube because I don't want to spoil it for myself, but I am to the point that it is going to take a drastic rethinking of what I'm doing, or I am going to need to watch tutorials to get anywhere out of Kerbin's orbit and get back safely. I sent an unmanned probe to Duna (basically Kerbin's Mars). I was not able to bring it back. Thankfully, no Kerbals were killed on that adventure.Yes, I'd say get this game. If you see it on sale, then grab it immediately. I guess I have put 170 hours in to it. I'll probably put thousands into it before it is all over.			",45,6,1,11,17,0,17

Its a must buy!I owe the countless Kerbals ive sent to their deaths a 10/10.			",226,14,5,11,16,0,17

 Overview Utterly fantastic space simulation game. I cannot recommend this game enough, it has brought me hours of fun and has really managed to enable me to rediscover my personal passion for space exploration. There are three main game modes: Career, Science, and Sandbox.In Career mode you take control of your own space program and must manage administrative, financial, and logistical aspects of your space program. There is a detailed research system for unlocking new technologies to use in your spacecraft. You will take contracts from various organizations, earning money upon completion. These contracts will get progressively more challenging and rewarding as you advance your space program.In Science mode you are free from the financial and administative burdens of career mode but are still faced with having to research technology for your spacecraft. You progress along the tech tree by performing various science experiments on your home planet and various other celestial bodies, with experiments performed in more distant and challenging environments granting more beneficial rewards.In Sandbox mode you are free to build and explore whatever you like and are not limited by any tech tree or financial limits. Positive Aspects +In-dept and accurate space simulation with realistic physics and particularly noteworthy orbital mechanics.+Very challenging and rewarding gameplay.+Wide variety of celestial bodies to explore.+Ability for player to choose from a selection of pre-built spacecraft or construct their own using a very intricate construction system featuring a large variety of parts to choose from.+Features unmanned probes aswell as spacecraft piloted by Kerbals.+Optional communications system for unmanned probes which require them to have a connection to mission control. This adds an additional layer or difficulty and realism to the unmanned space program, allowing for the construction of satellite communication networks around the star system.+Excellent community.+Large amounts of superb mods available.+Very large explosions.+New features are still being added by the developers. Neutral Aspects ~Planets, although  very  large, are not realistically large.~Celestial bodies are (somewhat accurately) extemely empty and desolate, with few surface features apart from a few rocks or trees  and a few easter eggs here and there... ~Does not feature any real form of pre-made story (though the player is free to make their own).~Does not feature any online functionality or multiplayer.~Has a very steep learning curve, particularly for players with no previous knowledge of orbital mechanics or astrophysics, though a wide variety of  excellent tutorials  easily available.~Unfortunatley lacks Steam Workshop support as of the time of writing. Negative Aspects -Not a particullarly good looking game. (Personally, I use a variety of mods which make the game look  utterly beautiful [forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com].)-Can have some performance issues when dealing with extremely large spacecraft. (significatly improved as of the 1.2 update)-Some may consider the game to be a bit too expensive. Conclusion Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in space, adventure, or very large explosions. In my opinion, no other game can give you the same amazing feeling as when you first land kerbals on the moon (Mun). This game has brought me so much fun, and I simply love it.			",42,6,1,4,9,0,5

												[EARLY ACCESS REVIEW] KSP is a challenging space-sandbox simulation game. Pros:+Vast open area (space) to play in+Highly detailed planets+Amazing customization for the space planes/rockets+Detailed base for launches.+Complex physics+Nothing is easy (might be a con for others)+Cool easter eggs here and there. (Space kraken, monoliths, pyramids, etc.)+Science and career mods are amusing (I prefer science)+Highly detailed UI, but fairly easy to learn.+Mod support+Cheat tab (ctrl+alt+f12)+Kerbals, they add some comedy to the game, and are just great in general.+Out of spaceship walking is fluid and smooth+Graphics are great.+Regular updates, keep the game new and fresh+Able to speed up time (this prevents the game from getting boring most of the time)+First person cockpits are a nice addition to the game+Controls for the spaceships/planes are nice+Animations are excellent+Graphics options are detailed+Well optimizedI could name more, but I think I'll stop here.Cons:-Occasionaly glitchy and sometimes crashes (but this doesn't matter that much since it's in Early Access)-No steam workshop (there is so many mods already, and it is so easy to install them, adding Steam Workshop support to the game would be amazing)-Price is a little high-sometimes you cannot speed up time in certain areas, which causes the player to wait 10 minutes just to get to the interesting parts of the game.Overall, KSP is a excellent game, and I see a bright future ahead for the developers and the game.

												This game should be said its for those that have atleast some Engineering or Scientific side to themselves.Yes you go to space, if you can design your own rocket to get there.But Kerbal Space Program is more then just rocketry, you can build space stations, rovers, space planes, and even some other unimmaginable things I haven't listed.Or if you want, you can build some contraption to see how far you can launch a Kerbal, really the choice is yours.There are tons of mods for the game, some are far better then others.   A whole variety of game changing mods from mechanics to realism or even down right silly.Yes its not really for everyone, its not ""fast-paced"" at all but it is challenging to those of us who can design things and face defeat when we fail at designing (or just revert to assembly).Can you get to the outter most planets on KSP?Since the newer versions of KSP, We've also been able to do science things and manage our budgets and even play with asteroid capturing.   And they're still working on adding even more to the game.The only real con I have about the game is that it doesnt like to run with massive/intricately designed items.  But thats just a physx limitation, and a proper Physx card will fix most of this issue (to an extent).			",123,20,2,26,29,0,38

												Mission Control asks me to put a craft into orbit.Third attempt, looks like Jeb's gonna be just a little short on fuel again.Burns all his fuel because he's not gonna make orbit anyway.Realizes that he did in fact achieve Orbit.Mission Control informs him that they didn't tell the recovery team Jeb was staying in space, so they are still looking for him.Jeb is about to resign himself to being stuck in space when he has a bright idea.Climbs out of pod and uses monopropellent jetpack to attempt to push his pod into a decaying orbit.Succeeds on pushing pod into decaying orbit: ""Mission Control, I'm coming home!""Few minutes later, Jeb and his pod burn up on re-entry.R.I.P Jeb :'(Great game, I've had lots of fun with it so far, and reaching the mun's orbit is the farthest I've made it. There are some really cool mods for it too, I my personal favorite so far has been the SCANSAT mod. Also the whole presentation of the game is well done too imo, a lot of little details that really make it feel like the Kerbals are running the most incompetant space program ever. The incompetant space program feeling usually makes accidents more comical than frustrating, at least for me. It can be difficult to learn, but if you have the patience to learn it, it's totally worth it. At the ~$40 asking price it's worth more than 99% of AAA $60 games, imho.			",177,14,1,21,26,0,37

Kerbal Space Program is a deceptively dense game hiding behind the cute green Kerbals that populate this space-age world. In Career mode you’re given a basic NASA-like facility. Buildings include Vehicle Assembly, Tracking Station, Mission Control, and a launch site that’s little more than a slab of concrete.Money is earned by accepting various missions, such as providing an orbital touring service, testing out new engine parts, and reaching the Mun. You can earn Science credits by succeeding in missions and using certain devices. Science is spent on a tech tree that unlocks advanced parts and components.A bunch of scenarios provide interesting challenges to work through, like returning a Kerbal from the Mun safely. There’s a ton of gameplay and replay value packed in.The heart of Kerbal Space Program lies in the Vehicle Assembly Building. The builder is intuitive and fun to snap together. You need to take heed of where all your parts go, and how your ship will steer. Decouplers eliminate empty engines and spare parts. Engines can be tweaked to carry a certain amount of fuel. Each device is activated through a staging sequence by pressing the spacebar before and during flight.Kerbal Space Program is rocket science. While the learning curve is rather steep, what the game sets out to do, it does extremely well.THE GOOD- Limitless creative freedom- Well designed, challenging career mode- Unbelievably impressive attention to detail- Incredible sense of satisfaction- Rewards persistence- Kerbals are hilariousTHE BAD- Mass amounts of information- A bit overwhelming at times- Default text size too small- Various camera modes can lead to nausea- A few graphical glitchesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

												i almost flipped the table when i created a space station and made it orbit the earth :|it felt like i've cured cancer and saved the humanity,no joke....this is the kind of game with no actual mission or goal but when you start getting ""somewhere"" it gives you a great sense of accomplishment.the game has no end,you can create endless missions for yourself and keep discovering new possibilities,and with mods it gets even better.KSP is like the ultimate space simulator,(don't know if that's a thing,don't care :D ) and everyone should try it....i haven't played much myself (yet) and i'm afraid if i put too much time into it i might get too addicted and abandon my social life just to play KSP!but i see myself putting at least +200-300 hours into this game in near future :)			",261,55,0,30,16,1,22

								When i was a child i dreamt of being a NASA engineer. Turns out i slacked off too much at school. Ah well. But i always had an interest in space, and particularly exploring it.This game gave me a sandbox to play in where i could design spacecraft and send little green men up into space above the blue earth... erm, i mean Kerbin. You know its always the little green men trying to visit earth in the movies. In this they cant get away quick enough. You know this game has something for everyone. Even if you do not have any real inclination to do anything so involved as perfect orbits, or landing perfectly on the moon (Mun) or whatever this game still gives you the chance to make crazy rockets that you can set off and see how far they get before it, and its possible inhabitants die a horrible, horrible death.And for those, like me who have a more involved interest in the subject matter, there is plenty that will satisfy you.Think you can do it better than NASA? Give it a go.For the price, you get a lot of play hours, and even some replayability. Check out the mods, also.			",67,7,0,6,38,1,18

								I can honestly say that had this been in existence when I was younger [turned 42 today] I would have been able to fullfil my dream of being in space.  I know, sounds corny I'm sure but this app and it's game play takes me back to my youth where Astronomy and Space were most of what I could dream, think and talk about.  Roll ahead a few decades and this game gives me such a sense of freedom, accomplishment and challenge.  Sure it's geeky, nerd stuff but honestly what isn't these days?  Madden 2015? Sure, geeks playing pixels of sports greats they can never be like so I guess it's not far off. (lol)This 'game' as they call it will teach you things about the science, mathematics and common sense problem solving that could help you in your life.  I'm sure by this point you're saying 'But how will an orbit trajectory to Mun help me..?' and 'How is knowing the dV to escape the SOI of Kerbal going to help me..?' and you for one would be right.  These, while still teaching the literal effect in game, also teaches you about solving sometimes complex puzzles or math problems or those 'how could I even do that?' types of questions.  From the first launch, which in itself is not 'easy' by any stretch of the imagination; to the 100th, 200th and several thousandth launch later you want to do more and push further into space.  It's those types of feelings that mold and lead those younger generations to wanting and wishing they knew and could do more.  Much like an aging dreamer, who at his younger years had always dreamt of getting the chance to leave this floating rock we call home.Game is great.  You just have to dream a little more, want a little more and do a little more.TL:DR - Game is stupendous and anyone interested in space, space flight and rocketry with a keen sense of having fun all the while doing math, physics and all that wonderful science stuff without really knowing you are/can/will.~Icky			",449,121,7,63,40,2,47

												This game. Oh, this game. I had a review that i posted back in October 2014 that i deleted in order to post this one for more accuracy. The game reached full release yesterday, so i deleted my Early Access review for the sake of accuracy when i posted this one.First of all, i want to make this absolutely clear that this game is not easy. I put this here due to a thread i saw a day ago of a man demanding his £30 back because the game was too hard, and he had no interest in ""3d oval orbits, etc."" While this was a gross lack of research on his part, and mostly his fault, i still thought i'd put this here. Especially with the new aerodynamics model, this game is the closest thing we have to an accurate spaceflight simulator.This game is about launching small, disproportionate green men into space....In theory. That's how it works if you're good at the game. (Like me! (humblebrag))If you're bad at the game, like most newbies, it ends up being more like launching small, disproportionate green men a few thousand metres into the air, then atmospheric drag pulls you back to the ground and kills said disproportionate green men. Unless you believe they're plants, like i do, then they just probably regrow somewhere.Your first step will be learning to orbit, then going to the Mun, then Minmus, then basically wherever you please. The game allows you to construct rockets or planes, then fly them. There's tens of parts to choose from, and lots to do in the game, if you have a bit of patience. The game has numerous tutorials and scenarios to help you out with the basics.I don't want this review to drag too long, since everything i would tell you here is better explained by people like Scott Manley. (Check out his channel on YouTube if you're interested in this game! He has a few tutorials there, also.)TL;DR this game is great and if you have an interest in space you should get it. Wait for a sale if you don't want to shell out £30 on it. Also do not forget the fact the game has a demo that you should most certainly get if you're interested in the game. Last i checked the demo is WAY outdated, though, so don't see it as a complete representation of the game.UPDATE: I should stress that you need persistence. If you fail, try and try again. Don't give up!			",24,3,0,3,9,0,6

Perhaps the greatest space exploration game there isAuthor's note: Upon reaching 100 hours in this game, I decided to write a lengthy review. Recently, however, I reached another milestone in the form of 400 hours. As such, I felt that the time was ripe to write a new, better review.I was born on the exact same day as the Mars Polar Lander was to touch down on the south pole of Mars. This NASA probe was going to broaden our knowledge of the red planet - not unlike countless other probes that had already visited - but this was, regrettably, not to be. Prior to landing, an error caused the craft to crash into the Martian surface at a high speed. Errors like this are common in Kerbal Space Program as well. We all know how it is: You've sent a lander-type probe or capsule through the Kerbol system, and at last, the target is right below you - be it the Mun, Duna, or any other solid object. At some point, you discover that there's not enough juice. Or not enough electricity to keep the baby under control. Or that there is enough fuel - but only for a landing. Which is fine if it's an unmanned probe, but good luck if you have three unlucky Kerbals on board. It's a good thing they cannot die of thirst, hunger, exhaustion or boredom. The interesting thing about KSP, however, is that these errors do not matter. You might have an impressive explosion on the launch pad, a complete failure while trying to leave the atmosphere, or a more annoying error - like the fact that your fancy satellite doesn't have enough batteries, or that you forgot to bring science instruments. But guess what? This game encourages you to try again. If you fail in this game, it will not shove you into a ditch and laugh. Rather, it will help you back up and tell you what went wrong. In Kerbal Space Program, it is quite simple to spot errors by experiencing them. And then, it is equally simple to fix that error with a small upgrade - say, an improved booster, or some extra batteries. Eventually, new problems will appear - and you fix those too. And through this trial and error, you get the perfect rocket at last.This is where the game suddenly becomes truly magnificent. For quite a lot of time, I didn't have any idea how to get my crafts into orbit. So I created a proper rocket, tried to figure out what went wrong the last times, modified the rocket accordingly, and then gave it a shot. Minutes later, a satellite is safely in orbit around Kerbin, telling me interesting things about the atmosphere and cheerily transmitting signals down to the surface. Obviously, I got a massive confidence boost because of this. You can probably guess what happened next: I put together a Saturn V-ish rocket and tried to send some (un)lucky Kerbals to the Mun. It didn't go as planned, to say the least: They all ended up burned or exploded, mostly the latter. So guess what I did? I went back to the drawing board, created a better rocket, took it through extensive testing, and then the day came. It was my own July 1969. Jebediah and Bill were now Neil and Buzz. And guess what? The Kerbin flag was planted firmly on the Mun, and my brave little Kerbonauts returned as heroes, becoming the public favorite for a future mission to Duna. But that's another story. Moving on from stories of trial, error, success and joy, it's time to look at what the game has to offer. As you've probably guessed by now, it's about building rockets and sending them into space. The wide range of parts, physics, planets and celestial objects allows you to create your own little NASA. Probes, space stations, capsules, landers, rovers and airplanes are all possible to design and cr- fly as you please. Why the ""Kerbal"" in the name? Well, this game takes place in a fictional planetary system with smaller planets, moons and distances. The Sun is named Kerbol, and orbiting it is Moho (basically Mercury), Eve (basically Venus), Kerbin (basically Earth, with humans being replaced by green-skinned, adorable Kerbals), Duna (basically Mars)...Yeah, you get the idea. The game has lots of planets and moons to visit, most of which are fully explorable. The game modes? You got three different modes, suited for different playstyles. Sandbox is simple: No progress, credits or reputation (we'll get back to that), but every rocket part and all upgrades available at no cost. If you enjoy building whatever you want with no consequences, Sandbox is fitting. Next out is Science. It works similarly to Sandbox, but with another interesting factor: You have to research and unlock new rocket parts by doing science. ""Science"" can be anything from taking a ground sample outside of your local space centre, or landing a rover on a distant planet to do geological surveys. The more interesting, the more science. The final mode is Career. In this mode, it's money-earning time. You start off as a small space agency with sheds instead of hangars and no capability to reach space whatsoever. So what do you do? There are three things that you need to focus on. First of all, science - we've already gone through that. Second, money. This is self-explanatory; earn money, buy rocket parts, build bigger and more expensive rockets, and upgrade your facilities - but how to earn money? This is where Reputation comes in.To put it simple: You earn Reputation by doing cool stuff and not messing it up - take a tourist into space, land a probe somewhere, et cetera. If you do mess up, you lose Reputation. Here's the fun part: Higher reputation means better Contracts. There are plenty of corporations that are willing to give you some money if you can satisfy their demands. Complete a contract, and get more Reputation, Science and money. Fail a contract? Yes, you guessed correctly. Now let's move back to space exploration. Let's say that you've done all your preparations, signed the necessary contracts, and launched some nice stuff into space. You got some satellites here and there, and even some Kerbals screaming for help at the Munar surface (let's pretend you have a rescue ship underway). Now what?Well, there's mods. This is one of the many areas where Kerbal Space Program really shines - mods. The game has an active, engaged modding community, and you can find a mod for just about everything. There's a mod that allows you to place a wall near your space center and have those pesky Kerxicans pay for it. Seriously, there is. But i'm not here to talk about that. Mods available include, but are not limited to: part sets with massive fuel tanks, engines and more; intricate, advanced space capsules for all your exploration needs; plugins that allow you to time your maneuvers, get better at docking or put things on autopilot; visual mods that give you enhanced skyboxes and magnificent atmospheres; whole new planets altogether that expand your frontiers greatly. And more. I could probably talk for hours about the various mods that are available, but I won't. I'll just say that most of them are amazing. If you're buying this game, make sure to grab a few mods. If you already have it, but don't use mods: Why?! If you have mods: Get some more mods. Mod it till it breaks, as some people would say.There are plenty of things that I have omitted from this review - mostly because I want to end things here. I could probably talk about the magnificence of docking, the beauty of well-placed orbital maneuvers or other things that could make a NASA engineer smile gleefully. For now, though, i'll advise you to place yourself firmly into the capsule and go into space. To summarize: Kerbal Space Program is an excellent space game that provides great experiences, combined with interesting gameplay and great mods, all while being a highly successfultake on sandbox, exploration and simulation alike. I can absolutely recommend it. ",9,1,0,3,3,0,0

								With the level of improvements they've made with each point release, I imagine KSP is going to be the most awesome game ever made by time 1.0 comes out.   With the latest, .23, we see some massive load time improvements, far less lag with high-part-count vehicles, tweakables *in the ship editor* and best of all, only one of my mods had issues, but it didn't crash the game - it simply didn't function at ""go time"".  That's already been fixed, it just hadn't been released officially as of this time yesterday.If you like space ship games, you will want this game - it's pretty damned hard if you're coming in with zero experience with rocketry, calculus and / or orbital mechanics.  You'll walk away with some if you put in the effort in career mode in this game.  I have a far better understanding of how something gets into orbit - and far more respect for the men and women who engineer those feats.  If you like educational games, this one is for you as well - it's not for all kids, but I could see a bright middle school or high school student picking this up quicker than most adults.  And adults could all learn a thing or two by playing this game - NASA engineers play this game in their free time.And most importantly, if you like to tinker AND play video games, this game was quite likely made for you.  The mod system is incredibly simple to work with - but if you know the right languages, you can make whole new features in the game!At any price, $10 or $60, this is a game worth every penny - and it's not even done yet!UPDATE for Beta 0.90: Since this review was written, Career mode has been added, the old Career mode renamed to ""Science"".  In addition, further features have been added - Contracts, better joints, new parts, way easier navigation and the career mode actually feels like you're helping the Kerbals march their way to the planets!  You have to balance science with your contracts (money!) and grow things carefully.It truly is educational in every sense - engaging, teaching and adjusting.  This game is whatever you want it to be - the mod ecosystem is growing and with CKAN, it's even easier to install and remove mods with a push of a button.  Check it out if you haven't yet!

												I dare say that no other game features such a high-quality blend of sandbox fun, rewarding challenge and educational value. Realistic but fun, awe-inspiring but cute, this game ticks many unique checkboxes and should have a place in the collection of every gamer or fan of simulation games.

												This game is awesome. Seriously, it's really, really awesome. And it teaches you physics. So you pass your exams. Win-win.I feel like listing the pros and cons. Because that's what everyone else does. And it gives you a better idea of the game.PROS:- Physics: Explosive stuff explodes, stuff that looks like a plane flies (mostly), spaceships fly like spaceships, stuff that looks like a rover WILL flip over.- Visuals: The graphics are not as good as some games, but they are definitely good enough. I particularly like all the small details, like the way the RAPIER engine puffs before going out, or the cockpit details, or the little ridges on the engines, or the way the landing gear closes up.- Career Mode: Feels like you're really running a space agency, and you really feel worried when you crash a rocket into a building and don't have enough money to rebuild it.- Sandbox Mode: It's also nice to be able to say, ""Stuff it, I can't afford this, nor can I wait long enough to invent really powerful rocket engines! Give me everything for free!""- The way spacecraft just feel like they 'work': The difference between the different engine sizes, the weight distribution problems, the new aerodynamics model, everything theoretically 'works'. My spaceships don't actually work. They explode.- The difficulty: This game is hard. Very hard. But only if you make it so. If you stick to low-altitude flights and don't try to go to Jool straight away, this game is very possible to play. And slowly, very slowly, you'll get better, and be able to get to Jool.- Small green beings: Kerbals themselves are very cute. I want one. Anyone know where to buy a Kerbal Plushy?- Mods: When 1.0 was released, I deleted all my mods and started afresh, so I don't know if they still work. But in Beta, I was greatly enhancing my experience with mods like BDArmoury, B9 Aerospace, KW Rocketry, Chatterer (A completely useless but nonetheless fantastic mod) and Infernal Robotics.-Performance: This game doesn't need a supercomputer to run. I can run it fine on a six-year-old MacBook Pro, no problems. I do have the occasional lagspike when a lot is happening at once, and the framerate tops out at around 35 FPS on a good day, but it certainly ain't unplayable.Cons:- Difficulty: Yeah. I know. That was a Pro as well. But as I said earlier, some things are very hard. Like getting to Jool.- Lack of an autopilot: The game could do with someone who could fly. Because for a long time, you won't be that someone.- The load times: This game has a lot to load in, and it takes a long time.- Lack of stuff: This game has a lot of stuff, but could do with more.- Problems with adding stuff to wings: Elevons, Landing Gear, and engines are really hard to fix on properly.- Lack of smaller pre-built wings.So in conclusion, this game awesome. Really, really awesome. Totally fantastic. I love it.Thanks for reading!EDIT: I need to update a review of a game I nominated for the Steam Awards to get the badge, so I will say this: I have nominated this game for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' Award.

												I've never written a review for a game on steam before, but I'm making an exception.Kerbal Space Program is a wonderful game, hands down, there have been problems underway.This game takes a lot of time to get good at, to understand how to do stuff. From getting above atmosphere or your first orbit, or landing on the Mün. Every one of those are achievements and something to be proud of. It is a game that is both challenging to get into and very satisfying when what you builds works as intended (Some explosions are okay).I'd recommend everyone who is looking for something new in their games to try this.

								Kerbal Space Program.All you have to do is belive. You put in the effort, you succeed. Have faith in your project, and you will emerge victorious.HAHA. Just kidding. Most of my ships blow up before I even activate the engines.But really... This game... is the ultiamate sandbox. Anything it can't do, mods will make it do. For example, here is a list of some achievments to acomplish:*Damage a ship without even taking off*Blow up a ship while taking off*Crash into another ship while taking off*Launch shrapnell into the Kerbal Space Center*Blow up the Kerbal Space Center*Blow up nearby rovers*Accidently launch your take-off rockets upwards like a missile*Shoot down a satellite with said missile*Have satellite debris crash into your refueling station*Have said refueling station and attached ships fall into Kerbin atmosphere*Have said station and ships burn up in atmosphere and/or impact a solid or liquid surface at over mach two...and...*Forget about your Mun lander as it crashes into the surfaceThat list can be acomplished in once launch.Now, explain to me why you aren't installing it already?

												What starts out as a simple, often hilarious; almost lego-like rocket/spaceplane builder has an astounding depth when you look into the possibilities. The game features a great incentive for advancing your ambitions, science. Science is spent on new technology and parts for bolder missions, and is earned by pushing your boundaries. First, you can explore around you. Take samples, and crew reports from your cute crew of little green simpletons, then maybe you take a simple rocket to outer atmosphere for the first time, take a crew report and get home alive with a nifty parachute.. and Bam! More science. A new part, and the plot thickens..KSP begins as a goofy tinkering tool with rockets and develops into a full-blown space exploration and research SIM.Getting a rock sample from the moon may be one of your hardest gaming achievements, as it was for me, but doing it brings reward like little else. The planning, the development and trial/error makes KSP a great learning tool. It's even NASA approved. It uses real world physics and simulated drag for winged aircraft. It uses realistic orbital-mechanics for planitary manuevers, and players use realistic many real-life elements mission planning. Buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself. They'll enjoy goofing and experimenting; they might even get serious about it. Same goes for you; you will enjoy at least a few experimental flights/missions. Especially if they end in a giant explosion, as many early flights will. After that you might have a success or two, maybe a simple contract or research mission turns out to be easy and you start learning. Soon you'll have dreams of the stars.*****			",59,4,0,1,3,0,10

The best simulation game ever!I played this game before it came on Steam, and I really love it!So I tought I should make a review because people need to know the hard truth about this game.First of all, let's take a look at the graphics..The game looks like some kind of a cartoon, which makes it really cool.I shouldn't have done it in any other way, it just made so unique.Than we got the possibilities.This game has an enormous amount of modifications you can add to your game, by easily dragging into a folder..With the mods your game get so much more intresting to play, with a million possibilities.Even without modifications the game is still amazing to play, with many things to discover.There is even a multiplayer modification which, of course, makes it posible to play together with friends, or just random people, and it's soo cool!The developers of the game are amazing too, they listen to their players and add suggestions to the game.Or sometimes add stuff to the game that has been inspired by amazing modifications.You can easily play this game the whole day without noticing the time flying, every time your ship crashes you are challenged to make a ship that actually can fly to the moon, and if it doesn't work you try again, and again and you guessed it AGAIN!Some people maybe think this is annoying but I think it's a good side of the game, instead of beating the game easily, you are challenged every time, in this way to get more into the game and learn more and more about real life space missions.You even got different things to do, you can do training missions or other kind of missions.You can start a carreer, play in sandbox-mode or even play in science mode, which makes it possible to both do research on planets for science points, and make ships using all the parts u want without unlocking them.You can go to soo many different planets, which are made so cool.They all got things like drag and stuff based on real planets, however some are changed a bit because it's still a game.For example, taking of at Kerbin - Earth requires you to have a ship with quite some power, while taking off at the Moon is much easier because of the gravity.There probably are some bad sides of the game, but I actually didn't discover those yet.However if you are using modifications they may sometimes don't work quite well together and sometimes make your game suddenly crash. - But this isn't the fault of the developers so don't blame them.If you want to see someone else's perspective of the game you should check out some other reviews, but my advice is to really buy this game if you like the things you see.I would also recommend to watch some gameplays on YouTube, and maybe if you want you should search the internet for Kerbal Space Program Mods to see what kind of modifications you could add to your game when you bought it.I will definitly keep playing this game for a long time and if I needed to give this game a mark, it would absolutly get a 10/10!

												So there I was, sitting in the metal death machine engineering came up with. My heart racing as control are counting down from 10 (not always in the correct order). It was my first flight, I didnt know any of these guys, and just right before I stared to cry the lead pilot Jeb told me, ""I've done this thousands of times over, you'll be fine."" There I was, sitting in this rocket, then just as control reached zero, the whole machine started to vibrate violently and we accelerated into the blue sky. I thought: ""Wow! This is amazing, I'm going to Duna!"". Then right when the ledgendary Jebadiah Kerman hit the big red staging button to go to stage 8, things took a turn for the worst. All of the sudden a huge bang shook the craft, fire everywhere, I saw my fell astronaut brethren fly through the sky from the exploded rover 2. Then a few seconds after the first explosion, another happend, and a stray booster scraped alongside the hull only to destroy the parachute. So there I was, freefalling in a metal can, I look over to Jeb and what I see is a smiling maniac with nothing but fire and evil in his dead eyes. Seconds before impact with the harsh unforgiving ground, I suddenly appear back at the launch pad.10/10 Would revert back to launch pad again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an engineer who was quite into astronomy as a kid, I LOVE this game, and it probably couldn't have been any other way. I mean : it is about ACTUAL space travel, how awesome is that?I'll recommend it, but there is one thing I can not stress enough : IT IS NOT FOR EVERYBODY.There are basically two ways to play that game : either you build crazy rockets in sandbox mode and you see if your random construction somehow achieves orbit OR you actually try to become a good (in-game) rocket scientist and launch a planned payload to a specific destination in the solar system.And to become such a rocket scientist  you will either need :College level math and physics, as well as a huge excel spreadsheetTo read and follow tutorials, and have a huge patience with trial and errorAnd... that's not exactly the conception of ""fun"" or a ""game"" to many people.Just to give an idea of why you need the ""school stuff"" : this game expects you to know what newtons are. (And no, those are not clones of a guy who took an apple on the head XD) It expects you to count speeds in m/s rather than km/h (just as a scientist does). You must also understand the concept of relative vector speed in a 3D environment... and many other things.The game features tutorials fortunately, but they only give the basics and you'll still have to learn most of the game by yourself.And even though the game simplifies a few aspects from reality (like for instance oxygen and astronaut's mental state management), on what it actually simulates it is ruthless : no fuel left after a 3 hour mission (for you, in the game, years have passed)? You miss your entry into the gravity field of a planet? You didn't launch your interplanetary mission on a correct date? Well, enjoy your newborn space debris! No way out of that except loading a past save. And this feature is not available on the hardest difficulty by the way.You might say : if you run out of fuel, it's because you messed up and you're bad, so it's normal to be punished. True.But this is why you pretty much need the math and the scientific expertise : to actually calculate if you have enough fuel BEFORE the mission, while taking into account a margin of error as well (because your manual-piloting manoeuvers will never be perfect).If you're fine with it, following a tutorial will allow you to build the spaceship suited to your mission and not worry about that. But I also believe it is kinda missing the point of the game.However, this scientific grounding and this high difficulty also come with a good side. Which is : when your plan unfolds as planned and you actually succeed, my God is it satisfying.I usually don't take screenshots of my games, but here when I actually managed my first moon landing, I just took so many. Because for once a game had made me feel proud. Yes, PROUD. And I have to say, it's the first time it has happened (at least to such a degree).The Kerbal Space Programl WIKI is very well made can help a lot by providing you with already-simplified mathematic formulas, preventing you from having to demonstrate those yourself. It could help people less familiar with math and physics to achieve more with the game and actually feel proud as well. The game also features lots of mods, and some are actually all about helping you to do all this calculus. It can replace the custom spreadsheet for those who do not wish to make one.If you don't look at any wiki and don't use any mods, then the challenge is phenomenal, even for an actual scientist, as the game throws you out there with minimal data.You might actually like a science and math challenge. If you think you do then buy this game. you won't regret it.If science, math, and ruthless difficulty are not truly your thing, there is the option of playing this game as a ""lego"" game where you build crazy stuff and see if they work. You could actually learn a lot about science and astronomy while you do that, so it might be worth it. I know I wouldn't enjoy playing ""randomly"" like that and I can't recommend it. But who knows, maybe you don't mind.Just be aware of one thing : unless you do some science and math (or have it done for you, but is that the point?), you'll never land that miniature base on the distant moon of the planet Jool... But hey, maybe you are actually totally fine with that.			",66,5,4,3,3,0,5

												I bought this game a long time ago. I still beleive it was well worth the money. I have yet to explore the whole solar system yet alone the galaxy. (VERY good mod support via CKAN) Oh, and it is also one of the most educational games ive ever played. taught me more about physics than my entire highschool physics class =) The only negative I can think of, is the insane learning curve. Many people need to spend hours just figuring out how to get into their first orbit. But that is just one of the things that you must be willing to do in KSP.  Aside from that, very highly recommended.			",43,9,2,5,13,1,26

												After playing for 72 hours...The funnest part of this game, is building the rockets of any design I can think of, testing them. (Go to launch... topple over and go boom... darn it, try again...)The graphics are pretty good. Some reason the crew is hard on my system when building the crafts, had to turn them off.One thing I do not understand is why your craft is desroyed even when hitting water at 5m/s via parachute, only thing to survive is the cockpits. (not a game breaker, just know the water is off limites in the game)... Patience is required while playing ...It takes a long time to get across the oceans to land your craft at desired locations. You have to be careful when using the speed up if flying a plane. It can cause you to loose/gain altitude without touching the controls.The arodynamics of the game are increadable. Durring one of my missions, altidude required for testing an item had put me in space, I managed to test it, but was out of fuel, and still orbiting, I almost restarted but chose to see if the close path was close enough to barely skim the atmosphere, and sure enough, angled the heat sheild to push the module deeper into the atmosphere, reducing orbit considerably, the next pass was slow enough to actually stay in the atmosphere, again, angled it to push it in deeper. The angle was so good, I was able to open the chutes at about 1900m and land on top of a mountain.Neucances of the game, the physics engine does something strange, causing the ship to stop flowing with the rest of the system, the ship dangles there, it's orbit doesn't move, but the planet does, if left alone long enough, the orbit no longer orbits the planet, but the ship still hangs there. Other times the ship suddenly disintigrates right after a ""warp time"" menuver. More than one occation on a load, the vessel is well belloe the 0m mark, on water it breaks the ship into pieces, and only specific pieces float to the surface. On land, only the pieces that register as above 0.000m is not instantly destroyed. These sorts of things make it difficult to play career mode. Occational crash to desktop, without known reasons, sometimes it says it has crashed, and to tell them about it, yet doesn't say what to do with a folder. I got the game through steam, will be nice when they have an update to fix known bugs. (Even so, I still recomend the game.).... Bottom Line ... I am enjoying the game. Devs keep up the great work.After 2 years, and still playing the game from time to time, I am wondreing if there will ever be an Android Tablet version for this game...			",19,3,0,7,3,0,0

An army of kerbalnauts, workers, and e̶s̶c̶a̶p̶e̶d̶ ̶w̶a̶r̶ ̶c̶r̶i̶m̶i̶n̶a̶l̶s̶   rocket scientists are at your disposal. Send them to a golden age or to their deaths by designing and piloting any craft you can imagine.It has three game modes:∆	Sandbox- players have access to all parts and unlimited funds, no objectives - do what you want!∆   Science- players have no budgetary restrictions, all facilities are fully operational(its not a trap) but must research and unlock parts by taking observations during missions, conducting experiments with scientific equipment, and recovering craft and crew after missions. (NASA’s wet dream)∆	Career- budgetary restrictions apply, must research parts, must upgrade facilities to unlock functions, can accept contracts for pay and other bonuses. (Most immersive experience)The game also features tutorial missions, scenario missions/challenges, and a wide range of difficulty options and settings.Controls are easy to understand, yet fairly difficult to master. Some players might wish to use an auto pilot mod such as MechJeb, but I would recommend getting a basic grasp of controls and basic maneuvers before using MJ. The basics :∆	Mash space when things go wrong∆	F5 to nvr 4get∆	F9 to I’m comin’ back MurphI highly recommend watching Scott Manley’s tutorial videos on YouTube (he is Montgomery “Scotty” Scott’s great great great grandfather) I recommend this game if:∆	Space exploration fascinates you∆	Engineering fascinates you∆	Science fascinates you∆	You cried during Interstellar∆	You cried during Contact∆	You cried during 2001: A Space Odyssey∆	You cried while reading 2001: A Space Odyssey∆	You cried while watching both versions of Cosmos∆	You hate the Star Wars prequels∆	You want to fight moon Nazis∆	You are a moon Nazi∆	You believe man went to the moon∆	You think Kubrick helped fake the moon landings ∆	You like Michael Bay moviesI do not recommend if:∆	You have no patience at all∆	You are dead∆	The Star Wars prequels are your favorites∆      You cry during Michael Bay movies (except The Rock)10/10 - would slip the surly bonds of earth again			",171,8,1,16,23,1,31

								One of, if not THE best early access games on the market.The updates are fairly frequent and always add something new and exciting.The devs are always willing to listen to the community to and will often hire popular modders to work on the game officialy, incorporating the mod into the game itself (with some changes for uniformity and game balance).The game itself is excellent, and although it can be challenging to beginners, that's mstly due to the accuracy that space is portrayed in this game. It almos perfectly emulates zero-G environments and orbital mechanics. Despite this , once you understand the basics, the game is simple enough to reward experimentation, yet challenging enough to require it.I cannot recommend this game highly enough.At time of writing, verion 0.9.0 has just dropped, oficially bringing the game into beta.

												Orbital mechanics for fun and profit. It is the best game. If you need a hand getting started look up Scott Manley on Youtube, he has an excellent series of tutorials and miscellany on KSP. Alternatively just play in Sandbox until you make things which don't explode immediately (or things which do ...for science). Note: You may actually end up learning science so you can get better at this game.			",25,3,2,10,6,0,7

Early Access Review
A bit about the game and developers.Kerbal Space Program is a space travel simulation game developed and published by Squad. Kerbal Space Program is their only game for now, and even that one isn't out yet. All of the review and game footage that you will see in this review is from ALPHA! Things could change when ever Squad feels they want something new.About Gameplay.As I said earlier, Kerbal Space Program is a simulation game. In it your objective is to build up a space craft and fly it into the space. You have a lot of different parts to chose from, with which you can create your space craft very unique! And It's very simple as well. All you need to do is Drag and Drop the part where you want it to be, and woala, you've got yourself a small aircraft. Of course, you do need to think about the laws of physics, and It will take you a couple of tries to even manage and get into the space! You need to think about how many engines should you take, how much fuel, how big should your ship be... And if it's too big, you should put it into couple of smaller pieces and just launch them into the space one by one.That sounds very simple, doesn't it? Well I'm sorry to brake this down for you.. This game is insanely hard! Just imagine, you need to set up the space craft just perfectly! Then you need to set up the valid commands (what engines start first, then which ones fall to the ground while the new ones start, and so on and on), then you need to think about the gravity. You need to make your space craft go straight forward into the air until it reaches about 10 000 km. After that you should turn around 45 Degrees. By that time, you're almost out of the gravity's reach. But that is not all of it! Once you get your space craft out into the orbit, you will probably lose all of your fuel. So then you need to launch more fuel from the ground. Simple, right? Nope! By the time you get into the orbit, your other part of the space craft is already orbiting around the ""Earth"" (i forgot the name of the in game planet, I'm sorry!) so you either have to catch up with it, or make your fuel fly the other way around. Very hard, but fun!Once you have finally put your ship fully together, you can travel to the Moon, Mars, or where ever you want! As long as you know what you're doing, and as long as you've got enough fuel left. Don't forget that you'd like to get your crew back, right? We need them to be heroes after all! And I think that the game wouldn't be so hard if it had a better tutorial. Tutorial teaches you how to fly a ship, and how to assemble it on the ground, but it doesn't teach you how to assemble it in space, it doesn't teach you how to land on the moon, nor anything else. That's the main reason why this game is hard. And I think that once the developers finish the tutorial properly, the game will be much more loved in the public! I, sadly, never managed to get out of the ""Earth's"" orbit and go to the moon. I managed to get half way there once, but that's it, hehe. It's just hard.Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking, the game looks great. This game is made by the Unity software, and it's amazing what Squad made this game look like. It has a lot of nice details, the land looks pretty decent, and the space looks amazing. Water, though, looks pretty bad. But once again, this game is just in alpha! The songs are pretty good too, but after too many hours, they get a bit annoying. Not so big problem though!Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Very fun building game.- Ability to make your ship look different from all the other ones.- Ability to travel around the space, and go on any planet in our solar system.Cons:- Lack of tutorial.Overall grade: 8/10.To explain my grade - It would be 9 if the game had better tutorial system. This game is extremely fun, but very hard to learn, so better tutorial would be very welcome. It would also be 10 if they put the Kerbal customization into the game, and if they added multiplayer into it! It could be very hard to do, but I'm sure it'd be awesome, hehe.Extra info:  I really loved Kerbal Space Program, and I will keep on watching the game progress. I will review it once again once it comes fully out, because I'm sure that this game will still have a lot to offer! I support Kerbal Space Program!Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] ",388,79,23,71,45,5,77

Early Access Review
""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind""Neil Armstrong (1969)... 3-2-1-0 ignition and liftoff! Kerbal Space Program is a space-simulator which is able to inspire, because the possibilities are so endless like the universe. There are two modes (state in the alpha), the career-mode where you have to complete some goals, research for better rocket parts and so on and you have the sandbox-mode where you have  all parts from the beginning and where you can set your own goals. An orbit around ""Kerbin"" (corresponds earth)? Fly to the ""mun"" (corresponds moon) or one of the other planets? Build a Lander and land somewhere? Or build a rover and make a trip on the ""mun""? It lies by you! A successful launch is even an special goal for the first time. It's harder as it sounds. While playing, your physics-knowledge will increase, you will see what i mean. You can explore many planets, moons, comets and asteroids which each have their own challenges.Mods:You will find lots of mods which make the game unbelievable. More parts for rockets or space-stations, better atmospheres for your planets and moons and more. As well as other games, the mods aren't free of risk but for me there were only a few game-crashes after hours of playing (>100h).Early Access Status:It's nearly perfect, so you have the feeling to get an full game. Some Special-features like an multiplayer will follow. So don't be disappointed if updates are slow in coming.To bring it to the point: Absolutely stunning game! 10/10In summary:  Pro Contra   + funny Kerbals - not suitable for low-performance pcs   + lots of Mods   + unbelievable and unique atmosphere   + a huge sun-system to explore   + lots of possibilities to build stations, vehicles and more PS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point. I hope it will help you in your decision. ",373,155,8,48,39,5,63

												Well. It was about time I got to writing a review about this game. I think I can accurately say the positives and negatives about the game.  with my 600 plus hours into it. And heres what I think. First review as well, for my first game I ever bought on steam: seems fitting. [h1[Pro's[/h1]Very realistic, for the most part. You have to know what you are doing, and learn how basic orbits work and what not to really learn how to play the game.Funny. This is that other part. The game isnt perfect, and you can mess around all you want with it, and do some silly things, like launch kerbals from the moon: not land and then take off, and not in a ship, but literally launch the kerbal from the moon. It was fun.Satisfying. Once you set foot on the mun (moon equivalent), then a nice lil bit of joy and happiness rushes over you. You feel this giant accomplishment. And this does dwindle after every other landing, even on other bodies, but it is still there. And once you actually land back on Kerbin, thats almost as sweet.Customization: Build rockets and stuff however you want: just need to make sure they work, engineer.ConsThere isnt much inherently bad with the game. The only problem with it is this: personal drive. You have to want to go to the mun, Duna, or other bodies, or create that perfect plane that can take off from kerbin and go somewhere in space without a hitch. If you dont have that large drive, then the game is boring; No sense of direction, nothing to do really, things of that nature. So if youre gonna get the game, make sure to ask yourself: Can I set my own goals, and actually achieve them/want too?EDIT: I did forget to mention the new career missions that you can do in career mode, thanks to one person who saw my review. Those can definitely extend the life of the game; I personally did not find them too much fun, but they are indeed there, and are fun for many others as well. :)My personal opinionI have not actively played Kerbal Space program in just under 2 years or so. One of the updates wiped my save, unfortunately, which made younger me mad and not want to play it anymore. Now, I just dont care anymore to really play it on my own. I did what I personally wanted to do, which was to land on every planet, and a few moons, and make a space station. I did that, and I feel like I beat the game. Now every time I go back, its all just ""Ya! I remember doing that"", but then I just go play something else. I tell people that I love this game, and I truly do. Its just I already beat it for me. But I will still gladly play it to show friends the ropes, and just to make sure I still know how to do it. Should you buy it? Yes, if you like sandbox space games. This is probably one of the finer ones out there. But make sure you have the drive to do it, otherwise you will stop playing it before you achieve anything. All the people that love this game have that drive, and are the ones that still playing it, that reach higher hours than I have. And I commend them for it. They have that drive that I have lost, for now. Buy the game though: Its fun to watch things explode :D			",106,19,1,6,13,0,2

												Great game. Gives you an opportunity to feel like a true astronaut/cosmonaut and of course Engineer! Learning curve is steep, but worth it.I remember doing small/starting achievements in career mode and had a blast.I didn't even get to any big planets. Explored only small moons.Still so much to do in this game. Especially if you're creative person.Below you can see my biggest creation of all times -- ""Babylon 5"".

												So let me say right off the bat, this game will not be for everyone, But you more than likely know before you read this review if the game is even close to up your alley.  In career mode, It takes a patience, common sense. There is alot of trial and error. I had seen alot of the reviews and decided that I was going to not visit any guides or wikis, Which made the game much more gratifying knowing I figured it out on my own.  After nearly 100 hours into the game, im getting ready to restart career and impose a hardcore mode on myself.  As stated on the main page of the game, this is early access, therefore still alot missing from the game, you almost have to make your own fun out of it ATM. But even with features still missing, the game is alot of fun, I always consider a game worth the money if I get a dollar a hour out of it, this game far surpasses that, even off sale.  The physics of the game are very solid and very unforgiving, just like it should be. The amount of stuff  you can do is only limited by your imagination.  From orbiting a planet, to a complete Space Station around the games version of Mars.I must say too that I am a bit worried that the updates have been so slow to come out, I got the game a few days before the asteroid missions and the sale (doh).  Come to find out that was the first update in something like 3 months.  That being said, I have also seen in rviews that the modding community is awesome, so that may make up for the lack of updates in a small way.  Becuase of my self imposed blackout on anything that could be a spoiler, i have not looked into the mods myself.  But after I get tired of my hardcore mode, thats my next stop.  Any questions, feel free to ask in the comments section.Edit: I finally had to look up how to transfer fuel.  Spent 3 hours clicking on a docked craft trying to figure it out. :/""THIS GAME IS:10% LUCK20% SKILL15% CONCENTRATED POWER OF WILL5% PLEASURE50% PAINAND 100% REASON TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME!""I saw this on another review of another game, and it was so true, i had to steal it. =P			",251,41,7,64,63,2,53

												As a 30-something year old person with little education but a love for science, space, and engineering, this game caught my attention while in alpha a few years ago. At that time, I knew 'of' the equations and methods used to get things into space, albeit not grasping the details to any extent. They were not familiar, but also not foreign. I opened KSP, and joyfully set to building what I thought would be a simple, but effective rocket. Ecstatic when completed, I excitedly smashed the button to launch. The view of my creation on the launchpad gave me chills. With shaking hands, heart racing, I gently pushed the space bar. The rocket ignites with a powerful firestorm. For a fleeting moment, my eyes found Jeb in the bottom corner of the screen. He was terrified. Panicing, I center my eyes on the screen, fingers ready to steer my way to space and victory. Six seconds into flight, the rockets begins to rip apart, parachute deployed and pulled taught from force of the rocket's climb. Rocket parts scatter in the aftermath of an explosion. I look to Jeb, preparing myself to see his corpse, mutilated and burned. On inspection, I see he survived. The look of panic on his face has become horror. The rocket's capsule is tumbling end over end, climbing in altitude. Muscles in my arms spasm as my person slips into shock, my mind reaching for help, begging for training and emergency reaction to kick in. Floundering, tears in my eyes, I desperately begin to smash buttons on the keyboard. My head is locked on the screen, eyes vigorously searching for a button to fix everything, to save Jeb from his certain doom. My heart sinks as seconds pass and nothing seems help, all of my fingers are finding buttons and pressing. The capsule apexed and started its decent, tethered to Kerbin by gravity's unrelenting pull. I lock up, panting short breaths, staring at the screen. I cannot blink. I cannot look away. The capsule strikes the ground. A dialog appears on the screen, confirming Jebidiah's death. I have since killed many more kerbals, slowly learning the ropes. I understand more about rocket science than I ever expected. I have had successful missions to the Mun, Minmus, Duna, and Jool. If you are brand new to this game, the best advice I have is to NOT turn the 'snap-to' feature on when building things in the VAB, and start killing kerbals. You will be amazed at what you learn.

Early Access Review
								It's a fun game. Yes, the learning curve is pretty steep, but new versions of the game have made the learning curve more forgiving. It's an extremely fun and rewarding game to play. This is not an easy game, however, and if you don't feel like thinking and/or planning ahead then this probably isn't the game for you.			",79,3,1,8,3,0,1

												Best game ever. Just look at my hours. Planning, building, and flying an awesome ship, like a space shuttle replica or a fully reusable space splane gives you the biggest sense of accomplishment when you burn through the atmosphere and touch down at the runway. Or rescueing a kerbal mark whatney from Mars (Duna) or doing a flyby of pluto (Eeloo). Or building a replica of the international space station one shuttle launch at a time. Or catching an asteroid, bringing it into low orbit than using it as a refueling base. My personal biggest achievement was doing a full recreation of the movie The Martian. Be warned. VERY steep learning curve. This is quite literally rocket science after all. Career mode is very hard for new players. You will hit a science brick wall if you cant do moon flybys without manourvre nodes. But theres some cool scenarios and theres always sandbox mode. Mods! Theres lots of mods and they almost always play well together these days. When I first started there was a max memory limit which is now thankfully gone thanks to 64 bit.Essential mods: Mechjeb, Kerbal Engineer, KIS, KAS, Trajectories, Interstellar fuel switch, Tweakscale, Editor Extensions Redux, Kerbal Alarm ClockGraphical mods: Stock visual enhancements, Scatterer, PLanetshine, DistantobjectPart mods: OPT, KASA, MRS, Kerbal Reusability Expansion Cool mods: Rasterprop monitor, Vessel viewer, Docking alignment IndicatorFailing, blowing up in the atmosphere, and forgetting to add parachutes is just part of the fun. Ive only been playing  since 1.0 and the updates just keep making this game better and better. 99% of bugs ( we call them krakens) have been squashed. The only thing which needs to be improved is the part physics. Dont get me wrong, its gotten so much better since 1.1 and 1.2 but it could be better. Currently if you have more than about 250+ parts being rendered, the game slows down to about 15 fps on my GTX 980. Very large ships take a while to launch and docking a large shuttle with an even larger space station requires patience and precision. Just be careful to build ships without too many unnecessary parts and you will be fine. ",93,2,1,6,7,1,10

												I have much more hours in this game, I bought it before it was even on Steam. Kerbal Space Program is a space-agency simulator where you control the agency itself and the actual Kerbonauts (astronauts). There are three gamemodes, career (you manage the actual agency with funds, popularity/approva, and research tech), science (same as before but just research) and sandbox with no limitations but there's almost no agency mechanics. Although because of that sandbox may sound like a lesser mode, the agency mechanics are really secondary.The main gameplay is being the actual Kerbonauts and performing the mission, which you yourself can determine or you can take a contract. However building the rocket (or spaceplane) is just as important as actually flying it. There's a whole solar-system for you to explore, complete with asteroids and moons for some of the planets. Some of the planets even have irrational orbits, and some of those have moons with an irrational orbit to the planet. The game is realistic enough to be somewhat educational but loose enough to be a very fun game. The game is somewhat difficult due to the loose-realism, but that is a good thing for myself. I'd rather a game be too hard (this game definitely isn't) than be too easy. Everytime I start a new save, I learn something new along the way everytime. Whether it's a more efficient way to get into orbit, faster way to dock, or even a way to use less parts for a rocket. I always learn something new, and I love that. Also, KSP is one of the few games ever to exit early-access and actually be complete with no major bugs. That's dedication.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								What a truely amazing game!I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in space like gaming.The core game is really great - but the modding community, and available mods for this game, adds value to this game unlike anything I've ever exerienced.This game has 3 modes (sandbox, science, and career), each having it's own unique experience. After spending a little bit watching some of Scott Manley's videos on youtube, you'll be well on your way to creating your very own space program. You can literally design every detailed aspect of your spacecraft, accomplish things in space, and have endless hours of fun. Iliterally can't stop playing this game...seriously! If you're wondering whether or not this is for you, go check out Scott Manley's videos on youtube, and get a taste of this masterpiece that is KSP.It's not rocket science...well okay, actually it is. But after spending a little time on those vids, you'll be well on your way.			",137,43,5,8,49,0,11

								Kerbal Space Program not only slices and dices, but it shakes the conventions of gaming up with this glorious take on running your own space program. Houston, we don't have any problems here because with Kerbal Space Program the imagination runs wild like Hulk Hogan in 1991. Make no mistake that if you do purchase this game you may have life changing experiences that include, but are not limited to: creativity, frequent trips to imagination land, and thoughts of becoming an astronaut yourself. If these conditions last for more than 4 hours please consult Kerbal Space Program.**This game should be supported by people who enjoy space, sandboxes, and early access games that are actually pretty well done in their current state.

												While writing this I have almost reached my 700th hour and that does not even include the ones I played offline, so I'm probably more near the 800th hour. Nevertheless, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. It's difficult, yes. But not as difficult as it sounds or appears first. Watch Scott Manley's tutorials on youtube and with a little practice and patience you will be able to do all the cool stuff you can imagine. I don't want to misslead you, it can be a rly hard and even a little frustrating during the first couple of hours, but it's also so damn rewarding once you got past that initial learning courve.So what does this game offer? A huge sandbox experience with lots and lots of content that has been build up and polished for about 4 years! You want to build a rocket? a (space)plane? a shuttle? a station? a moon (mun) lander? or a probe that travels across the whole system to reach the gas giant far out? Than do that! No one is stopping you! Your imagination is the limit, as much of a cliche that might sound like. But it's true and if you don't believe me, watch showcases of people on youtube. There is everything from Star War's podracers to real life replica missions. And if you fail a couple of times, there is nothing bad about it. The game manages to make failures fun. How? Cause you see stuff spinning, crashing and exploding in ways you couldn't even imagine. This is the unique experience of KSP that I've been enjoying with the greatest community I've ever seen. If you have a question, than simply post it on the forum. There are so many experienced vets out there that help each other and especially the new people with theire knowledge and skill. It's a rly unique group of people that has kept the forum alive ever since the buggy first steps.You might ask yourself where the hell you might take the inspiration from to build new stuff after 100th of hours. The answer is simple. KSP is easy enough to be fun once you get used to the basics, while still being acurate enough to build real life replicas from the Apollo and Space Shuttle Aeras to modern missions and designs like SpaceX's reusable boosters or Virgin Galactic's space ship one. It's all within the possibilities of this sandbox. And if you want something more SciFi orientated? Then get a mod like interstellar or near future and you will get everything and more right at hand. Even for the type of player that enjoys a harder and more realistic simulation type of game there are easy ways to adapt the game to be just that. The moding community of this game is just huge. There is everything from physics driven algorithms that simulate hypersonic reentrie effects to adding whole new planets and solar systems. There is just so much content out there that you will literally never be able to see or play it all.Long story short, after playing this game for years I sudenly felt a need, driven by nostalgia, to write this down and promote the best investment I ever did when it comes to a game. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did and still do! Cheers			",65,11,0,5,9,0,18

								Am now qualified to join NASA.Honestly though, this game is amazing! You learn so much about how space travel is done in the real world. This game has already taken so most of my playtime ever since I got it, and no doubt it'll continue to do so for a long long time. It's so fun to build your own aircraft, rocket, space station, rover, etc and make them work.And when you ever get bored(which is not possible, but on the vigintillionth chance you do), you can look for mods that add parts or gameplay elements, having great modding support and an awesome community.And this is still in beta, and looking at the developers, it can only get better.If you ever get stuck from the steep learning curve, you can watch some tutorials done by Scott Manley.Why are you still reading this?

												I started playing this game during the Beta and it quickly became the greatest game I've ever played and still is. I've played 600+ hours and I've hardly scratched everything you can do in this game. I can easily say, without exaggeration,  I'll be putting another 1000 hours if not more into this game. Games these days seem to go onto the market at 60$-120$, if you include all the DLC or pre-release shannanigans, for about 4-5 hours of enjoyable gameplay, 20 hours if your lucky. With Kerbal Space Program they're not even charging 50$ with a guarantee of continued FREE updates. I can not express enough the level of enjoyment anyone with any amount of interest in space exploration will get from this game. If your like me you'll get hooked on this game and before you realize it you'll have put in 100 hours of gameplay and be working towards setting up mining operations on any number of distant worlds, complete with orbiting space stations and/or colonies. Did I mention you can capture and/redirect asteroids then do whatever you want with them? Yes, that does include mining and/or building bases on them. What you do in this game is only limited to what you can imagine and build to get the job done...... unless you run your agency into the ground first of course. BEWARE THE KRAKEN!!			",9,3,0,0,2,0,3

Elon Musk SimulatorThis is an example of Early Access done correctly and with the last patch (1.1.2) KSP finally matured in a must have for space lovers.This is a complex and deep game and by no means easy while at the same time it's super fun and doesn't feel like a chore to play even if you fail, and you will fail A LOT:your rockets will explode and your Kerbals will be slaughtered in the crudest ways while you will be laughing like a maniac at your screen.A little note of caution:DON'T BE AFRAID TO MOD THE GAME!Everything the game lacks (tools, parts, mechanics) can be easily added trough mods and they will make your life easier in certain areas while making it absolutely nightmarish on other aspects due to the increased realism.And trust me when I say that the Sky IS NOT the limit.

Early Access Review
								OMG this game is a masterpiece although its not finished yet. I have this game since the early access alpha and with every update you can see that the devs know what they are doing. You will fall in love with the Kerbals as soon as you set one of em up into your uniguely build Spacecrafts and fire it to the next planet. It is sooooooo much fun to see if your construction works out.""The way is the goal"" This game will give you great satisfaction if you like seeing how your plans unfold.Also the game knows how to raise the difficulty bar 1 by 1. Beginners get a great introduction for a sandbox game and once your more of an expert and try out the♥♥♥♥♥♥load!!!! of great mods for it you will also be challenged by wanting more into Orbit (ISS setup, Docking ports, refueling stations, Lander-systems with rovers, satellites......you name it)No♥♥♥♥♥♥ if i were to choose my top 5 games of over 700 atm  i would pick this one for sure =DTHANK YOU SQUAD, keep it up			",378,119,14,51,40,3,64

Early Access Review
								Release Update: still great!everything i said during early access still applies, and this game is definitely still worth getting.Highly Recommended! also if you played during early access its worth checking out again. lots of new features, including completely revamped aerodynamics and heating physics made me start over again from scratch, and im loving every minute of it. blown up quite a few rockets learning the improved physics, and poor jebediah burned up in re-entry after losing control and facing the heat sheild the wrong way :'( , but ive learned a thing or 2 along the way and recently got my first ship into stable orbit and back safely. its also worth mentioning that the new aerodynamics physics allows for vastly improved space plane gameplay. i actually built, flew, and safely landed my first plane before getting my first rocket into stable orbit, and with way fewer attempts; something i struggled with, even in sandbox mode with everything unlocked, during the beta.also the con i mentioned in beta is still there but is easily fixable with mods :)Early Access Review:ive had some bad experiences with early access games and told myself never again. my freinds however convinced me otherwise and im glad they did. this game is just about to enter beta, but it feels like a pretty solid game already. the gamemodes feel complete and the engine feels solid. ive had a tremendous amount of fun and have yet to explore all it has to offer.  im currently in the process of trying to build a space station for refueling so my ships dont have to carry all the fuel for their entire mission from launch. im also trying to get my team thats on the ""mun"" home with all their science data intact (my design didnt include enough fuel to get them all the way back from the mun), so now im setting up a retreival mission. the game is merciless, but its realistically so, and i actually consider this one of its strengths. you learn something with every attempted mission. also, while the learning curve is steep, there are also tutorial missions that are actually very helpful. you can check them out right off the bat, or you can do like i did and blow up a few rockets first, but they are actually very helpful tutorials.as good as it is its still an early access game and as such you can expect to encounter a few bugs and glitchs. the only bothersome one for me at the moment is that stage rockets that you release during launch disapear after a certain distance so you cant recover them for recycling. that said kerbal is one of the few games thats doing early access right. updates are fairly frequent and the developers pay attention to the communities comments and complaints. when an update causes an obvious annoyance thats easily fixable, theyll follow up shortly with a hotfix patch. I feel confident, based on the developers track record thus far, that during beta any issues that remain will be resolved and the game will receive the polish it deserves. its also worth mentioning that theres already a thriving modding comunity for this game that adds additional features.

												Kerbal Space Program is truly something unique.How do you market a game about rocket science -- the default analogy for ""something extremely complicated"" -- to an audience big enough to justify your budget? Well...there's a lot of little things that make it playable to many people.First of all, it's a make-your-own-experience sandbox. Just like Minecraft (before there was an End), there's no final goal, no objective arrow. It's just you, an bunch of spaceship parts, a few kerbals, a custom solar system, the infinite expanse of space, and explosions. Lots and lots of explosions.Second of all, this game about rocket science isn't about ALL of rocket science. There's quite a lot of liberty taken with the laws of physics, all in the name of simplicity. You don't have to worry about fuel flow, or life support, or the speed-of-light delay. All of that is benched in favor of less subtle things, like orbital mechanics, atmospheric shock-heating, and (look this up; it's practically KSP 101) delta-V and Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.But here's the best part; all of these ignored facets of space travel can be added into the game. KSP has a very robust and active modding community, and I'm sure enough mods exist to make the game as realistic as you could possibly demand. Life support? There's a mod for that. Several, actually, in varying degrees of difficulty. Fuel flow? Part of Realism Overhaul. Speed-of-light delay? Check out RemoteTech. There are even mods that replace the stock solar system with our very own, real system, and even mods that add entirely new, dreamed-up systems. (I highly recommend starting out with no mods, then adding them as you become comfortable with what you already have.)Really, Kerbal Space Program is great for the same reason Minecraft is great. It expects nothing in particular of you, it just wants you to do whatever comes to mind. If that means strapping a hundred boosters together as randomly as possible and watching the fireworks, that's fine. If that means methodically landing on every planet and moon one-by-one, that's fine. If that means brutally murdering your kerbals, well, heck, they're just as surprised to be alive as you are, so go for it.			",99,23,0,61,14,2,31

												Imagine you are the head of NASA and everybody that works for you willingly steps into whatever ludicrous idea you can come up with. Will you send them off to the heavens to explore the far reaches of the solar system or lead them to their demise in a fiery explosion on the launchpad? The choice is yours...This game deceptively teaches you rocket science, orbital mechancis and physics amongst all the wonderful explosions and stunning destinations.The Trial and Error makes learning the game entertaining and fun! (Lots of explosions and lost Kerbals to be had).For the first several days of playing, I had an ICBM Factory as opposed to a Space Program. Many Kerbals died. A few Youtube videos later (Thanks Scott Manley!) less Kerbals died and with a grasp on how things worked, they began to prosper.The reward and feeling of accomplishment you get from this game is unlike any other I have ever got from a game. The community for this game is enormous, friendly and constantly active, Youtubers churning out their own stories, tutorials, successes and failures. Developers creating thousands of mods, Forum users pushing the boundaries with weekly challenges, and more.In regards to mods; you can add things like:-New Planets/Moons-Life Support/Cryogenics-More parts, more parts, more parts ....oh yes, lots and lots of parts-Colonization/Habitats/Bases/Space Stations-Boats/Submarines/Planes/Vehicles and everything inbetween (Even more parts!)-In game tools to give you all the information you would ever need-New and Historic Missions/Contracts-Combat/Weapons-Visual beautifications/eye candy/textures-Malfunctions/In flight repair and damage control/Emergency Escapes-Complete realism overhaul...and many more.You can play this game any way you dream.Absolutely Stunning Game 10/10.

												I have spent so much time on Kerbal Space Program.  This is one game I keep coming back to after years of play.  The sandbox nature of the game combined with the numerous parts available leads to endless possibilities for Rockets, Planes, Space Probes, Boats, Trucks, Cars, and really anything you can think of.  Take the base game and add mods like Infernal Robotics and Tweakscale and you have so much more to do.  Then add an additional 150 mods from CKAN and there is literally no end to what can be accomplished.  10/10			",65,32,4,19,12,0,8

												Kerbal Space Program was the first Early Access game I ever bothered to try and it turned out to have been a great decision; KSP has evovled into a stunningly fun and creative game that packs not only surprisingly well-done physics together and perfectly decent graphics with infinite replayability and different game modes but also a small dose of witty comedy.I think an important thing to realize with KSP is that, yes, Kerbals that live on planet Kerbin (essentially the astronauts that you get to have inside the space crafts you build) do have a ‘minionesque’ comical look but in no actual way does this really ever affect the simulation aspect of the game - it still packs in a pretty hardcore simulator with the actual ship resources like fuel, electricity and mono propellant having to be carefully managed during advanced missions. Successfully piloting a craft and docking with a space station is seriously no joke. Flight dynamics are also very realistic with you actually having to have at least a rudimentary understanding of how a rocket or airplane works in order to have one you designed actually ever get off the ground.All in all this provides a game that has you spending hours designing a ship straight out of your imagination using a very wide variety of parts in order to accomplish any mission you could think of like launching from Kerbin, landing on the Mun (moon) and then returning those happy little guys back home. All of this happens while constantly having chuckles at the witty ship part descriptions while in Build Mode or the quirkiness of the Kerbins that you're having go on EVA's outside your space station.Mod support is huge and makes the game essentially extendable to anything you could possibly ever want from a space sim. If you like space sims you will like this, trust me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Two space pilgrims are dead. This is one of my most noticeable achievements in a PC diversion. Clearly lamentably the two Kerbals - an entire sorts of negligible green outcast men who feel like an unholy blend of the Associates from Detestable Me and the Irken race from Interloper Zim - are dead. I made sense of how to keep them alive through a large number of calamities, contributing hours ensuring to their survival presented to the brutal components dim of space. Test missions were flown; tests accumulated consistent data; rockets would decrease to leave the ground and would explode or dispatch and a while later rapidly tip over in light of the way that the change wasn't right. These two passed on in light of the total data of a thousand frustrations. Additionally, it was exquisite since they kicked the container crashing into the Moon. Conciliatory sentiments, the Mun. It doesn't for the most part cover it to express that Kerbal Space Program is a space sim. For a specific something, paying little mind to how honest to goodness things get, notwithstanding all that you're playing in a universe of negligible green child's shows, which the entertainment never really obliges with its amazing physical credibility the further along you go. Nevertheless, for each something that vibe cerebrum bowing and sciencey, there's still a smooth sentiment responsiveness, like the way that endeavoring to plot a flight way that spots you in hover with a substitute planet is essentially a genuinely dubious and correct session of Bop It. The preoccupation beats that characterization as a consequence of that sentiment relentless revelation and improvement. Conferring a blunder never felt like a train, just as the preoccupation had set an incomprehensible obstacle before me and chuckled as I whipped furiously at it. It felt like improvement. Frustration is a teacher here, one that challenges you and doesn't exchange off by giving every one of you the answers. Regardless, it is certainly an instructor that requirements essentially for you to find light. In light of present circumstances, endeavoring to nutshell Kerbal Space Program doesn't include clear ""You win in case you arrive"" targets. To the degree I can tell, the delight never stops, and an entire close-by planetary gathering persists there to be explored. What KSP values above all is consistent quality. Though every one of your analysts and pilots are insignificant green men, the entertainment is actually human. You advance basically by being adequately striking to try accomplishing to some degree higher, making your species' scope of noticeable quality just to some degree greater with every attempt. In case you make sense of how to break the world's speed record, you're set up to have a go at accomplishing the upper environment and recording how the air is up there. If you arrive, then maybe we can put a satellite extensively further. In case the satellite can get up there, maybe a space explorer can. In case we can accomplish space, we can accomplish our closest planetary neighbor. The main thing that is critical is that the experience is never misused. Whether you transmit the data using a radio wire you associated with your bus or you make sense of how to arrive safely and the data can be recovered physically, Mission Control gets the experience, showed up under a clearing point of interest of ""Science"" in-entertainment. If the mission bombs marvelously terribly, it is beneficial the length of you see why. Clearly, most of your time in-preoccupation is spent in the spaceport on a steady experimentation mode endeavoring to collect a claim to fame that can do correctly what's required for the present mission. The beguilement wouldn't take your breath away apparently or aurally - arrive, sea, space are all decently textureless and lacking, even with each one of the specs twisted up, and the sounds are about the same, with the soundtrack besting out at ""vigorously impossible to miss"" instead of amazing. All the torque has gone into making the fine engine inconspicuous components terrifyingly confusing. In every way that really matters every part of a spaceship's arrangement is spoken to here, with really many diagram options and moving parts to gather - from fuel tanks and rockets to the glow shields for reentry and the decoupling devices for supporters. Besides, would do well to consider each and every piece of it or without question as you're imagined, it will flop marvelously before you even watch the stars. It's mind-boggling, however starting close to nothing and including new tech onto powerful structures is the place rapture is found. The honest to goodness making methodology is earth fundamental, regardless, in light of the way that every part is basically joined to your specialty like Legos. There's a colossal number of tweaking instruments available for the more picky player, yet it takes a long time before they get the opportunity to be unmistakably fundamental shades of perniciousness. Kerbal Space Program offers guide Easy to-Hard inconvenience settings, yet when in doubt, the bona fide inconvenience setting is for all intents and purposes figurative. The Sandbox mode opens up each available part in the delight so you can just waste time and make the most point by point, insane arrangements conceivable. The Science mode grants you to secure concentrations for each new leap forward achievement; you can spend those spotlights on the Imaginative work bent tree, which is the place you win more prominent and better parts to use. The Calling mode is a full scale space program experience where money is, really, a challenge and extraordinary general evaluation, open blessings, government contracts, and developed out tech are required to before you can even remain to send space adventurers on a flight. This is the most ""gamey"" it gets, with contracts addressing clearly described missions you can perform to get the most out of every flight. It's direct going, yet it's conceivably the most satisfying in light of the way that each new progress is earned. You will miss the mark at this beguilement. It will incapacitate you and it will stress you, in the meantime, when in doubt, it will quiet, quiet, and energize you. Inventive muscles will be reached out here that aren't augmented all the time by diversions, and more personality boggling minutes require a sort of zen past being essentially snap arranged for a stun strike. In reality, even dissatisfaction gives a lesson. Notwithstanding how huge or little the achievement, whatever else that ought to be conceivable is compelled just by your imaginative vitality. To be sure, even with its cartoonish entertainment factor and erraticisms, Kerbal Space Program has a for all intents and purposes holy respect for the minor miracles required in space travel, and even at its most troublesome, it justifies that respect thusly. (All reviews are recouped from the Internet and piped through a movement of identical word instruments three conditions both for amusingness and to extra time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), yet you can call it ""Threewording"")			",324,44,31,27,29,2,48

								Kerbal Space Program is an excellent game if you like anything to do to aeronautics and space. You start off with limited parts but as you progress and do missions and launches you get gradually better and reach out further and further into the cosmos!The more you play the more possibilities are opened out to you and since I love doin sciency♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is just great for me!

												Fantastic game, in general. The game at first is very complex, and if you honestly don't have any past experience with applied physics, you might need/want to look up a lot of tutorials on YouTube (Scott Manley is your friend!). With 750 hours on the game currently, I still haven't done everything there is to do in the stock game, and with mods, you can make it as easy, hard, realistic, or fun as you want.Though, for all players, new and experienced, I HIGHLY recommend pacing yourself. Go slow, don't travel to all the planets right away, because it is possible, but it's also no fun if you have no goals to set for yourself. I have over 700 hours on this game and I still haven't even tried to land a probe on Eeloo (farthest and most eccentric planet in the Kerbol system), so if you want to get the most fun out of this game, don't blow it all in one go!

												Kerbal space program has one of the most steep learning curves i've ever seen in a video game. It took me over 2 hours to learn how to get into orbit (this was before there was tutorials and your only salvation was scott manley), and by that time my periapsis was 60km and my apoapsis was 47000km. This game allows you to either make outrageous rockets and crash them into buildings, or choose to play it seriously and be frustrated for the first 20 hours. If you ever wish to pick this game up, it is extremely fun, which ever play style you choose, and pushing through the difficulty and landing on these far away celestial bodies was one of the most rewarding gaming experiences i have ever had; it kinda reminds me of defeating a boss in dark souls. Just remember when you first start playing that IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND YOU WILL FAIL MANY TIMES. I spent 400 hours playing the game and im still playing it. Without a doubt i highly recommend it. *Also one of the most valuable tips i can give you is to use 'F5'; it saves the game at certain points and thus you can try your landing again if it fails.

												Build. Fly Dream.One of the best sandbox games in this decade of sandbox games. You are given a whole star system open to exploration; Mun, Duna, Laythe, all these planets are yours, except Eve, attempt no landing there. However each trip has new challenges and the game does not hold your hand through them you will run out of fuel, burn up in re-entry, and explode and explode and explode. That rush you feel though when you finally plant that flag and safely return to Kerbin is incomparable.This is the gateway drug to space. Nasa, Esa, and Roscosmos should pay squad for recruiting their next generation of scientists, engineers, and pilots.			",204,58,2,30,37,0,52

												If you've ever dreamed of launching your own rocket, or wanted to figure out how to keep ships in orbit, or wondered how hard it REALLY is to dock with an orbiting station with intricate and precise maneuvering, or aspired to land a craft on the remote moons of a gas giant while sweating your fuel reserves, then buy this game and play it today. (Spoiler: Landing on planets is HARD, Docking is HARDER.) With a wealth of mods, a great developer team and a rabid fanbase, this game is truly wonderful. It appeals to the explorer in all of us, if you're the type of person where the journey IS the destination, then this game is for you. Definitely not for those who prefer PvP shooty-type-stuff. Luckily I count myself among the former and can rate KSP 9/10 - highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kerbal Space Program is a beautiful game.Of course, I don't mean that in the graphical sense. The graphics aren't amazing, but I'm running the game at low power. It's what I expected. The physics are absolutely on point, though. I've learned a lot about space in my 50 hours of play. It does require some skill to pilot and trial and error to figure out which designs work. Timewarp is a handy feature. Youtubers like Scott Manley were godsends.So far, I have landed on the ""Mun."" I will be playing for many hours more.10/10			",3,1,0,4,2,0,1

Kerbal Space Program. If I could sleep with a video game, this would be it. KSP is beautiful in almost every way! I can blow up my Kerbals on the launch pad and try and build a boat out of struts (I can't), or if I want to I can land on alien worlds and watch alien moons rise.It runs on my Mac, making it a game that can run on anything short of a rotary phone. Really, any game that can run with an i3 processor and is this GOOD then should be a yes in everyone's book :DThe real fun comes when things go wrong. If it seems to go right first try, it won't. I think the best moment have come in failure. Once I killed Bill, Bob and Gwent Kerman after landing to rescue another Kerbal on a far-away moon before realising I was on the wrong side of the moon. While attempting to get back into orbit, I lost my velocity and plummeted into a xeno-ocean. Xeno - sea? Xenocean? I don't know .-.In addition, this game has no cons. The stock game has plenty or shortcomings, but the modding community is the most diverse community in existence for a game on Steam...You want clouds? There's a mod for that.You want to eject you Kerbals and watch them parachute to safety? There's a mod for that.You want to fly them up in an AI-flown spaceplane then shoot an AMRAAM missile at them from a ground base, then watch them jump out just in time before landing perfectly on top of the mountains? There's a mod for that. Well, actually about 12.Don't bother with that astrophysics degree, play KSP. If you are considering buying this game, then HELL TO THE YES!Like 124 / 10			",3,1,0,0,7,0,10

								One of the most addictive and exciting games I've played in recent memory and that although it is not even in beta stage yet. So wonder what is more to come from this. But if you like Space games, like building rockets or space planes and send them out to explore the universe this is definitely the game to get. Even after over 30 hours of playing I still scratched on the surface.  I wished this is what Spore space stage should have been. With Kerbal Space program you could lots and lots of fun in this one, but beware this can be a real time sink. I also recommend watching some of the tutorial videos online to help a bit with frustration at the beginning when you just don't get your rocket into orbit!			",47,25,0,26,16,0,26

								There is simply no shortage of places to go and things to do.Once, I put a pirate ship into orbit.  A pirate ship.  In orbit.  Hell yeah, it had cannons!  It could sail the stars as Odysseus sailed the seas, but curiously enough couldn't float upon landing in an ocean.  In this way, I discovered the need for testing.Another time, I built a large, mobile glove-shaped buggy out of airbags that was designed to safely catch spacecraft that were landing at significant multiples of the speed of sound.  Sifting through the wreckage of that first test revealed serious flaws, but that's just the sort of can't-do negativism that further engineering tweaks can and will overcome as you play KSP.  Soon, the crack engineering team realized they could save millions by just installing an airbag or two on any landing vessel itself.  En garde, gravity!Another time, I dropped a jeep on the Mun that landed on its side doors, trapping the Kerbals inside.  My OnStar insurance coverage did not extend beyond the atmosphere, so I launched a rescue mission to flip the Munar jeep.  Then, I toured the Munar craters in a jeep.  The rescue team had no way to return home and no other plans, so they hopped in for the ride.  Yeah, riding dirty in Kerbal Space Program.300+ hours in, and I've only begun building space stations.  I've only landed on a handful of planets and moons.  The call for exploration lures me ever upward, even though in my first ever rocket launch, I didn't know better than to not walk out the capsule door mid-flight.  As I fell back to the surface, my body aglow in the flames of reentry, a thought crossed my mind: maybe I should develop a large, mobile catcher's mitt for situations such as these.KSP is a game in which you decide where to go, what to do, what to make, and how many boosters you need to accomplish all of these things--much research has been done on this very subject before you arrived, and the data has always pointed toward ""moar.""KSP is challenging to learn--truly challenging.  It is also so, so very rewarding.  You WILL learn a lot, and you WILL explode.  Often, and, at least as you take your first tentative steps skyward, with great consistency.   But one fine day, as you become the first Kerbal to step on another planet, you will remember.  You will remember the first time you made it to space as the hook that did not let go.  You will remember your first orbital docking with nearly the same sense of relish as the first time you made love.  You will remember landing on the Mun--not crashing, but landing--and the look on that brave Kerbonaut's face after looking around on the Munar surface and realizing you had neglected to make plans for bringing him back home.Next time, you note, you will be more prepared to cross another item off the list of things that can't be done.

												Why are you still not playing it? This game is as pivotal to sandbox games as was minecraft , but in a completely different department - depth.Simulated solar system, chance to experience and learn real (almost - still cut some corners - no la-grande points, orbits are mostly radial without additional simulation after a swing, but none the less) rocket science.Sense of achievement with this game is as huge as in dwarf fortress, when through error, misery, failure, countless tries you finally get your♥♥♥♥♥to <s>mars</s> Duna. And it only goes up from there.And then there are mods. My. GOD. Modding scene for this game gone above and beyond: You want attachment systems? Sure. You want to mine? Since 1.0 - embedded, but there are also kethane and open resource system. You want to build rockets on distant planets - sure - Extraplanetary launchpads got you covered. You want even more? How about warp drive and additional systems mod? Want more realism? TAS Mods got you covered with food, water and waste resources. Want working actuators? Infernal robotics got you covered.I got more than 600 hours of gameplay out of this game (300+ on steam, 300 prior) and it still has a little bit more to offer, and with newer mods coming around - it is always fun to occasionally get back to it. This game is like a good song or a good movie - memorable, can be watched/listened a dozen times and never gets old.So, once again, why are you still not playing it?			",277,54,1,22,66,2,56

								Kerbal Space Program offers an immense amount of tinkering away at spacecraft that fail and fly.  Spending a few minutes slapping something together that barely gets off the ground can give some satisfying laughs. But when you've spent a good bit of time perfecting a craft and getting to the many milestones (getting airborne, breaking atmosphere, maintaining orbit, landing on The Mun) you'll have so much pride in yourself for accomplishing something that you'll feel like a rocket scientist.  The physics at play in KSP can allow a previously failed launch to have a chance of succeeding next time so taking several attempts is rewarded (don't give up).  Trial and error is what drives this game and if you love the idea of ironing out the wrinkles in your design and watching it pay off, then you won't be disappointed at all in KSP.  Let your creativity and problem solving skills run wild!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								This is: - how to do edutainment - a demonstration of the power of adding a little personality to an otherwise dry and difficult challenge, making failure hilarious instead, and success all that sweeter - sufficiently gameified that you can get to the moon-analogue and back using a wobbly stack of exploding things, steering with WASD, and do it within a few hours rather than years of meticulous planning and precision engineering - sufficiently accurate in the broad strokes that you can get a really good gut understanding of rocket science and orbital mechanics, and one of the most notable Lets Play-ers (Scott Manley) has a couple of physics and astronomy degrees - absolutely thriving with mods to push it further into either direction if you so desire (and as a pure utility, Kerbal Alarm Clock is excellent for managing scaling up to multiple concurrent interplanetary missions) - far, far more rewarding than a ""level up!"" screen when you set yourself a dot in the sky to visit, and finally make it there and back intact - an early access game which is worth the (inevitable sale) money for what's already been made (writing this as of version 0.23), not some nebulous future potential - why I have not had any ""free time"" for the past month - JEBEDIAH KERMAN, THRILLMASTER			",121,11,1,6,14,0,22

								Rocket Science! Explosions! Fun!Kerbal Space Program (KSP) puts you in charge of a space agency (think NASA) whose goals are... actually that's pretty much up to you. The game's career mode will give you missions you can accept, such as ""get a rocket into orbit"" or ""land on the Mun (Moon),"" and you get rewards for doing so such as research points to unlock more modules, prestige to do... stuff, and monies to pay for things. But really you can do whatever you please. And outside of career mode which structures your objectives and gameplay to an extent is a sandbox mode that lets you do as you please without worrying about unlocking things or having money for them.The game basically has two main aspects (three if you include the Career Mode stuff described above): building stuff to send into space, and then launching that stuff and making it do other stuff. Designing successful rockets (and later on spaceplanes) can be a bit difficult, since you have to worry about stuff like the weight, the power of the engines, maneuverability, and more. The 1.0 Update plans to add a tool that will let you see potential problems with your designs before you actually try them out, but until then you basically just have to wing it and hope that your designs don't crash or explode in a spectacular manner.Once you have your designed rockets (or spaceplanes), then you get to launch them and perform whatever ""mission"" you have chosen for yourself. You have to fly the craft yourself, which often requires great precision and timing. Assuming you don't just crash and die horribly, your biggest concern is fuel, and running out of it at a bad moment can make you go back down towards the planet (you did attach a parachute, right?) or leave you drifting in space unable to return home unless you can find some way to rescue them.This is not an easy game even on easy difficulty settings, but it is one that can give a real feeling of accomplishment when you make successful designs, achieve your first orbit, make that fateful landing on the Mun, and much more. It gives you an appreciation for the difficulties that real world space agencies face when planning or performing such missions.At the time of writing, KSP is still in early access, though its full release is not too distant. Regardless, this game is fully playable now and stands as one of the best early access games ever to make it to Steam. If you are interested in Science, and specifically space exploration, then you really should check this game out. Actually... if you like games period you should try this out. There is a demo, though it is of an older version of the game and therefore has far less than the main game does.Difficult, often frustrating, and yet an excellent game that makes you feel great when you succeed at something in it. :3			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Kerbal Space Program is probably the best Early Access game out there. Yes, it's even better than DayZ. It's an amazing game, and I don't even purchase simulators. If I buy a game from a genre I don't like/care less about, then you know that I knew something was up with the game. I'm not much of a Early Access guy, but this game was quite an exception.GraphicsThe visuals, unfortunately, are pretty weak so far. The textures look like those from games where the textures are glitched and it's all blurry. The Kerbonauts are also not much better. However, the graphics look nice on occasion, so it's not bad everywhere. Not much to say about visuals in this game.GameplayThe gameplay is much like a simulator (which it is) where you build a ship and launch it, and with the proper ship, you can either get to the Mun and beyond, or crash and burn and possibly kill Jebediah Kerman. And if you DO kill Jeb, then I will find you and make sure that neck of yours makes a mighty fine snapping noise as you collapse to the ground. Anyway, the construction is solid and is easy to learn. Just be warned though, you will need to know the basics to physics if you want to make a decent ship. To add on to that, the pilot controls are also solid and makes the game more difficult in a good way. Why else do you think I enjoyed FTL, Super Meat Boy, Dark Souls, and all of the other throw-your-controller/keyboard-at-the-wall simulators? The only con to the gameplay is that the learning curve can be quite steep and requires lots of blood, sweat, and tears (Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration) into the game. But, we'll get into replayability later.StoryThe story? Well, there is absolutely no story in this game whatsoever. No trace. There's a small amount of lore, but that's it. The story to this game will NOT be counted towards KSP's final score.AudioThe audio is decent, but the noises keep looping and it sounds repetitive and it needs lots of work. However, I love the songs a lot, so that'll boost the score quite a bit for this game.ReplayabilityThe replayability is very, very, very, high. This is one of the few games on Steam that could easily take 1000 hours of your life, sitting on the throne alongside Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, Skyrim, and a few others. There is so much trial and error in the game that for you to actually get to the Mun, it would take you hours after hours after hours. Look at the other reviews' hours. I only have a small amount, but let's use common sense: Most of the reviews have over 1k hours logged into the game, so what does that mean? Does it have high or low replayability? That's what I thought. The reasons the game is highly replayable was explained in the Gameplay part of the review already.VerdictIn the end, Kerbal Space Program is an impressive and difficult space simulator. Despite a few flaws, this game is well worth the price and is worth buying, Early Access or not. I highly recommend the game. Why waste your time dealing with connecting into servers and getting captured by bandits all the time in DayZ when you could build a bunch of ships and then watch them all burn to the ground after failing miserably and then decide that if Jeb dies, you need to restart the launch or else I WILL FIND YOU- I mean, you will get sad. Oops. Graphics- 5/10Gameplay- 8.5/10Story- NONEAudio- 6/10Replayability- 10/10.:7.7/10:.+Monsterous amount of replayability+Funny ways to watch your ships crash+Solid piloting controls+Simple-to-learn but hard-to-master construction+Great songs-Required experience at physics and other things to understand the game-Mediocre visuals-Small amounts of audio, loops sound boring			",150,23,0,20,8,2,12

								This is highly addictive and quite hardcore space faring sim. I call it NASA sim with kerbals. Having been playing space trading games like Elite or X3 I have always dreamt of game that actually does have orbital navigation and things like that. But this game is really much more than that - You actually colonize the space with Your own custom built space stations, planetary landers, planetary bases, rovers and anything Your imagination can create. And the ""building bricks"" are based on real world counterparts - no teleporters or stargates here. Should this game have a story like Mass Effect and space trading economy like X3 series, it would be my dream game come true.I would highly recommend this game to everyone who dares to test his own creativity in building sophisticated craft that can actually fly and land on distant planets and moons.And You will have to land there if You are playng campaing mode, because that is a way You gather more science data for Your scientists and You will need that to learn better components for Your spacecrafts.This game has also a huge modding comunity already that have created a lot of content that can extend a stock functionality.There are also tons of tutorials on Youtube that will explain a game in detail and a dedicated wiki to learn more.Try not to be distracted by appearances of those kerbals - they will share Your passion of flying high and far away and they will show their appreciation if You do things right! :) Have fun and fly safe!

												Thought about Space and stuff, bought this game.Learn actual science like orbital mechanism.Build rockets and shoot for the stars (Moons).10/10 - IGN ""It's OKAY.""Okay, I think it's time for me to have a serious review. Here we go.This game has one of the most helpful community ever. Its modding potential is unlimited after the release of 64bit game, and just the community itself is worth buying the game.Even without modding, the stock game itself is already marvelously designed and delivered by Squad. It worth hundreds of hours of gameplay.With the orbital model of Patched Conics, you can apply many real-life maneuvers like exploiting the Oberth Effect. You can play the game without KER or Mechjeb 2, as you can just use the third Kepler law to calculate most information you need just by the apoapsis and periapse. Of course, it is also easy to play just without all the fancy math, just with lower efficiency ;)I would personally describe playing the Kerbal Space Program as an interactive learning experience. It is one of the best learning experience I've ever had, as it requires me to learn the real-world science. I would have to thank Squad for creating this incredible game, as it opened the door of aerospace engineering as well as astrometry. With the introduction of KSPedia, it is now even easier for new players to get into the game. In many senses, with the help of Realism Overhaul, Kerbal Space Program is a simulator. I do not care what people say about how ""the Orbiter"" is the only real space simulator, as Kerbal Space Program is one of the best indie game, hands down.EDIT: CKAN saves life. Seriously. If you are trying to play Realism Overhaul please use CKAN. It saves time and eliminate human errors.			",56,16,3,8,24,1,20

								Imagine, if you will, any alien race on another planet.  Image them looking up at the stars and trying to reach them.  We went through our own space program in the 60s, and we got a taste of what it means to leave your own gravity well.  Well, certainly we can't be the only species trying to do this.  Playing Kerbal Space Program makes me feel connected to every other species attempting to leave their home planet.  It's not just us on Earth, but everywhere.  KSP makes me feel like I have NASA in my backyard and can throw together a rocket and try it out whenever I like.  I recommend this game for young and old alike.  If you like rockets because they're cool or because you remember Neil saying those memorable words, please play this game!			",7,2,0,3,2,0,10

												Boiled down to it's very core it's a physics symulator. Under that catagory, it's the best physics symulator out there. Go to another generality, say it's a space game. It's the best space game I've ever played. Go specific, it's a game where you start on one big potato, and explore other potatos in space. It's unique, it's physics-ey, it will teach you about space, and it's got mods flowing from every crack. 10/10, this game sets a really high bar, and then jeb flies a rocket all the way up to that bar, then runs out of fuel on the burn back to Kerben.

												The best simulation game I've ever played! The stock game is amazing enough for trying to get to orbit, and other planets (very hard, still havent landed everywhere in one trip.. after 1000 hours). Also boats and land vehicles if you're into that (on other planets too why not?). But with mods... it can become every other sim game youve ever wanted! And a handy community run mod database and manager (CKAN) to make it easy!Flight combat sim: install realistic aerodynamic mod and weapons mod to make your own F15s fight your own Su-27s (FAR and BDarmory). Colony building: there are life support and resource collecting mods that challenge you to scan for the right site and use resources on any of the planets to sustain a colony of kerbals; even manufacture new parts there (MKS, TAC lifesupport, extraplanetary launchpads, scansat, remotetech). Hardcore realistic simulation? Theres a mod that converts the stock star system to a 1:1 scale replica of the solar system, with real-life satellite data used (real solar system, realism overhaul, probably more mods - these are too scary for me). Realism overhaul I think uses historical rocket data so you can create saturn-V replicas with the accurate fuel mixtures and everything! Or go the other way and get futuristic mods to create antimatter powered near-light speed craft to visit entire other solar systems (nearfuture, KSPinterstellar)! And with the new 1.1 release on Unity 5, you may actually be able to use these mods without running out of memory!Between the great modding community and active devs (for over 5 years!) this game will continue to get better and better, so even at full price of $40 its a great deal!

Short Version: Wonderful engineering game. Great challenges, countless hours of fun, very satisfying experience. The more effort you put into learning how to play the more rewarding the game becomes. I believe that KSP is an absolute must-have game for anyone who likes building things.Long Version: Pros: Challenging tasks that require significant planning and engineeringI've probably spent two-thirds of my game time simply starring at the vehicle assembly window planning and tinkering with my space ships to get them to perform a specific job. This game heavily rewards forethought and competence. Wide variety of vessel components that can be combined in virtually limitless waysAfter you've unlocked most of the tech tree (or in sandbox) you have a lot of parts at your disposal. With some talent and imagination you can craft some astonishingly clever (and beautiful) space craft. Intuitive and flexible ship building systemThe one thing in this game that doesn't take 20 hours of research to be competent with is the vehicle assembly system. Even a complete novice can launch the game and start sticking parts together (learning the parts is another story). But like everything else, there is a skill to it, and it rewards learning advance techniques. Players are encouraged to ""eyeball it"" and fly their rockets manuallyPersonally, I like that the game wants me to fly by the seat of my pants and guide my space ships by hand. It is very rewarding to learn orbital mechanics and figure out how to maneuver my rocket. Endlessly mod-ableThe developers spent some time to make almost every aspect of the game open for modding. Thanks to this effort there is a very healthy ecosystem of mods that can change the game to your preference. EducationalWhile not the primary focus of the game, you will learn about physics in space. Orbital mechanics, delta V, acceleration and mass, just to name a few.Cons: Vessel physics is really quite badWobbly ships that act like they're held together with rubber bands. For a game which is basically a big physics simulator, the one place where the physics engine actually matters completely falls short. This can be seriously frustrating when it destroys rockets for no obvious reason. The game chokes on large or complex shipsEarly on you will notice that there is a ""Part count"" number shown when building ships. Later on you will learn why. When you reach a certain number of parts (the number varies based on computer performance) the game starts choking and has major FPS drops. If you're building a very large space station you may find that it becomes nearly unplayable as you add more components. No tutorial or basic flight school to help new players become proficientThis game has an exponential learning curve. Unfortunately new players have virtually no in-game resources to learn basic flight proficiency. Just accept that you're going to have to do some research and watch hours of youtube videos before you have a chance of even reaching one of the moons. Little to do on other celestial bodiesWhile the addition of resources has helped greatly, nine times out of ten, after spending hours designing your vessel, carefully planning and timing your flight, and painstakingly setting down on another world - you will step out, look around for 10 seconds, then hop back in and fly home. It's really rather anti-climactic. ",103,19,1,10,13,0,6

												First game on Steam I've been willing to take time to write a because I feel this game deserves it. Yes it's a long review, however again, this game deserves it.GAME DESCRIPTION:You own the Kerbal Space Program and your facility is equipped to launch various rockets off the launch pad or aircraft off a runway to send items in orbit, dock with orbiting stations, travel/survey/land on other planets, conduct science experiments, take samples and materials from planets/asteroids, build bases on other planets, or just explore. Campaign mode allows you to start with very basic rocketry equipment and buildings in which you can accept contracts that offers rewards of money and science you can use to purchase upgrades of buildings and research additional items to further your mission capabilities. In addition, you can hire new Kerbals to your crew that includes pilots, scientist, and engineers and advance their effectiveness with each successful mission. If you'd like to skip to the good stuff and jump right into the action, you can play in Sandbox mode which already has everything unlocked and nothing cost money. Sandbox mode also allows you to save your progress so you can always comeback and continue sending things up in space. PROS:+The unbelievably accurate physics and mechanics are always fun+Near endless possibilities of various rockets, satellites, space stations you can build. +Can send fueling ports, stations, satellites, or rockets in orbit and let them orbit in real-time while you build something else to dock, refuel, rendezvous with it, etc. You could do this 100s of times and have thousands of things orbiting whatever celestial body you chose. +Can be played as a sandbox type game or campaign +The solar system is insanely vast. If you were not not speed up time in travel, travel time is very accurate. 2 days to get to the moon and years to get to the outer planets (in near real-time). Thank God they included time warp lol!+Extremely HARD at first = pure joy and satisfication when you accomplish what you're trying to acheive.+Music is fun and fitting depending upon your location. Beautiful galatic music plays in space+Beautiful space visuals. Although I'd recommend a few visual mods to enchance this+Minimal bugs/glitches. I've had one crash of the game in 60 hours, however I believe it was my computer :). Otherwise, I haven't ran into any gamebreaking glitches. +User interface for building the rocket is VERY user friendly and makes it downright fun to use your imagination to build somethingCONS:-I feel the tutorials are lacking. While there are some tutorials to help you get started and they're very helpful, There's nothing that really explains what most of the items to build your rocket do. Instead, most item descriptions are just funny little paragraphs that doesn't always explain the item's function. While I do like the comical approach and it seems fitting for the game, it should at least always say exactly what function the item serves and/or why you may need it. Or, there should be a tutorial on every item and it's use (like what batteries, docking ports, thermal reactors, decouplers, etc. do)-While I did state in the pros there's endless possibilites of what you can build, I still feel almost all items available are still lacking in variety - such as engines, fuel tanks, lights, batteries, RCS pods, science, structural, and aerodynamics to name a few. Mods do ease this and offer many more to chose from, however I've found many mods to be graphically glitchy and some I've found that do work I felt should've been included stock in game. -Campaign contract requirements are VERY aggravating at times. Sometimes they make no sense and feel out of place. For example, one contract has you test a specific rocket while submerged in water...really? So you have to launch, navigate over water, land safely in the water, and then boost your rockets while submerged - in which they do absolutely nothing other than just burn out...just weird, but ok (yes I realize some planets have water). Some people may like this, but I've found no use for contracts like these.  In addition to the above, I feel the contracts cause the campaign to way too slow and become frustrating due to them being tedious and many being repetive that require you to test the same item, but it just changes the requirements making it a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ For example, one rocket you may have to just test at 50,000km...easy enough. But then another contract will be offered to test the same item, but at 52,000km, not in orbit, and within 450-500m/s. So you may be at 52,000km but if you test it at 501m/s or 449m/s, you fail. Quite aggravating and again, this may not be a con for some, but I feel tests/contracts like these are a waste of time spending hours trying to get everything right, making the campaign move and feel VERY slow and near non-rewarding. OVERALL:That said, if you like space or anything space related, get this...period. I've played 75 hours and I've litterally scratched the surface of what you can do. I've managed to place items into orbit, build and dock stations, orbit satellites for research, and land and return from the moon. However, I still have yet to learn building rovers, advanced science stations, traveling to other planets, etc.  When I zoom out after I've traveled to the moon and look at the solar system, it's insane how large the solar system is. It makes it look like I've just merely accomplished stepping out on my front doorstep - even though the in-game and real-world travel time was days. This game offers thousands of hours of gameplay and I've not come remotely close to losing interest. It's no doubt the best (if not only) realistic space-mission simulator with nearly an endless amount of possibilities and customizations. It lets your imaginations run wild. However, that said, be warned it's a simulator that takes patience! If you lack patience, this is not for you. But if you have patience, when you finally accomplish what you want the feeling of satisfaction is like no other! RATING: 8.5/10-1.5 as I do feel the campaign could be a bit better if it offered better contracts making it easier to get into, some item choices lack variety (again, alleviated with mods), and item's descriptions, tutorials, and purpose of use is severely lackingEdit: Thank you Kevin for pointing out the saving process. It's not described anywhere in game (that I could find), so thank you for that.			",22,0,0,4,8,0,0

												This is far and away the most entertaining game I've ever played. Which is not to say that an FPS isn't more exciting or anything, but because of the stellar physics engine and the game's foundation in real-world orbital physics, I have never had my brain more taxed while learning to play a game. And because of that, when you finally do succeed in a Mun landing, or even your first Kerbin orbit, the amount of satisfaction is just insane. Because it's not *just* about better reflexes, or a stronger sense of strategy—You succeed in KSP based on *actual knowledge* gained during gameplay. (And many, many hours of tutorials and failure...)So yeah. Get it. It'll satisfy all kinds of nerdery in the best way.			",61,12,0,4,7,0,9

								Kerbal Space Program is one of the best sandbox games I've played, even though it is currently in development. You are given unlimited possibilities in a number of settings, be it orbit, on the surface of your home planet Kerbin, or even on another heavenly body, such as the cleverly named Mün, or Duna, a Mars like planet.  On the sandbox aspect, you are given loads of different odds and ends to do as you please with, and the only limit is your imagination.  Things like replica space-planes, and huge space-stations await you in this new universe. Don't expect to be a pro right away though, as fifty-one hours into the game even I still have mishaps. The KSP community is incredibly supportive however, and there are great sources for help. If you get bored with what the developers give you, it is made incredibly easy to add plugins and part-packs to the game, with a website called the SpacePort. KSP is a great game for all ages, too, because unlike the theme nowadays of shoot-em-up and gore, you are challenged with expanding the frontiers of your own race of little green men.

								KSP is like Dwarf Fortress but with less dwarven fortresses and more space!It´s a game where you decide what you do.You could build a space station, a base on the Mün, a VTOL to cruise on the planet Kerbin, a network of sattelites, some space fighters to destroy previously build stations or something completly different.Also, KSP is damm hard. You can´t even get into orbit without knowing what you do. A degree in space could help!If you´re somewhat connected with the KSP community, you will learn tons of new terms like Kessler Syndrom, Hohmann transfer, apoapsis, periapsis, prograde, retrograde, aerobrake, gravity turn and many more!

												This is the single game which I have dumped the most time into. I have probably played no less than 1000 hours of this overall, as after a while I moved away from my ""vanilla"" steam save and began going nuts in RSS. Highly recommend this game for anyone who's curious about how it is that the aerospace industry works; yes, it's very unrealistic in some aspects (such as the fact that Kerbin seems to be twice as dense as osmium), but the incredibly diverse and lively modding community more than makes up for any of those concerns. This game is as hard as you want to make it, and as realistic as you want to make it, with the single exception of N-body mechanics. That, however, is something that everyone will have to suck up, if only because time warp would no longer function usefully.			",41,1,1,1,2,0,4

												An amazing flight/space simulator, with amazing depth and detail, as well as vast scope. From building space-pleanes(and not-so-space planes), to hi-tech rockets to land on everything from the mun to Dres, as well as do orbital science, this game is a incredible space program simulator. In addition, it is fully modable(and has a huge modding community with hundreds if not thousands of mods), and has cooperated with big-name groups like the ESA and NASA. I highly recommend buying this, and i can only say, there is no such thing as to many struts, and check(and then RE-check) your stages. And then check them for a third time, just to be sure........Easily, 11/10Addendum:With the update to 1.0, this game only gets better, They redid the atmospheric model, tweaked all the parts to be more realistic, and added tons of new parts to the game. And of course, if its something they didnt include, you can be sure some modder on Curse or the KSP forums made a mod for it. It is so expansive, i cant even go over all of it here. Check out Scott Manley's YouTube channel for in-depth learning on how to play, and just get right into it, it is well worth the buy, and the time. 20/10.			",8,1,0,1,11,0,17

												From the papers of Wojak Feel 2/26/1962:I have enjoyed every second of the 220 hours that I have played of this game. I have built over 2000 spaceships for the Kerbals so that they can get to the various planets in their solar system. It is a process of trial and error in building these spaceships since they tend to fall apart quite easily and when they do it has catastrophic results for the Kerbals manning them. I have conducted inventory this past Tuesday and I can report that as of this past week 26,000 Kerbals have lost their lives in service to their planet. The families of these Kerbals receive my deepest condolences and I am putting forth a motion with the Interplanetary League of Kerbal Nations (ILKN) to aid in providing financial reimbursement to help with funeral expenses and life insurance claims. In watching these brave Kerbals and Gerbals lose their lives I have inadvertently discovered a new passion. Killing Kerbals is to date the most exhilarating thing I have ever done. I thoroughly enjoy watching the life slip out of the eyes of these Kerbals as they are crushed under structural beams after the collapse of a separator ring or as they suffocate after the cabin is flooded with carbon monoxide due to an engine malfunction. I am therefore issuing a call to arms to the rest of the galaxy. This vermin has lived under us for long enough. I will petition the various solar systems to supply me with the necessary forces to complete my mission of mass genocide. I see the future as a joyous one where, having crushed the Kerbals, the various nations of this great galaxy of ours can rise above the shattered remains of the Kerbal Empire and join hands as a beautifully diverse master race. This is the promise I make to you my listeners: I will thoroughly destroy the Kerbals and everything they hold dear. I will be the scourge of the Kerbal Empire and will not rest until every last insignificant spec of Kerbal scum burns and I can take my place as king of the ashes. I swear by the staff of Jehovah that by the time I die, I will have destroyed every last trace of the Kerbal Empire and its commonwealth. I will meet every Kerbal I find without mercy or remorse. I will expend every resource I have to wipe the Kerbals off the face of every planet that they inhabit. No matter where they run, no matter what loyalist swine that they cower behind, I will seek out and destroy them with brutal efficiency. There will be no leniency, no forgiveness, no chance for appeal. The empire and its corrupt senators will be a stain on the face of history and even after their obliteration I will work tirelessly to make sure that this stain is thoroughly bleached out. I am also announcing the re-militarization of the Koprulu sector once the arms embargo is lifted. The annexed Kerbal colony on Duna will be used as a base of operations for this re-militarization and I am currently in negotiations with the Aldemari Republic to supply several Minotaur-Class fleets for the rebel navy including battle cruisers, frigates, and capitol ships. We have hired many privateering firms including the famous Black Sun crime syndicate to undertake raids on the Kerbals' trade routes. These privateers should not be needed for long however, as I have issued a galaxy wide decree that whoever does not cease all trade with the Kerbals by star-date 66155.3 will suffer the full extent of my power. In order to destroy the Kerbals we must also neutralize the solar systems allied with them. The Kerbal allied systems as well as their hired mercenary groups are as follows: Kairon, Flaxo, Kelnar, Ara Aquarii, Aquila Icarus, Calesius prime, Zodiac-355, Oculus cloud, Xm-934, and BBA 19J. I will give each of these systems a chance to pledge allegiance to the rebel cause before they are utterly destroyed. In order to disarm the vast Kerbal military I have issued arrest warrants for over 3000 Kerbal army officers. Further I am offering a reward of 600,000 xaljats to anyone who manages to apprehend the band of outlaws known as the Kerman Brothers. I will see Commander Jebediah Kerman of the 35th Kerbal regiment brought to justice for his crimes against the United Galactic Federation and will use the planet destroying laser currently in development to obliterate his home world of Kerbin prime while he watches. I can assure you that he will not be able to talk his way out of this punishment like he has so many times before. He will be helpless to save his planet just like I was helpless to save mine. In conclusion, I will impart with you the famous last words of Admiral Jorney Kerman before I flayed him alive at the Battle of Kelnard's pass: ""I really wish I wasn't here right now. Uh oh now my skin is gone."" ",30,1,0,3,6,0,7

												This game is absolutely amazing.This game, however, has one big problem.This game is not challenging enough, nor is it dangerous enough.I mean seriously, it's space, stuff is supposed to go wrong. The only time anything bad happens is when I forget to put on a part. The planets have no storms or anything that happens on them, they're just bland balls of ground and water with no real dangers. Everything runs perfectly as if God himself made every single part that you put on your spacecraft, and the only issues are the assembly flaws created by yourself in the VAB.The game is amazing, it's just BORING now. Not enough challenge, no danger, no action whatsoever. The only time kerbals die is because you miscalculated something or forgot something or are trying to figure out something by trial and error. There should be actual dangers that you must deal with, such as storms on all the planets with atmospheres, especially Jool because it's a gas giant and so that aerobraking becomes risky, make things spontaneously malfunction and go wrong (I have Dangit and still nothing bad happens, it's just a ""part lifetime"" addon). The only challenge with this game is trying to get as much DeltaV on your spaceship as you can fit onto it with the best Thrust to Weight ratio you can get (and making sure you don't forget the parachutes). Some people like that. I don't. Does that mean I don't like the game?Of course not. Buy it now. Or I'll kill your dog!(kidding)			",79,12,3,4,12,0,1

												I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed all those fancy Discovery channel documentaries. Now you can make your own space adventure. Sweet stuff. There are a few bugs with the ship builder though, and later in the game when precision is of paramount importance, the maneuvaring nodes available to you will do a poor job. You can fix a lot of problems with mods, but they aren't supported via steam, so you'll have to either use curse or do it manually. Here's to hoping modding will be integrated with the distribution platform.			",127,11,4,10,10,1,25

												Never in my life would I have thought that I would ever learn things like prograde and retrograde, apoapsis and periapsis, orbital mechanics, delta-V, decouplers, aerodynamics, the relationship between centre of thrust, centre of lift and centre of mass. And never in my life would I have thought I would have so much fun in doing so.This game has a very steep learning curve, but part of the fun (and frustration) is experimenting and trying out new ideas - and failing, and then failing again. But once you reach the eventual success of designing a vessel that could complete that pesky contract, or completing your first orbit, or successfully landing on the Mun without toppling over for the seventh time, it feels like all those hours repeatedly failing (and having fun) had really been nothing.

												For anyone that enjoys a challenging learning curve, building stuff that works and is interested in spaceflight this game is a must have.I have played this game a lot, and I can only reccomend it. There is a staggering amount of things to do, and more ways to go about accomplishing these things than can be listed.One thing that really strikes me is that there is always room for improvement. Sure you can build a humungus rocket to go to the moon, but maybe you are like me and like a challenge, so instead you take the time to perfect the rocket and get there and back with barely any margin.With KSP Squad has managed to make a remarkable game, one of a kind, and one that will be played for a long time. They continously keep updating the game with new content, tweaks etc., the community is great and the modding community in particular is stunning. Some of the Devs even have their own mods, pet projects etc. and the general quality standard for mods is incredibly high.KSP's aerodynamics are too simple? There is a mod for that!Bigger rocktes?  There is a mod for that!SciFi looking parts?  There is a mod for that!In depth colonization and resource system? Non-OP Space age technology (fusion, plasma etc)? Real scale everything? Realism? Beautification?  There is a mod each and every one of these and far, far more! And CKAN makes it ridiculously easy to install them all.TLDR; BUY THIS GAME			",76,12,0,11,11,0,18

								I'm one of those people who never bought a game, relying on piracy for almost 15 years. KSP changed that.During more than one year of playing it and perhaps even 2000 hours of game time collected, I've never regret the spent money.As this is a work in progress, it can't be fully evaluated, but judging by the current status, it has crossed the line of just having a potential to become big. It really became big.Its Unity engine doesn't allow it to be very flexible for the developers because the bottleneck is Unity itself. Nevertheless, the game graphics is visually appealing.This is one of the most stable WIP games ever. Crashes are very rare even if one tweaks the game using various plugins and mods.It's educational, it's open to expanding by others and the community is fantastic. One of the most peaceful communities I've encountered online, probably due to the fact that such games aren't generally appealing to aggressive types of people.There is still much work to be done, but I already see this as one of the games that will become important in the history of computer games.

												KSP is a space program sandbox with personality.The core gameplay is solid and improves with every major patch - recent patches seriously improved the aerodynamics for example.The game has some seriously hard parts such as in-orbit rendevous and docking - but there are lots of mods to help with this (MechJeb for example).The best part about this game for me is that it feels like you have achieved something when you first manage to get into orbit, or first manage to get to the Mun.

When you get bored (or if) you can download a mod with a couple of parts and add a whole new element to customize your spaceships like guns or autopilot. Theres alot to do in this game and the best I've done is a damaged science base on duna. Good luck and my kerbal death count is at 137.PS. like any sandbox game this game can crash with too many parts being used in your ship.			",64,8,0,13,14,2,25

Not land on the Mün or anything. Just go in to space. And it keep being awesome to this day with the great support it has gotten from it developers.

								A must have for space/rocket fans!KSP provides a large set of components and functionality with a relatively bug-free simulation of physics. I've read reviews mentioning repetitive crashes or the lack of Steam Workshop integration, I personally had 2 KSP crashes in all my game time (77 hours) so that is fairly alright. The mod installation is as simple as putting the mod folder into your GameData folder, that's it.Talking about mods, the mod support seems to be great. I've never looked into modding it myself, but since there are mods adding mineable ressources to planetoids or doing complete mapping scans from certain orbits there is a lot of room there :)Who do I recommend this to?""Engineers"": People that like to Trial&Error in games, that like taking challenges and eventually mastering them. In KSP, the difficulty of these challenges depends on you (i.e. sending two rockets with station segments into orbit or try it in one turn, which is more cost efficient etc etc)""Organizers"": People that love doing stuff as calculating orbits (orbital period, ""best suitable inclination"" and so on), Thrust-To-Mass Ratios and all the tons of numbers you find in rocket science :P""Pilots"": People that have fun with coordinating a vessel in space near a fragile station to it's docking port ;)Most of you will be all three of them, but interestingly you can lay your focus on whichever you want.Also the humor of the game is amazing, so from my side:A BIG YES to Kerbal Space Program!(PS: If you decide to buy it now, check out Scott Manley's KSP tutorials.

								KSP is awesome. You can maintain a space agency yourself, designing rockets that explode on the launchpad to complex rockets that take a Kerbal to a distant dwarf planet. It's immensive, fun and gives lots of satisfaction when you have successful missions.Now it includes upgrades to your space center. This adds another level of complexity, as you must manage the economy of your agency.			",107,11,0,14,12,0,19

								One of the best simulation games out there, by far better than pretty much any other space sim game I've found. Beats the Buzz Aldrin new release by galaxies. Devs are responsive, mod community is great. Even great guys on Twitch streaming how to do things. This is just in beta now but it has so much you can do and with the mods out there you can quite literally make it as easy or hard as you want. Want to worry about life support? Sure! Want to have nasty heat reentry problems? there's a mod for that! And they keep adding some of the best mod elements to the game as well, and are constantly improving it. I recommend this to anyone almost. Sure no shooting but they do have a mod out there that lets you build things with bombs and the like and there /is/ a multiplayer mod so maybe? Ha!I'd say it isn't rocket science but it is! But it is accessable rocket science. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Have you even thought, ""man i wanna go to space yo"". Don't lie, you have.Kerbal Space Program here says, ""ye man you can go do whatever in space yo""Both beginners and advanced players can easy start out in this game. It's simple, stick rockets on some capsule and press space. Or, y'know, create a multistage rocket that docks to a space station orbiting the planet to refuel and then land a science rover on the far away planet, and then create a return mission in order to recover the science found on the body and use it to further your research. Easy. I mean, it's only rocket science, right?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hours of fun and you'll learn the basics of space travel and rocketry, As you join the Kerbals in exploring space take control of the space agentcy and you slowly devalope the space programe. Build and take full control of the rockets and crafts, build space stations and planetary bases, and bring you kerbanuts back alive.Basicly it's a CRASH couse in Space and rocketry. two thumbs up and good for all ages.

								I'm a space enthusiast. I saw a video about KSP which depicted it as a silly and unrealistic game that made fun of serious efforts to explore space. Thankfully, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to give the game a go. I'm glad I did.This is a game where I can design, build and fly spacecraft designed any way I like. The game is set in a fictional solar system filled with analogues of planets and moons of our own solar system. I can recreate past and present missions, learning how to land on KSP's Moon analogue, or construct and dock with a space station of my own design. I can also act out proposed future missions by visiting KSP's Mars analogue or other planetary body analogues.The game is not yet fully mature. We do not yet have realistic re-entry heating. We are not yet able to establish bases to utilise in-situ resources. These features are in development and will be implemented in due course. The next feature we are eagerly awaiting is an overhaul of aerodynamics and implementation of payload fairings and cargo bays.KSP is realistic without being inaccessible. I'm currently on 1434 hours played without installing any mods.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												People always talk about making games that are both fun and educational, lets be honest, most fail for one reason or another, not Kerbal! Kerbal space program, Coming in I didn't even understand how much I didn't know about orbital mechanics! But Kerbal space program unravels these secrets in a paced and comprehensive order and most importantly, its fun while doing it. Everything from the designing the rocket to performing the actual mission, you don't get near space the first few tries but you feel yourself improving every time, and every stage feels awe inspiring. My first Apollo style moon landing was a highlight to my summer for the sense of acomplishment it entailed. Even faliure can be fun, run out of fuel to early? mess up your design and realize after you make it to Duna?(mars), figure out what parts of the mission are salvageable, what science can still be performed. My first mission to Duna ran out of fuel before making into orbit but I was able to use the rotation control rockets to alter my path just enough to fling around its moon and slam into Dunas thin atmosphere to slow myself down. It's that kind of clever problem solving that brings the most satisfaction sometimes.			",39,5,0,3,5,1,3

								The more I play this game, the more I love it. Really, not enough good things can be said about this game. On the surface, it's cute and funny. Go a little deeper and you will find a surprisingly complex and intelligent space simulator, where you will learn something new every time you play it. Honestly, I'd pay twice the price for this much fun. $22.99 is a steal, and 300 hours in, I'm looking at 7 cents per hour for a hell of a good time. The mod community is also very vibrant and adds literally anything you can imagine: new paint jobs, altered physics, communication, fusion-powered engines, warp drives, hyperspace, and even asteroids. Seriously, give this game a shot. You won't regret it.			",356,112,7,40,86,1,76

												This game is very unique and extremely fun. It is very challenging, but also extremely satisfying when you accomplish something. In addition, it quite expands your knowledge about physics.There is no other game like this, but in some ways it bears similarities to Dwarf Fortress - both games have sharp learning curve, are extremely difficult beyond the very basics (albeit KSP is pretty forgiving) and the lesson you learn from them is that losing is fun. KSP simulates physics very well, it includes objects burning when reentering atmosphere, different gravity on various bodies, and the whole solar system is actually simulated (planets and asteroids orbiting Sun, moons orbiting planets), while the game is a sandbox allowing you to do whatever you want. Do you want to fly to the Moon? Sure. Do you want to do research on an asteroid? Sure. Do you want to take that asteroid down  to Earth? Sure! (But it's not gonna be easy!)Oh, and you do actually learn some physics in the game. You have to. This, however, lets you understand space exploration and why is it so difficult and takes so much time. After all, in KSP you get to do a lot of stuff yourself!The game doesn't have any drawbacks either. Perhaps some rare bugs or crashes, but very few. Other than that, the game is flawless.It's not just the best space game. It's actually one of the best games ever made. I recommend it to literally everyone. Download a demo to try it out first and fly to the Moon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I came to this came on the wave of Reddit hype a few years ago since then, I have: put it down, deleted, reintalled, flung mice around my room, printed off screenshots and actually shouted in triumph upon landing on the Mun.The worth of a game, a film, of art in general comes down to the emotional response it elicits. KSP has caused me actual ♥♥♥♥ing trauma, total euphoria, crushing despondancy, childlike wonder, intellectual overreach and many other feelings beyond mere words.Building a rocket, blowing up said rocket on the launch pad, fixing the staging, running out of fuel before circularising, consulting our Lord Scott Manley, circularising, achieving orbit and just staring out the window at tiny Kerbin before burning retrograde and coming back home. To recommend this game, is to recommend the spectrum of life's emotions.			",117,33,0,12,23,0,17

								If you are even slightly considering buying this game, then stop thinking and just do it. You will spend countless hours hurling Kerbals at the stars and hoping they'll stick.One caveat though; the secret knowledge of prograde and retrograde, apoapsis and periapsis, radial and normal, is hard-won and not for the faint-hearted. You will fail, gloriously, many many times. You will rejoice over every successful burn, and agonise every time you send a hapless Kerbal spinning off into the infinite night.

With a massive and very active moding community, the only limitation is your imagination.Recently added was the career mode, where you start off with limited parts to build with and you have to venture forth doing science experiment to aquire science points to unlock new or improved parts.

								Kerbal Space Program managed to do something that many games are unable to do, they can make me come back to it after being forgotten in 6 months.This game is ludicrously fun, it's got education in it aswell, you can fly rockets to the outer rim of the Kerbol System, Fly SSTOs to docking stations and then proceeding to land in the arctic, Drive rovers over mountains and make sucky boats unless you put Vac. Co. Air intakes on the under side of it, all of these things can be simple or ridiculously complicated (As in, you build a spaceplane, it looks awesome and when you put it on the runway, you start the engines only to find that the plane does the immelmann maneuver and crashes into the ground in a fireball as soon as it gain flight.)There are also a lot of very well hidden easter eggs on other planets that are really hard to find without some videos giving you co-ordinates, one of the easier easter eggs is the monolith near the Space Center, it appears to be nothing more than a dot at a distanceYou can succeed in this game and feel greatly achieved, with getting all them new modules with the science that you're going to get, or you can fail miserably and have a massive laugh with the 100 megatons worth of volatile kerosene going all over the place, destroying whole parts of the Space Center, until eventually a hell kraken comes and snatches you into space (This a bug that blacks out the screen and frazzles the altimeter)Straight 10/10 for me and likely many others			",11,1,0,0,5,0,2

If you are interested in space travel, and astrophysics, try this game!You might learn something. Or, if you are already an expert, you can see with your own eyes how these things really work. Of course, not everything is modelled perfectly, for example, you don't have to worry about the heat during re-entry, the aerodynamic drag works in a kind of a gamey way, and I can guarantee you that some of your earliest designs are gonna resemble a soft, shaking sausage instead of a rocket, but at the end of the day, you are gonna feel like you just built a real rocket.If you are interested in original, deep, addictive, sometimes awe-inspiring games, TRY THIS GAME!!When your build your first orbit-capable rocket.Your first spacewalk.When you first reach Mün.Your first modular space-station.When you first flip and crash your rover on the surface of another planet.When you learn about the fantastic stuff OTHER PEOPLE can build in this game.Just some of the great moments you'll experience in KSP.The game might look complicated, and yes, you CAN build some pretty complicated stuff, but the learning curve is surprisingly easy, of course watching some youtube videos help a lot. Graphically, it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. Yes, the textures are not really detailed, the models aren't, either, but when you first align your rocket against the Sun so you can only see a silhouette, with your pilot next to it on an EVA, when you drive your Rover through Mün's canyon, or when you turn the lights on on your shiny new space station are as screenshot-worthy moments as anything ever.The building possibilites are endless, especially with the great mods out there. Of course, so are the possibilities to explode right at the launch pad. ;)Seriously, try this game, playing KSP is one of the most special experiences any game can give.EDIT: Oh, and don't be bothered by the fact that it's still Early Access, the game is constantly evolving, and felt like a finished game even months ago.

								I bought this game, I don't know, a week ago, I've already put 60 hours into it and loved every minute. It's seriously amazing. There's incredible freedom in sandbox mode, you can design nearly anything you can imagine, as long as you can make it work within the constraints of the physics engine. Worth it! The developers haven't abandoned it either, they're still updating it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KSP is a game in which you run a space center, build spacecrafts, launch them and fly them to explore the Kerbin system. Your space empire could be built on a plethora of crew sacrifice, and it will be tedious process to learn to fligth freely. But nothing could bring you so much sense of achievement than standing on the soil of other celestial objects. Only the most intellectual and hardworking one will be awarded.The most attracting portion of this game is building mindblowing spacecrafts and flying them in the space. When you play in career mode, you will have to consider whether it could fly your crew members back to Kerbin safely and whether you could afford it. Every spacecraft is a essense of your mind and your knowledge about astronomy, physics, aerodynamics, etc.10/10 Play this game and kill Jedebiah again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is seriously one of the greatest creations of the modern era. Design, build and fly your rockets into space, the moon and beyond. With multiple planets and accompanying moons to explore. Build space stations like the ISS or a moonbase, all with docking capabilities. Then take your little Kerbals out for a space walk and plant flags at your landing sites. With a massive and very active moding community, the only limitation is your imagination.Recently added was the career mode, where you start off with limited parts to build with and you have to venture forth doing science experiment to aquire science points to unlock new or improved parts. You can then build bigger and better vessels, so you can go further and do MORE SCIENCE!!You buy this game right now!			",205,27,8,26,45,4,54

								You can spend hours and hours on this game, This is a really fun game and its not at all rocket science but it does require a bit of learning, took me ane entire day to learn how to land on the mun, then next thing you know I was learning how to leave our solar system, with some mods added and some more work I was able to build monstrous space ship in career mode, my advice is to invest in science and launch to space far!looking forward to more update in this game, need more aesthetic overhaul to the planet and MOAR PLANETS!If you do want to play this game and you're really bad, theres a mod called mechjeb, it will play the game for you, if you're lazy it'll do it for you too. The game is playable by anyone even if you don't understand basic rocket science. Though the elites will frown on you don't let that put you down.+ Build your own rockets+ Build space planes+ Rovers check+ Base on planets check+ Refueling station check+ Diverting asteroids Check+ Great gameplay rocket simulation fun+ Hours and Hours of fun+ You can build space stations, big rockets, fuel stations, even lunar stations Hell you can even build a rover and space shuttle.+ Its not rocket science+ Build rockets YOUR way+Amazing mods going on for this game- A bit steep learning curve, takes time to understand at least a day, and more learning to grasp the concept you'll be educated well. This is a negative if you hate learning- Need more aesthetic overhaul, mods help but the game needs that itself- Need more planets  than just ours, space is big and it should be bigger			",810,183,33,104,81,7,110

								My most rewarding gaming experience ever comes from rescuing one of my kerbals, trapped on the Mun after a routine science mission had a rough landing, damaging the parachutes of the vessel and rendering it incapable of returning to Kerbin. The rescue mission had to be quick as the life support (TAC life support mod) was running out for Jebadiah Kerman. After rendevousing with the damaged ship in a low Munar orbit, the rescue vessel set about returning to Kerbin with much less fuel than planned. It was tooth and nails as the vessel only just managed to deorbit itself, skimming through Kerbin's atmosphere multiple times before finally landing, all astronauts safe.That is the thing about Kerbal Space Program, everyone has a story about the game which they want to tell. You design your own missions- they go well, success! they go wrong, rescue mission! You design ships and redesign them. You plan your missions, and you fly those missions.The game is still being developed and new features are gradually getting rolled out. And if you ever want more, the awesome modding community has you covered, adding♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of more content and gameplay, from extra parts to requiring life support for kerbals or even a connection link for unmanned vessels.P.S. I recommend checking out Scott Manley's youtube videos for tutorials and to just see someone who does awesome things in the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite game. There's so much to do, and so many places to go. A whole  world  solar system of freedom and opportunity awaits!You can play in sandbox, science mode, or career mode. In sandbox mode, you have unlimited funds, and everything is unlocked. In science mode, you have infinite funds, but you need to unlock things with science. In career mode, you have limited funds and science, as well as reputation. You must accept contracts from companies to fund your space program, and progress through the tech tree.The game has in-depth tutorials and a guide, as well as different scenarios to try out. The community around the game is great, and Squad (the company that makes KSP) is great. I have seen them implement many things the community asks for, and even bring modders on to the team to help.Speaking of mods, there exists a plethora to choose from. Whether you want to make your game easier, harder, better looking, more realistic, or crazy, there is a mod for you. They include things from graphics overhauls to aerodynamic overhauls to vast quantities of new parts to autopilot systems you code yourself.The game is both simple and challenging at the same time. It's easy enough to build a rocket, but can you make it fly? Can you get into orbit? How about to the  Moon  Mun? What about  Mars  Duna? The answers may be no at first, but you learn. You slowly understad more and more, and after playing the game for a while, the answer becomes yes. And in that moment, you realize: ""Hey! I know how space works! This is orbital mechanics! And I know how to do it!"" It gives you a wondrous feeling of accomplishment, each time you do something new. That feeling barely fades, as I still feel my heart swell a little every time I land on the Mun.So go ahead, give the game a shot. It may seem daunting, but it's really quite fun -- and deceptively simple.How hard can rocket science be anyway?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal Space Program basically sums up the entire reason as to why I wish I were an astronaut/rocket scientist, and the entire reason as to why there is no way in hell I could ever be one.The game has two modes (as of the time of this writing), Career, and Sandbox.  Sandbox is exactly what it sounds like, minus the cat poop and the lost action figures (never forget you little Anakin!).  In sandbox, you build a rocket ship or a space plane, and you go to space.  Half of the time...  The other half is spent trying to figure out why in the hell did that stage not properly go off, only to realize you didn't actually attach your rockets to that stage...  But anyways, sandbox mode is the mode you play when you want to make a giant ship in a few minutes and fly it into the sun.  Because why?  Because Science!The second mode, Career, is basically ""Here's a couple of pieces, those guys over there are the pilots, see if we can't get this into space.""  The beginning parts are spent mindlessly launching rockets into the ground because you have no idea what you are doing, and when you finally figure out what you're doing, you can have some fun.  In Career, you gain science points for everything you do.  Like, everything...  Such as EVAing a Kerbal while you're still launching, dropping a mysterious goo on the ground, into the water, into space, into orbit, and pretty much anywhere you can drop that goo, you'll get science for it.  You can get science for successful missions, unsuccessful missions, missions that you didn't think could go wrong but did, missions you thought would never be possible but was because who needs logic.This is definitely one of my new favorite games out there.  Although, as much as I'd hate to admit it, this game is MUCH better being played on a controller (or joystick, which is awesome if you can), just because the little fine tuning you have to do can be a pain when using your keyboard.The only complaint I have is that I freaking got Jeb stuck into orbit with no jetpack fuel in Career mode, and he isn't even in the ship anymore, and so the only way I could save him is by very, VERY precise calculations, that I'm too lazy to do and end up just winging it.  I mean, I could just terminate him and he'll respawn eventually, but it's FREAKING JEB!  I CAN'T KILL JEB!So anyways, I hope you found this review helpful, and I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this game to people.  But, I suggest packing enough fuel to get out of orbit, or wait until you have docking ports...  Then you won't end up with Jeb stuck in space...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								How hard could it be? It's only rocket science. If the idea of putting parts to build various flying machines in appealing you you I highly recommend you try this out. It's a got a bit of learning curve but it is worth it. To make things easier on yourself you can skip the in-game tutorials (they mostly confused me) and hop on YouTube instead. Scott Manley has a good tutorial series. This is the link for the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0You'll probably want to at least make some attempts at flying prior to jumping to the videos as a lot of the fun of the game can come from failure and cool explosions... not that you'll have a shortage of those later. Rescue missions on distant worlds make for some amusing challenges.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Still charming, now with extra awesomeness.Construction UI's gotten even more solid and impressive. Flight model and air resistance and heat management are now unremarkably good (that's a good thing).  Many flight controls are still difficult to discover, but the worst of the old flaws are gone (it no longer trains you to rely on the space bar being ""do the next thing"" only to later on make that an insta-lose-but-only-sometimes button). While you're in-game it still won't show you the keyboard shortcuts and you kinda still have to find out about the quicksave key (F5 save, hold-F9 load) yourself before you can go check the keys midflight.  You can't always quicksave.Caveats as of 1.0.2: This game will enthrall you so thoroughly that _hours_ will pass by.  If you don't  quicksave regularly then sooner or later (leaning towards ""sooner"") you'll lose an entire evening's meticulous and irreproducible work.  * Quicksave isn't really for exploring different flight plans, it's for defense against the UI and to a lesser extent some minor bugs. Don't use the hard-mode option that shuts off quicksaves. * Go into the settings input options and shut off the staging function in any but staging mode.  The default setting makes the space bar a pun (but only sometimes): toggle RCS between linear and rotation mode, oh, and also jettison your last engine.  The controls shouldn't be more counterintuitive than orbital mechanics. They really shouldn't. * If you hit the can't-place-a-maneuver-node UI bug, try deleting other maneuvers, farthest away first. That sometimes fixes it for me.Ragdoll Berts and a space program.  Charming, genius, progress requires ambition (it's a sandbox, after all), very demanding but always with clear reason game.  I think this is going to remain my builder of choice for a long time.			",72,19,2,32,24,0,25

It's by far the most solid early access to invest in on steam in my opinion.It may be early access but man is it fun! I have played over 342 hours and it's still fun.The gameplay is fantastic, the modding community is highly active, the development is stready and progresses well. The development team is very responsive and engaged with the community and they even have a history of hiring people right out of the modding community to work on the game with themAll in all this is a great time to chip in on this one, sure it's not all there but everything that is works great and there is plently of content in already.It's growing with every update, and the modding community can definitly keep you happy between updates.Or If your looking for a game for kids, this game is great for that to. No violence, fun, and plently of problem solving to keep there brains thinking, not to mention it will teach them a lot about physics.At the end of the day this is the best and quickest developing early access game I have see on steam yet, and it often goes on sale for around 15 dollers.

												This is the story of Jeb KerminJeb wanted his entire life to become an astronaut. He'd look into the stars each night and think, ""One day."" With the arrival of the new Kerbal Space Program, Jeb didn't hesitate. He was the only willing pilot in the lot that offered to join. Jeb traversed dangerous missions of small hunks of metal launched at high velocities. Jeb endured it all, explosions, heat reaching the thousands of degree. Jeb endured.One day, Jeb was offered a special mission. ""We're gonna get you into orbit."" said the commander.Jeb crawled into the rocket, the rocket of Icarus. Strapping himself into the pod, he prepared the final checks before launching once more into Kermin's sky. As he exited the atmosphere and entered into space, as he had before, Jeb couldn't help but feel worry. Something was not right. Looking at his live orbit map revealed a terrifying sight. Rather than circle Kermin, Jeb was destined to sail straight on...into space. Jeb's heart sank as the engines stopped. He had no fuel.Time passed. Days. Months. Maybe a year. Jeb didn't know. His orbit map revealed finally a circle.A circle around the sun. Jeb had entered space at such a velocity, he missed Kermin's orbit, and rather caught the sun.He was to sail past three different planets, including Kermin, to orbit the sun.Jeb felt no pain. He felt no sadness. Jeb looked on at the flaming ball of gas that was his new home. He smiled, for Jeb had the life he always wanted. To traverse the stars, see the planets.Icarus had succeeded. History repeated.Jeb was with the stars.UPDATE: Years have passed. All electricity in the pod have drained. For seemingly forever, Jeb floated high above the sun in a never ending circle. Tiring of the pod, Jeb prepared to make his mark on history.Jeb strapped on his suit and ejected from the pod. He took a deep breath as he closed his eyes, letting go of the ladder holding him from safety. He drifted away, unsure of his destination. Unable to control himself, Jeb closed his eyes as he soared through the stars, drifting both higher and lower than the mysterious Eeloo, on the farthest reaches of the system.A frozen tear drifted down Jeb's eye as he floated away, never once again seeing another planet. No Kerbin. No Mun. Only the Sun.Jeb was unsure of what would happen. Jeb didn't mind. He would endure. He would survive.Or Icarus would win.TL;DR i messed up trying to orbit kerbin and managed to orbit the sun on accident and jeb's flying all across the entire system. today i told him to abandon his pod and just drift away in space.god bless you jebediah kermin.Pics for anyone interested or don't believe meOrbit map: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/248087970818710036/55ECF3E4067555F056FA6E63A254F1B0840E5CBA/Jeb orbiting the sun: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/248087970821367339/E47FE9B0564285E7F6DE6A599887F237ED1CFE5B/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Whilst still technically in Alpha, I don't think a game has had me coming back to it with every patch this often since Minecraft! Beta release is just around the corner but I do hope they continue to add more things. That's not to say there isn't a lot there already... but the potential is huge!Regarding the game itself... build it, fly it, crash it. Build it again, fly it again, crash it again. Things will go wrong, adjustments will need to be made, and kerbals will get lost in space. It's ok though because that means you can try to rescue them! When that fails, try to rescue both ships at the same time with a bigger ship! In no time you'll have space debris surrounding your home planet, but in the process you'll learn orbital mechanics, docking proceedures and the best landing techniques for the dozens of planets in the system at present. Then there are asteroids too! Give this game a shot, if you don't want to pay out right away I believe there's a demo available from the main website.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you like space, science and space science you'll love this magical little gem of a game. It's *not* easy, which I happen to like. I'm sick of games that I can beat in a matter of hours. Kerbal Space Program is hard - hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥in some cases - and as such it can be incredibly rewarding to land on a new planet, moon, or just build a cool new thing. There are some fairly significant downsides: 1. The tutorials are terrible. Maybe I'm just stupid? I ended up having to figure most of the game out myself and spent tons of time looking things up on YouTube and the game's Wiki. 2. It's a *little* slow to start. Because the controls are a bit obscure at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I ended up playing it immediately after buying it, becoming frustrated and shelving it for about two weeks. But I am *SO* glad I gave it a second chance. 3. There're still some weird bugs, but the KSP team seems quite active in working them out. It's still only just now in beta so bugs are to be expected. Unfortunately the worst one I've encountered managed to corrupt my best saves, forcing me to start over after having a nearly completed tech tree.However I haven't had this problem again in over a month now - maybe it was fixed, maybe I'm just lucky.Anyway, despite these problems, the game is ABSOLUTELY worth every penny and I'm incredibly excited for future content and witnessing the continuing development of this game. Obviously as a video game it's not quite the same thing as actually being an astronaut, an engineer or ground control, but it does give you an entirely new appreciation for what NASA, the ESA, Roscosmos, and any other space agency do every day. It *is* rocket science! Just a touch dumbed down for those of us without Ph.Ds :DBuild all the things.Buy all the Kerbal Space Programs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is very hard to describe as it is one of a kind.I could label it as a space program simulator but that really doesn't do Kerbal Space Program justice.Kerbal Space Program is essentially a game about managing your own space program, building your own rockets, planes, ships, space stations, landers, or any silly contraption you imagine really, and taking your poor victims.. err Kerbals.. to the stars! It runs on a semi-realistic physics and astronomy system where you can see every single part of your ship explode spectacularly as your poor Kerbals show their expressions of despair throughout the ride.This is a game about building and exploring the Kerbal Solar System and each of it's astral bodies, about making silly contraptions and planting flags on unexplored worlds.And if you ever want to go beyond the far reaches of the solar system, there's also a plethora of mods already available for Kerbal Space Program despite it being only in alpha stage... Even a multiplayer mod.I haven't sinked as many hours into a single videogame for a very long time as I did with Kerbal Space Program.This is Rocket Science the videogame and is an ABSOLUTE MUST!WARNING SIDE-EFFECTS:You will learn a few concepts of aerodynamics, physics and astronomy just by having fun!

								This is an excellent physics based sandbox game.  Currently, it doesn't have much of a story line or much of a directive beyond ""go to space, do research, get science, research things and go to space again.""  Yet it is still extremely fun, better if you come up with your own planned program.If you don't have a very decent grasp of astrophysics (or even physics in general) then expect to get one if you stay committed to the game. Takes awhile to get used to, but once you do, you'll never go back.I highly suggest having at least 4gb of RAM is you intend to mod this game though, otherwise you will taste the rainbow.

								Kerbal Space Program is one of my favorite games. If you are somewhat of a space fan and want to actually build your own rockets, this game is for you! I have spent countless hours in this game, even before it was on Steam. I always wanted somesort of space game where you build your own rockets and take them to space and potentialy other planets, and when I found this game in its early stages, I knew that this whas the game that I dreamed of. I came across this game about 2 years ago by now and even then I coudnt believe the quality of the game even though it was only in version .15. If you are new to the game there are tons of tuorials by now on YouTube, I came across Kurtjmac, he is a awesome YouTuber and so is Scott Manley. Anyways, this game is really fun and I really recommend it, and knowing that there is still alot of developent ahead, I cant wait.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is really awesome, if you are into space exploration the non-fictional way.Your imagination is not limited.You can practically send anything into space or on other celestial bodies.This is, if it is able to leave the surface of your home planet without exploding... ;-)Most people like to play the game just for fun, sending rockets and crews up into orbit or to the Mun (the moon of the planet Kerbin, where your Space Center is located).You can gather science there to either way collect data or enhance your research of new technologies and rocket-/plane-parts, if you play career-mode (rather then sandbox mdoe, where you already habe all parts) or you can just do it FTW!Be warned the learning curve is pretty steep, which means you will have some hard lessons to learn, until you really pull of your first spaceflight.Nontheless this should not hinder you in downloading the DEMO first and try out if you have the guts to send ""Kerbal""s into space or not. ;-)Kerbals are the little eggheads doing funny facial expressions to the right lower screen.The most famous is Jebediah Kerbin (aka Jeb).He will be your first voluntary (test-)pilot.This game is for all ages and space enthusiast, who see more in the sky, then shining lights in the nightsky... ;-) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The mechanics are solid, the graphics aren't too rough considering the game's scale, and there is a vibrant and diverse modding community.Easily one of the best gaming purchases you can make, as long as you don't mind days of your life being consumed by the need to put little green men into space.

												KSP is wonderful, unique, difficult, confusing, elating and all manner of other things bundled up into a deep and long-lasting package. The core of the game is all about building space-rockets, and flying them to the furthest reaches of the Kerbal solar system. Sounds fun eh! Just be aware that this is not some arcade-game were you can just shoot oversized fire-crackers into space. KSP is a full-blown space-program simulation.The upshot of this is that building rockets that really work is hard. If you want to succeed at KSP, you're going to have to spend a lot of time and effort getting to grips with how the simulation works, and in the process you're going to have to learn at least the very basic aspects of physics and even rocket-science that underpin this game.Sound daunting? It is, and in many ways that is the beauty of this game. At first you'll fail and fail hard. You'll build rockets that have no business being in the air, let alone venturing into space. You'll loose Kerbins to the deep void as you run out of fuel or otherwise mess up.But, spend some time reading the community guides, watching some YouTube vidoes on the principles of flight and you'll start to get the hang of things. You'll manage to launch a rocket into stable orbit and return it to Kerbin. Next you'll find yourself landing on one of the two moons that orbit Kerbin. And then from there, the challenges grow.The one down-side to this game is that it really does not contain the information needed to teach you how to play it. You cannot just 'wing it' when it comes to building rockets. In order to get past the most crude stages possible, you're either going to have to already be well trained in physics at degree level, or you're going to have to venture outside of the game and find the information you need to calculate the all important variables you're going to need to build successful rockets.Do I recommend this game? Yes, provided you're up for spending some serious time and effort getting to grips with it. There is nothing else quite like it, and you can learn a lot of interesting real-world physics while learning to play this. It's not, however, a game that will appeal to those looking for more instant fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kerbal has a steep learning curve, but once you've figured out the mechanics, the reward of plotting out & achieving a goal is one the best experiences I've had in gaming in years!In the space of 40 hours, I started off barely managing to launch a rocket several thousand feet into the air. Now I'm fully capable of being able to both create a space faring craft & plot a course to recover a stranded astronaut circling around the orbit of the Mun (Kerbal's moon) over several million miles away.This isn't even scratching the surface of future possibilities I could attempt. I could perform a moon landing. Lift & place a space station into a stable orbit or travel to several of the other planetary bodies in the solar system.Much like an advanced 'Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts' there's very little hand holding with a bare minimum of instruction of how to perform any of these outrageous feats. It takes the right combination of a well designed vessel, a correctly plotted route of orbital eclipses, skillful piloting & finally luck. Once you have all these, it's not long before you're complimenting yourself on a job well done & planning out what your next grand project is going to be.With charming & fluid presentation, extensive & encouraged mod support, atmospheric soundtrack & both career plus sandbox mode included. There's very little this game does wrong.You'll be doing yourself a disservice not giving this game a go!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

KSP is a brilliant little game for everyone from clueless cosmo-naughts to astrophysicists. It's also remarkably versatile, so boats, rovers, and planes are all things too. The mechanics are solid, the graphics aren't too rough considering the game's scale, and there is a vibrant and diverse modding community.Easily one of the best gaming purchases you can make, as long as you don't mind days of your life being consumed by the need to put little green men into space.

 I've seen hundereds of successes....   Thousands of falliures.....   And millions of kerbal funerals..... But seriously where the ♥♥♥♥ is the fuel when you need it?################ SERIOUS REVIEW ###################################So i've been playing this game for hours on end (On this account anyway ¬_¬ ) And i can tell you, You will learn more about space, physics and the most efficient way of killing little green men (And women +1.0.0) Than you ever could learn in school!It's difficult at first, But if you can master it, It is the most fun game you can ever play.Just the sensation of landing on the moon for the first time is just one to die for. Better than anything else.As someone who absolutely LOVES space and would literally kill to see it, I cannot recommend this game enough. 9/10  -  Needs actual kerbal scream sound effects.

								Kerbal Space Program, this has to be one of my favorite games of all time! If you have ANY sort of fascination for space, then this is the game for you! You build any rocket, however you like, then shoot it into space, hoping things go for the best. You may build a very realistic rocket, or a monstrosity of science! The maneuvers you commit in this game are very realistic to what NASA would do in space in real life. The game is both very realistic, and very comical at the same time!Crashes and scared astronauts are included!I highly reccomend it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								All I can really say about Kerbal Space Program... Havent you ever wanted to kill little green men throught a alien space program? If you do, this game provides endless fun through hours of addictive playing. If you don't like to kill little green men, this is an awesome game were you build space craft and test them with trial and error.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								KSP might honestly be the best sandbox game I have ever played.  Everyone seems to make comments about this games steep learning curve, but the reality of it is, while you are struggling trying to figure out the controls and dynamics of this game, you are probably having a load of fun blowing rockets up and watching your little green men screaming in horror (except for Jebediah, who is always cheering).  Nothing about this games learning curve is a deterrent.  It admittedly took me a couple hours to get the hang of things myself.  But while I was learning, I was having a lot of fun just messing up stuff and laughing at how quickly (or slowly) my launch fell apart.  Now that I feel I have ""mastered"" space docking and world landings, I'm still finding tons of new things to do, explore and try to recreate.  Also, the physics in this game are spot on, all the way through.  Its amazing how much learning this game really seems like it can provide.  I highly recommend this to all.  KSP is addictive, fun, and hilarious.KSP is still in early access.  So there is a lot of new content still coming out, and the community for this game is great.  Some of the community mods I've used have really blown me away.  This game is only going to get more awesome moving forward.  Buy this game and thank me later.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you don't know anything about the space program or orbit maneuvers, this is a hilariously fun game of attempting to build rockets and often causing massive explosions while your cute little green pilots scream on in horror (except for Jebediah, who is cheering all the way). Laugh at your new build, where you've strapped on dozens of boosters, and be rolling on the floor during launch as you watch everything slowly (or, quickly) fall apart.If you know vaguely of the space program and think learning something about how to get things into space will be fun, this is a science kit in a box. Have all the fun above, plus you'll learn what ""freefall"" and ""orbit"" and ""retrograde"" really mean with hands-on experience. Relive the Apollo missions to the moon (or for Kerbals, the Mun), simulate real NASA missions (or try to and learn much as you stay up all night trying to make your rocket fly correctly). Addictive, cute, and fun.If you've mastered space docking and other-world-landing in other games, you'll still appreciate the excellent physics and the cute take on what is often a difficult genre to break into. The physics are all there and are quite good- you could teach a class using many of the features even in this early beta. With community mods, the physics get even better (or crazier, as you wish). Fans have even programmed automated burn correction programs so you can do a professional job. Calculate delta-vee and puzzle as your probe lands precisely where it was supposed to based on your mathematical calculations- in a game featuring cute bobble-headed green men.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a steep learning curve but once you give it time and start to understand how it all comes together you will fall in-love with it.It is like a rocket scientist decided to make a game one day probably while waiting to build the next breakthrough rocket ship, that or waiting on a new budget to come through. ;)Seriously there is so many things nested into this game it would take many playthroughs just to even scratch the surface of just what all you can do! For example my first few hours was just trying to figure out how to build a simple rocket but oh man was it fun.I highly recomend this game to everyone who is a space game junky like myself, you will not regret it at all... :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is Absolutely INCREDIBLE! This need to be the precurser to Space engineers. I have been playing for quite some time and still the prospect of making it to the mun seem absolutely unachieveable, let alone the rest of the solar system. This game has a tonne of hours in gameplay, complex game mechanics, and it gives you a reason sense of joy when you make you first sucessfull orbit around the planet (which I recently did). I can't want to get a move on so I can start playing it on harder difficulties, which I'm sure will make me want to throw myself in front of a bus... which for me means it's going to be awesome! I suggest this to anyone who likes free building games that have a bit more direction and goal oriented playing. I'm a huge space engineers fan and this fits RIGHT in for me. ",92,18,0,8,21,0,18

								I have followed Kerbal Space Program for a long time and it has gone from a good game to epic! It's tricky to master but you are rewarded every step of the way and it's not even final release! My favourite single player game of all time.Now ver1 is out! Wow... what can I say, it's better than I could have hoped for. Everything that makes KSP so special has been fused together with epicness. I fail to see how you can not love it, the cute little green men, the disasters, the sucess and true freedom. Go whereever you like, build what ever you want, fail, suceed and just have too much fun. If KSP was a drug it would be tobacco. I have to remind myself it's just a single player game because it sits up there with the best games of all time not just single player games.Beauty: Every player who playes KSP will have a different path to sucess or failure. There is no right way in KSP, you build what you can to get the job done. Trial and error and even with 2000+ hours on KSP I have not built the perfect rocket because there is no perfect. If you forget an antenna or a parachute etc your mission will fail but this is how you learn.As for the new ver 1 mining stuff 10/10 it's just so polished as a game I cant praise the game enough, fantastic+epic!

												Before play KSP I have no ideas how hard it is, to design something that is able to go to the space and come back in one piece.Exploration is human's nature, our curiosity drive us into the deep space imagining what will be waiting for us. Well, lucky you, if you are a science nerd, rocket fetish, got a lot of A plus on you Physic's examinations, KSP is the perfect game for you to spend some time for a adventure. From my experience, KSP has no flaws, apparently my expertise aspects are limited to artistic titles, video games,game designs. For science, I'm not even an amateur but if you ask me if there are any features that I wish was in the game or will be added, I would like see more solar systems and most importantly flora and fauna.So far my suggestions seems intriguing, but there's a problem for gamer who wish to see faster results, if so,I warn you that you won't go further into the game. That will be a waste of money, in my opinion. KSP has some necessary built in tutorials but that won't be enough for someone like me, amateurs, to get into orbit. Don't worry, that doesn't mean we are just going to watch others building fancy things. There is a joke about KSP, whoever ask a question in KSP community thousands reply ""Scott Manley""! Luckily we have our self a mentor on Youtube to teach us all the essentials that is required to ""enjoy"" the game. Assuming you are an amateur like me, whichever mode you started you will either get overwhelmed by all the parts that is displaying in front of you and you can't even make a damn thing out of them, or you are staring at a 4 or 5 parts and you have no ideas where this is going. If you are not a patience gamer, KSP can only be a cheap fun, you build some weird aircraft and spacecraft, fly around, click some buttons. Then KSP is definitely not a game for you and that's why spend times watching Scott Manley's tutorial is required.I had a hard time to learn the essentials, but Scott Manley is professional enough if you pay attention to his lessons. Most of the gamers will probably think, why the heck do you need to learn to play a game? Well KSP provide a strong realistic feelings (career mode), gravity, weight, budgets, design possibly everything that is related to build a spacecraft in real life is in this game. You can play it casually but you won't fully dig into this game. Failure will be inevitable, especially to people like me, I know very little things about spacecrafts, going through atmospheres, get overheated, can't even lift off the ground, can't return to ground, can't make a round orbit, suck at rescue mission, can't go to ""moon"". These frustrations are necessary but will eventually beat you, and you will rage quit. I remember I was doing a rescue mission where there are 3 astronauts need to be saved in low orbits, I successfully extract all of them but I got overheated and exploded when returning to ""Earth"". I spent merely 6 hours on that mission and yes, I didn't save it.Overall, KSP is a high quality space simulator, and a lot of potentials for you to discover, forgot to mention that KSP fully supporting mods which make this game even better! I do suggest you play the original game first then try some new mods. KSP gave me a lot of good memories, the moment that I reach the ""moon"", the moment that I reached north pole, you really feel that all that efforts worth it and it is so thrilling and satisfying to achieve something in KSP. That's what makes this game so special, after I became a decent player, I started to realize why conquering space is not that easy, as the title says. A true experience about learning and practicing space and aero technologies that you will feel. Highly recommended! TO SPACE!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Even with the seemingly impossible challenges, and even harder choice of buying a game that might not seem worth it, I recommend it fully. There's so much for you to do on this game, with its realism, and the hundreds of parts it tosses at you when you open the VAB or Spaceplane Hanger. The planets, moons, and asteriods each have their own challenges and perks that differ from the rest. For example, Duna is farther from Kerbin than the Mun, but Duna has an atmosphere, which allows gliders and rocket planes to fly. The rocket parts and aerodynamics are nothing less than amazing, with engines that benifit and hinder you, fuel tanks that carry diffrent fuel sizes, muiltiple prepulsion methods and more. Not interested in rockets? Well, you got a full hanger with airplane parts choking the catalog. You can still aim for space, however, as it still supplies you with rocket parts, in whice you turn planes into SSTOs (single stage to orbit FYI), and vice versa. The exploration factor is nothing less than infinity. You got 7 planets, most of them with moons. They all have special chractheristics in which you either hate or love. Me myself,  having been  to EVERY planet and moon in this game, has not tired out yet. Why? Instead of just exploring, you can colonize and conquer. You got docking ports, which leads you to massive space stations. You can build bases on explored planets to supply fuel or power to passing ships. This game is truly amazing, even the slightest of space geeks will have fun in this. I recommend it fully 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								There's nothing I can say about this game that hasn't already been raved about by thousands of other people...It's the most polished Early Access game you will ever see. KSP will spoil the very concept for you, because after playing it you'll think that Early Access is just a great way to get already-awesome games at a discount. No. Wrong. The vast majority of Early Access games are severely underdeveloped for even a partial release, and too  often misrepresent how far along they are on the path to completion. Some of them run out of funding or enthusiasm and never even reach completion, or declare ""Mission Accomplished"" and give you a game that falls far below the devs' original expectations and ignores the community's complaints. KSP makes ""Early Access"" into something of a joke, because it's more fun and more functional than anything that Electronic Arts or Creative Assembly have released in the last 10 years. Yeah, not even kidding when I say that.KSP has been a great game that just keeps getting better, and with the start of beta it just goes to another level entirely. Most folks would've been happy with the game as it was a year ago, but Squad is still picking up more and more momentum. They love their project, they're good at what they do, and they're incredibly responsive to the wishes of the KSP community, which is EXACTLY what Early Access is supposed to be about. If you weren't sure from all of the modding community's input that got included in the prior patch, well, here's some more for you. The community interaction is great from every angle, really... Modders get the recognition they deserve, average players get way more than they paid for, and the devs get a game that makes everyone that much happier.People here have mentioned the learning curve before, and it's there, but it's definitely not insurmountable... I know a handful of friends who've just tinkered with the game and gotten into low orbit around Kerbin and called it a day, but they're missing out on the real game. Each new task, each new challenge, requires you to master another skill in addition to properly executing everything else you've already learned. But when you finally get it right? There's a sense of accomplishment that's hard to find in any other game. Getting into orbit, changing orbits, landing, attempting a rendezvous, intercepting a planet that'll take you 6 months just to reach--once you start to string all of it together, the results of your hard work speak for themselves.And like lots of other folks have also said, there's a great sense of accomplishment when you nail a difficult task... but the real hilarity of the game comes from those moments when you get things just a little bit wrong. KSP will satisfy all of your emotional needs. <3But if you're more into stories, here's the highlight reel from my last playthrough after they updated Career Mode...The infamous Jebediah Kerman did most of my early test flights and managed to hog all of the glory. Not to be outdone, Bill Kerman booked a spot to be the first Kerbal to land on the Mun. UNFORTUNATELY, Bill botched the landing and his pod tipped over sideways and couldn't seem to right itself. Now we had a problem--not only was Bill stranded, but we hadn't yet researched a 2+ command pod that would allow for a rescue team.So the heroic Bill Kerman sat in his command pod, on the surface of Mun, eating snacks, for exactly 34 days while we built a ship big enough to take him home and got it to the landing site. We all held our breath as the ship arrived and prayed that Bill was still alive and had enough snacks.Jebediah stole the show again and came to the rescue, and got Bill into their 2-kerbal lander and got them back into space. BUT THEN, something happened.They ran out of gas. Before they got home.The lander collapsed into orbit around Kerbin, with enough fuel to get them off the Mun but not enough to finish the job. So now Bill AND Jeb were stuck in space for another 61 days while we engineered an unmanned ship that could grab them and redirect them to Kerbin's surface. Thankfully, by now, Bill's snacks had been replenished from the latest rescue attempt, and they hunkered down in anticipation of the final rescue attempt.Only... it wasn't the final rescue attempt. Being our first effort at a rendezvous in space, the unmanned ship with the grabby-claw came to within 3km of Bill and Jeb... and then rocketed straight past them into the unknown. It would be almost another month before we set out again.So we sent a SECOND ship with a BETTER grabby-claw, and THIS TIME WE GOT THEM. Our two heroes were yanked from orbit and rocketed home once and for all, splashing down just a short distance from where it all began.*..... This could happen to you. Buy it now.42/10 WILL DEFINITELY RUN OUT OF GAS AGAIN*Story based on real events, see screenshot library for documentation*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing this game since 2011 and since then this game has proven again and again the physics and space travel can be amazing fun. From colonizing the vast outer regions of the Kerbal solar system to screwing around and conrtucting massive starships. There are a vast amount of mods for this game and even mods to add more planets and stars to even further extend your exploration. Mods for mining, colonising and just building the most massive space assault carrier. This game is truly worth its asking price. It has lasted for over 4 years and I believe with the communities support it will be able to last even longer. I love this game. Just seeing Jebediah smile after a crash or even whilst he is crashing is a damn awesome feeling. The satisfaction of you first space station in orbit or you first landing on the moon, then planet then first starship is unmatched.			",119,9,1,10,9,0,7

												Oh my Science....This is... BY FAR....My favorite video game of the current era.Those who know me, know I'm a rabid Fallout and Resident Evil fangirl. I can't call this game my favorite yet (Fallout 2 still has this title by a steady grasp) but KSP is a very close follower.To sum up the entirety of this game in a few phrases or memes....This game = NASA + Lemmings.KSP is hollywood rocket science....collect ALL THE SCIENCE!There are 3 modes of play. The first mode is sandbox. You get all the parts unlocked, you can build anything you can think of, and then explode it marvellously while trying to fire it up into space. The second mode, is Science mode. This unlocks the Tech Tree and the collection of science. Parts are restricted by the Tech Tree, visitable through the R&D building. Collecting science unlocks branches in the Tech Tree. This gives you access to more and more parts, until you're eventually at the end of the tree, and its basically like Sandbox mode. The third is Career Mode. Career is the fully unlocked version of the game, requiring you to balance limited parts (locked behind the Tech Tree, requiring the collection of Science), limited money (Rocket science is expensive! Ships now cost money, and you have limited funding. In order to get more money, you need to complete missions from the Mission Control building), and spontaneous explosive deconstruction.The whole point of the game is to explore the Kerbol system. Its that simple. Build rockets, leave the planet Kerbin (third from the sun Kerbol), and visit all you can. The Kerbol System has 8 planets, Moho (like Mercury), Eve (Venus analogue), Kerbin (Earth-like), Duna (Mars rip-off), Dres (Small planet, light gravity, hard to land on), Jool (Jupiter wannabe), and Eeloo (Pluto if it was a planet!). Each planet has its own special features, moons, things to see, and difficulties in visiting.The game has an INCREDIBLE modding community, which I recommend, and the YouTube community loves making crafts and blowing them up. I VERY MUCH invite you to watch Scott Manley's videos for learning Kerbal science and aerodynamics.... skills needed to blow up much less often than before!The game still has its issues... I commonly find the Hell Kraken or♥♥♥♥♥Kraken (Community known bugs), but this may be due to the mods installed on my game.  The Windows x64 version is horribly broken, but the other versions are great.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been waiting patiently before reviewing this game and finally they released it so i can post my thoughts about it.The idea behind this game is amazing - you get to explore a solar system, build various rockets, pretend to be an engineer, a pilot or an explorer. They've managed to allow as much creativity as it actually possible at this current development level for simulation/strategy game.HOWEVER (it is a big however, i know) before you can actually enjoy anything like building a satellite to orbit around some distant planet, or a two way mission to the Mun - you will either have to learn hours and hours, and hours, and hours, even more hours of youtube tutorials or... cheat.When it comes to tutorials and explaining ""how things work in the game we made"" the developers failed so miserably, so utterly and completely, that you actually have to wonder which audience they intended this game for?Telling a new player to try and land a vehicle near space center - is not a tutorial. Forgetting to mention recently added features like heating and cooling, so they would inevitably burn in the atmosphere is a shocking oversight. Not mentioning how to save up fuel when launching vessels, changing orbits or de-orbiting is just lousy.Bottom line is - there is no comprehensive tutorial in this game whatsoever, no learning curve, no actually useful in game tips, tooltips or explanations on anything. Period.So before you actually can enjoy this game in its fullest (repetitively launching badly designed pieces of crap is just a part of it) - you will have to spend hours learning how the hell you can launch a vessel properly, save fuel, dock, transfer to another object, land, land in different atmosphere, land without an atmosphere, take off, etc. etc. etc.I was expecting them to completely revamp the tutorials and the learning curve - they did not. Because of that i was prepared to thumb it down but i could not. Even though developers clearly do not care about players actually getting into their game and enjoying it without wasting a lot of time - modders do care. There are mods that allow cheating, better parts and complete designs which reduce the difficulty curve significantly. There are also plenty of videos (i recommend Scott Manley) which explain various game aspects in details and manage to be both interesting and educational at the same time. So yeah... while i am very disappointed in developers, the community and modders made this game better, good enough to recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are into space, science, and space travel, this is definitely for you.Build planes, rockets, and shuttles, and blast off on an adventure.Different play modes, including sandbox mode, where you can let your imagination run wild.Build different spaceships, do science projects, or visit other celestial bodies. The choice is yours.Graphics are solid, and the soundtrack fits the environment of the game.The only issue I can see people having is the game can take up a lot of your time, and if you are a busy person, this might not be the game for you, for this reason.Also, some people may find the game a little heavy in the science and math section, so it might be a little more of a steep learning curve for them.Overall great game that you should get if you get the chance.Don't take my word for it, and check out my video by clicking on the link.

												KSP is a great game overall. Easilly the best simulation game I have personally ever played. I also like how this game doesn't take itself too seriously, yeah it's all about rocket science, but the kerbals are ♥♥♥♥in goobers. The mods for this game are great and can really make it an incredibly beautiful game. I've had this game for a few years now after getting it recommended to me and don't regret it at all. The developers were always keeping in touch with the fans throughout the whole process AND THIS GAME ACTUALLY FINISHED. LIKE THEY HAD AN EARLY RELEASE AND ACTUALLY FINISHED THE GAME, WHAT A CRAZY CONCEPT LOOKING AT YOU, EA, UBISOFT, AND EVERY OTHER DEVELOPER I CAN THINK OF). I think the only downside to this game is that the vanilla graphics are kind of cartoonish, even though it is a beautiful game. I highly recommend looking into some mods to improve graphics for the sole reason that space should be detailed and pretty. This game will take some getting used to, however, this is why I recommend looking at the wiki and Scottmanly's videos on YouTube for advice and help. The community for this game is easilly one of the most friendly and supporting community I have seen for any game, check out the subreddit or some of the forums for proof, we all love seeing new and old players post things they achieved or found. If you are a fan of open worlds, immersive gameplay, and cosmic greatness I can't recommend this game enough. I have a whole library of pictures I have taken from this game and they are worth more to me than some of the games in my library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After having played this extensively in the beta, and now adding plenty of time to that post release from early-access, really all that can be said is how amazingly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed wonderful this game is.Underneath what can only be descibed as a charming, humurous exterior lies an incredibly deep, physics based strategy game that basically leaves you to it. You will fail to get a ship in to orbit dozens of times before you ever make it into space, but that's purely because you haven't figured it out yet, which, when you do, makes it so much more rewarding.Each small step makes way for a bigger step, and then an even bigger step, until you're exploring the entire solar system, putting stations in orbit around far-flung gas giants and somehow managing to make a return trip to the surface of Eve. At the same time, you learn so much about space exploration - when was education ever remotely this fun?A thoroughly amazing game and very much worth of much of your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Stimulating, rewarding, enjoyable. KSP provides a Solar System and space technology similar to Earth's. Career mode gives an excellent context for performing ""experiments""(go to place X and press button Y) to unlock better or different spaceship components, and has the freedom to let you choose what to attempt first, or go on free mode. Building a craft and putting it in orbit, going on to land a probe/rover/lander to a planet/moon feels fufilling. On the way doing spacewalks, crew reports, atmosphere/space experiments. It's a very involving game, solving the problems of how to reach a planet, slow down and land on it, and then get back. Ontop of being a fun game, KSP provides an easy way to grasp the concepts of space travel, and it's not overly complicated. Just pick the right parts, and fire your rocket at the right time and direction to get somewhere. Suffers a stuttering issue for many people, but it's not a gamebreaker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal space program is a physics sandbox space simulator. You can build ships or planes using individual parts such as engines, fuel tanks, solar panels etc. Planets are almost realistically sized and so is the space between them. You can build space stations, send probes to intercept the moon or some how build a manned base on the gas giant 'Jool'. If you ever get bored of the game then you can visit the space port website where you can download hundreds of modifications to the game, including physics changing ones!			",61,7,1,1,14,0,6

												With 80 hours invested into this game I can safely say it's amazing!KSP is an open sandbox space exploration simulator. Your role is a director that oversee the whole operation from fund management, hiring test dum- qualified astronauts, and building your ship design to hopefully reach space and beyond.Story wise this game doesn't have one. They career mode which is decent but it requires alot of grinding to unlock technology to advance your ship. As of my review this game has plenty of content but not enough interactive options. Such as my kerbals stats didn't much at all, no recoloring, or real purpose of exploration other then saying you did What this game lack is backed by a healthy molding community that put a sense of purpose to explore for resource, new ship design and energy source, and weapons!This game is abut trail and error. One mistake can cost a whole mission and most of my botch up mission ended a satisfying ball of fire and explosion. ProsEasy setup and understandExtreme replay valueConstant updatesExploration is satisfyingHealthy molding community ConsPlanet exploration has no real purpose without modsLack of customization other then shipsOverallPick up this game now, it is worth it at full price. This game to me spawn the whole idea of vehicle biudiling simulator with a purpose or mission.MSRP: $39.99Recommend Pick up Price: $39.99, and donate to Development! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								  A review that should have come a long long time ago.  What can I say about Kerbal Space Program other than buy it.   Buy a copy for yourself, buy copies for your family memebers, and buy copies as gifts for your friends.     Hands down the best money on entertainment I have ever spent.  I've spent more hours than I care to admit to playing this gem of a game and in addition to the sheer joy and feelings of accomplishment this game gives its users you will also find yourself learning a ton about orbital mechanics in a fun and exciting way.   That feeling of accomplishment is so core to the Kerbal Space Program experience.  I can't think of a single KSP player who doesn't have a first docking story or loads of screenshots/videos from their first landing on another planet.  The list is endless with this game.    Another great part of the KSP experience is the community here and on the main forums.  The mod community is large and very active.  Mods for this title will blow you away!!!  So much so that some mods were swallowed up by the developers and the mod developers now work along side Squad.    If you have not yet bought this game I invite you to download the demo here on Steam or from www.KerbalSpaceProgram.com  After downloading the demo hit Youtube and grab some popcorn for the hours upon hours of tutorials and general fun surrounding this game.  If your anything like me it won't take but 5 minutes in the demo before you instantly see the value of this game.    Click buy!!!  You will not regret your purchase!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have decided to edit my review, in light of (a TON) of new content since i last posted.------------Is the game fun:... its basically a drug.is it easy?: no.  not at all. in fact this will be the biggest issue people have with the game. while Dark souls is hard in a ""quick reflexes or death"" kind of way.... KSP is hard in a ""omg i dont understand this, what on earth is a Pe and DeltaV?!"" kind of way. One of the biggest issues new people to this game have is that well.... its rocket science. and most of us didn't walk into this game with a couple degrees. (though i feel like i could get one walking out)as a result there has been a huge disconnect for many people between the ""what i need to know to enjoy this"" and ""what i actually know right now"". amd this has caused many people to not enjoy there experience, or to quit the game altogether. Now with version 1.1, this issue has been addressed with an in game ""wiki"" if you will.  the rocket science 101, the up goers guide to the galaxy. and man did they hit it out of the park. not only is it super detailed.... i mean like, detailed enough that despite having 1500 hours logged in game on steam alone (dont judge me) i was still able to learn something i didn't know flipping its pages. but it is implemented in a way that makes it not only easy to access, and easy to use.... but basically screams ""use me"". right down to having a built in pause game button into the wiki, so you have the option of flipping a few pages on route to kill time... or to pause the game in a panic as you try to figure out why your 1 rocket just became 5.and yet, with all of that, its still super easy to follow.  I am glad they have finally cast away that looming shadow that has haunted this game for years and fixed one of the last real issues this game faced.and if you are wondering, yes.... the rest of the game is amazing too.

This is by far the best space simulation game ever made, but forget space combat : the only fight will be your limited knowledge about space newtonian physics.The base game is very fun, and evolves with every new version in a most satisfying way. Then you can add community Plugins, and gods there are many good ones ! Create a communication network to pilot your probes around the solar system. Map the planets and asteroids to prepare your ground missions. Do science. Then create a gigantic asteroid mining base, a fuel reloading orbital station, and drive your ships even further on distant celestial objects.You will have to deal with the limitations of your science at the beginning to fulfill your contracts, but the more science you unlock, the further you will be able to go in your space odyssey.

												This game is amazing. There was a bit of a learning curve to figuring out the specifications needed for a space ship to reach its target, but with a little reasearch on orbital mechanics and rocket design,  designing rockets became easier. It's such a satisfying feeling when you finally acomplish missions that took hours of hard work, I've even had to pull out the old pen, paper and FE approved calculator a few times while playing this game.

If your anything like me it won't take but 5 minutes in the demo before you instantly see the value of this game.    Click buy!!!  You will not regret your purchase!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You know nothing about space.Don't you believe me?Try to reach the moon.Did you fail?Right, because you know nothing about space... yet...I'm in SPAAAaace ! This is by far the best space simulation game ever made, but forget space combat : the only fight will be your limited knowledge about space newtonian physics.The base game is very fun, and evolves with every new version in a most satisfying way. Then you can add community Plugins, and gods there are many good ones ! Create a communication network to pilot your probes around the solar system. Map the planets and asteroids to prepare your ground missions. Do science. Then create a gigantic asteroid mining base, a fuel reloading orbital station, and drive your ships even further on distant celestial objects.You will have to deal with the limitations of your science at the beginning to fulfill your contracts, but the more science you unlock, the further you will be able to go in your space odyssey.

								I can honestly say this is one of the most enjoyable games recently developed that I have ever seen. A steep learning curve means progress can be slow and difficult, but overcoming challenges become all the more rewarding as a result. You have the options to build spacecraft that are simple, complex, brilliant, insane, or a combination of all four. Then you get to fly what you've built and see whether you need to change the design, or merely how you fly it. With a community that is usually eager to help those who struggle, feedback and advice is seldom out of reach. I highly recommend this game if you're into space exploration and are not afraid of a challenge.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								After one and half year since my last review at 0.25, I am pretty amazed about how this game has changed. Careers, more parts, better aerodynamics and heating simulation.What I loved better is the amazing modders. Plugins and parts are always growing better, taking shapes and functioning more smoothly. Ferram4, bac9, Acea, BahamutoD, those guys are just getting more amazing than ever making more and more fantastic mods.Since 1.1 is almost out of the bakery, this indie game is making it's way through!====Previous review at 0.25 [Sept.2014]====Well, after a total of 100 hours of gaming time (steam doesn't count every time I started it directly from the directory), I was proud to say that I am finally a amateur engineer and pilot. In the gaming process, I found this game quite challenging despite earlier easy experience. Generally, it's a pretty nice game though it's still in dev. Much of the game is something like Space Engineer, but this one is quite realistic(if you got some mods installed). Also, the game's setting is a highlight. A vast system of star, planets, asteroids and moons. Impressive if you like exploring. Also, the orbit and aerodynamic is just as great as its inspiring game, Orbiter. The game is developed on Unity platform, and the x64 edition is just realeased and packed with some bugs, severe or unimportant. If it simply crashed or a Oops message appears, don't worry. It's just a bug ruining your game experience. But don't blame the dev team please! They are trying their best to make everything perfect, although it's just a ""Good"" now. Oh, and one more thing, this game is finally entering BETA testing! Mark the day on the calendar, Jeb! You'll never forget it! So that is it, the game for a sandbox gamer, a rocket maniac or a airplane designer; even worse with the 0.25 update, it is also suitable for a sociopath who liked to design and destroy things.  Thousands of mods are available in the official forum[forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com]. If you are intrested in it, try out the demo in the official site[www.kerbalspaceprogram.com].In a few words, this game worths the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game got me all into mathematics and ignited a flame in me that started a greater hype of getting knowledge over topics that is way beyond my understandings that I still dont understand how it did that.Since i started playing that and understood what orbits, gravity and other things really are, I got way deeper into space than I ever imagined I would.I suddenly got interested in what general relativity is, the basic laws of motion, the rocket equation, all the mathematics involved with the game and the mechanics, etc etc etc etc...SO BEWARE: THIS GAME WILL MAKE YOU A NERD UNLESS YOU ALREADY ARE.Get it! 100%!

								I really love this game. It is like you are NASA and all of its employees. You get to design and build the rockets, spaceships, and planes and then fly them. I am currently doing missions to explore and land on the moons of what would be Jupiter in the game, and I can still see a lot of content left for me to explore. Once you get into the game a bit, I highly suggest looking into downloading some mods for the game, since it has a pretty strong modding community. This game teaches you geometry, planetary motion, the effects of gravity in space and much, much more. I find myself using my calculator to plan my missions and drawing up mission outlines. Success in the game takes a smart mind and a good plan. I think it is one of the best games I have ever played.I highly recommed it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Possibly one of the best games to be released in the last 10 years. I have for a very long time dreamed of going to space and this game only strengthen's that desire. Here's my analysis of this game.Graphics: Have improved dramatically compared to what they were back when I started playing. The Mun has changed shape for crying out loud!Gameplay: With the recently improved aerodynamics, The gameplay is superb. Watching your own rocket/spaceplane tumble back to Kerbin is an amazing feeling.Other: Contracts are wonderful. However, they feel a little repetitive in the late game. The tech tree is fun to explore and great for first time players. When multiplayer comes out I wont be surprised if I rack up 2000+ hours on here. If I were a therapist I would recommend this game to my patients because of how great you feel when you finally land on the Mun that required 5 Kerbal's lives to get there, and then planning a rescue mission!The rundown: Buy this immediately.

								I. Love. Dis. Game.  It has quite a harsh learning curve, i tossed this game aside after 10-20 failed launches, But when i came back a week or two later, I put some time into it. The list of mods for this game are endless with some of the more well known being MechJeb(Good for Newbie) K9, Kethane, Extended rocket packs. etc etc, Massive list.  I find myself starting a new game every couple weeks just because a lot can be done differently, I tend to try keep my place clean, Place a flag everywhere i go. Run out of fuel and end up stranded. Send rescue missions. A lot of what this game has to offer comes down to ones own willingness to make it themselves lol.  A few great YouTubers for KSP but i absolutely love Scott Manley, I've picked up a lot of things from watching his video's.  Regardless!, Excellent game, and i intend to play to play it for a long time to come. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fantastic game!I have been playing since early beta and had the pleasure of watching this game blossom into what it is today.If you enjoy building and tinkering, planes and rockets, space exploration, and many, many explosions, then this game is definitely for you!You have the pleasure of building the Kerbal Space Program from the ground up. Starting from your very first rocket exploding on the pad, you will soon be taking your Kerbals to distant planets with full blown multi-stage ships, and planning trans orbital maneuvers like you had been doing it all your life.If I were new to KSP, I think my only complaint would be the lack of a thorough tutorial. The player is really left to fend for themselves as far as using features goes. There is a lot to learn about controlling and building your craft, and most of it has to be done by trial and error. Fortunately there are plenty of community resources for KSP, so a short Google search will get you past any features you are having trouble with. This game will certainly be a joy to play. Definitely recommended for anyone with a mind to download it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you like to ""win"" games, this game is not for you. If however, you like to ""play"" games, this is your game. This is a simluation much like SimCity, in that it is what you make out of it. Just like most simluations, you have a carreer mode, in which you start off with nothing much but a rocket, a pod an some gadgets to learn science. As you explore more and more science, you open up more and more rockets, winglets and more science gadgets. I have to tell you the truth, games like this, Civ5 Simcity, i dont play EVERYDAY. This game sat in my steam shelf for a few months, but once I do start playing them, I go on 20-50hr binges....Im on one of those now :) Get this game if you like fun and science, do the tutorials to get an idea of what you CAN do, and just have fun!

								It's a game about orbital mechanics. Who knew science could be so much fun?Admittedly, I was a bit relunctant to purchase due to ""early access"" stigma or something along those lines. Glad I did! If you like science, sandboxes, space, and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with moar boosters, this is for you.There's a sizable learning curve, sure, but don't let that put you off (it took me close to 70 hours in to get good enough at docking) KSP has one of the best, if not THE best community hands down. On top of that, there's the legendary Scott Manley on YouTube who has extensive knowledge and makes things crystal clear. Once you figure out the fundamentals in this game, things become quite a bit easier and you can really let your creativity run loose.Also, this game can help you learn about orbital mechanics. KSP has helped tremendously with giving my interest in science a much needed boost. Then there's the mods. The wonderful folk who make mods spend lots of time seamlessly integrating them into KSP.Chances are, if there's something you desire in KSP that doesn't exist just yet, there's a mod for it, or being currently made. When I started playing with mods, it opened up so many doors for creativity. In short, KSP offers a lot. Especially as an early access title, and compared to a lot of AAA titles being released.I think Squad will become one of the best devs out there. I recommend this over and over again.Uh. BUY IT.

												What a fantastic game!I have been playing since early beta and had the pleasure of watching this game blossom into what it is today.If you enjoy building and tinkering, planes and rockets, space exploration, and many, many explosions, then this game is definitely for you!You have the pleasure of building the Kerbal Space Program from the ground up. Starting from your very first rocket exploding on the pad, you will soon be taking your Kerbals to distant planets with full blown multi-stage ships, and planning trans orbital maneuvers like you had been doing it all your life.If I were new to KSP, I think my only complaint would be the lack of a thorough tutorial. The player is really left to fend for themselves as far as using features goes. There is a lot to learn about controlling and building your craft, and most of it has to be done by trial and error. Fortunately there are plenty of community resources for KSP, so a short Google search will get you past any features you are having trouble with. This game will certainly be a joy to play. Definitely recommended for anyone with a mind to download it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's a game about orbital mechanics. Who knew science could be so much fun?Admittedly, I was a bit relunctant to purchase due to ""early access"" stigma or something along those lines. Glad I did! If you like science, sandboxes, space, and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with moar boosters, this is for you.There's a sizable learning curve, sure, but don't let that put you off (it took me close to 70 hours in to get good enough at docking) KSP has one of the best, if not THE best community hands down. On top of that, there's the legendary Scott Manley on YouTube who has extensive knowledge and makes things crystal clear. Once you figure out the fundamentals in this game, things become quite a bit easier and you can really let your creativity run loose.Also, this game can help you learn about orbital mechanics. KSP has helped tremendously with giving my interest in science a much needed boost. Then there's the mods. The wonderful folk who make mods spend lots of time seamlessly integrating them into KSP.Chances are, if there's something you desire in KSP that doesn't exist just yet, there's a mod for it, or being currently made. When I started playing with mods, it opened up so many doors for creativity. In short, KSP offers a lot. Especially as an early access title, and compared to a lot of AAA titles being released.I think Squad will become one of the best devs out there. I recommend this over and over again.Uh. BUY IT.

								Kerbal Space Program is close to my idea of a perfect game. It's a beautiful fusion of rocket science, physics, and just the right amount of lunacy to make for an extremely entertaining and engrossing game.Although the game is unfinished, and it can be painfully obvious at some times, the core mechanics in place are amazing enough to make you overlook those shortcomings as you play.If you have ever had an interest in physics or space, this game is for you.

								Pros:+Totally open ended, build whatever sort of rockets you like.+Persistent universe, rockets you send up today can serve as docking platforms or refueling stations for things you send tomorrow.+Fun cartoon aesthetic.+Built-in procedural quest system (Contracts) always available to give you new goals.  They're totally optional, you can fly wherever your fuel will take you.+This game taught me orbital mechanics.Cons:-Rough optimization.  You may need a beefy rig especially if you want to make big complicated rockets.  However a small rocket can complete most of the in game challenges and is kinder on your system.-Control scheme can take some getting used to.  Everything is rebindable though.-Dedication to realism means that you're sometimes hitting the time compression button and waiting (and waiting) for an orbital launch window to open.  However this is only an issue for distant planets.  The moon is always nearby and ready to explore.This game doesn't hold your hand because there's not one (or even ten) correct answers to any problem.  You may find certain tasks like getting a stable orbit or docking with another craft challenging, but there's literally hundreds of cheerful, informative youtube vids offering tips.  And if it starts hard, you'll feel like a boss when you finally nail it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game looks simplistic at first glance but may be one of the best space/rocket simulators out there. Even though we're not launching real humans into space, the premise will grab your attention. Launch everything from simple rockets into orbit to landing onto other planets. A warning to the player though, this game is not easy when it comes to getting where you want to go. The game is fun but comes with a huge learning curve called orbital mechanics.Kerbal Space Program is a rocket simulator. The objectives change as the player progresses through the game depending what game mode was chosen. There are 3 modes : science, career and sandbox. Career is the real challenge as reputation, contracts, money and research all play a crucial role in completing objectives and acquiring better technology to build better rockets. Science throws aside the funds and reputation but still respects research in which the player still needs to meet certain objectives. Sandbox lets the player run loose without any strings attached and even has some pre-loaded vessels ready to be launched. Do not be fooled though, this game isn't as easy as launching into the sky and flying to another planet. There are a lot of calculations involved and for me personally, a lot of youtube tutorial videos. Adding all the components you wish to isn't always easy, and definitely isn't easy to launch all that off the planet!There are a few primary structures that start small and grow (visually) as the player progresses. These structures include a vehicle assembly building, launch pad, space plane hangar, runway, tracking station, and astronaut complex. The vehicle assembly building is where the rocket, ship or even lander can be assembled and saved/loaded. The Hangar is for planes that need to take off on the runway. The tracking station is for data, mission management and tracking statistics (such as where landed ships are). Lastly, the astronaut complex allows the player to recruit new units to fly into space. Each structure can be upgraded by clicking the right mouse button. Other structures include research and development (which is important to improving and discovering new parts), mission control used to obtain contracts and the administration building, I'm not too sure what it does.Building in Kerbal Space Program is relative simple and easy to do. The challenge is finding something that works and doesn't blow up during launch. The trick is not only to be able to pilot it without it spinning out of control but also have enough fuel to land. The first part comes easy to me but the second part is actually quite difficult if take off isn't done properly. There are a tonne of parts that the word limit on this review won't let me name them all. Parts included are parachutes, cockpits, aerodynamic wings, de-couplers, rocket-fuel boosters, fuel canisters, biology bays, research attachments, and all sorts of other thrusters and boosters. To add more depth to the construction, frames can be added to the rocket so that the rocket doesn't need to stand on it's own boosters. Meaning, if you have a rocket that can't really stand on it's own due to it's odd shape, size and weight, there is a method to suspend the rocket in the air prior to launch. Releasing the rocket is relatively easy but ensure that you place everything in proper order. Order is especially important in this game and can be easily overlooked when constructing. If you don't put everything in sequential firing order, you just might fire the wrong rockets and cause an accident. Order (or stages) are everything! Double checking this will definitely save some headaches.Visually the game is basic but ensures details where necessary. The rocket parts are pretty detailed but the world itself sort of feels bland. I do feel they could have added a little bit more to the terrain (or added some cities) to make it more... decorative. What is cool is that they decided to include a camera on-board every shuttle. So whether you're flying one Kerbal or many, you can check their facial expressions at any time (which is a neat feature). The sounds are basic and do provide the essentials but nothing extremely out of the ordinary. Crash effects are definitely included.Overall, good game but with a big learning curve. Don't jump into this expecting to hit the moon right away. It will require some skill, observation and background. When you do succeed and understand how it works the game, everything becomes a lot easier to do (obviously)! It's just getting through the learning stage is what makes it difficult. For future updates or games, I would recommend trying to make an ""easier"" setting so regulars can simply jump in and play. Then again, the challenge is what attracted so many players.RATING : 7.95/10 Gameplay A- Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability B- Overall  BScreenShots : [url][/url][url][/url]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game.  It does have a steep learning curve, but it is enjoyable at every step, even with failures you encounter.  Those failures make it so much more satisfying when you do succeed in constructing your first successful craft.  It is definitely worth the price(and even better if you can get it on discount like I did at 40% off!).  It will definitely make you think more creatively(which is has for me at least).  Give it a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game makes so much fun, building rockets, destroy them and finally make them fly into the orbit. And from there to other moons / planets and maybe back to home :-). It's so funny to watch your Kerbals doing stuff.It's a fantastic game, even it's in alpha state.I know that some people struggle a bit in the beginning, because the tutorials are not really good (yet). But there are thousands of good tutorials and gameplay videos on youtube about this game (As a hint: check the youtube channel of Scott Manley!). And of course the big and nice community which will help you.There are also many mods for this game, which add more parts to build your rockets, or just helpful things like autopilot (MechJeb 2).

								This game is fantastic! I've a bit of a soft spot for space to begin with and I'm also fond of sandbox games like minecraft where you just give yourself objectives and projects then fulfil them or don't. I got this game at the same time as Bioshock Infinite and then played this for 40 hours before touching Infinite. The light spacy music and just fine tuning different models to get them to work right, trying not to kill all the kerbals and just building your own space station but trying not to forget important parts, all just part of the great fun to be had with KSP!

								Very fun game! Been playing for a year in early access and if you are into true Sandbox games that allow you to explore the world and universe around you, this is the game for you!You basically build whatever you want/need to get your ship to do what you wanted it to do, whether is building massive interplanetary rockets or space planes that can leave orbit and fly inside the planets atmosphere, or even send a space station in orbit to refuel and restock, all from scrap!The one thing the game does lack is direction or a mission type system to give the player purpose beyond building their dream ships. A career mode is in the works but doesn't provide goals beyond researching matter throught the galaxy. I'd recomend this game to anyone who is into sci-fi, space exploration, engineering, and simulation games.8/10 rating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Omg this game is in Alpha? There is already so many planets to go to, and the rocketship building is awesome. Physics does take part in this game, with real situations like weight, how your plane can hold all the stuff you have, and only being able to use liquid fuel in space. What are you waiting for, go BUY THIS GAME NOW! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Concerning KSP, in my opinion - the best space program simulator of all time, lots of mods available for even newest Beta version 0.90, realisticly remade laws of physics. Personally I had a lot of fun playing with my Kerbals :D. Summing up all aspects of Squad production - I am sure they will continue working on KSP as one of therir best projects :). One and only thing which is a little bit uncomfortable about Steam support for KSP is no Workshop. Mods should be also supported by Steam considering how many people are using them. Above all, Workshop, that's the only disadvantage of Steam support for this game. But on the other side, even without Workshop, getting mods and setting them off in your game is not problematic at all. Regards for Squad, hopefully they will not stop improving KSP.

								Kerbal Space Program is by far one of the greatest games I have played in my life. From the cute expressions on the Kerbal's faces to the excitement of landing one of your creations on an alien world - this game delivers. I'd like to start out by saying..holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are many, many planets and moons to land on with many, many parts to and combinations to do it with. You can make Rovers, Space Stations, Vehicles to transport your little, green friends; you name it. The planets are all really, really awesome and vast. You could spend hundreds, even thousands of hours exploring a single planet/moon. Things never get boring!  Don't think for a minute that tasting the fruits of your labor will be easy, though. The game is a very difficult game to master and will take you plenty of time just to get the basics down. There's a steep learning curve, but in the end it's worth it. Whether you make it to one of the many bodies or you end up exploding half way through the atmosphere of Kerbin, it's satisfying! Seeing your creation shatter into a million pieces and then watching them rain down onto kerbin is just...I mean...glorious. The game is still in development, so it's pretty buggy. To be honest though, you'll get over it when you successfully land on the moon for the first time. Another thing is the fact that the game is a bit of a resource hog, meaning you have to have a decent computer to play this game to it's potential. It's still playable with a semi-low/medium end computer, but things will be a wee bit slow at times, especially with larger part counts. But really, aside from that I don't really have anything negative to say about the game. Go ahead and buy it, you will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								My daughters boyfriend turned me onto the Kerbal Space Program last week.  OMG, I can't remember the last time I was so sucked into a game..... wait, game???   No, this is not just a game, it's way more. I've played plenty of Outer Space games, and most are just 1st or 3rd person shooters of some form.  But not this.  For the first time I can remember, the Kerbal Space Program lets you sink your teeth into real problems with space travel, like gravity and establishing orbits!  It's much harder than one might first think...... which I love!!!This is not a game for people that want to shoot and blow up stuff. This is a game for science and math geeks who like some serious hardcore problem solving.  It's not Rocket Science.... Oh wait.... yes it is!!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Definitely my most favourite game of this 2013, and it's not even finished yet!The idea is to make spacecraft to explore the solar system. Sounds simple, right?There are two basic game modes, Career and Sandbox. In sandbox mode you get all the pieces to play with, and can design anything you can conceive with the parts available to take you as far as you like. This is how I started playing the game and it provided hours of entertainment and explosions, but it does rely to an extent on setting your own goals. See if you can get to the Mun. Then Minmus. Land on each one. Get to other planets. Make a space station. It goes on!Career mode was recently introduced and definitely simplifies the learning curve a lot, limiting your starting builds and unlocking parts through performing science, and adds a lot of value to the experience, as well as adding a purpose for some of the parts that seem to be pointless in sandbox mode. Finally, the modding community is extremely active for this game with mods to add mineable resources, expand part lists, and adding new methods of travelling (warp anyone?), and even a multiplayer mod still in its infancy. Without a doubt the best value for money in terms of time played for me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite games of all time... back when it still was in Early Access with version number 0.23 or 0.24.2. After that pretty much all the developers have done is integrating some mods and putting boobs on a kerbal (but no boob-physics, so you can't study how boobs jiggle in space. So what's the point of female kerbals. Except to push the feminist ideology down your throat.)Also I'm a Sandbox-guy, who doesn't give a damn about Career or Science mode (Though I'm also the only guy in the community who ♥♥♥♥ing hates Jebediah Kerman, or any one of those orange suited kerbals), just let me fly planes and spaceships.But enough of ranting. In a nutshell this is a game where you build stuff and then crash them. Rovers, Planes, Rockets, Starships, whatever you desire. Also Satellites, Space Stations and unmanned probes.Graphics may not be the best there are, but that doesn't stop the game from being mindblowingly stunning. The first time you achieve orbit (it's not that hard) and look down. If you enjoyed Gravity or Interstellar in theaters, you'll like this game. Though even with all the new nuisances I still recommend this game as it still is pretty fun.Just make sure you get some mods.Install one mod and start your own asteroid mining corporation.Another mod and start colonizing other worlds.Third one and you got yourself an Apollo 11 replica.Fourth mod to build a bloody Borg cube.Fifth, sixth and seventh for GPS system, Deep Space Telescope and a Mapping satellite.The list goes on and on.And now, I'm off to the internet to find a previous version of this game along with some compatible mods and without female kerbals.

Video Transcript:Hello viewers!  Welcome to another episode of A Bird's Eye View.  My name is Endeavor, once again your humble host.  Our game this time is the simulator Kerbal Space Program.  Developed and published by Squad, this game came out of Early Access in April of 2015.  Let's take a look at the finished product.As a simulation game, Kerbal Space Program doesn't have a real story to speak of.  The player is tasked with running a NASA like organization made up of accident-prone green people called Kerbals.  Administrator duties include everything from securing funding, designing ships, and even personally piloting space shuttles, all the while trying to keep your astronauts alive long enough to go on more than one mission.The game has a charmingly simple atmosphere, with unobtrusive, upbeat music to keep the mood light.  Most of the engine is dedicated to simulating complex physics, so the art is fairly plain.  The graphical limitations are fine since the ultimate purpose of the game is to tinker around with creative spaceship crafting.Kerbal Space Program includes a few game modes.  The primary way to play is called Career Mode, which unpacks the game slowly, constantly giving the player new challenges to beat in order to unlock more things with which to play.  Sandbox, which used to be the main game, gives the player all of the unlockable ship parts to use right off the bat.  Finally, there’s Science Mode, which includes missions and tasks like Career Mode, but without some of the more managerial duties like worrying about funding.The controls, while not simple, are consistent enough, and they can be rebound for ease-of-use.  There were so many controls and commands to remember that I had to reference the options menu frequently, but the game doesn't punish the player for doing so.There are games with annoyingly overzealous tutorials that constantly remind the player how to do things.  Kerbal Space Program is not one of those.  Quite honestly, while the tutorials are comprehensive, they throw so much technical jargon and complex concepts at the player that the tutorials feel inadequate.  This game doesn't hold your hand, and I'm left with the impression that the player is expected to crash and burn a few times before getting it.One part of the game that sorely needed further explanation was the Career Mode.  The game tells you that you need to launch missions and conduct research to earn Science (a sort of currency for unlocking upgrades), but almost no effort was made explaining how one conducts research.  I learned more about how to play from Wikis and online guides than I did from the game itself.There were only a few bugs which I encountered during my time.  When building, there were a few times where the ship pieces wouldn't attach to the spacecraft how I wanted them to.  Fixing the issue involved saving my work and reloading, which wasn't a big deal, but it happened often enough to warrant a mention here.  A few times I had a problem where ship pieces that were meant to separate during flight wouldn't cooperate, dooming my ship and mission to an explosive end.Despite any issues I had with the game, I think it was masterfully put together.  Nothing beats the feeling of finally getting your ship out of the atmosphere for the first time, and the accomplishments don't stop there.  Once you've broken the speed and altitude records, it's time to orbit the planet Kerbal.  And then try landing a ship on the moon.  Learning to manage limited fuel supplies and using gravitational pull to slingshot around planets and moons is fascinatingly complex, yet the satisfaction in learning all of the ins and outs of space travel make it a worthwhile endeavor.The game's retail price is $39.99.  With all of the features and science-based entertainment, I recommend Kerbal Space Program for anyone that loves building and discovery.  It's currently available on Steam and Good Old Games for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  It is also available for PS4.That concludes my review for Kerbal Space Program.

												Summary of my time:1st career: Spent about 30 hours making something that can go into orbit and back safely. Gave up when I realised I couldn't do any more.2nd career: Realised that I could definitely do more, so managed to get to the Mun and Minimus, but then got stuck making space stations.3rd career: Learnt to make space stations and bases.Maybe I'll get around to going to Duna soon...Awesome game, if you're willing to stick with it!

								This game is truly amazing. As a kid, I've always dreamed of becoming a pilot, of a spaceplane or airplane, and this game lets me play with the realistic aerodynamics/physics of air/space travel, and it does it right.....oh, and it's still in beta! Except for minor glitches here and there, this game is perfect and VERY well made. It lets you build any rocket/spaceplane/airplane you want and fly it to distant planets/celestial bodies, land and return, all to complete missions to get more science, which you can use to unlock upgrades for your vehicles. Right now, I've made the sexiest spaceplane you can imagine, which can get into orbit around Kerbin (home planet), transmit data and return back to base, in perfect shape. Kinda like an upgrade of the Space Shuttle (since it doesn't need external boosters to get into orbit).See, this game is extremely realistic, so you get to learn a lot about the exact orbital mechanics NASA workers are required to know. I used to think getting into space was just firing a rocket straight up, but realistically, you need to have a high surface velocity so you can get into orbit, otherwise, you're wasting a ton of fuel on either flying far away from home or falling back to the earth due to gravity. There isn't zero gravity once you leave the atmosphere, that's only because there's just as much gravity the other way, due to your orbit in which you're constantly falling, but have a high enough velocity to generate an equal G-force the in the opposite direction. And if you want to go to the Mun (moon), you'll need to use your orbit to slingshot yourself to the place where you and the Mun moon will be at the same time, since you must take into account that the Mun also moves in an orbit. I swear, you'll learn a TON about orbital physics, as well as you'll have a lot of fun building your spaceship however you want. And if it crashes to the ground, you must think about which part was misplaced to cause the crash, getting you in this trial and error loop until you FINALLY fix up the whole thing perfectly. Then you can think of its purpose-transport vessel, science lab, satellite launcher or a long distance traveler to a distant celestial body etc. etc. There's so much science to do, so many new ideas to think of and so much to learn from this game. Get the game and prepare to ignore every other game you have in your library because this game is out of this world! (literally)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favourite games of all time... back when it still was in Early Access with version number 0.23 or 0.24.2. After that pretty much all the developers have done is integrating some mods and putting boobs on a kerbal (but no boob-physics, so you can't study how boobs jiggle in space. So what's the point of female kerbals. Except to push the feminist ideology down your throat.)Also I'm a Sandbox-guy, who doesn't give a damn about Career or Science mode (Though I'm also the only guy in the community who ♥♥♥♥ing hates Jebediah Kerman, or any one of those orange suited kerbals), just let me fly planes and spaceships.But enough of ranting. In a nutshell this is a game where you build stuff and then crash them. Rovers, Planes, Rockets, Starships, whatever you desire. Also Satellites, Space Stations and unmanned probes.Graphics may not be the best there are, but that doesn't stop the game from being mindblowingly stunning. The first time you achieve orbit (it's not that hard) and look down. If you enjoyed Gravity or Interstellar in theaters, you'll like this game. Though even with all the new nuisances I still recommend this game as it still is pretty fun.Just make sure you get some mods.Install one mod and start your own asteroid mining corporation.Another mod and start colonizing other worlds.Third one and you got yourself an Apollo 11 replica.Fourth mod to build a bloody Borg cube.Fifth, sixth and seventh for GPS system, Deep Space Telescope and a Mapping satellite.The list goes on and on.And now, I'm off to the internet to find a previous version of this game along with some compatible mods and without female kerbals.

NASA simulator 2013You're stuck on a earth like planet without trees or life at all called Kerbin. The only people left is a group of small green men who call themselves Kerbals. Nobody know how they got here, or how long they've been here. (Kraken!). It's no wonder that their biggest goal in life is to reach distant planets in search for whatever that they wish to find.Your task, is to help these poor, *ehm* brave!

Or from building a jet that can take you around the world. It's your world do what you want with it!                      Just a little extra clip to go with it.

								One of the best sandbox games out there with a campaign mode.Build the craziest or most effiecent rocket of your dreams, can be as simple as point and click or as in-depth as calulating mass vs fuel expenditure.... Truely for any type of intellect ranging from Rocket Surgeon to Simple Joe.IF SOMEHOW you run out of things to do, there is a MASSIVE mod database that can completely change the game...After 100 hours I finally have set up a self-sufficent base on a remote planet capable of launching and building rockets... though you could get just as far as I have in 5 hours if you are skilled enough.9/10 Amazing game... The only thing I will gripe about is the soundtrack is a little lacking... Regardless, it's a fantastic game. Buy it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AMAZING game. Do you like flying? Do you like space? Ever wanted to build planes and spaceships? Then allow yourself. I\'ve learned so much about launching crafts into orbit, getting to planets, the calculations, OH what I have learned. And the fun I\'ve had while doing it! You\'ll spend a half an hour building a spacecraft and making sure its 100% set and ready to get put into orbit and complete its objective. Then you\'ll get to launch and control your craft through the atmosphere and into the galaxy laid out before you. Two moons orbit your planet, more planets lay beyond yours, each with different gravity and temperatures and atmospheres.If you want a game about space and building your own craft and controlling them? Do it. SO worth it. I\'ve even found making my own jets and flying within the atmosphere fun and educational all in one. If you have a creative kid, or one who loves spaces? Do it.It has a sandbox mode, build and fly whatever you want, or you can take on missions and slowly proceed through the various parts and completing different objectives.Downsides? Only jets for inner atmosphere, no propellers in the vanilla game (with mods you can get some, but they aren\'t 100%), no submarine crafts to my knowledge, but \""water craft\"" and seaplanes... errr seajets are able to be made.Overall 100%, get it! Try it out at the very least!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Do you like science?  Like armchair aeronautics?  Like watching rockets fail catastrophically in an effort to reach orbit?  Buy this game.In the game, you get to assemble rockets/space planes from a decent list of parts and then launch/pilot them and see how they perform.  Aeronautic forces are actually at work on your designs and you have to consider center of lift/gravity and things like weight and thrust.  There are moons/other planets to explore in a sandbox environment.  If you like building things and tinkering around with them, you'll love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game requires a surprising amount of dedication just to enter. The learning curve is an immediate cliff off of the get-go, however I think it is most certaintly worth the effort. The core of the game is simple (ironic as it is still relatively complex) orbital physics; not exactly a common skill or knowledge. This isn't necessarily big issue, as the game works for how much you put into it. If all you want is large explosions and awkward rockets with no real effort, go at it. If you want to spend hours perfectly calculating how the rocket will work, the game provides the information to do so.The community is great for the game, as the steep learning curve keeps the stereotypical ""haters"" or ""trolls"" away from the subreddit or forums. Even when I started playing (about 2 years ago, 9 major updates total) there were more tutorials and mods than I could ever use. Their quality has since skyrocketed (pun intended), and never ceases to amaze me.The goal of the game? Right now there is a career mode, where you manage funds and reputation with limited parts, however you can fulfill contracts and complete objectives to gain new parts and money. There is another mode without the currency system, and then there is the original sandbox mode where anything goes, everything is free.Other than that the game is mostly self-driven. For me, it's the challenge of the game. When I started, landing on the moon was about as far away as, well, the moon. Now I usually spend my time making orbital stations or interplanetary landers using the plethora of mods available (my favorites including b9, remotetech 2, and KAS).The game is almost like a puzzle, if you will; a very, very open-ended puzzle. Massive, towering rockets that take your brave kerbals to the outer reaching planets can perform the same as tiny, lightweight and efficient rockets with a small probe. If I had to rate it, I would definitely give it a 10/10 for the experience it's given me thus far; and so far I haven't lost interest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was absolutely addicted to this game when I first picked it up, and honestly I can’t wait to kick my Space Engineers addiction and get back to my Kerbals!I think it would be hard to describe the deep mechanics of this game without making it sound rather dry and educational, but as a huge fan of astronomy and the idea of space travel, I think this is a game everyone should give a go. Contrary to how some of the screen shots and discussion threads may appear, you don’t need an engineering degree to get something out of KSP. While the simulation aspect is very flushed out (and frequently being updated and fine tuned) there is enough arcade inspiration to allow for silly builds and brute force approaches to reach goals. At the same time however, those with a knack for math and engineering, your precision and dedication will be rewarded with epic adventures across the Kerbal Solar System.Kerbal Space Program is a must buy in my book!

								This is easily one of the best indie games you can get your filthy moondust covered hands on.Although the learning curve in the beginning is pretty steep for someone who isn't aware of basic orbital physics or is on par with the navball or rocket construction, it's nothing a couple of videos from Scott Manley (or Robbaz if you intend to just make space a circus) can't fix. If you however know what you are doing and/or have been following someone who knows what they're doing you should have no problem at all getting into this game.It features many planets, their moons and in the future even an asteroid belt you'll be able to interact with all from the comfort of your own room/NASA mission control centre.You can build everything from rockets, space planes, landers, probes and god knows what.The game also features modding support and mods for the game can be found on the KSP site. Mods can add everything from boat parts, weapons, tools for making robots and mechs, new parts to add to the already pretty big library of parts and even customized planets.The game is however somewhat unstable and building large stations etc can often cause horrible lag on all but the beefiest computers, it is however only a problem when you build VERY large stuff and once the game is finished the optimization will no doubt be better than it currently is.I truly recommend this game to any and all of you! There is something for pretty much everyone in this game, if there isn't then mods have probably added it.If your PC can run this game, I see no reason for you not buying it. Trust me the game is worth every penny but if it's on a sale you pretty much have to buy it. Your life is not complete without this game. Get it now. Seriously.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would highly recomend KSP to anyone that loves sandbox games or space themed games. There is really no way to get bored of the game, there is an infinite amount of fun to me had and it dosen't matter whether you are playing career mode where you start with minimal parts and work your way up to the top, or just messing around in sandbox mode building what ever you desire. You really arn't limited to just rockets, there is also a building where you can make space planes! (basically just jet powered planes but you can strap some rockets and you are good to go.) Use your amagination and do whatever, make some planes and drop some *bombs* on the kerbals buildings or build a rocket and go to the moon, or maybe even other planets!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												10/10 crash simulator.Seriously though, this game is fantastic if you don't mind the steep learning curve, kerbals who can survive high falls, learning about space and failing...A lot of failing. “I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.” Who doesn't love failing? What was I doing? Oh yeah, my ship just crashed and burned, back to the VAB. Flight's going well? Alt-tab and come back 5s later, well look who's on their way down to the cold hard ground. But really, failing is just a part of the game, and you get to learn what works and what doesn't. It gets much better once you understand the concepts required to handle and build the vehicles as well as space exploration in general. Then you go on building things that just works and it really gives a sense of achievement; you did it, you. You got Bob up in space. Great job, now he's stranded...because all you wanted was to get to space and you forgot to include the return trip. The game supports mods to enhance the experience, features several modes depending on what you want to do. Play sandbox if you want to build ridiculous rockets with enough funds to run an entire nation just to have it crash into mission control 5 seconds later as you laugh manically. Science for those who do not want to manage funds but still go through the science develoment and career for the management of all aspects of building your own space program.  Also remember that F5 is your best friend. It's the only one who can come clutch for you when all else seem to fall apart.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kerbal Space Program is one of the best games ever made (If you don't mind playing it alone.) I've but more than 1200 hours into it, and I can say it has captures my imagination more than anything has since I started playing Minecraft back in high school. This game is educational, imaginative, addictive, optimized, and never ever leaves you with nothing to do. Space flight is immersive, realistic, and exciting. No other game has ever given a player the experience of building a rocket, launching it, and flying it to the moon and back with absolutely no loading screen. Literally billions of meters, no loading screen. If you have even a vague interest in space flight, engineering, or exploration, KSP is for you. And on top of the fantastic vanilla game, there is an active and thriving modding community that elevated the game to new heights. Like Minecraft, if you can think of it, there is a mod of it. Want to build a scale Saturn V and head to the full-scale moon. There's a mod for that. Want to create a colony, completely from your own design, there a mod for that. Want to shoot rockets at enemy mechs on mars? There is a mod for that. Best game ever. Best mods ever. 10/10. KSP for president.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game requires a surprising amount of dedication just to enter. The learning curve is an immediate cliff off of the get-go, however I think it is most certaintly worth the effort. The core of the game is simple (ironic as it is still relatively complex) orbital physics; not exactly a common skill or knowledge. This isn't necessarily big issue, as the game works for how much you put into it. If all you want is large explosions and awkward rockets with no real effort, go at it. If you want to spend hours perfectly calculating how the rocket will work, the game provides the information to do so.The community is great for the game, as the steep learning curve keeps the stereotypical ""haters"" or ""trolls"" away from the subreddit or forums. Even when I started playing (about 2 years ago, 9 major updates total) there were more tutorials and mods than I could ever use. Their quality has since skyrocketed (pun intended), and never ceases to amaze me.The goal of the game? Right now there is a career mode, where you manage funds and reputation with limited parts, however you can fulfill contracts and complete objectives to gain new parts and money. There is another mode without the currency system, and then there is the original sandbox mode where anything goes, everything is free.Other than that the game is mostly self-driven. For me, it's the challenge of the game. When I started, landing on the moon was about as far away as, well, the moon. Now I usually spend my time making orbital stations or interplanetary landers using the plethora of mods available (my favorites including b9, remotetech 2, and KAS).The game is almost like a puzzle, if you will; a very, very open-ended puzzle. Massive, towering rockets that take your brave kerbals to the outer reaching planets can perform the same as tiny, lightweight and efficient rockets with a small probe. If I had to rate it, I would definitely give it a 10/10 for the experience it's given me thus far; and so far I haven't lost interest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I'm a huge fan of sandbox games and KSP is no exception.Gameplay: It's like this, you get a bunch of Kerbals and you put them sad ♥♥♥♥ers into whatever unholy behemoth of a rocket you've slammed together in a quilt of random fuel tanks, jets, and scientific equipment then you launch them in your aberration into space. Gods of Kerbal willing, they'll make it to orbit around Kerbal instead of feebly falling back to the planet for the hundredth time. (And probably exploding on impact!)I'm no rocket scientist and boy does playing this game prove it. Sure is fun to try at it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Houston we have a problem! This is one of the phrases you will find yourself saying in this game, but not because this game is horrible. The game is very challenging and you can spend hours and hours in game before you perfect your design and you will have many failed attempts before sucess but this is what makes it great, this is purely a sandbox game and it does it well, being able to fly to any planet in the Kerbal Solar System is fun and challenging and it has simulation aspects to it which makes it a bit like... erghh well rocket science. Kerbal allows you to build your own space rocket and send it to space and this is very fun and time consuming. The graphics are quite basic but beautiful looking over the orbit of Kerbin or the Mun is very pretty and can bring a tear to your eye (i cRy eVertim)The sound is basic but nothing to amazing, some sounds lack the UMPH! I wanted but the game is highly modable and im sure many people can adapt this but don't get me wrong the sound isn't bad neither.This game has unlimited replay value in my opinion. You can spend thousands of hours on this game, and its very fun._________________________________Overall: A_________________________________If you enjoyed or found this review helpful please let yetteh know :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can be quite difficult, it depends which gamemode you choose and if you have the patience to read a lot of tutorial text. If you do have the patience, then you'll learn a lot about astronomy and you'll learn how to pilot your aircraft/rocket. I recommend this because it's at a very fair price. It's all up to you when it comes to how much time you put in it. I think you'll have more fun the more time you put into the game. You have to take it nice and slow though, as I said patience is a big part of this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Another rare gem that although it is an early access it is better than most ""completed"" games.It is hard and you will need to use the forums / wiki / youtube to really learn it... but even researching how to pull off a proper orbital maneuver is just fun.  And if you don't do your research... well crashing is fun too :)A game based in enough science to be very compelling and immersive, but fictional in all the right places to make it funny and casual.The mods out there easily multiply the conteny a hundred fold.  I have never seen so much unique content, right down to all new 3D models for entire new part sets.Well worth whatever it is selling for!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								10/10Kerbal Space Program just might be the game of my life! For someone who is passionate about space exploration, there is simply nothing that even comes close. An enormous sandbox in which you can plan and design your own missions. However ambitious you're feeling, you can think of a mission that will REALLY challenge you. And when you finally reach the goal you had set for yourself, you will feel a tremendous sense of pride and accomplishment. This game can be exquisitely complex, which definitely makes it a niche title - but it's really what makes it so good. My biggest mission to date took me 16 hours, of which roughly 10 were spent designing my gigantic rocket. I like to use real formulae for thrust to weight, planetary transfers, terminal velocity, etc. and plan the entire mission before leaving ground, and not use auto-pilot (mechjeb is what most people use and it can be incredibly helpful). I'm a masochist like that. This game is so good that I try not to play, or else I cannot stop and will not go to bed ever.Even in early access, this game has everything it needs. Make sure you google and search through the numerous mods, which can increase realism and add many features (comm networks, planetary scanning, mining operations, GPS, telescopes, enhanced aerodynamics, to name just a few).Simply incredible.

								I think i'll begin this review of Kerbal Space Program with a few stories of things I have done in the game.  First is the quest I had to assemble a modular outpost on the Mun.  Complete with living quarters a solar array/battery bank.  It also had O2 and CO2 storage and a converter.  Finally I added the Kethane(Methane) drilling rig and a plant to convert it to usable rocket fuel.   Next up was the journey to research science from near sun.  I flew a space probe to various altitudes near the sun.  Starting at 1 million km, next 100km, and finally 10,000m.  The last altitude I discovered a fun glitch in the game where the suns gravity accelerated my probe to near the speed of light and it shortly disintegrated.At its core Kerbal Space Program (KSP) is a physics simulation of a solar system and the player is given pieces to make rockets and explore the stars.  Of course there is sandbox mode where all parts are available and the player doesn't have to worry about money or unlocking more advanced parts.  In sandbox the only objective are ones the player must create.  But the real fun starts in career mode that was recently updated to give the player contracts to give them various objectives.  Also part of career mode is the need to balance money and reputation.  The way to unlock better and more advanced parts in career is by performing science.  Of course you might be leary of KSP being early access, but I will say that in terms of content the game is amazing.  I'd buy it in its current state ten times over.  However if you're still not satisfied one of the games biggest strengths is the dedicated modding community.  Want to only focus on building ships and let the autopilot launch and land your crafts.  Theres a mod for that.  Want to add even more rocket parts, the ability to build and connect space crafts.  Theres a mod for that.  Want to make the game super realistic and add O2, CO2, and a realistic atmosphere where your ship can and will burn up during re-entry.  Or you could add Kethane, the games equivalent to Methane, that you can mine and make rocket fuel on distant planets.  Well you see where this is going :)Finally my criticisms.  The biggest one that I hope gets worked on by the devs is optimization.  The physics engine only utilizes a single core of your CPU.  This is frustrating because I have an AMD CPU and not only does it struggle with single core vs Intel but the game doesn't take advantage of my multi core CPU.  Remember that sweet moon station I mentioned, well it got too big and the game ran at ~11 FPS near my station.  Secondly if you install a bunch of mods the games takes a while to load.  Overall if you love Lego and space exploration KSP is an amazing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal Space Program a game where you stuff little kerbals into a poorly designed space ship and see what happens. If you strip this game down to the bare min it is a space simulator. But if you add all the different features included with this it makes the game really fun and exciting. What I find about ksp which makes it so great is that it makes hard complicated science of knowing how a ship is built and what to do when its moving into small bitesized peices so that it doesn't overwhelm the player and just make the game not fun. For me I found this game really fun to play with all the features it has because I enjoy science after few hours of playing I found myself learning how orbits work and how a spaceships work. I find any simulator I play I end up wanting to know more about it. If a campaign added makes the game even more fun to play. The game brings a lot of expermenting and doesn't just tell the player everything which adds to the enjoyment of sending kerbals into rockets and letting them go flying. I would defintly recommend this game it would be my best buy really fun and enjoyable to play even due it is £19.99 i got every penny out of it. I would rate this 9/10 lets you be a rocket scienceist with knowing to much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								What an amazing project to date. Squad has been regularly updating their game as well as giving credit to the modding community which has been a pleasure to see. I personally do not have any skills in creating mods but seeing a modding community working with a game has always been a good sign that a game has become worth looking at. I also like seeing a company that gives back to people on a regular basis which I can say that Squad is also doing. At minimum by creating a ""game"" that creates a fun learning environment and giving this to schools is remarkable. I would love to see this project help teach those who will run the future that space is necessary for our future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Your chance to become a rocket scientologist, kerbonaut, pilot and explorer. Despite the game being under developement it is a brilliant piece, real fun to play. With addons it is even better. If you like either a challange or want a casual flight you can have both.Ad: The game has undergone a lot of improvements and it is a bit more complex now. I quite praise the new level with money and contracts altough good old sandbox and science only options are still avialable. It definately is one of the best games I have played in the past decade, complicated if you don´t know what to do but you can learn by trial and error, or from Scott Manley channel on youtube, but since the game also runs in windowed mode it is easy to get on time information how to make a gravity turn, hohmann transfer, plane change, gravity slingshot etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game is amazing and if you are thinking about buying it, you should. It is still in development and the developers are adding many new features in 2014, among them are big ticket features such as multiplayer are planned. The community is very helpful and there is a large proportion of mods and tutorials available online. If you enjoy sandbox oriented games, do not look far, for this game has both sandbox and objective oriented modes. Bugs do happen, but are not as frequent and disastrous as one might expect, and often go unnoticed. Kerbal Space Program is well rounded, often humorous, and overall fun and easily enjoyable. I myself took almost a solid 10 hours getting to the Mün, and while it was extremely painful to watch myself fail time and time again, it was enjoyable to just build vehicles bound only by physics.

								Kerbal Space Program is one of my ""Games of the Generation"" for whatever that may be worth (the other one is a certain game with Souls that are Dark...you know.)I will skip what KSP is, to make it short, a Space Program Simulator. You build Spacecraft like Rockets, Landers and Rovers and try to get them to other celestial bodies in the simulation...or you can mess around with your creations and create huge deadly fireworks, that works too ;)What makes KSP so special to me is the sense of achievement it conveys when you finally get something right. Let me make this clear right away, KSP is not a simple or easy game. Your first hours will consist of hillarious failiure (if you don´t consult any guides). But once you get your first stable orbit, it feels like you really achieved something, which you did, getting a functional spacecraft in orbit is NOT easy for a beginner. And it only gets more complex AND awesome from there. In Sandbox-Mode, you have no goals beside the ones you set for yourself. Want to go to the furthes planet and set up a network of probes there? You can do it...if you can do it ;)KSP consists of two main modes while you play: Building your vessels and then launching and controlling them. The cool thing is, KSP is not only fun, it also teaches you some things about Astrophysics, even if the physics here are simplified.Bottom Line:If you like thinkey, slowpaced games that let you build and lead your creations to success, if you AT ALL like Space and the wonderful endeavour that is traveling to other celestial bodies, careful maneauvering and putting your very own flag down on the moon (you can totally do that btw), you HAVE to play Kerbal Space Program, one of the most ambitious, brave and rewarding games about space you will ever play.One final word about Early Access: KSP is in development, yes, but it already offers SO much content and possibilites, let alone Mods for just about anything, that I can see no reason not to jump on the KSP-train right now. The sooner you get it, the sooner you will feel that satisfaction when the blue sky fades, the stars shining brightly above your small vessel while the sound of your rocket slowly gets quieter, only to be replaced by the serene soundtrack and a feeling of awe when you´re confronted with space....you can probably tell how much I like this game ;) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's certainly not without its flaws, as an early access game that is to be expected, but for such a complicated subject such as rocket science to be as amazingly accessible as it is with this game... it truly is remarkable.If you look at the stars and ponder the universe, give this a try.

								If you're thinking about buying this game if you have not purchased it yet... Let me give you a few reasons why it is worth getting. Positive • Extremely fun• Gather more information about aircrafts/rockets • Watching the faces at the bottom right = gg wp• Freebuilding any aircraft/rocket to go any planet or maybe just to freeroam in space• Mods• Not many bugsNegative• Can be difficult to learn • Can be very time consuming • Does take a while to get science points which is used to unlock parts for rockets/aircraftsOverall ReasonOkay so there isn't so much to add to the lists above but what I can say is that this game is absolutely beautiful to play. It feels amazing when you first ever orbit the kerbal earth or when you first ever land on the moon using the rocket/aircraft you have created. You can also be very creative with everything you make, who knows? you could make a flying UFO or maybe a really tiny rocket which could possible reach the 'mun'. WORTH THE BUY :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game has the most entertaining sand-box style gameplay I have enjoyed in years and that's just scratching the surface!I have learnt more about space and orbital dynamics from a few hours playing this, than I did during my entire education; and enjoyed every explosion packed second of it.I can't recommend this game enough to players of any age. It's an instant classic and just keeps improving with every update.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I never knew flying out into space in a cardboard box could be so tranquil and beautiful.This is probably my favorite game on Steam; I have had it for a little while now (since about v0.14).  I have put many hours into KSP and yet I still don't know how to describe the character and depth this game has to offer.  It is perfectly situated in that place where silliness and fiction meet complex science and math to form a uniquely fantastic game.  The creative graphics, gameplay and interface are very well in tune with each other and work in tandem quite effectively. The community add-ons greatly enhance the experience and are a must-have for those who like to spice up their missions.  The mod base is so extensive, you can incorporate everything from epic science modules and probe paraphernalia to loads of different rocket engines, solar panels, and landing gear.Most importantly however, you can in fact launch a kerbal into orbit, deorbit him, and watch him burn up in the atmosphere until he hits the ground at 120 meters per second.  Of course, if he lands head-first, it is interesting to watch as his indestructible helmet propels him several hundred meters back into the air.Overall, I believe that KSP is for gamers of all types and can be suited very easily to the user.  I can live with the cons because they're all either bound to be fixed or don't even matter anyways.  I always keep coming back for more kerbal adventures.Solid 100/10 because it makes me chuckle			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Space; the final frontier. We might not be able to explore our solar system, launch countless space stations and monsterous rockets in real life, but virtually anything is possible in Kerbal Space Program. This is ultimately how an early access game should be done, and I'm writing this on the launch day of 1.0 as it's coming out of Beta. It's come a long way with a massive community of modders out there, which thankfully are not going to turn into paid mods--and developers who listen to, as well as have hired members of the community to help with the game. It can be relentless, it can be fun, and at times hilarious. Whether you're an absolute beginner, have some rudimentary knowledge of rocketry--this can be great for people of all playing styles and ages. You also don't have to dedicate a whole lot of time--jump in for 5 minutes, or a few hours. Want to just blow up rockets? That's fine. Space Station nut with no goal of exploration? You're missing out, but that's fine too. Are you like me and love building entire networks of probes and satellites? Ah, that's fun and quite the challenge. The experience is quite something unique, and I can't recommend this enough. Pick it up as soon as you can.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I originally played this game about 2 years ago and absolutely loved it. Tho, at the time, resources (from my wallet) were low. Soooo... I went the underground route and got the game from other means. I loved it so much and played for the longest time. 300 plus hours on this game. I recently uncovered the game again and fell inlove once again, the new updates were amazing, tho at this time my funds were still low. But finally, I was able to work up enough means to get quite a few games, KSP at the top of the list. The game is amazing, I'll list my Pro's and Con's below (cons being low)Pros:Vast universe with amazing details.Great physicsUpdates aren't cheesy!Funny little green guysSo much to do, new things to craftExtremely addictiveCons:No multiplayer (yet)Not enough green guysFor some reason when you multiply speed whilst lifting, u go boom.All in all, this game is amazing, and you should so totally get it9.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been with KSP since 0.23 back in 2013, and with version 1.0 recently released, I am amazed by how persistently awesome this game/simulator has been. Although I think it would have been better to fix the technical problems in the game before the 1.0 release, this game is miles better than the average Early Access game. It's DRM-free, easily-moddable, and delivers realistic simulation, and hence it sets an example to all other games and simulators.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Pros Absolutely Beautiful: The visuals in this game, even unmodded, are stunning. I particularly enjoy flying a ship into orbit around the Mun, going into cockpit view and watching Kerbin rise over the horizon.Something should also be said about the seemlessness of transitions between the surface of planets and the solar system at large. With zero loading screens, you can go from the surface of a planet, to orbit, to an inter-planetary flight, to another orbit, to the surface of another planet. This is, frankly, pretty amazing.Challenging: The feeling of finally being able to step out onto the surface of the Mun, after hours of failed attempts at getting into orbit, after countless revisions in rocket designs... Words fail me. But it gets exponentially better with each milestone you pass.The new campaign mode adds a lot to the challenge level as well. Having limits set on the amount of weight you can launch, having to balance the cost of your flights against your program's budget. It definitely adds a new dimension to the game that's a lot of fun. Cons The campaign mode, at least the last time I played, is somewhat lacking in content. Also, there isn't much to do on other planets. There are missions to set up extra-planetary bases and so forth, but once you have them up there, they don't really do much.  Conclusion While the game is still in early access, what they have so far is amazing, and almost worth the price all on its own. I'm really looking forward to further updates. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the very few games that will make me laugh like an idiot. One time was when I decided to simply stick a bunch of parchutes on the jet plane I built because I suck at landing. I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off because my silly idea actually worked beautifully, I laughed as I watched the plane drift gently down to the ground. Then there's Jebediah... He's always so damn happy, even if the rocket is exploding around him. :DI love how this game actually has a quite realistic and sophisticated physics simulator but at the same time you can build some truly insane rockets. This is a unique game, I have never played anything like it, and I keep coming back to it, because it always makes me laugh. It doesn't just make me laugh though, I find it very satisfying when my overengineered space craft finally makes into orbit and beyond.If you're looking for a unique game that's guaranteed to make you laugh like an idiot, then you should definitely give this game a try.

												Kerbal Space Program is a game about space. If you're interesting in nothing past CoD of Duty: Goats, then stop reading now.---KSP is complex and realistic (mostly) space travel with a twist: it's clear. So instead of being a sleep-deprivied, coffee-addict flight controller who needs to recite more instructions than should logically be in existance, you are simply given the controls the fly the rocket - WASD, camera, throttle, and so on. There is no clutter.KSP has a lot of freedom in what to do in it. Recently, the Campaign mode was introduced, which tasks you with balancing the reputation, budget, and science developments of the Kerbal Space Program whilst pushing further and further and building up to greater things. If you prefer the simpler things, there is also the Science mode, in which the only restriction is having to unlock all the parts, or the Sandbox, where everything is given with no limitations.The main protagonists in the game are the Kerbals. Assuming you are fine with the prospect of cartoonish, green, panicking astronauts screaming as your rocket flies into mountains at Mach 5, KSP's light-hearted side appeals to everyone. Your little kerbals will grin like children at a Minecraft Convention as they gracefully land on the Mun, or enjoy the views of a gas giant and it's moons. Upon landing, you can plop down a flag and claim this ball of regolith for you: because in KSP, the solar system is yours.KSP has many opportunities. You may endeavour on projects from a reusable shuttle, to a space station, to a moon base. If you have the time and ideas to make something, possibilities await. Assisting this is the diversity of the modding community: it is very large and it should even be noted that many ideas have been incorporated by the devs into the game - like the C7 Aerospace parts, whose creator was hired for the staff to help develop them, and the soon-to-be multiplayer function: something that was off-limits for the staff before, until it was proven by a modification that multiplayer and KSP can indeed go together.The Official KSP forums have areas for user built craft and items, help and assistance, and pictures and discussion. It's worth a visit if you have any questions, need a helping hand, or simply wish to browse the latest craft available.If you're interested by KSP at this point, don't hesitate to consider buying. It's an excellent game and will continue to improve - because it's still in development.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Even though this game is in early devolpment it is fantastic. The Creators are doing a great job of adding new content all the time, and the creation and testing modes of this game are too much fun. I highly reccomend this game, especially if you have any kind of interest in space.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is by far one of the best games I've ever played. It kind of reminds me what Spore could have been!You can really build your rockets from scratch and they will (or will not) fly if the model is nice. It's not a hard game, have very good tutorials and let you be free to reach whatever planets you want!Every planet is different and have stunning visuals, different gravity levels and atmospheres. You can explore all planets using rovers, spacecrafts and rockets made by your own hands! It's really cool and rewarding to make your first ""Mun"" landing or to orbit a far away planet.Sometimes you'll lose Kerbals to terrible accidents or to the lack of fuel or even to bad planned landings and so far, my mission is to rescue them and bring them back home! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With a very healthy community for both support and mods this game has great potential to be one of the few games that I will come back to for years.

								Highly recommend this.It's a bit hard at first, and you'll explode a lot. But exploding and ""failing"" in this game is hilarious!If you're actually planning on getting anywhere though, you should know that you'll have to do a bit of research, reading tutorials etc.Though, if that's fine with you, then you should get this game!

								Do you like rockets? Do you like explosions? Do you like silly green men? Never fear, all are found within!In Kerbal Space Program (KSP), you build rockets and toss them into outer space. Hopefully. Sometimes they explode, sometimes they land in the water a few thousand kilometers away because you were 10 m/s short on your delta-V.Once you get the hang of it, you can make rockets, space planes, trips to the Mun or other planets, or maybe even crash something into the sun if you're feeling the need for a good tan.

												Kerbal Space Program is my absolute favourite game.This game probably won't teach you enough to land a job at NASA, but you will get a better grasp on a wide range of aerospace topics than you will by browsing wikipedia for hours.This game has had it's fair share of controversy in it's development process and may not be updated for a long time. But the game in it's current state is easily good enough for another 200 hours. With a great community and more mods than your average bogan's car, you will always find a mod that can change the way you play. I currently have 52 different mods installed that focus on things from procedural aeroplane and rocket parts to hundreds of different varieties of explosive ordnance.In closing, this game will teach you in-depth space flight mechanics, will give you hundreds of hours of fun and will keep you wildly entertained with it's great community and mod support.10/10 Couldn't recommend more(P.S. Use CKAN for easy mod installation)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best Game Ever!.. In my opinion anyway ;)If you have a background of interest in sandbox and/or simulator games you're sure to get your money's worth of enjoyment out of Kerbal Space Program.The game is renowned for having a truly Everest like learning curve. So if you're a type to be frustrated when things don't work first time round beware.However, at this point the game has a nice set of tutorials to get you going on the basics and some clearly thought out scenarios which you can use to drop you in situations to practice most other things (without going to the trouble of getting those pesky rockets off the launch pad).I have found the game to be relatively low on bugs at this point (although rockets do have a tendency to fall apart on the launch pad sometimes). But as the game is still early access it's safe to assume these will be fixed with time.Overall Kerbal is a Great Game. Lots of depth for those willing to put in the time and the promise of comical failures and explosions for all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fantastic game to burn time on, the constant requirement of science points runs as an incentive to carry on building spacecraft and attempting to land/orbit different worlds. I heard about this game from my friends and was reluctant to get it at first as I didn't know if I would enjoy it, or get a lot out of it. As soon as I got it in the sale I knew that I would definitely pay full price for it. Some better tutorials can be found on YouTube so have a look there if you're stuck. Personally I love this game, it keeps me hooked in whenever I start to play it, getting into the orbit of different celestial bodies is always a challenge and landing on them even more so. Also having to consider the levels of fuel, your craft weight, drag and many other elements are just features of this game that make it successful. I've had moments where I've thought, ""I fancy going on KSP for a couple of minutes"" a couple hours later I'm soaring around the solar system attempting to collect as many science points as possible before I return to Kerbin. Seriously a fantastic game whether you want to play it genuinely or just want to burn a bit of time. I highly recommend this and if you're into your space stuff then this is the perfect game.I rate it a good 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very good game. I have started playing it in early acces, when you stil had to land on the engine nozzle.You can fly little green peaple to space (or fail). Land on moons and Planets or cruise in your plane.The editor for the spacecrafts is well done and easy to learn.The physics are very nicely done. They are realistic enough for a simulation and you wil learn a lot of  astrophysics, yet they are simplified enough to make a fun game.It may be a bit much, when you first dive into the game, because it is rocket science after all. I would recommend watching tutorials on youtube alongside the game.There are some Performance issues. Sometimes the framerate drops and you will experience some glitches and bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best game ever. Not only will this entertain you with its magnificent explosions. It will also educate you about astronavigation and the mechanics of space travel. It will continue to seduce you to try to build that ultimate spacecraft. And with a thriving community of mod makers the parts that this game comes with are really just the tip of the iceberg.If rocket science secretly tempts you. Try this out. Many people working at NASA and ESA have gone before you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Definitely one of the top 10 games in 2013. This game blew up once it hit YouTube and Steam. Just like Minecraft, it got it's success from other people talking and sharing about it. In this game you get to make spaceships and fly them to different planets and moons. This game has a lot of modding capabilities to it, so it allows you to add, take out, or edit almost anything in the game; like items and bodies in the solar system. At default, the game has set bodies in the solar system which are about 10 times less distant in game as they are in real life (but don't take this as a negative, it is perfect like this). If you want a real challenge, people have made a mod to correct the distances of planets. Modding capabilities in this game are infinite. This game allows anyone to become the astronaut they always wanted to be. I would highly recommend buying this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal Space Program is the ultimate game of exploration, but once you get beneath the suface it is so much more than that. You are your own space program.  Dream it, build it, fly it for better or for worse. You will find yourself wanting to learn the complexities of orbital mechanics. You will find yourself designing larger and more complex things. You will never forget that first time you land on The Mun and live. Then you will discover it's wonderful community. The devs that listen and interact with it. You will find yourself waiting anxiously for each and every patch with glee knowing that this is still the early days. It is well on it's way to being one of the greatest games ever made and just continues to get better. This will be the 'it' game in due time and in this time of games becoming dumber it is nice to play a game that decides to be complex and  difficult. It will capture your imagination, test your mind and allow you to fulfill all of those childhood dreams of reaching for the stars. Get this game and shoot for the heavens. You won't regret it.

								Probably one of my favourite games of all time! An AWESOME space program-simulator!I have never experienced the sense of achievment like this in any other game. It's a hard game, but worth every moment of frustration and explosions. I strongly reccomend this game for any people who are interested in space exploration, aerodynamics, exploration, a good challenge and good laughs.Even though the game is far from finnished development-wise, it has a broad gameplay. I'm now playing ""my third update"" of the game, and the changes has been good and many in that short amount of time.EDIT: Actually this game is so AWESOME that I bought it two times! One time on their homepage, one time on Steam. Most enjoyable alpha of a game ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is my favorite  steam game that I own. It is really cool designing your own Rockets and Planes, flying to other planets, docking on your space station and adding new scientific tools or even simply going around the moon on a rover. I would definitely recommend this game as it combines science with fun. This game is extremely realistic in almost all the areas including orbit mechanics and other areas like aerodynamic drag. Some parts are unrealistic like there is no re-entry heat in the regular game but if you go to KerbalSpacePort.com which is created by Kerbal Space Program, you can get many mods which add alot to the game. If you wanted to simulate re-entry, get the deadly re-entry mod and be sure to put Heat Shields on your space ship. If you want more plane parts, get B9 Aerospace. For more rocket parts, I recommend KW Rocketry. You can find a mod for almost everything from new parts to new things you can do like creating a map of the planets with a satellite and then using it to find a cool place to land. This game gets a 5/5 rating from me and since it is only in Beta, I expect more to come since already, this looks like an official game. ~Mountain Lion~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of my all-time favorite games that I own...The more you play, the more you learn; and with Kerbals running around, you can use your expanding knowledge to hurl them deeper into space aboard their 'precision built' space vehicles.Building is half the fun, and successfully returning from another planet is probably the most satisfying part of the game experience.Challenge yourself by playing the career version. You will learn to use parts much more efficiently and it will motivate you to get to each moon and planet as your parts will allow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As for those who are not so okay with technical or physics things it's an opportunity to learn it's basics (and more advanced later on). I have lots of fun playing this game. Performace-wise it's running acceptable on my laptop although i must say that with more advanced crafts its basically 8fps till you loose some parts and get into orbit. Even thou - lots of fun!

								Very fun game!Highly original and addictive.Game PlayVery original. This game is very interesting as it fells like a simulator, but plays like a game.The game is very flexible and you can do just about anything! This game is also great if you are in any way interesting in physics, space exploration and of course rocket science.*Note: The game's physics aren't perfectly accurate as they only take into account one body at a timeGraphicsthis game looks very nice! The planets and effects look good and the parts have a fair amount of detail (though I wish they we a bit higher res). Though the game can be hard to run (see next part).Performance and DevelopmentThe game is in Early Access so it's for ever changing. As of when this review was made the game is only 32 bit (A full 64 bit version is in the works but is quite buggy). If you don't know what that meant here is an explanation (www.techsupportalert.com/content/32-bit-and-64-bit-explained.htm) The game's campaign is just starting to be implemented (with the new science system) and if the game doesn't have what you want check the modding scene.ModdingThis game is very mod friendly. Though it doesn't have an API it has a official modding website (with improvements in the works). The modding community is very active with LOTS of new parts and better aerodynamics and more game play.If this game looks interesting to you in any way I would say it's worth your money!

								This game is super cool. For all of those that ever dreamed of being an astronaut or working for nasa you will enjoy this. Wether you use math and physics to build your rocket (you can actually do this) or just slap as many engines and fuel canisters on it as possible, the crazy kerbals will bring you hours of amusement and fun. You will not regret getting this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very very challenging game, but rewarding in the end. The majority of your time spent in this game will be just designing rockets that don't blow up on the launch pad. Once you get a good design, you can see about getting it in the air, and better- space. After that you can set destination to many realistic planets and test your hand at inerstellar travel. A must have for sandbox fanatics, but a little rough around the edges.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This game, Is one of my favorites games of all time, I played since september 2012, the gameplay mechanics of this game, are like no other game I have seen before, Its idea of going to space, Landing in other celestial bodies, building a base, creating a space station, doing science, doing orbital mechanics, crashing with things and planets, messing around, experimenting and looking what happens when you do an action or a different thing because you are curious ( because that is an animal instinct), that type of things, that type of things you find in a sanbox, are quite unique... mabye they represent you in a way you express yourself. ""Sandbox in space: floating around, and crashing around""  -The game's art-style is quite good, the ""Kerbals"" and their ""quite advanced spacecrafts"".-The sound is not something to hate, The music is from royalty free, so it isnt unique.-The graphics arent next-gen, they run very well at unity, they're well done-The controls arent to complicated , I mean they are simple, they arent like flight simulator X.The concept is simple, but the gameplay is sort of complex if you are a newbie, the game itself is somewhat hardcore mostly if you are a casual gamer, or you add mods that complicate your life. This games isnt for everybody and you might♥♥♥♥♥♥off.first I got to say, this game is still in alpha and paying 30 dollars might not be worth it, but it might be, it depends on you, if you are a person who is curious and you love space and little bit of physics, I highly recomend this game, if you are a preson who dosent like space, and dosent like physics and any stuff like that, I recomend you this game, THIS Game even if you buy it and you find it wasnt worth it , It was worth it because this game is like no other and a new experience is always worth it. If you cant afford this game, I still recomend it to you, you can play the demo or download it pirate, BUT having this game and helping the developers is ALWAYS GOOD.My final verdict of this game, Its    94/100 Even if it hasn't an orignal music ( except of one), Its idea complements Mostly everything, this innovation is unique.

								The Game's only just officially been released in Beta, but had it never been updated again I could have played it as a finished game (though somewhat lacking in terrain details, i.e. trees etc).KSP is hard, I found it quite a steep learning curve from the usual games I play. Getting to grip's with correct weight distribution, centre of lift and mass, trajectory etc. Its all new to me coming from games such as Eve Online, War Thunder or generic FPS's. But given some time, you soon get to grips with the game, more through trail and error in my case, and it really shines.Some people are incredible at designing and building enormous craft, creative designs, technical and brilliant, and can, using mods, even colonise other planets and celestial bodies in the game. I myself, have successfully landed on Mun just the once and returned (on my first try luckily!), and that's about the best i've managed! KSP's modding community really is incredible, and KSP's developers have invested time looking into the more popular mods for the game and have even incorporated them into the newer releases! They have applauded the inginuety of the community and have taken on all constructive criticism, and have really built an incredible game.I can whole heartedly recommend this game, for the more serious sim gamer, or for those wanting a bit of fun building a rocket and blowing little Kerbels up. If you're creative you will love KSP, just make sure you have a decent CPU if you want to build anything too crazy!This game is still (technically only just) in Beta, but already feels like a finished game, and although I got it a incredibly reduced price in a Humble Bundle package, I would pay the market price, and even more, still knowing it's in Beta.10 Jebs out of 10.

								This is one of the games that you will either love or hate depending on the one who plays it. There is no action here, no twisted plot, no wepons. Different games exploit different human drives. I guess this one exploits you drive of curiosity and learing. Its about exploration and tinkering, experimenting and laughing about the results. And allthough I am not that fond of games without clear purpose at the end, this one makes me come back. Its fun and that's more than enough for me. How about a 3 stage rocket with a Kerbin as a last stage(and then watch how he reenters the athmosphere)? Can you make a Rocket with 6 solid fuel boosters in series fly? Can you reach the Mun? If you find those questions intriguing, then buy it, it will be worth you while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This easily one of the best games ive ever played.  It is still in early access on steam and ive been playing it since even before it was that, when it was only available through the developers website.I havent played enough of the career mode yet to really comment on it, but the sandbox mode is where the game really shines.  You build epic spaceships from scratch and then launch them, they will almost certainly explode, and so you modify it and try again.  This constant redesigning and retrying feels normal, you dont feel like you are losing or are rubbish at the game, you feel that you can get it to work with just one more try, then eventually you get into space, then into orbit, then to a moon or another planet and the satisfaction never really goes away, you just want to keep going further.I cannot recommend this game enough, if you like space games or simulation games, or even just time waster games then this is the game for you.

												I had long since held an interest in the early days of space exploration. When I was a kid, it thrilled me to read about Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom launching their Mercury capsules into space.Kerbal Space Program is a game that captures the spirit of space exploration perfectly.It is a very simple game to play, and yet it offers a huge depth of possible content, allowing the player to literally build their own space program from the ground up.What more can be said? Yes the development has had it's teething problems, but the developers have continued to support this game beyond even my own expectations.If you are interesed in space exploration at all, Kerbal Space Program is a must-have game.

And with the thousands of mods available, the possibilities are virtually endless.Now that it's been officialy backed by NASA, this is definately a game you should look into if you'd like to make your dreams take flight.And don't worry; there's plenty of potential for explosions.

								It's obvious from the popping-up of my friends' list that lots of people are playing Kerbal Space Program.  Never-the-less, I avoided it until recently because the little green Kerbals made the game appear to be a whimsical and smirking jaunt more appropriate for a fan of 'The Sims' (oh look my guy is peeing on the floor! Haha!) than for the hardened gamer whose enjoyment of games is based mostly on his level of personal annihilation while playng, like myself.Two days later, when the tail of my robe gets caught in the castor of my computer chair, I curse and tug on it a couple of times, but decide to leave it because my launch window is about to close.  Burn!  Full prograde burn!  I'm frantically watching my liquid fuel deplete and trying to stay on target as I burn for home, my onboard computer full of data I collected from my first successful landing on Duna.  I can already imagine what technologies I might unlock with the trove of scientific knowledge I've picked up on this flight.  I collected temperature and barometric pressure readings at several altitudes in Duna's thin atmosphere, I collected surface samples from two different substrates, I have a pod full of goo reacting strangely to the radiation in space, damnit I have to get home!  My robe is still caught in the wheel and the cat is eating his food out of the can.  Anhillation level: high.Is Kerbal Space Program a whimsical jaunt?  Yes, but is also a deep and involving sim where you are creating the story of your space program as you play.  I recently landed on the Mun (the moon) and recued a marooned Kerbal who'd crash landed there on one of my earliest missions.  I planted a flag saying ""Bob Kerman was here 636 days escaped to space.  Tell Kelly Frears, Memphis TN I love her.""  I've fretted over what technologies to unlock and had a blast piecing together launch vehicles and watched in horror as they broke apart during staging before breaking atmo, pounded my desk in triumph as my lander touched down after dropping my first rover on the Mun.  Career mode is the only mode I have played, collecting science and earning money completing contracts, e.g. testing a new parachute high in the atmosphere for the manufacturer, but if you are more of a creative tinkerer who needs to be unhinged, other game modes exist where you don't need to manage cash or unlock tech.  I highly recommend this game in its current state of pre-release 0.25 (i think).  It is already more of a game than most finished products.  Evey feature implemented works and adds to the experience, nothing is broken and there is loads more on the way.  I'll try to get my robe untangled by the time they release multiplayer.

								Mun or bust!  Put those solid fuel boosters on that capsule and send mastermind Jebediah Kerman on a trip to.. whatever it is you hit in space!In Kerbal Space Program you're put in charge of a Space Center run by Kerbals, the inhabitants of Kerbin, a race so eager to explore space they'd put rockets on everything.Your job is to build Rockets, Rovers, Space-Planes.. yes, even Space Stations and launch them into Space to explore/ fly-around-in and land (or crash) into and onto Moons, Planets and even Asteroids and build your scientific base there.There's really only one downside, and that's an incredibly steep learning curve. Thanks to an incredible amount of Video and Written Tutorials on the Web, especially Youtube, you're get a hang of it in due time. The game also comes with a few basic tutorials on how to build a ship and maneuvering it in space.It takes a bit of scientific knowledge to understand how moving in space works. Kerbal Space Program (KSP) often refers to scientific terms for things and is proud of itself as being a very realistic presentation of how Space works.If you can get past your early crashes and misbuilt ships, what lies ahead of you is a journey to the stars with your own crew of Kerbals, in your very own Ship towards a Planet you're going to put your flag on.The Game offers a Campaign and a Sandbox mode. In Sandbox you can pretty much do whatever the heck you want. Build a Ship out of infinite materials and try launching it into space, or better, try landing it somewhere. In the Carreer Mode of the Game you need to start with baby steps. Perform some easy things like orbiting, collecting Scientific Data along the way and hiring new Astronauts to help you in your quest for the Stars and gaining new Materials. Slowly explore Space and the many things it has to offer.With lots of user created mods and community created overhauls for Sounds and Textures and a generally booming Modding Community that is also being appreciated and even incorporated into the Games releases you'll never run out of new Materials for building your dream-ship.Now go and conquer those Stars.4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is really cool designing your own Rockets and Planes, flying to other planets, docking on your space station and adding new scientific tools or even simply going around the moon on a rover. I would definitely recommend this game as it combines science with fun. This game is extremely realistic in almost all the areas including orbit mechanics and other areas like aerodynamic drag. Some parts are unrealistic like there is no re-entry heat in the regular game but if you go to KerbalSpacePort.com which is created by Kerbal Space Program, you can get many mods which add alot to the game. If you wanted to simulate re-entry, get the deadly re-entry mod and be sure to put Heat Shields on your space ship. If you want more plane parts, get B9 Aerospace. For more rocket parts, I recommend KW Rocketry. You can find a mod for almost everything from new parts to new things you can do like creating a map of the planets with a satellite and then using it to find a cool place to land. This game gets a 5/5 rating from me and since it is only in Beta, I expect more to come since already, this looks like an official game. ~Mountain Lion~			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of the best games I've ever played.Do you worship space? Do you love rockets? Do you enjoy a nice retrograde burn at 35,000 feet with advanced thrusters made from scrap parts found in Jebediah's junkyard? Then Kerbal Space Program is the game  experience  for you. The possibilities are endless. And when you finally take your first step onto the surface of the Mun, you will feel a thrill that only KSP can provide. Plan it, build it,dream it. Kerbal Space Program.			",229,26,8,19,19,0,9

								One of my all-time favorite games that I own...The more you play, the more you learn; and with Kerbals running around, you can use your expanding knowledge to hurl them deeper into space aboard their 'precision built' space vehicles.Building is half the fun, and successfully returning from another planet is probably the most satisfying part of the game experience.Challenge yourself by playing the career version. You will learn to use parts much more efficiently and it will motivate you to get to each moon and planet as your parts will allow.			",64,9,7,3,17,0,4

								Kerbal Space Program is the ultimate game of exploration, but once you get beneath the suface it is so much more than that. You are your own space program.  Dream it, build it, fly it for better or for worse. You will find yourself wanting to learn the complexities of orbital mechanics. You will find yourself designing larger and more complex things. You will never forget that first time you land on The Mun and live. Then you will discover it's wonderful community. The devs that listen and interact with it. You will find yourself waiting anxiously for each and every patch with glee knowing that this is still the early days. It is well on it's way to being one of the greatest games ever made and just continues to get better. This will be the 'it' game in due time and in this time of games becoming dumber it is nice to play a game that decides to be complex and  difficult. It will capture your imagination, test your mind and allow you to fulfill all of those childhood dreams of reaching for the stars. Get this game and shoot for the heavens. You won't regret it.

												KSP is a physics game which means its not for everyone. It is somewhat technical but thanks to its cartoonish approach funny at the same time.You build your rocket or your plane in the hangar, go to the launchpad/runway and watch it fly ( or die trying ). The graphics are pretty basic but that has no negative impact on the game for me (i for one prefer a good game to good looks).It can be somewhat repetitive. You're going to repeat ALOT of your flights until they yield the results you set out for but with the tinkering in between trying to optimize your design its okay for me.There are 3 gameplay-modes to choose from. 1) Sandbox: just build what you want and let it fly. 2) Science: Get scientific data from different locations to advance your rockets like various climate zones of your own planet, in flight, in orbit, heck even swimming in the ocean and in space of course. Just worry about the data no matter the costs. 3) Career: You pretty much run the whole show yourself if its science/piloting/managing/work on contracts etc.For me it was totally worth it and im not done yet. :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As an avid fan of technology and engineering, I absolutely LOVE Kerbal Space Program. The game provides a fairly accurate portrayal of space flight mechanics. Also, the modding community for this game is one of the best I've ever come across. Anyone who wishes to learn more about this game should check out the following streamers on Twitch.tv: KSPTV, EJ_SA, DasValdez, Shimmythejj, and Kofeyh. These streamers, as of this posting, are regular KSP streamers who are quite good at explaining how the game works and can teach the basic concepts of orbital mechanics very very well.

												BEST. GAME. EVER. GO SQUAD GO!!!!!!!!!1!!!!!!!!!!!one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :DWell, apart from the sheer fanboyism, lets get serious, because this game deserves it. I have been playing this since the early builds before getting it on Steam, so i calculate i have well over 3000 hours logged total.  And if you expect flight action, or fancy cutscenes and effects, or a more casual game based on surreal spaceship propulsion systems, this game is not for you. Really. This game requires you to actually use your brain and learn things. It is disguised graphically as a cute little sandbox with them kerbals and fun explosions, but the truth is that this is a realflight rocket, spaceship, plane, and orbital simulator. Which means you will need to LEARN in a relatively DIFFICULT way things like orbital mechanics, manouvers, how to rendezvous and dock ships in orbit manually, and that kind of things. Expect a HIGH learning curve. Which in my humble opinion is worth its weight in diamonds in this world of stupid games we live in, but i digress. The game makes you learn things about space, spaceships, real propulsion systems, aerodinamics, and in general how things are done in real life with rockets and satellites, spaceplanes and such.... really i have no words that make it justice.If your are an all things space aficionado, or always wanted to be, this game is a no brainer great choice for you. Plus Squad are great guys that are always improving the game in giant steps, like the recent comms net and satellite signal system, and you can always expect improvements. And also the communitiy is great, the mod scene is greatly supported... It's all good! Go get it!!My only little grudge with it is that it still has no real habitat and life support simulation, appart from G force or heat exposure, but everything will eventually come, as always  :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Kerbal Space Program is a game thats easy to play hard to master, understanding Delta-v, Gravity assists, rendezvous and many other technical and physic base technique. But man oh man it's fun. I can only play it for short bursts due to the fact that it strains my mind, but they are rewarding for the effort and psyche that you put into it. I recommend reading the in game Wiki or watching Youtube videos before frustrating yourself. If you are a enthusiast on the subject of aerospace then I implore you to try this game.

								The only game I have ever played that, when successfully building and launching a rocket to then deploy a lander on the moon followed by an elaborate docking process once back in space led to an ambitious return to the home planet without killing any of my crewmen, gave me a TRUE sense of personal accomplishment that has rivalled real-life accomplishments. That may sound lame to some of you who are not hardcore about gaming, while it may sound strange to you hardcore gamers who find accomplishment in successes from other games. I tell you this being a 29-year old gamer veteran of 25 long years (Tandy PC jr., TI Home Computer, Amiga, Commodore 64, and Atari 2600 for starters) who has seen many games come and go. I'm sure that Kerbal may not be a true pioneer of the sandbox sim, yet I have never met a game that has kept me riveted to my PC for as long as this one.Kerbal can create an experience never lived for most of you who grew up wanting either to be an astronaut or a rocket scientist (or both!) and presents it in a fashion that is otherwise unattainable in any other media form. The creation process can be frustrating and unforgiving, between the thrust/mass/control coefficients and the staging management ensuring your success/demise right at the paddock, yet always gives a personal sense of enjoyment when your self-concocted combination of (loosely) held together parts engineered for home plumbing/rocketry when it finally does work out and you break that atmospheric threshold between Kerbin and space.The graphics are solid; with a moderate gaming laptop or mediocre desktop PC, this game can still shine. The only time I have run into issues with my Ivy Bridge i7 with 670MX GPU laptop running all features @1080p is when I created a six-part space station with lighting fixtures in low orbit (125 km). This causes some choppy camera effects which can easily be resolved with lowering res or AA.The physics are unmatched; the way each rocket adds mass with thrust, providing an unnerving sense of realism to having too much or not enough on either of these factors. This is a mechanism that other space games should take note of.The story is unnecessary and therefore (so far) omitted. This is an exploration game with no prome directive. If Squad does finalize the game and provide any type of a campaign, it will only be a plus on an already incredible design.The gameplay is certainly something special; you build, launch, stage, deploy, land, and dock to your heart's content! There are also some other great features Squad has done with the R&D facility and science points (it provides a heck of a challenge starting with very little to promote a scientific approach to your exploration and desire for more research). The full solar system exploration will provide countless hours of efforts to send unmanned satellites to the farthest reaches, and perhaps even manned vessels of you are REALLY amibitious. Overall this game, as it stands, is a 10/10 even though there is still so much left for it to improve on but the foundation of what is the single greatest Early Access Game released on Steam certainly surpasses the expectations I could have ever had of it.

												With gametime over 500 hours I thougt I should write a review. I've had this game since it was an early access game, and I still enjoy it a lot. Some mods should be essential such as ""Renaissance Compilation"", it makes the world a lot more realistic and enjoyable. It is difficult for everybody the first time, but with some practise you'll gain experience beyond your imagination. I was so proud the first time I landed on the mun that I snapchatted my friends even if it rolled over to the side. Now I am a quite experienced player and I think almost everything feels too easy. So don't refund the game just because it is hard.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								As an avid fan of technology and engineering, I absolutely LOVE Kerbal Space Program. The game provides a fairly accurate portrayal of space flight mechanics. Also, the modding community for this game is one of the best I've ever come across. Anyone who wishes to learn more about this game should check out the following streamers on Twitch.tv: KSPTV, EJ_SA, DasValdez, Shimmythejj, and Kofeyh. These streamers, as of this posting, are regular KSP streamers who are quite good at explaining how the game works and can teach the basic concepts of orbital mechanics very very well.

Make it prosper by completing contracts and reach ever higher altitudes. Build your bases on another planets. Assemble your orbital stations.

CHECK YOUR STAGING!!...Launches 203rd rocket - Extraplanetary Launchpad finally docked to my Interplanetary hub and it's finally complete (even though the game in running at 10fps with the station loaded), I can run tankers from Duna to fill it up with the metal and fuel!Launches 204th rocket - Full space tanker bound for the IPH (to do trips between the IPH and Duna Station) flips off of the launchpad, crashes into one of the fuel tanks , throws one of the burning boosters into the VAB, blows up both of them, can easily afford to repair, but still.... CHECK YOUR STAGING!!!Absolutely love this game when things go well and find it hilarious/mortifying when things go badly.

								This is one of the best games I have ever played.  It is an indie game and not yet in full release, but the developers are highly communicative with the community and regular updates are released almost always adding major features or bug fixes.  The modding community is extremely dedicated and the developers are highly supportive of it to the point where they have hired several of the best modders straight from the community.I've put over 250 hours into this game since its been on Steam, but that doesn't count the hundreds of hours I put in before it was on Steam.The game is extremely worth it and has an extremely bright future ahead of it.  There is no clear objective system at the moment though, which has turned some people off the game.  I don't believe its coming in the next update but their main priority is currently fleshing out the 'career' mode (as opposed to the sandbox mode that most people play) where there will be objectives, funding, and research.  Research has already been added but it needs some major fixing, which is actually their expressed priority for the coming update.TLDR; The game is very much worth it, if you're interested in spacetravel at all go for it.  The satisfaction of landing on the Mun (Kerbal equivalent of the Moon) on your own for the first time more than makes it worth the cost, not to mention the hundreds of other things there are for you to do.Oh, and if you're still on the fence there is a free demo for you to try.  It only includes a fraction of the parts and celestial bodies that are available in the full version and does not include the career mode, but it gives you a good idea of what the full game is like.

								One of my all-time favorite games that I own...The more you play, the more you learn; and with Kerbals running around, you can use your expanding knowledge to hurl them deeper into space aboard their 'precision built' space vehicles.Building is half the fun, and successfully returning from another planet is probably the most satisfying part of the game experience.Challenge yourself by playing the career version. You will learn to use parts much more efficiently and it will motivate you to get to each moon and planet as your parts will allow.			",64,9,7,3,17,0,4

								Definitely one of the top 10 games in 2013. This game blew up once it hit YouTube and Steam. Just like Minecraft, it got it's success from other people talking and sharing about it. In this game you get to make spaceships and fly them to different planets and moons. This game has a lot of modding capabilities to it, so it allows you to add, take out, or edit almost anything in the game; like items and bodies in the solar system. At default, the game has set bodies in the solar system which are about 10 times less distant in game as they are in real life (but don't take this as a negative, it is perfect like this). If you want a real challenge, people have made a mod to correct the distances of planets. Modding capabilities in this game are infinite. This game allows anyone to become the astronaut they always wanted to be. I would highly recommend buying this game.			",614,153,33,64,83,7,95

								Do you like rockets? Do you like explosions? Do you like silly green men? Never fear, all are found within!In Kerbal Space Program (KSP), you build rockets and toss them into outer space. Hopefully. Sometimes they explode, sometimes they land in the water a few thousand kilometers away because you were 10 m/s short on your delta-V.Once you get the hang of it, you can make rockets, space planes, trips to the Mun or other planets, or maybe even crash something into the sun if you're feeling the need for a good tan.

								Bought this game on a Saturday night after watching some youtube videos about it. By Sunday night I had sunk 15 hours into it and landed Jebediah on Minmus and brought him back with fumes to spare in the tank.This is a very much playable game as is, and Squad (devs) are planning on adding more to it to make it even better. Well worth the money in my opinion.This is a highly detailed game. Yes, you will start of very basic with rockets, but it quickly scales up so that you need to plan stability, lift, mass, etc, before you even hit the launch pad. Youtube will be your friend trying to learn decent builds to get you started, but once you get the basics, the fun is in the experimentation, trying to find what works best for you.I have only begun to scratch the surface, but I am looking forward to spending many hours trying out different builds, different tactics, and try to plant my flag on the surface of any and all planets that I can.

								Sure, it's a game under development. Sure it hasn't got a full campaign yet. Sure it's ridiculously hard to even get a rocket off the ground.But despite all that, this game can bring out your inner astronaut and lead you to build either the most practical or the most insane spaceship ever concieved. And with the thousands of mods available, the possibilities are virtually endless.Now that it's been officialy backed by NASA, this is definately a game you should look into if you'd like to make your dreams take flight.And don't worry; there's plenty of potential for explosions.

Abosultly amazing! There is so much I love about KSP, The Kerbals themselves are funny, theres the learning, I've learned so much about physics, essentially rocket science, also atmospheric flight dynamics(you can also make and fly planes in KSP to, although for me its harder than the rocket science), There comes a great sense of acomplishment when you finally get it right, It is a very challenging game, it really works my brain, to think outside of the box, to be innovative to get the craft to get the job done. There's a great community with this game, here on steam, but my favorite places for all things KSP is reddit /r/kerbalspaceprogram and also KSP offical forums. Theres also Fantastic people like Scott Manley on YouTube, to help you get started with Your Space program. (I still refer to his videos all the time.)KSP does have a STEEP Learning curve, but its worth it.I bought it on sale, but knowing what I do now, I would pay full price, I would pay even more for it.And then theres the mods, which can make the game even better.For a beginning player I would recommend starting out with some of the tutorials(theres more now than when I started), and then experimenting in sandbox mode, then if you feel so inclined jump into career mode, theres where the real challenge lies.I may have other games with more logged hours, but this is probally my favorite game I own.I Love KSP!

								If you like space, rockets, and endangering the lives of little green astronauts, welcome to Kerbal Space Program! This game offers building your own rockets, assembling space stations, shooting satellites into orbit, landing rovers on celestial bodies, and doing all other sorts of SCIENCE! KSP is all about trial-and-error, so you'll need a lot of patience for your many attempts to get anything functional into orbit, but if you have the patience and love anything space-related, this game will not disappoint a bit. With near-endless replayability, constant updates, and beautiful mod support, KSP is the game that keeps on giving.			",52,18,0,4,22,0,13

								This game will make you laugh, cry and is certainly an extremely steep learning curve.But by the time you're through, you'll understand orbital physics, gravity assist, what a 'launch window' actually means, how hard it is to dock two ships together and obviously...how hard it is to hit a ship with a 'missile' [read as: rocket you're bored with after failing docking].Though based around space-travel, you're free to build rockets, planes, planes for space, rockets for...uh..the sea? and rovers.Whether you choose to roam space as a tiny probe exploring each planet and its moons, or doing hard science with Kerbals on the ground taking samples and reading data; the world is truly yours to explore, claim and litter with debris.It's also being updated frequently and has a large modding community.

								I'm not sure what I would say to convince anyone to want to play this game, because it seems to me that you either hear about KSP or watch a video and immediately want to play it, or you do those things and it does not interest you. This is very much a simulator for realistic Newtonian physics and orbital mechanics, with some cute frumpy alien creatures goggling in wonder at the universe thrown in to make you smile.I've played a whole lot of this game. Several orders of magnitude more than it would appear from my profile because I originally purchased the non-steam version (for easier Linux support). I recently purchased a second steam copy, if that says anything about the game. I've played it on all three supported platforms and it works perfectly, even under Slackware Linux. From that I assume it's very distro agnostic.When I started out with the game, the only mode was the Sandbox mode. This can be a little overwhelming to the uninitiated due to the sheer volume of parts to play with. Since then the Career mode has been added, which limits the parts that you can use and requires you to run missions and gain science to research new parts. This allows you to slowly gain an understanding of all of the parts, and is something that really enhanced my enjoyment of the game.In the end, you get out of the game what you're willing to put into it. Even in the career mode, the only objective you have is ""gain science"", so it's up to you to conceive of missions that take you to new places to do that. The game is very much not a guided experience.Do note however that there are a few short training missions that give you the basics of how to build rockets and fly them. What you do with that knowledge is up to you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I give this game a 11/10 rating and I hope you would do the same. Happy launchings!			",10,0,0,0,3,0,1

								Kerbal Space Program is the ultimate game of exploration, but once you get beneath the suface it is so much more than that. You are your own space program.  Dream it, build it, fly it for better or for worse. You will find yourself wanting to learn the complexities of orbital mechanics. You will find yourself designing larger and more complex things. You will never forget that first time you land on The Mun and live. Then you will discover it's wonderful community. The devs that listen and interact with it. You will find yourself waiting anxiously for each and every patch with glee knowing that this is still the early days. It is well on it's way to being one of the greatest games ever made and just continues to get better. This will be the 'it' game in due time and in this time of games becoming dumber it is nice to play a game that decides to be complex and  difficult. It will capture your imagination, test your mind and allow you to fulfill all of those childhood dreams of reaching for the stars. Get this game and shoot for the heavens. You won't regret it.

								Kerbal Space Program is a great game which I first played with my friend who loves space simulators. After a few hours we quickly fell in love with getting rockets lost in space, terrible landings and killing hundreds of kerbals. The entire day and night was lost in this immersive game.The game has since been released on steam (obviously) and we have continued to enjoy hour after hour exploring the solar system. With many successful and failed missions, I have slowly become a better pilot, whilst still enjoying every hour playing the game.I would strongly recommend Kerbal Space Program for anyone, regarless of your intrest in space simulation games. With many updates adding astounding new features, you will fall in love with the many apsects of space travel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One of my all-time favorite games that I own...The more you play, the more you learn; and with Kerbals running around, you can use your expanding knowledge to hurl them deeper into space aboard their 'precision built' space vehicles.Building is half the fun, and successfully returning from another planet is probably the most satisfying part of the game experience.Challenge yourself by playing the career version. You will learn to use parts much more efficiently and it will motivate you to get to each moon and planet as your parts will allow.			",64,9,7,3,17,0,4

												Kerbal Space Program is a game about space. If you're interesting in nothing past CoD of Duty: Goats, then stop reading now.---KSP is complex and realistic (mostly) space travel with a twist: it's clear. So instead of being a sleep-deprivied, coffee-addict flight controller who needs to recite more instructions than should logically be in existance, you are simply given the controls the fly the rocket - WASD, camera, throttle, and so on. There is no clutter.KSP has a lot of freedom in what to do in it. Recently, the Campaign mode was introduced, which tasks you with balancing the reputation, budget, and science developments of the Kerbal Space Program whilst pushing further and further and building up to greater things. If you prefer the simpler things, there is also the Science mode, in which the only restriction is having to unlock all the parts, or the Sandbox, where everything is given with no limitations.The main protagonists in the game are the Kerbals. Assuming you are fine with the prospect of cartoonish, green, panicking astronauts screaming as your rocket flies into mountains at Mach 5, KSP's light-hearted side appeals to everyone. Your little kerbals will grin like children at a Minecraft Convention as they gracefully land on the Mun, or enjoy the views of a gas giant and it's moons. Upon landing, you can plop down a flag and claim this ball of regolith for you: because in KSP, the solar system is yours.KSP has many opportunities. You may endeavour on projects from a reusable shuttle, to a space station, to a moon base. If you have the time and ideas to make something, possibilities await. Assisting this is the diversity of the modding community: it is very large and it should even be noted that many ideas have been incorporated by the devs into the game - like the C7 Aerospace parts, whose creator was hired for the staff to help develop them, and the soon-to-be multiplayer function: something that was off-limits for the staff before, until it was proven by a modification that multiplayer and KSP can indeed go together.The Official KSP forums have areas for user built craft and items, help and assistance, and pictures and discussion. It's worth a visit if you have any questions, need a helping hand, or simply wish to browse the latest craft available.If you're interested by KSP at this point, don't hesitate to consider buying. It's an excellent game and will continue to improve - because it's still in development.			",58,11,0,15,20,3,37

												Been playing this game for years now.  It comes close to having endless replayability.  Not to sound cliche but the only real limits are your imagination and your ability to build and fly the contraptions you create.The first time I played this I played for 26 hours straight without really noticing the time going by, this was back when there was only the Mun to visit and maybe 20 something parts to build with.  Building a complex craft can consume an entire day.  Flying it and getting the ship to its destination can take longer.  Not to say this game is tedious, every step of the way you are challenged in multiple ways as you complete your goals.If you like space, if you have any interest in modern and historic spaceflight and aeronautics then you should check this game out.Its graphics while simple are beautiful.  It is often funny, and always challenging.  Its like lego except you get to take your creations outside and fly them to the moon and beyond.So if a game where you can build a large orbital plane carrier then fly it to a distant moon to launch planes into its atmosphere sounds like something you enjoy, you should try this game.

								If you like space, rockets, and endangering the lives of little green astronauts, welcome to Kerbal Space Program! This game offers building your own rockets, assembling space stations, shooting satellites into orbit, landing rovers on celestial bodies, and doing all other sorts of SCIENCE! KSP is all about trial-and-error, so you'll need a lot of patience for your many attempts to get anything functional into orbit, but if you have the patience and love anything space-related, this game will not disappoint a bit. With near-endless replayability, constant updates, and beautiful mod support, KSP is the game that keeps on giving.			",52,18,0,4,22,0,13

Sure it's ridiculously hard to even get a rocket off the ground.But despite all that, this game can bring out your inner astronaut and lead you to build either the most practical or the most insane spaceship ever concieved. And with the thousands of mods available, the possibilities are virtually endless.Now that it's been officialy backed by NASA, this is definately a game you should look into if you'd like to make your dreams take flight.And don't worry; there's plenty of potential for explosions.

												Imagine, if you will, a space program created by you, driven by you, and fulfilled by you. That's KSP. You throw parts together like a kid with a container full of LEGOs, sometimes with disastrous, sometimes with spectacular, sometimes with wonderful results. Want to see what happens when a plane has its rudder at the nose? You can find out. Want to see what happens when a bunch of hot burning solid rockets are placed right next to liquid fuel tanks? You can find out. Necessity is the mother of invention, and you'll need to be inventive to enjoy the game, but you could find yourself learning some things along the way too. The physics are mostly realistic, scaled down so they're more forgiving of mistakes, but the principles are mostly the same. This doesn't mean the game is hard - it just means the world works by a consistent set of principles. This makes it a lot easier than the ""physics"" in other games, which cheat and flub their way through physics using a cobbled-up set of exclusions and special cases to try and approximate a realistic engine.Word of advice: If you're new to the game, start off in sandbox mode. The other modes are for when you've already learned how the world works, which you'll do by playing in sandbox for a while. Once sandbox is no longer a challenge for you, then start off a new game in career mode. You'll be a hell of a lot happier this way.			",432,106,5,45,44,3,73

								It's obvious from the popping-up of my friends' list that lots of people are playing Kerbal Space Program.  Never-the-less, I avoided it until recently because the little green Kerbals made the game appear to be a whimsical and smirking jaunt more appropriate for a fan of 'The Sims' (oh look my guy is peeing on the floor! Haha!) than for the hardened gamer whose enjoyment of games is based mostly on his level of personal annihilation while playng, like myself.Two days later, when the tail of my robe gets caught in the castor of my computer chair, I curse and tug on it a couple of times, but decide to leave it because my launch window is about to close.  Burn!  Full prograde burn!  I'm frantically watching my liquid fuel deplete and trying to stay on target as I burn for home, my onboard computer full of data I collected from my first successful landing on Duna.  I can already imagine what technologies I might unlock with the trove of scientific knowledge I've picked up on this flight.  I collected temperature and barometric pressure readings at several altitudes in Duna's thin atmosphere, I collected surface samples from two different substrates, I have a pod full of goo reacting strangely to the radiation in space, damnit I have to get home!  My robe is still caught in the wheel and the cat is eating his food out of the can.  Anhillation level: high.Is Kerbal Space Program a whimsical jaunt?  Yes, but is also a deep and involving sim where you are creating the story of your space program as you play.  I recently landed on the Mun (the moon) and recued a marooned Kerbal who'd crash landed there on one of my earliest missions.  I planted a flag saying ""Bob Kerman was here 636 days escaped to space.  Tell Kelly Frears, Memphis TN I love her.""  I've fretted over what technologies to unlock and had a blast piecing together launch vehicles and watched in horror as they broke apart during staging before breaking atmo, pounded my desk in triumph as my lander touched down after dropping my first rover on the Mun.  Career mode is the only mode I have played, collecting science and earning money completing contracts, e.g. testing a new parachute high in the atmosphere for the manufacturer, but if you are more of a creative tinkerer who needs to be unhinged, other game modes exist where you don't need to manage cash or unlock tech.  I highly recommend this game in its current state of pre-release 0.25 (i think).  It is already more of a game than most finished products.  Evey feature implemented works and adds to the experience, nothing is broken and there is loads more on the way.  I'll try to get my robe untangled by the time they release multiplayer.

								Mun or bust!  Put those solid fuel boosters on that capsule and send mastermind Jebediah Kerman on a trip to.. whatever it is you hit in space!In Kerbal Space Program you're put in charge of a Space Center run by Kerbals, the inhabitants of Kerbin, a race so eager to explore space they'd put rockets on everything.Your job is to build Rockets, Rovers, Space-Planes.. yes, even Space Stations and launch them into Space to explore/ fly-around-in and land (or crash) into and onto Moons, Planets and even Asteroids and build your scientific base there.There's really only one downside, and that's an incredibly steep learning curve. Thanks to an incredible amount of Video and Written Tutorials on the Web, especially Youtube, you're get a hang of it in due time. The game also comes with a few basic tutorials on how to build a ship and maneuvering it in space.It takes a bit of scientific knowledge to understand how moving in space works. Kerbal Space Program (KSP) often refers to scientific terms for things and is proud of itself as being a very realistic presentation of how Space works.If you can get past your early crashes and misbuilt ships, what lies ahead of you is a journey to the stars with your own crew of Kerbals, in your very own Ship towards a Planet you're going to put your flag on.The Game offers a Campaign and a Sandbox mode. In Sandbox you can pretty much do whatever the heck you want. Build a Ship out of infinite materials and try launching it into space, or better, try landing it somewhere. In the Carreer Mode of the Game you need to start with baby steps. Perform some easy things like orbiting, collecting Scientific Data along the way and hiring new Astronauts to help you in your quest for the Stars and gaining new Materials. Slowly explore Space and the many things it has to offer.With lots of user created mods and community created overhauls for Sounds and Textures and a generally booming Modding Community that is also being appreciated and even incorporated into the Games releases you'll never run out of new Materials for building your dream-ship.Now go and conquer those Stars.4.5/5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Kerbal space program could quite possibly be the best game i have ever played. and is ground breaking in its own field. the feeling of achievement when you A) build a working rocket. B) get it into orbit. c) send it to another orbiting body D) land it on that orbiting body E) dock the craft, is awesome. every single moment feels like 100%ing any other game (in the words of kennedy) ""not because it is easy, but because it is hard"". and failure in this game is devastating, seeing rockets explode during launch or failing to reach orbit. or crashing during a landing is gutting, mainly because you can see it all going wrong over  a course of time, and such you get attached to it all. every aspect of this game is rewarding.this game is in early access admittedly, this may put some of you off, but do not let it be so, this game is as polished and tidy as most AAA releases these day, there are no microtransactions here, you are buying practically a finished game.this is a must own game, and i wish more games were as rewarding and enjoyable as this			",62,3,6,3,21,3,12

												This game. I love it. The list of things you can do in this game is really long, including, but not limited to:-Flying-Orbiting Stuff-Falling from the sky-Redirecting asteroids so they fall on random things-Crashing into planets-Summoning the Kraken-Download mods ( lightspeed drives, female astronauts, and other cool stuff )-Whatever else you can do with a fleet of gigantic 3000 ton rocket ships, hacks, and your imagination.If you know basic logic, how to open a how to video and how to open your computer files, then you can even easily mod your own things ( invincible astronauts, indestructible ship parts, engines that have unheard of amounts of DeltaV, etc... )Plus, if you plan on becoming an engineer, this game is pretty realistic when it comes to orbits, acceleration, velocities, aerobraking, and other cool physics stuff. I swear my IQ jumped the moment I started playing this game.Although there is no real end game, there are missions and senarios you can complete, however, for me, the sense of accomplishment of landing an asteroid on top of a building is enough for me to become addicted.I've been playing for about 1,800 hours and I have rarely ever become bored of it. There is always something new, something bigger you can do than that of what you have just done. For example, you can fly to space, great, time to make an orbit, next, to the moon, eventually, you're sending colonisation missions to Mars (Duna), the moons of Jupiter (Jool) and Pluto (Eeloo). I would even go as far to say it has influenced my carrer choices, before I started to play this game, I wasn't very sure on what to do as a profession, now, I'm locked on aerospace engineer.Anyway, I hope you like this game.*After release edit:Sill awesome game. I recommend a mod pack called ""realism overhaul"" for all of you realists.			",154,18,2,9,28,0,6

												I would reccomend this game time and time again. It does have a steep learning curve, but stay with it. Everything that goes wrong, is going wrong for a reason.Maybe your ship is pulling hard to the right during launch. something like forgetting to add a fuel line in and the rocket becomes unbalanced as you use fuel in the counter weight compartments. This is one small example. If you stick with it, you'll want to go to the moon sooner or later, and when you finally get your intercept course and come into contact with the Muns gravitation pull. Chances are you'll crash into the moon and explode. Get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, and walk away.But you'll be thinking, ""I can land that"" and you will.Not only until you manage to re-enter Kerbons atmosphere will you realize you forgot to parachutes.Again you will be mad, again...you will do better.Somewhat of a rant.An easy 10/10 though. Worth the money.After another 200+ hours in the game I still say buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Best 'Make your own space program' game ever.  Now with Career mode too.  Build rockets and fly the solar system.  Make spaceplanes and soar to planets.Loads of parts as standard and a great modding community.  Space stations, rovers, bases - All can be yours!& the little green men are awesome too :)			",82,9,5,2,15,3,9

								Lots of fun and joy for people who are ok with basic physics and tech-stuff. Do recommend for those people strongly. As for those who are not so okay with technical or physics things it's an opportunity to learn it's basics (and more advanced later on). I have lots of fun playing this game. Performace-wise it's running acceptable on my laptop although i must say that with more advanced crafts its basically 8fps till you loose some parts and get into orbit. Even thou - lots of fun!

								Very fun game!Highly original and addictive.Game PlayVery original. This game is very interesting as it fells like a simulator, but plays like a game.The game is very flexible and you can do just about anything! This game is also great if you are in any way interesting in physics, space exploration and of course rocket science.*Note: The game's physics aren't perfectly accurate as they only take into account one body at a timeGraphicsthis game looks very nice! The planets and effects look good and the parts have a fair amount of detail (though I wish they we a bit higher res). Though the game can be hard to run (see next part).Performance and DevelopmentThe game is in Early Access so it's for ever changing. As of when this review was made the game is only 32 bit (A full 64 bit version is in the works but is quite buggy). If you don't know what that meant here is an explanation (www.techsupportalert.com/content/32-bit-and-64-bit-explained.htm) The game's campaign is just starting to be implemented (with the new science system) and if the game doesn't have what you want check the modding scene.ModdingThis game is very mod friendly. Though it doesn't have an API it has a official modding website (with improvements in the works). The modding community is very active with LOTS of new parts and better aerodynamics and more game play.If this game looks interesting to you in any way I would say it's worth your money!

The game is excellent in my opinion, and I would happily play it again, except that I've found it's somewhat hard for those who have not seen the game before to pick up and play. I believe a tutorial should come in an update soon though, so I would qualify this game as a must buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Its been in early access for a matter of years now, its had a slow and steady pace of development but its remained in a playable and worth-the-money state. Its not a space sim, or an RTS. Actually to an extent it IS a space sim, but the whole goal is to build a rocket that is space worthy, taking into account fuel, weight, aerodynamics and position in orbit.3/5			",166,14,2,20,15,3,8

												Been playing this game for years now.  It comes close to having endless replayability.  Not to sound cliche but the only real limits are your imagination and your ability to build and fly the contraptions you create.The first time I played this I played for 26 hours straight without really noticing the time going by, this was back when there was only the Mun to visit and maybe 20 something parts to build with.  Building a complex craft can consume an entire day.  Flying it and getting the ship to its destination can take longer.  Not to say this game is tedious, every step of the way you are challenged in multiple ways as you complete your goals.If you like space, if you have any interest in modern and historic spaceflight and aeronautics then you should check this game out.Its graphics while simple are beautiful.  It is often funny, and always challenging.  Its like lego except you get to take your creations outside and fly them to the moon and beyond.So if a game where you can build a large orbital plane carrier then fly it to a distant moon to launch planes into its atmosphere sounds like something you enjoy, you should try this game.

								Oh god, c'mon! Is a game where you can build your own rockets to defy gravity, for real! I mean, is hard and that but it can give you a nice experience. When the rocket pass throught the upper atmosphere to the endless space you're like: ""Ommm, this is so beaaaaaaaautiful... And i made it with my own clumsy design!"". Join to Jebbediah Kerman and his pals to an endless adventure to reach all the planets you can (and gathering science which is the most annoy thing to get... Seriously, who is the smart guy which his decision was to give that little science for an orbital mission?)."" The point is: ""A good game if you can do magic or if you really love rocketry.""

												With gametime over 500 hours I thougt I should write a review. I've had this game since it was an early access game, and I still enjoy it a lot. Some mods should be essential such as ""Renaissance Compilation"", it makes the world a lot more realistic and enjoyable. It is difficult for everybody the first time, but with some practise you'll gain experience beyond your imagination. I was so proud the first time I landed on the mun that I snapchatted my friends even if it rolled over to the side. Now I am a quite experienced player and I think almost everything feels too easy. So don't refund the game just because it is hard.			",22,1,0,1,7,0,4

								This game is great! It really lets you unleash your creativity, and it's quite satisfying to land on a planet/moon. However, there are some bugs here and there, but that's expected from an alpha (now beta and still going strong!) game. Plus, there's a steep learning curve for beginners which may demotivate them from playing and learning. While it may not be complete, it's rather fun once you learn. I recommend this overall.1.0 edit: The game's been released, and by God is it more difficult. You need to upgrade buildings and compensate for new aerodynamics, which add a harder spin to the game and is a lot of fun.			",89,19,0,5,11,0,8

								  I've really enjoyed this game for the 600 hours I've played it (That's only the documented time, my modded .zips probably add at least 600 more!) The gameplay elements they have now are great, and were even when only Sandbox existed. With the new .90 update coming out, I see alot to look forwards to. Career/Science Modes' ability to change the difficulty and output of science, cash, reputation, and more, makes the game really easy or difficult depending on how you change the percentages. It's near-impossible at 10% everything, but really easy when you hit like 1000% everything.Overall, I really do recommend this game for anyone wanting to have some fun, or really creative, sicence-oriented people.

												This game is tough on newbies, there are tutorials but I wanted to dive right in. took a lot of tries to get something basic to leave the planet, only to run out of fuel and eventually get burned up in the sun. Once you get used to reaching orbiting and re-entry and learn what all the technical words mean, it gets easier, but there is so many things to take into consideration, weight, gravity, trajectory, fuel, thrust, aerodynamics... well worth it if you like space simulations or explosives.

												When I am writting this review, Steam shows 354 hours in game. However due to DRM free and moding, I already spent 1400+ hours (KSP is DRM free and is modable - so I play from non Steam-connected copy which is of stable version and specified mod mix - that is why). And I am counting.What is this game about? Sending green folk (called Kerbals) to space and to another planets. For science. And having TONS and TONS of fun. Well, in case you like rockets, planes, space and explosions. In whatever order. It is so hard to describe the game I advice you to give a check to youtube - e.g. Scott Manleys channel will give you nice view into what KSP is about.I bought this game back in 1.0.5 (32bit only) only out of boredom and to satisfy my game hoarding habbit. What I buy I do try - so I gave it a quick look before just adding it to my library. I tried to launch a rocket (I was unaware of contracts that time) - the chute deployed instead of expected fireshow. Some testing revealed the problem. I launched Jebediah and landed him back... It was kind of fun... Can I make it to orbit? After couple hours at 3 AM (working day followed) I maintained very odd, but stable orbit. I literally danced at my darkened man cave-corner. For two weeks straight, I slept only 4 hours a day. I designed rockets in my head while driving, or falling asleep, I was making sketches of new projects while waiting for a meeting at work, I was (and I still am) proactively looking for books and documentaries to study or inspire myself. I have a time to play at PC only around 4 hours a day at max, but KSP takes much much more hours per day. In times before KSP, when on toilet, I would check the smartphone for funny gifs to have some giggles. Now, I am all about space exploration...In those two weeks I found out I was wrong all my life about microgravity, orbital manneuvers and ascends of rockets. I was actualy learning stuff and I had great time doing so. Then I found out mods. It was like Christmas. Then a 1.1.x versions came and we received completely new engine, 64bit support. I fel in love with superfriendly community around KSP.And all it took, is lego based rocket building. Behind simple concept of straping a big fuel tank and engine under a crew module lies very complex mechanics of orbital physics. I droped my dream to be an astronaut at age of 5 (bad memory of kindergarden ""event"" - so I am sure). After more than 20 years later, I am back :)You can be new Elon Musk, or a reincarnator of Neil Armstrong. Or would you rather be Werner von Braun? You can be all of this. You can build rockets, planes, rovers, or any mad creation of yours (Kerbal mixer to mix actual Kerbals). ANd with mods, you can do really anything. Game can be easened (assisting mods), widened (parts mod, more planets) turned realistic (RSS/RO) and much more. Well... long text and no actual review of what this game is. Sigh... Ok, go to youtube, check Kerbal Space Program... Does it seem funny? Give it try. I did and it is best game purchase I ever did. I already can play other games, and not touch KSP for two or three days. But I still play, and I still do enjoy it beyond I ever imagined.10/10			",134,22,9,27,11,0,36

												I've been playing KSP for a few weeks at this point and have made it all the way to obriting the Mun.Each successful mission has been an ever more impressive triumph which requires a greater depth of understanding and strategy, in asset allocation, construction, mission planning, and execution.I just went skydiving for the first time today. It was beyond words. Amazingly I followed every step in sequence at exactly the right altitudes without my instructor having to remind me. All while screaming toward the ground at up to 120 miles an hour. My instructor was so impressed that she let me land us at the end of the parachute coast after free fall.After it was over I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just successfully landed on the Mun.No game should be so good that you land from a skydive you feel the same exhileration and pride you do from playing it. A trip to the Mun is way more exciting than ""a trip to Pittsburg"", and it's worth the hard knocks to figure out how to get there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You spent hours building that rover just right. Not too much or too little fuel and propulsion, and the craft is properly reinforced with struts (of course).You spent even more time flying the craft to it's destination. The staging was perfect, the orbits calculated just right.Finally, you spend many nerve-wracking minutes landing the rover. In the end, the descent goes without fail, with just enough fuel.There was some sticky moments, but now you are at your destination. You made it to space today, and now it's time to science. You start driving the rover, celebrating your success...Only to realize the rover is not as balanced as you thought, which causes it to fly up and spin out of control in microgravity and explode into 5 million pieces when it strikes the surface.You realize then you forgot Rule #1: Failure is always an option.11/10 Always good for making you question your own intelligence and self-esteem.

												This is a truly unique game. This is a truly infuriating game.There's nothing I can say bad about this game because 1: I'd call it about 90% stable (compared to a bethesda game that's about 70%). This alone wouldn't matter. Just cuz the game loads and doesn't crash while you play it doesn't mean it's not bad. But for how much time the average Kerbal will play this game, it's a huge factor (Also, the game takes about 10 minutes to load if you have anywhere near 100 mods installed, like me.)2: It's unique. There is no game like this. ANywhere. It simulates a solar system (simplified, of course, because truly doing this in real time is beyond any home computer.) so that you can build, fly and crash rockets, planes, boats and... anything. The limitations are almost nonexistent. Some youtubes build completely stock (No mods) helicopters even though there are no parts designed to build a helicopter. 3: You HAVE to think. You can slap rockets together and hope for the best and plenty of people have mastered this game from doing that. But if you don't learn and try, this game will lose appeal fast. If you manage to get over the steep learning curve, though, you'll never get bored of this game. Minecraft let you let your artistry go wild. This game will refine it into a diamond as you struggle to meld Form and Function into spacecraft that can literally go beyond the Moon. I can't be serious enough in saying that this is a truly fascinating and amazing game.4: Mod support. There are mods that give you exactly the type of experience you're looking for. The stock game is wonderful and enough for most people to sink their teeth into for a good minute. If you want more, there are mods that enhance and maintain a stock-a-like experience and mods that add completely new systems. Or bananas. Hell, there's a mod that lets you make a Hamburger that you can launch into space. Why? I dunno.Anyways, this game is worth playing for anybody. It's unique, offers limitless challenge and, if you're patient, it will actually teach you about aerospace. It won't make you an astronaut, but if you show up to space camp after a few hundred hours of this game you'll definitely have some knowledge to show off.			",245,18,3,39,15,0,42

												Awesome, realistic space ship building game where you can explore a solar system of another race.In this game, you start a space program, the Kerbal Space Program. Start by building your first ship, may it be a sattelite or something massive, as you launch it into space. But do not expect it to go smoothly at first, expect lots of crew members to die, and lots of explosions to happen before you even create a space-capable ship.It's refreshing, challenging and something to feel accomplished of when succeeding. Though in alpha state still, the game proves to have extremely alot of potential, definately a recommendation even in it's current state.So, if you're looking for a space game, that is challenging, fun, and realistic, do not hesitate buying this, as it's in alpha, it's a fair warning to say that the game is far from finished.Also, personally, I can't even get a rocket into orbit, as I constantly crash down. But I'm learning! ;)			",601,113,32,84,109,5,123

								Never has a game made me feel so accomplished. Few games capture the beauty and adventure of the unknown quite like Kerbal Space Program. Building your own complex spaceship, rover, spacestation, or lunar base is quick and easy, and there is no telling where your imagination might take you next. From the moon, to gas giants, to Mars look-alikes, Kerbal Space Program will give you countless hours of adventure, fun, creativity, and even a few laughs. You might even learn a few things along the way. If you enjoy interstellar sandbox games with a realistic twist KSP is definitely for you. Five Stars - Excellent game.			",78,8,0,8,21,0,25

								This one flew under the radar...I saw this game a few times while looking for something to play, never really stopping to pick it up.Finally, out of bordem, I checked out the forums.  Seemed there weren't many negative reviews, some game play issues, but nothing too crazy.  So, for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, I downloaded it.Best decision I've made since burning down the neighbours house!! You are able to build rockets, blast your Kerbals into space, and leave them stranded on the dark side of some long lost ice-planet because you failed to remember to give them a way home.There is a career mode, which starts you out with almost nothing and as you accomplish more and more objectives, gives you points to buy more equipment.  There is also a sandbox mode which gives you everything all at once so you can start building your double-wide rocket right away.This game has a MASSIVE sense of achievement.  There is a bit of a leaning curve to accomplish some of the more advanced things (ie: landing on the Mun (moon) or flying to another planet), but when you finally get all your ducks in a row make it, it is truly an awesome feeling.  Not many games have that kind of effect.Therefore:If you are any kind of space fan or love the space program, this game is definitely for you.If you like building rockets with realistic physics modelling.. this game is for you.If you like watching your kerbals go up in flames because you failed to secure your rocket and it turned into a bees nest of fire and metal... this game is for you.If you hate space and anything fun, ... this game is NOT for you.Good luck and plan accordingly!:)			",97,18,1,6,18,1,3

								Even in it's current state just as an early access there are THOUSANDS of unique and inventive ways to explore the kerbal universe all with an awesome sound track and just so you can feel like neil armstrong on the moon, oh excuse me ""Mun"" as it's called in ksp. This makes ksp a MUST HAVE have for any science nerds out there. And that comes from someone who has only 10 hours, YES that is how quickly this game will draw your attention. There are so few games out there that can deliver the hours of fun and enjoyment that ksp can, and even fewer that deserve your money, but ksp is well worth it! I also highly recommend that you check out some video tutorials on how to actually pilot a ship. Because if you dive right in you are gonna feel pretty lost. Other then that there are very few things that hold this game back from being in your collection.BUY IT NOW!!!			",15,0,0,2,5,1,7

								This game is so great. At first it is hard to use and understand but that is the fun bit! Understanding how this all works has actully taught me about space and shuttles. Getting off the ground is only half the job though, there are so many planets and moons to explore and visit each with their own unique challenges and difficulties. Overall this is a brilliant game with so much to it and so much can be done			",74,15,3,10,24,1,7

												Just buy the game already! Expect a rather large learning curve though and watch some videos on the internet too.The base game is already packed with places to visit and new things to discover but mods upgrade the game entirely.All in all:If you were that kid in school who thinks to go to the moon you just point and fire your engines this game probably isnt for you but if your interested in astronomy, space, physics etc this game is a must have10/10			",37,0,0,6,10,0,2

								A deep earth digging simulator, Kerbal space program follows your kerbals to the core of the planet earth, the goal of the game? create some space!The game has a fleshed out building stage which allows you to build advanced rocket powered digging machines to traverse the deep underground, will your vehicle of choice be horisontal or vertical? you choose!Unfortunatley, due to the game being early acess, all the features of the game are not implemented, this is obvious as there is currently no digging or drill parts availible for your vehicles, and the only traversible areas include the solar system and many planets. for some reason evryone wears space outfits, this might be just a formailty at this point but i personally suspect that some sort of astronautical features may be being implemnted. only time will tell.

								In a world far far away...Sorry, that's star wars. But if my lame intro did not get on the right mind of this topic, Kerbal Space Program will. KSP is a good game that I enjoy playing and with mods, it makes it a lot better. I'm not saying it's not good without it, but the insights on how the community may better a game is always a wonderful thing. From building a base on Mun (the Moon) to exploring the lands of Jool (Jupiter) it will keep the little astronaut in all of us happy (if you do not this little astronaut feeling then this game is not for you). KSP does have physics and it is hard, at first, to get to the far portions of space and you will lose a few Kermans' (the astronaut's last name) in your first few missions. But hey, failing is just one step closer to getting on the moon.Personal Rating: 07/10			",90,7,4,5,38,1,8

								I absolutely LOVE this game.  I definitely recommend it if you love space/space exploration as much as I do.  The physics aren't exactly 'real world' but for a simulator they are phenomenal.  If you're a trial and error kind of person, you'll enjoy it.  If you're a patient person, you'll enjoy it.  If you're a person able to learn things, you'll enjoy it.  There really aren't any full tutorials in game, but the kerbal wiki is rich with material.  It's still early access, but for an early access game it's definitely blown me away.  You start off at a space center on an earth-like planet 'Kerbin.'  You can then either build a rocket from scratch or load a pre-made one; I recommend the latter just to get a feel for the game.  Once you know what you're doing, you can pretty much decide what you're doing from there.  They've added a career mode recently, and I think it holds some promise.  So far you perform launches with a limited amount of parts for your rockets and conduct experiments at different altitudes and locations.  Those experiments will get you 'science points' which are spent to research a new technology on a tech-tree.  The said techonology will unlock more parts for your ship to further your launches which in turn further your experiments.  More points, more parts, more research.  It goes on.  Career mode is still in development so I expect a lot more from it in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Words can hardly put into perspective how incredible this game is. For over a year I have been playing -- and loving -- Kerbal Space Program. Not only is KSP fun and addictive, you also learn real-world physics and rocket science: a winning combination by any standard. Fantastic gameplay, outstanding physics, beautiful graphics and the most immersive community out there brings this game right to #1 in my favorite games of all time. Never has a space simulator been this in-depth, and everyone should try out Kerbal Space Program.			",13,2,0,0,6,0,2

												In this game you control every aspect of a space mission, from hiring your crew, to researching technologies, to designing your ship, to launching it into orbit, landing it on another planet (or moon), and safely returning your crew home.WARNING: THIS GAME IS VERY HARDIt is literally rocket science. You will have to learn all about rocket design, staging, and orbital mechanics in order to successfully send your kerbals to the mun and back. You will fail many times, usually resulting in spectacular explosions. But when you finally succeed, and your hours and hours of research, trial and error finally pay off, it is the most satisfying feeling of any video game I have ever played. When your kerbal steps out of the spaceship you designed and piloted, climbs down the ladder, plants the flag, and you look up to admire the beautiful view of kerbin from the mun, you suddenly feel that all those hours of frustration were worth it.

								This one flew under the radar...I saw this game a few times while looking for something to play, never really stopping to pick it up.Finally, out of bordem, I checked out the forums.  Seemed there weren't many negative reviews, some game play issues, but nothing too crazy.  So, for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, I downloaded it.Best decision I've made since burning down the neighbours house!! You are able to build rockets, blast your Kerbals into space, and leave them stranded on the dark side of some long lost ice-planet because you failed to remember to give them a way home.There is a career mode, which starts you out with almost nothing and as you accomplish more and more objectives, gives you points to buy more equipment.  There is also a sandbox mode which gives you everything all at once so you can start building your double-wide rocket right away.This game has a MASSIVE sense of achievement.  There is a bit of a leaning curve to accomplish some of the more advanced things (ie: landing on the Mun (moon) or flying to another planet), but when you finally get all your ducks in a row make it, it is truly an awesome feeling.  Not many games have that kind of effect.Therefore:If you are any kind of space fan or love the space program, this game is definitely for you.If you like building rockets with realistic physics modelling.. this game is for you.If you like watching your kerbals go up in flames because you failed to secure your rocket and it turned into a bees nest of fire and metal... this game is for you.If you hate space and anything fun, ... this game is NOT for you.Good luck and plan accordingly!:)			",97,18,1,6,18,1,3

								I love this game.Kerbal Space Program is a sandbox space exploration simulator that totes a very realistic physics system. The challenge of the game is build a rocket that has the potential to reach distant moons or planets, but that's only half the game! You must also pilot that rocket successfully to reach your goal.With the amount of attachments you can put on your rocket, the possibilities are endless. You can build: a space shuttle, a space station, a moon rover, sattelites, retrieval rockets, moon bases and more. The only things that limit you will be your skill and imagination.While there really is no 'goal' to the game, it is still very satisfying all the same. The first time I landed on Mun I stood up out of my chair and shot my arms into the air! The very next thing was posting a screenshot to Facebook. When you first play the game and see the moon in the sky, you immediately want to start buidling a rocket that can reach it! This makes the game super fun to play, because the 'goals' or 'winning conditions' are based upon what you want as a gamer.tl;dr - If you are thinking about buying this game stop killing time and buy it. The sheer number of rocket outcomes and flight possibilities are unfathomable. Kerbal Space Program will make your wonder and dream of space exploration come alive!			",113,11,4,8,16,0,9

												Tip for Kerbal Space Program players: Hitting Alt+F4 does not bring Bob Kerman back from playing with his jetpack on the moon, flying 40+ m/s into the side of a crater. Hitting Alt+F4 does also not fill Jedebiah Kerman with EVA propellant so he can get back to his orbiting space ship. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not reverse the 40 minutes you spent getting to Duna, only to realize you forgot Newke Kerman.

Hitting Alt+F4 saves you from embarrassment when you pull up your steam overlay, and realize you messed up your amazing trajectory to Minmus by hitting the Shift key to pull up the Steam overlay, only to do it again and tell your friend about how you're stressed and angry because you just messed up your path to Minmus, only to be cut short because you made yourself an escape trajectory out of Kerbin because once again, you hit Shift.

								Do you wish you could fly rockets that behave according to real world Newtonian physics? If so then KSP is for you!Even if the KSP developers took the current version (0.24.2) and said 'this is 1.0' it would still be an excellent product and a successful Eary Access. For myself, the most enjoyment is in Sandbox mode where all the parts are available and there is no research or career to worry about.KSP includes a career mode which has a research tree and economy which is still being developed and balanced but works reasonably well. If you get bored with the 'stock' game, take a look at the mod community. Dedicated individuals have created mods that can change just about every aspect of the game adding new parts, research, game tools, textures, etc. Buy KSP now!!			",107,9,0,8,15,0,20

								In a world far far away...Sorry, that's star wars. But if my lame intro did not get on the right mind of this topic, Kerbal Space Program will. KSP is a good game that I enjoy playing and with mods, it makes it a lot better. I'm not saying it's not good without it, but the insights on how the community may better a game is always a wonderful thing. From building a base on Mun (the Moon) to exploring the lands of Jool (Jupiter) it will keep the little astronaut in all of us happy (if you do not this little astronaut feeling then this game is not for you). KSP does have physics and it is hard, at first, to get to the far portions of space and you will lose a few Kermans' (the astronaut's last name) in your first few missions. But hey, failing is just one step closer to getting on the moon.Personal Rating: 07/10			",90,7,4,5,38,1,8

								Words can hardly put into perspective how incredible this game is. For over a year I have been playing -- and loving -- Kerbal Space Program. Not only is KSP fun and addictive, you also learn real-world physics and rocket science: a winning combination by any standard. Fantastic gameplay, outstanding physics, beautiful graphics and the most immersive community out there brings this game right to #1 in my favorite games of all time. Never has a space simulator been this in-depth, and everyone should try out Kerbal Space Program.			",13,2,0,0,6,0,2

If you are able to overcome the very steep learning curve, expect to have a lot of fun  with rocket, planes and more. With realistic physics, 7 planets and many moons, KSP is a revolutionnary game centered on air and space. This game is totally worth its price and I can't recommand it enough.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tip for Kerbal Space Program players: Hitting Alt+F4 does not bring Bob Kerman back from playing with his jetpack on the moon, flying 40+ m/s into the side of a crater. Hitting Alt+F4 does also not fill Jedebiah Kerman with EVA propellant so he can get back to his orbiting space ship. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not reverse the 40 minutes you spent getting to Duna, only to realize you forgot Newke Kerman. Hitting Alt+F4 does not revive your sanity after going back to your vehicle assembly, putting Newke Kerman in your pod, flying back to Duna, and not having enough fuel to slow yourself down, going 30 m/s over the limit, and killing Newke Kerman.

								Kerbal Space Program is awesome! Definitely worth the money for it. You can build rockets, destage them, put satellites in orbit or even shoot for the moon! There is also a bucket load of planets and moons out there. Try your hand at a landing on Duna, or shoot for the moon system of Jool. Whatever your path, Kerbal Space Program is one of the best PC games I've seen in a long while. At a convenient $27.00 USD, I think this is a great choice for any space simulator enthusiast.10/10 would blow up a rocket again.			",16,1,0,0,12,0,7

												Awesome, realistic space ship building game where you can explore a solar system of another race.In this game, you start a space program, the Kerbal Space Program. Start by building your first ship, may it be a sattelite or something massive, as you launch it into space. But do not expect it to go smoothly at first, expect lots of crew members to die, and lots of explosions to happen before you even create a space-capable ship.It's refreshing, challenging and something to feel accomplished of when succeeding. Though in alpha state still, the game proves to have extremely alot of potential, definately a recommendation even in it's current state.So, if you're looking for a space game, that is challenging, fun, and realistic, do not hesitate buying this, as it's in alpha, it's a fair warning to say that the game is far from finished.Also, personally, I can't even get a rocket into orbit, as I constantly crash down. But I'm learning! ;)			",601,113,32,84,109,5,123

								Kerbal Space Program went public only a few month short before Kickstarter became big, so keep that in mind when you play that unlike some Early Access games KSP didn't have a huge fundraiser at  the start.  Their success is purely due to their own hard work.And that they do.  The game is updated at  a steady pace.  Once very few months.  But the content additions have always been massive.  They're always pretty bug free as well.The game is also very easy to mod, adding so much replay value.  And do't just take my  word for it, you can literally go in and edit numbers in the notepag file for parts and make the part work totally differantly.Squad has proven themselves one of the greatest indie developers out there now.  If anything is testament to that it's the fan base.  Unlike other game fanbases, their's is almost entirely positive.			",102,25,0,21,40,2,29

												Sooooo, after spending a few, not hours, but days learning how stuff work, I've just realized after 400 hours that I might just know half of what there is to know. At least I've got the satisfaction to crash more rockets into the assembly building than getting them into space, I've spent more time designing planes that would end up crashing, and I've wasted soooo much time choosing mods that crash the game. And I've loved every single second of this game! MODS MODS MODS is a must have!Why can't I recommend this 1000x?			",41,2,2,0,13,1,2

												I've been playing KSP for a few weeks at this point and have made it all the way to obriting the Mun.Each successful mission has been an ever more impressive triumph which requires a greater depth of understanding and strategy, in asset allocation, construction, mission planning, and execution.I just went skydiving for the first time today. It was beyond words. Amazingly I followed every step in sequence at exactly the right altitudes without my instructor having to remind me. All while screaming toward the ground at up to 120 miles an hour. My instructor was so impressed that she let me land us at the end of the parachute coast after free fall.After it was over I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just successfully landed on the Mun.No game should be so good that you land from a skydive you feel the same exhileration and pride you do from playing it. A trip to the Mun is way more exciting than ""a trip to Pittsburg"", and it's worth the hard knocks to figure out how to get there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You spent hours building that rover just right. Not too much or too little fuel and propulsion, and the craft is properly reinforced with struts (of course).You spent even more time flying the craft to it's destination. The staging was perfect, the orbits calculated just right.Finally, you spend many nerve-wracking minutes landing the rover. In the end, the descent goes without fail, with just enough fuel.There was some sticky moments, but now you are at your destination. You made it to space today, and now it's time to science. You start driving the rover, celebrating your success...Only to realize the rover is not as balanced as you thought, which causes it to fly up and spin out of control in microgravity and explode into 5 million pieces when it strikes the surface.You realize then you forgot Rule #1: Failure is always an option.11/10 Always good for making you question your own intelligence and self-esteem.

												This is a truly unique game. This is a truly infuriating game.There's nothing I can say bad about this game because 1: I'd call it about 90% stable (compared to a bethesda game that's about 70%). This alone wouldn't matter. Just cuz the game loads and doesn't crash while you play it doesn't mean it's not bad. But for how much time the average Kerbal will play this game, it's a huge factor (Also, the game takes about 10 minutes to load if you have anywhere near 100 mods installed, like me.)2: It's unique. There is no game like this. ANywhere. It simulates a solar system (simplified, of course, because truly doing this in real time is beyond any home computer.) so that you can build, fly and crash rockets, planes, boats and... anything. The limitations are almost nonexistent. Some youtubes build completely stock (No mods) helicopters even though there are no parts designed to build a helicopter. 3: You HAVE to think. You can slap rockets together and hope for the best and plenty of people have mastered this game from doing that. But if you don't learn and try, this game will lose appeal fast. If you manage to get over the steep learning curve, though, you'll never get bored of this game. Minecraft let you let your artistry go wild. This game will refine it into a diamond as you struggle to meld Form and Function into spacecraft that can literally go beyond the Moon. I can't be serious enough in saying that this is a truly fascinating and amazing game.4: Mod support. There are mods that give you exactly the type of experience you're looking for. The stock game is wonderful and enough for most people to sink their teeth into for a good minute. If you want more, there are mods that enhance and maintain a stock-a-like experience and mods that add completely new systems. Or bananas. Hell, there's a mod that lets you make a Hamburger that you can launch into space. Why? I dunno.Anyways, this game is worth playing for anybody. It's unique, offers limitless challenge and, if you're patient, it will actually teach you about aerospace. It won't make you an astronaut, but if you show up to space camp after a few hundred hours of this game you'll definitely have some knowledge to show off.			",245,18,3,39,15,0,42

								I love this game.Kerbal Space Program is a sandbox space exploration simulator that totes a very realistic physics system. The challenge of the game is build a rocket that has the potential to reach distant moons or planets, but that's only half the game! You must also pilot that rocket successfully to reach your goal.With the amount of attachments you can put on your rocket, the possibilities are endless. You can build: a space shuttle, a space station, a moon rover, sattelites, retrieval rockets, moon bases and more. The only things that limit you will be your skill and imagination.While there really is no 'goal' to the game, it is still very satisfying all the same. The first time I landed on Mun I stood up out of my chair and shot my arms into the air! The very next thing was posting a screenshot to Facebook. When you first play the game and see the moon in the sky, you immediately want to start buidling a rocket that can reach it! This makes the game super fun to play, because the 'goals' or 'winning conditions' are based upon what you want as a gamer.tl;dr - If you are thinking about buying this game stop killing time and buy it. The sheer number of rocket outcomes and flight possibilities are unfathomable. Kerbal Space Program will make your wonder and dream of space exploration come alive!			",113,11,4,8,16,0,9

								My train of thought from before I bought it to now:- I see my friends playing it a bunch, but will I like it? Im worried I'll get bored since space isnt really my forte.- I start watching broadcasts by other steam users and asking them questions about its replayability- Oh, it has modding support, which apparently is a must in this game- After hours of research and streaming, I bought it on sale for $22- I was still skeptical   - At first I started out in science mode (gain tech points, no money system) which was one of the harder modes. oops.   - Next I tried career mode, which offered contracts for those of us who wanted to gain science (tech) and where also newer to the game.   - Oh, there are spaceplanes?   - *Download many mods*   - Oh, there are _______? (x10)   - Unlock more tech to perfect my plane   - *Download more mods*   - Planes that run off of electricity?   - Nuclear....That's where I'm at, and Im loving every bit of it. I've always been kind of a ship-builder guy when it comes to free-roam exploration games like this (If you do too, check out reassembly), but it's captivated me. Im always told to pay attention to Delta V (Change in velocity) which I assume is important, but I'm too new to the game to get into specifics like that. Super fun!			",136,17,0,11,23,1,24

												Tip for Kerbal Space Program players: Hitting Alt+F4 does not bring Bob Kerman back from playing with his jetpack on the moon, flying 40+ m/s into the side of a crater. Hitting Alt+F4 does also not fill Jedebiah Kerman with EVA propellant so he can get back to his orbiting space ship. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not reverse the 40 minutes you spent getting to Duna, only to realize you forgot Newke Kerman. Hitting Alt+F4 does not revive your sanity after going back to your vehicle assembly, putting Newke Kerman in your pod, flying back to Duna, and not having enough fuel to slow yourself down, going 30 m/s over the limit, and killing Newke Kerman. Hitting Alt+F4 also does not make you feel less stupid about getting rid of your landing rockets, and putting on four parachutes because you realized that Duna has an atmosphere. Hitting Alt+F4 saves you from embarrassment when you pull up your steam overlay, and realize you messed up your amazing trajectory to Minmus by hitting the Shift key to pull up the Steam overlay, only to do it again and tell your friend about how you're stressed and angry because you just messed up your path to Minmus, only to be cut short because you made yourself an escape trajectory out of Kerbin because once again, you hit Shift.

								Kerbal Space Program is awesome! Definitely worth the money for it. You can build rockets, destage them, put satellites in orbit or even shoot for the moon! There is also a bucket load of planets and moons out there. Try your hand at a landing on Duna, or shoot for the moon system of Jool. Whatever your path, Kerbal Space Program is one of the best PC games I've seen in a long while. At a convenient $27.00 USD, I think this is a great choice for any space simulator enthusiast.10/10 would blow up a rocket again.			",16,1,0,0,12,0,7

Have your imagination took you to orbit?If you answered yes then you should definitely try this one!I've been playing it since version 0.18 (at least this is the one that burned into my mind) - yes it was very early access and it was awesome even back then!Own a space program. Make it prosper by completing contracts and reach ever higher altitudes. Build your bases on another planets. Assemble your orbital stations. Create communication network to cover the entire Kerbol system :DSet your own goals and achieve them. How far can imagination take you?			",131,9,6,14,7,1,40

								Kerbal Space Program went public only a few month short before Kickstarter became big, so keep that in mind when you play that unlike some Early Access games KSP didn't have a huge fundraiser at  the start.  Their success is purely due to their own hard work.And that they do.  The game is updated at  a steady pace.  Once very few months.  But the content additions have always been massive.  They're always pretty bug free as well.The game is also very easy to mod, adding so much replay value.  And do't just take my  word for it, you can literally go in and edit numbers in the notepag file for parts and make the part work totally differantly.Squad has proven themselves one of the greatest indie developers out there now.  If anything is testament to that it's the fan base.  Unlike other game fanbases, their's is almost entirely positive.			",102,25,0,21,40,2,29

												Kerbal Space Program. Oh, Kerbal Space Program. I don't know what to say.Ok. Here is what I'm going to say. KSP has done a lot for me, and I'm glad that I finally got a new PC capable of playing it on a playable level (I don't know how I ever enjoyed it before on my 5 year old laptop, much less reach over 700 hours). But I probably reached that level for 2 reasons: 1. I left the game idle a lot and 2. Simply because KSP is such a great game.If you hadn't read the description up there, KSP is a game where you must manage your space program and send you kerbal astronauts safely into space.KSP's main mode is carrer mode, where you run a space program, and you have to make sure you can efficiently get your spacecraft to fly straight and make it safely into space (and safely return home too). You also have to manage your money by accepting contracts and complete research by collecting ""science"" to unlock new and better parts.My favorite mode, however, is sandbox mode, where you can build any aircraft/spacecraft/rover/boat/drone/car etc. you want. I personally enjoy designing my own airplanes. It is also a good place to practice your building and flying skills before you try career mode.KSP shines it's best when building. As said before, you have unlimited options to build whatever you want. There are hundreds of different parts for you to choose, and can be placed in pretty much any way you want on your craft. The system of building is very intuitive, as parts that have a similar shape will snap together, and you can easily mount parts on the side of other parts and rotate and move them using tools to put them wherever you want.KSP's physics engine is best compared to actual physics. In other words, it's extremely realistic. Spacecraft will generally fly as they would in real life, and real life spaceflight manuvers are plausible ways of navigating in KSP. When flying, a helpful array of instruments will tell you your speed, altitude (relative to nearest body), direction, and atmospheric density. The aerodynamic flight model is also very realistic, so if designing aircraft is your thing, you will surely enjoy KSP.If I haven't made it clear already, KSP deals with ACTUAL ROCKET SCIENCE (no I'm not exaggerating). So while it's accessible, don't expect a walk in the park. Even with it's tutorials, KSP is VERY DIFFICULT. However, the way Squad dealt with easing the pain of learning rocket science was genius. They made the game HILARIOUS!!! The cute, green, clumsy kerbals that pilot your aircraft will generally have facial expressions regarding your current situation, so they will be in awe when you reach the Mun (the in game equivilent to the Moon), but will be screaming in terror when you are crashing to the ground. If you crash, which you are bound to do a lot, don't feel bad for killing all your kerbals, thanks to the helpful ""revert flight"" button that turns back time and makes it so that the crash never happened. Speaking of time, the game's ""timewarp"" feature is capable of turning time up to 100,000x faster than current time, and is helpful when you are doing long, interplanetary missions. KSP doesn't get much regard for it's graphics, but I think they look good, and when you are orbiting a gas giant with 5 moons, the game can look pretty incredible. Speaking of planets, there are a total of 17 different celestial bodies (planets, moons, and stars) for you to explore! Finally, KSP has an amazing modding community. There are mods that add new parts, new mechanics to the game, alter the physics to make the game even more realistic, some that add more planets, and there is even a mod that adds online multiplayer to KSP! So if you ever get bored of the core game (something that is very unlikely to happen), be sure to check out the mods that have been created!KSP has been an influential game in my life. It's helped me make friends, it's boosted my interest in aviation, aerospace, and space exploration. It's helped me get into new hobbies such as flight simming, RC flying, and model rockets. And it's even inspired me to think about what I want to do with my life one day, even if it has absolutely nothing to do with KSP. Kerbal Space Program has really been a lifechanging experience, and is arguably my favorite video game ever. I wish I could give it higher than a 10 on a 1 to 10 scale, but since I can't, KSP easily recieves a 10/10 from me. Be sure to pick it up for yourself, and make sure to get it when it's on sale!

								This is one of the best games I have ever played.  It is an indie game and not yet in full release, but the developers are highly communicative with the community and regular updates are released almost always adding major features or bug fixes.  The modding community is extremely dedicated and the developers are highly supportive of it to the point where they have hired several of the best modders straight from the community.I've put over 250 hours into this game since its been on Steam, but that doesn't count the hundreds of hours I put in before it was on Steam.The game is extremely worth it and has an extremely bright future ahead of it.  There is no clear objective system at the moment though, which has turned some people off the game.  I don't believe its coming in the next update but their main priority is currently fleshing out the 'career' mode (as opposed to the sandbox mode that most people play) where there will be objectives, funding, and research.  Research has already been added but it needs some major fixing, which is actually their expressed priority for the coming update.TLDR; The game is very much worth it, if you're interested in spacetravel at all go for it.  The satisfaction of landing on the Mun (Kerbal equivalent of the Moon) on your own for the first time more than makes it worth the cost, not to mention the hundreds of other things there are for you to do.Oh, and if you're still on the fence there is a free demo for you to try.  It only includes a fraction of the parts and celestial bodies that are available in the full version and does not include the career mode, but it gives you a good idea of what the full game is like.

												PROS:Modding support. The developers encourage modding and the modding community for this game is pretty big. While modding extends a game's life and increases enjoyment you can easily have fun with the stock unmodified game. I would reccomend Engineer, MechJeb and Kerbal Attachment System to start.Easy to start. You don't need to know a thing about real world rocketry to play this. There are in-game tutorials for most of the game aspects and the community has written out details about the advanced stuff.(Mostly) Friendly community.While every community has its share of ""not nice"" people, KSP has an invested fan base who will help and support each other. Don't know about a certain thing in the game? You won't be ridiculed for not knowing everything.Quicksaving and reverting are enabled.Afraid to take some of the Kerbal crew you have grown attached to on a dangerous mission? Have no fear, saves are here! F5 quicksaves the game while F9 reloads the quicksave. Need to take a few tries before you successfully do a powered landing? Just quicksave. Crash terribly before you had the chance to save? Revert to the launchpad. For people who don't like to quicksave it is 100% optional.Not stuck to one flight.Don't feel like time accelerating while waiting for your deep space probe's course correction? No problem! Just switch to another ship, your probe will still make progress. A mod called ""Kerbal Alarm Clock"" is great for letting you know when your ships need to be paid attention to.NASA street cred.For KSP's 23.5 update they actually worked with NASA to add things to the game. While the game isn't 100% realistic you can tell that the developers are balancing realism with unrealistic things.Demo available.More games should come with a ""try before you buy"" feature and demos are a great way of giving that. If you are really unsure about if the game is for you, get the demo.Rewarding gameplay.Knowing the ship you created landed on the Mun, or even made it into Kerbin orbit, is a great feeling. Being able to bring your crew home safely is also great. I remember my first attempt at a crewed landing on the Mun. I didn't have enough fuel to land on the Mun so I sent an unmanned ship to refuel it using the KAS mod. After refueling I landed on the Mun after several tries. I planted my flag and launched back into orbit only to realize that I didn't have enough fuel to get back so I rendezvoused with the refueling vessel. When I finally made it back to Kerbin and splash downed in the ocean it was a great feeling.CONS:Not everyone can pick up and play.Some people will not be able to figure out the game and will think it is too complicated. There is online material to help with understanding the game but that might not be enough.==I have spent more time on this game than any other game. I enjoy it that much. More than half my time is spent designing vessels but I am learning more and more. Often I will not have played the game for a few days when I feel it pulling me back in. I definitely recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall - Very silly and fun. However, first warning - Buy it on sale of at least $20 or less if possible. NOT worth the current $40 being asked for.Pro's: It's fun to build something just to see what happens and how far you can get them up there. Strap on a bunch of rockets, a few struts, then more rockets, about three layers high, then add a command seat for one very nervous Kerbal and you end up either having a fun time, or a barbecue. Either way, fun is had by all.Different modes of play allow you to try different things for the fun of it, including what amounts to creative mode.There's an inbuilt cheat mode, as well, I've recently learned. Look it up if you care. I'm not sure what it does beyond give money and ... maybe science points? o.O'Cons:So, first thing to know. Increasing the speed of play during launch or at any point really during a launch and flight, will actually cause physics to go wonky when they otherwise wouldn't.Figuring out how to make and control the more advanced builds have been difficult for me. Tutorials gave a touch of aid, but not enough to really be helpful.Overall: 7/10 - Mainly due to difficulty and lack of tutorials that really give decent data. Still fun to build random things and see if you can crash into a moon or the run.-Paladeus			",99,20,0,31,10,0,5

												Cool game. Vanilla is fun, but science grinding in career gets dull after a while.One of about 3 games made in Unity that I actually like.Has some system flaws: basically it loads EVERYTHING  into RAM during the startup meaning it can take a looongggg time. I\'m running realism overhaul + real solar system + a couple more mods and it takes 25 minutes to start up. That said, to go all console peasant and justify this, the load time commits me to the game so when I get frustrated (every time) I just try again until it works.To date that strategy isn\'t working, I\'ve tried 25 times to put a simple satellite into orbit, and failed every single time. Tons of fun though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Don't even read this. Just get the game.I have absolutely zero knowledge of rocket science and physics, and yet this gem is still phenomenal. The creativity you can express in your spaceship (just to see it spiral out of control and explode) is astounding. The sheer size of the game world (a whole solar system) is incomprehensible, and I've only touched the tip of the iceberg of the countless planets to explore.Will you be the next Krbal hero, or will you set a new record for number of Kerbals sent to their death in space?

												“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”- Carl Sagan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like space and building things, you'll like Kerbal Space Program. The graphics are mostly so-so, but gameplay is excellent. There's no artificial sense of achievement; you set your own goals and work hard to achieve them. At first, the game will feel really difficult, but as you master the real physics behind the game, you'll be able to go bigger and grander. The base game feels complete, but mods add a lot more to the experience. Overall, an amazing game with tremendous replay value. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												KSP is one of the best games I have ever played. It is as tense and exciting as Bioshock. It is as challenging as Darksouls, but is 1000 times more forgiving. It is the biggest sandbox I have ever played in, and I feel like wherever I go there is meaning in my progress. It does a better job at giving you a story to weave than any RPG thus far… though I might be getting a bit into hyperbole. It’s just hard to not to, in the light of just how FANTASTIC this game is. I have over three times the number of hours displayed on steam due to my use of modded installs which I run without steam.TLDR at bottomThe AwesomeYou can play any way you want. Heck, you might never leave orbit of Kerbin (Earth's analog in the game: your home) and spend your time making supersonic aircraft and rovers to explore Kerbin's surface. Of course, I wouldn't recommend that, as then you would be missing out on the wonders of space exploration... but to each their own. It is super accessible. Orbital mechanics can get complicated. I do that stuff in school. It can get pretty crazy. But have no fear! Squad’s map screen will let you add Maneuver Nodes, allowing you to see what your orbit will look like if you burn in a certain direction. This lets you learn orbital mechanics through an intuitive trial and error process.You can explore the game’s solar system in any manner you deem feasible, with whatever vehicles you can dream up (and successfully get off the ground). You can send probes into the sun, aerobrake around gas planets, land rovers on moons, and generally be cool floating around in space. Experience different game modes! Creative lets you play with all the parts, and not worry about unlocking anything or paying for it. Science makes you unlock parts with SCIENCE!, but you don’t have to pay for anything or worry about your Rep. Career is where you manage all the aspects of your space program, dealing with Funds, SCIENCE!, and Reputation in order to get your Space Program to the heights of success. I’ll explain each of those “resources” below.Gain SCIENCE! by running around making observations and running experiments wherever you see fit, or by completing missions you sign up for. Use this SCIENCE! to unlock new parts for your space program. Manage your Funds carefully, and with great concern, as you will need every penny you have to upgrade facilities, hire your brave astronauts, and launch your craft into the great unknown. Make money by accepting missions, which range from testing out a part on the launch pad, to launching a tourist to the moon, to setting up a base on the surface of Laythe (a moon of the game's analogue of Jupiter) capable of resource extraction and the support of 30 Kerbals. No matter the complexity no mission is impossible.Make sure you keep your Reputation in check as well, as even though I am not sure what it actually effects, you can convert a percentage of your Reputation gains into the far more useful SCIENCE! points and Funds. Perhaps Reputation will play a greater role in updates, or there is a hidden purpose to it which I have yet to discover.Level up your Kerbals RPG style by having them go and do things they haven’t yet done! Pilots gain the ability to keep the craft oriented to a specific direction. You can’t set your heading or anything, but you can ask to keep the ship pointed retrograde during re-entry, or towards a maneuver node. 1st level pilots can only point Prograde and retrograde, but more are unlocked per level. Scientists gain the ability to reset experiments and give you even greater returns of SCIENCE!. Engineers gain the ability to fix busted parts like wheels, though their effect is somewhat limited, as most parts simply explode when they break.The game is rarely tedious, as even the longest transfer times can be compressed into a few minutes with the game's time acceleration, and even when you are forced to wait, you can look at beautiful vistas of the sun peeking out from behind the planet, or marvel at your design as it floats (or spins uncontrollably) in space.Rendezvous with and redirect asteroids! Because it’s cool! You can get SCIENCE! from them, slam them into other craft or celestial bodies, land them on the roofs of your facilities, or build a space station on them. They’re just fun.Burn up as you scream through the atmosphere at thousands of meters per second. This most recent release has made re-entry rather… dangerous. You have to design your craft with the concept of a “return journey” in mind, and having the craft accidently flip around during re-entry, exposing your squishy crew cabins to the intense heat of friction, and then struggling with the controls to get the heat shield pointed back in the direction of travel is probably one of the most intense experiences I have ever had in a game. Whether you succeed or fail, it is still unbelievably cool to do it in first person.The MOAR AwesomeAnd the best part? That, and more which I haven’t mentioned, are ONLY what COMES WITH the game. There is a catalogue of THOUSANDS of mods to add on to your game, very easily too, which can drastically improve the game beyond even what it is now. Mods adding entire new resourcing ecosystems (Kethane/Karbonite), mods adding hundreds of parts (LLL/B9),  and mods adding entirely new features (Hanger/Weather mods).Mods adding useful functions (Kerbal Engineer), mods adding cool sound effects, and  mods making the game look photo realistic (Texture Replacer).Mods ADDING MULTIPLAYER (DMP), mods adding weapons and new damage models, and mods adding ROBOTICS (Infernal Robotics).Mods adding KERBAL BASED CONSTRUCTION (KAS), mods adding EXTRAPLANETARY LAUNCHPADS (Extraplanetary Launchpads), mods adding FLIPPING WARP DRIVES AND FUSION POWERED PLASMA ENGINES (Interstellar Mod), and so much more. So, so much more. And you know what is even better than that? YOU, yes YOU, are capable of editing text files. You are able to mod any part you can imagine. Fuel scoops that collect particles from space for your ion engine probe to use? Yes, you can do that with like four lines in a text file. It truly is a sandbox, and you can spend just as much time having fun with the game files as you would actually playing the game. The Slightly Less AwesomeDespite KSP’s greatness, there are some small issues, Mainly the lack of a stable 64 bit build for Windows.As I have pointed out, modding can make the game a whole lot more awesome right off the bat. However, KSP keeps all of its Game Data files in its memory at all times. This normally wouldn’t be a problem; KSP only has about 1 Gb to manage without any mods, and even though KSP on windows is only 32bit, it has plenty of ram to work from.As you might imagine however, when you start having a parts list that grows to 2000+ parts, KSP might start to get a bit on its memory. When you develop a Game Data folder that starts getting to 3-3.5 Gb of size, KSP will start to crash. A lot.As KSP isn’t going to change how to it handles asset loading, the most obvious change to make to allow people to have a stupid number of mods would be to release a 64 bit build. Unfortunately, KSP is built with Unity. And 64 bit windows Unity is really buggy. Buggy to the point where Squad didn’t release a 64 bit KSP for 1.0, as they didn’t want to release a hot mess. And Squad can’t really do anything about it until Unity fixes the issues. I would like to point out that this is absolutely ZERO reason to not buy the game; I just complained about KSP because it crashes when I mod it too much. So go, shell out that 30 USD. It may just be the best 30 dollars you will ever spend.TLDRBottom Line: 10/10- Would save Jeb from certain death again.Ad Astra			",35,4,0,2,11,1,12

												Ok, just a quick review for this game. You build rockets. Find out you can use cheats. Destroy everything with Whack-A-kerbal (great name btw Squad). Try for Duna. Try to land on a gas giant but explode because physics. Download mods to do more stuff. And have more fun with Hyperedit and Whack-A-Kerbal at the end. Why not give it a try? It's not always about being NASA serious!			",159,33,3,12,29,3,5

												This may be the most fun I've ever had at my computer.....or my various console game machines...or in front of a coin-op cabinet game...or even much of anything else!   I was born a few months before Sputnik touched off the space race....and astronaut was at least near the top of every child's ""what I wanna be"" list.  It was number one on mine!  The magic of this game for me is it connects with that child who never achieved that pinnacle of human endeavor, but unlike other science fiction games that center around aliens and space battles,  this one recreates what we were actually doing in space, and lets me put all those children's books on how we were going to get into space to work.  I must admit it tickles me  to be able to outperform players who grew up in the post George Lucas gaming world who don't always grasp that space ships do not perform like jet fighter planes.....and why should they?  It may be centuries before we run into a hostile alien force....if in fact we ever do. As for me, the sheer joy and wonder of putting a space craft in orbit and looking down on the beautiful world below far outshines the number of enemy craft I've blown to space dust with my plama bolts or anti-matter missiles, or particle beams. There are mods that let you turn space int a war zone  if you must...meanwhile.I'll be on board the space station 'Evening Star', learning things from orbit that the groundhogs never guessed, and plotting the best course for Duna Discovery Fleet One.

								Quite the revolutionary game if you ask me. Not only do you get to build your own rockets, spaceplanes, and whatever else you can think of. You can also build your own learning curve as well! With the help of modifications that make the base game even easier or more difficult!Cannot get to the mun? Get a mod that can change engine specific impulse so you can travel further!Planted a flag on every planet and moon? Get a mod that makes the Kerbol system resemble ours on a 1:1 scale!Game crashing because of too many mods? There is a mod to fix that!Once you have mastered KSP in all it's glory there is still fun to be had. Especially because there are many things to master in the base game like: docking, spaceplanes, and of course not running out of fuel before reaching your destination so you can return to Kerbin. The community, and modmakers only make the game even more in depth and fun!You don't like modding your game? Kudos to you vanilla extremist, I still haven't even done everything in stock KSP yet. Just goes to show how much fun you can have in this game with plenty of things to do! Well worth it's price!10/10 Still haven't touched the spaceplane hangar			",140,13,5,9,25,1,13

												No Man's Sky, as hard as it may try, will never produce the feeling of landing your fearless-ish Kerbals on the Mun with their trusty-ish Munar lander after completing your well-ish thought out maneuvers from the Kerbal Space Station for the first or twenty-first time. Microsoft Flight Simulator will never produce the feeling of landing your aerocraft on the Kerbal Space Center runway. No other game on steam will or can teach one so much about orbital mechanics, aerodynamics, astrophsyics, aerophsyics, or rocket science. There's no other game on steam that will make you laugh as hard, or think as hard when you fail.  And there's no other game on steam with more skilled, more incredible modders, or such an incredibly friendly, helpful community. Also, explosions.I personally rate this game 10/10. Kraken Aproves.

												Kerbal Space Program is the perfect combination between gaming, learning and the best damn community a game can wish for. With almost unlimited mods and tutorials you're pretty much settled to spend a load of fun hours in this game. The only negative point in my opinion is that for some people the challenge will be too much. You don't just go to the moon or fly by an interstellar planet like that, there will be a lot of planning, thinking and most of all; failure. Seriously, the difficulty of this game can make you lose your♥♥♥♥♥♥ Imagine this: you're a wedding planner and you've been planning for days, only to discover that you're one cupcake short when the wedding is almost over and because of this you can start all over. It's a bit like that, but can you imagine the satisfaction when you actually pull something off? It's a feeling no other game can give you, trust me.Also, what I mentioned before, the community is amazing. Ever heard of Scott Manley? You will after you buy this game. There are many more like him that make tutorials for doing the craziest stuff, and a load of others that make humorous video's using KSP. Then there are mods, that can make the experience that much more challenging, fun or realistic. So all together, I would definitely recommend this game. Unless of course you don't like a challenge that will tear your family apart. Have fun :)			",55,7,2,7,16,1,6

GeneralWhat can I say. Hm. Kerbal Space Program is just fantastic. I've been playing since early alpha (before steam), only paying $10 at the time and from that it has grown. Physics are great and new features are just amazing. I would recommend this to anyone.My OpinionKSP has been my life for a long time now. I love it. Going to different planets, landing on planets (which a lot of new space games lack today), building rovers, jets and anything you set your mind to. KSP even has mod support so you should never become bored and I found that great. Though, it sometimes is not fun to play alone. I cannot wait for multiplayer.OverallHowever.. there is something I CANNOT wrap my head around (below):I find it funny people are paying full price when you can butcher a friend that hasn't converted to Steam yet to give you the game for free through the KSP website store.Great game and I recommend it.Rating: 10/10			",236,41,4,26,34,3,32

								I do not understand why the negative comments.If you are going to make constructive critics,that's ok, but:If it's too approximative, simply go work with NASA;there you can fulfill you desire to crash 10.000.000.000 $ rocketsIf it's too complicated simply go play GTAIf it's too nerdy simply go play flashgamesIf it's too frustrating simply learn how to playYou cannot lower a game reputation only because you did not document yourself on its features before buying it,and/or did not even try to learn to play it. In my opinion,this is one of the most challenging and creative games I ever played with, and still they managed to prevent it to be a serious simulator, adding hilarious characters (useless, but life would be meaningless if Jebediah hadn't been so happy whenever I made him re-enter Kerbal athmosphere while realizing that I had forgot to put parachutes on the command pod,eheheheheh), funny descriptions and a game which amazes without pretending to be what it does not want to be.

								Exploration, construction, flight, and laughs is what this game has to offer. Explore the planet you are on with a rover, make a rocket to deliver a payload to another planet or space station, or construct a space station. Build your vehicle for exploration and hope it withstands the acceleration, gravity, and atmospheric forces stressing it.  Laugh at the faces the Kerbals make as they hit the ground at 1000m/s and survive to bounce once. Also, there are a wide variety of addons to expand your experience and enjoyment including but not limited to; more detailed information, different parts, tools to help make tasks easier or even do some tasks for you, and resource mining.This is one of the most difficult games to learn I have ever played, and while still bare-bones compared to what it will be, one of my favorites. You can spend hours trying to complete just one objective, trying to put yourself in a circular orbit or dock your first piece to a space station, and remain entertained the whole time.

								If you like to build things and then see them blow up, you have found the right game. This game does not hold your hand when it comes to getting to the Mun or other planets. You need to fall 100x before you make your first successful landing in outer space. That is the best part of the game. The first time I planted a flag on the Mun I was ecstatic. I was so excited to know that I had built up enough skill to do it. Getting my Kerbal back to the planet was another story. This game is a Dwarf Fortress space sim. Get ready to laugh, cry and rejoice in almost every circumstance.  ",124,35,1,42,24,1,34

												Can't think of a game I've learnt more from playing or had as much fun doing so. It's given me a real appreciation just looking up at the moon.There's a fairly steep learning curve at the start, but it's very much worth sticking with. If anyone ever asks me to recommend a game, this is it.			",127,29,1,11,21,3,21

								I first bought this game around v0.18 ish as enjoyed building crazy rockets and firing them into space. But for a beginner, it was pretty tough to learn how to play without understanding what's actually going on.However, recently I picked up the game again and started learning how to play it properly with the help of Scott Manley's YouTube video tutorials. Having spent the time learnuing how to orbit, redezvous and dock, it has opened up a tonne of depth to the game, allowing me to strike out to further places in the Kerbin system. Right now, I've now logged over 80 hours of play and I feel the game has so much more to offer and is being updated regularly by the authors. Opening up the game to mods was a great move and provides a wealth of tools and enhanced features.If you love space and can make your own fun in a sandbox environment, you're going to love this. I'm really looking forward to where this game will end up.			",85,38,0,7,11,0,27

								This is probably my favorite game on steam. All I do is fly around blowing things up and launch my Kerbals into the sun. I remember once I actually tried to land on the Mun, I almost did. I was about 250 ft above the surface coming down slowly, and then my fat cat jumped on my keyboard, which made my rocket flip and go max speed  in to the ground. Killing all 3 Kerbals inside. I yelled quite abit of swears at my cat, all she did was turn around and show me her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This game has made me yell, stay up all night and make me draw sketches of what rocket I should make next. Sometimes I stay home all day playing.

								This game is excellent, though not for everyone. The game is challenging, and features realistic space flight and orbital mechanics. There is certainly a steep learning curve early on, but the difficulty makes the reward when you succeed that much greater. Beyond that, the game makes failure FUN! So don't think that you're going to get frustrated. If you have any interest in space flight, you will enjoy this game. The game will teach you about rocket science and the challenges of interplanetary travel.Build crazy rocket-powered contraptions, launch them into space, travel to moons and other planets throughout the system (an analog to the solar system). What's to dislike?Modes: there is currently a sandbox mode (all parts unlocked) and a Career mode (earn Science points by carrying out missions in order to unlock parts in the tech tree).The state of the game as it stands is very playable. There are some bugs, but it does not hinder the gameplay. The game is early access, so new content will be added in the future. Be warned: development is slow. However, SQUAD makes sure that each update is polished and robust before release, so the updates are worth the wait.Modability: there are TONS of mods for this game. Mods that add parts, mods that enhance the atmospherics, mods that turn the entire system in to the Solar System and scales it up to size, and more.TLDR: This game is loads of fun, even when your rockets are blowing up on the launchpad. Play sandbox and goof around with crazy contraptions, or play career for a fulfilling experience exploring, earning 'science' points and unlocking parts. Enjoy realistic orbital mechanics -- learn about real space flight!8.5/10			",74,8,5,11,12,0,2

								This an amazing space sim.  If you ever wanted to understand the basic concepts of what goes into putting a man in space and sending them elsewhere in the solar system, this is the game to play.  The game simulates orbital mechanics better than any space flight game I have played.Currently, the career mode is unfinished and needs filling but this is still in alpha and to be expected. Thankfully, the devs offer insights into their dev process on their blog and genuinely seem to care about making a fun and realistic game.  They also have allowed modding to the game and there is a large community that is building mods to do just about anything else you would like to do in the sim.I strongly recommend this for any space nerd out there.

								Kerbal is a great game. Difficult, unforgiving, often glitchy, but great. It's endlessly entertaining, even when your hours long mission ends in catastrophic failure on an attempted landing. A word of warning: it's not very stable, especially when building using larger rocket pieces. But the thrill of a successful mission, and the endless humor in watching a ship rip itself apart in a series of explosions is extremely gratifying, and I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was gifted this game after raving about the demo to a friend (I think he gave it to me just to shut me up. Mission FAILED because I still haven't shut up about it.) I don't think I've been this excited about a game since the first Bioshock. It's incredibly entertaining as well as educational... I thought I had a good grasp of orbital mechanics until I tried to land on Mun. A lot of fun building rockets, launching and flying them, doing science (we do what we must, because we can), and the adorable 'minion'-like Kerbals are a draw. I *highly* recommend this game to anyone interested in space sciences or with kids who are.The game is still in active development and is not yet 'finished'.A couple nitpicks: 1) the career mode is too hard in that there are some basic funtionalities that are way up the tree (ladders??) and require a great deal of science points to unlock. There's definitely a sharp learning curve with, due to component unaavailability, a pronounced 'hump'. 2) There are no lady Kerbalnauts. This should be addressed for girl gamers' sake. Anyway, back to being obsessed with KSP. Just managed to land on Mun and get back so working on a Minmus landing mission. :-)			",51,2,1,10,12,1,13

At the end of the day, this game is going to have you say, ""Just one more launch... just one more launch... OK, for real, just one more...""			",104,24,2,11,21,1,25

Really teaches you alot about orbital mechanics, and how to get you kerbonauts stuck on other planets!The Career Mode, though still in Alpha, is really fun, try challenging yourself by implementing your own rules to follow (ex. only spaceplanes) to increase re-playability. Definitly worth the cost and more!			",58,5,5,2,7,0,2

								Do you like space? Do you like designing space craft? Do you like engineering? Then this game is for you. Do you hate learning how to do stuff? Do you like games that anyone can play without a tutorial? Then you WON'T like this game. Kerbal Space Program is a VERY realistic space simulator and I highly recommend it to people who love space. You can build a space station, satellites, rovers, landers, space planes, you name it! It can probably be done! Overall this is a fantastic game and worth every penny. My only problem is the long amount of time for updates to be released. Other than that it's great. Just make sure you are ready to watch people's tutorials on YouTube because this game is not something to be mastered the day you purchase it. I've played over 30 hours and I still can't dock without blowing up everything! Have fun on your space voyages!			",23,5,0,1,11,0,4

								This is an amazing game that only keeps getting better as time passes. A lot to learn and explore and everything you do feels likes a new achievement. But this game is not for the faint of heart. It does take a bit of time to learn just what you can do and I highly recommend doing a few tutorials before just hopping in. You will often end up turning a lot of main flights into ""test flights"" as parts start to fall off and explode... Or discover that you need more fuel to get into orbit or you took off at the wrong time to get to the moon or planet you has set your eyes on.			",325,58,2,54,43,0,26

								9/10This game is still in early development alpha stage and yet I have played it more than any other Steam game. Don't let my ""low"" play time fool you, I must have over 200 extra hours I played before this was released on Steam.Despite being an alpha, Kerbal Space Program excels well. I honestly could believe this is a released game if it wasn't for the patchnotes and version number!The game itself alone can be played in sandbox or career mode. This means you can either start out with everything and just build wacky creations (incredible fun) or gradually build up the R&D to develop the different parts (gives way more pride). The feeling you get from completing the technology tree in career mode is incredible. Planning, building and flying missions makes me feel like a true rocket scientist.But surely that means you need to know rocket science? Well, not really. I started this game without any real knowledge of how spacecrafts get to orbit, how missions are structured or how different engines vary. I started originally by doing silly beginner mistakes, and slowly realised I could do things more efficiently a different way. I taught myself a lot about how orbital mechanics work, and the game inspired me to research more. I would say it's one of the biggest things that has driven my passion for space along with seeing Saturn through a telecope and watching a rocket launch from Kennedy Space Centre. So is the game centred around physics and orbital mechanics (bleh!)? Nope! While Kerbal Space Program brings many real life effects into account, and does its best to correctly model the physics acting upon bodies, you don't need to really pay much attention to this. For instance, you could build a huge plane and fly to the North Pole, or create a tank and drive around firing at buildings. This game can be as in depth as you'd like it to be.But what if science is your thing? Well then you're in luck because Kerbal Space Program allows you to whip out the calculator and start crunching those formulas. Several times I have been to wiki to remember the forumla for Delta V or when to make the most efficient transfer burn to one of the several other planets/moons. Mass, thrust, Isp, velocity and fuel quantities are all given to you by the game allowing you to plug them in to whatever equation you want allowing you to create several page booklets on each mission! I like to keep a notepad and pen closeby to scribble down some quick maths to make sure my missions will go off without a hitch.Not enough? Both the Forum and Space Port have hundreds of user-created (along with a few by users that have since been hired to work on the game itself) mods to install (via drag and drop, no hard installations!) and further expand the quantity and depth of your missions. Currently my favourite mod I am using makes unmanned vehicles need to be connected to Mission Control to be able to move, throttle, operate hardware and send back infomation. This means I have had to set up a telecommunications satellite array consisting of 4 ground stations, 6 geostationary satellites and 3 satellites orbiting each of the planet Kerbin's (your starting planet, similar to Earth) moons. Setting these up required some serious hard work and crazy amounts of logical thinking I didn't think I was capable of, but with it currently running perfectly I'm over the moon! (Ba dum tss)Remember; this game is still in Alpha: There are bugs, there are crashes, not everything you'd expect to be in the game is here yet. However, and more specifically recently, I have been seeing a huge drop in bugs. The physics engine could do with some work and aerodynamics leaves much to be desired. However, until this is further looked into by the devs, a marvelous user by the name of Ferram has created a mod to more accurately model aerodynamics. That's the way at the moment with KSP; Much like smartphones and apps, there's a mod for anything you'd want to do from going boating to recreating the Mir Space Station.I would highly recommend this game even if you aren't a huge fan of science or space because of the wacky, original fun you can have from messing around with this marvelous, beautiful game.

								I was gifted this game after raving about the demo to a friend (I think he gave it to me just to shut me up. Mission FAILED because I still haven't shut up about it.) I don't think I've been this excited about a game since the first Bioshock. It's incredibly entertaining as well as educational... I thought I had a good grasp of orbital mechanics until I tried to land on Mun. A lot of fun building rockets, launching and flying them, doing science (we do what we must, because we can), and the adorable 'minion'-like Kerbals are a draw. I *highly* recommend this game to anyone interested in space sciences or with kids who are.The game is still in active development and is not yet 'finished'.A couple nitpicks: 1) the career mode is too hard in that there are some basic funtionalities that are way up the tree (ladders??) and require a great deal of science points to unlock. There's definitely a sharp learning curve with, due to component unaavailability, a pronounced 'hump'. 2) There are no lady Kerbalnauts. This should be addressed for girl gamers' sake. Anyway, back to being obsessed with KSP. Just managed to land on Mun and get back so working on a Minmus landing mission. :-)			",51,2,1,10,12,1,13

								I think at one point when we were young everybody wanted to be an astronaut. Everyone dreams of flyinjg into outer space, exploring the cosmos. Well, you can do just that in this game. If you can get your rocket off the ground in one piece, that is.This game is what I suspect would be reality if NASA just did not give a ♥♥♥♥. For example, one time, I built a large rocket with four extra fuel canisters and boosters connected to the main one, which held the main thruster. As I lifted off, God chose to remind me right then and there that I forget to put on stage seperations parts, and promptly punished me for it. My craft was wieghed down, and after reach a couple hundred kilometers in the air it slowly descended to the dirt of Kerbal. Like the reincarnation of the Challenger Incident, the minor propulsion systems exploded first, leaving the main thruster to break apart limply on the ground before it too was engulfed in an explosion. This sent my cockpit, which carried three brave Kerbels(rest their souls) bouncing and skipping along the ground for a few seconds until they, too, exploded.tl;dr  Astronaut death simulator, 10/10 would play again.

								This game has the biggest learning curve I have ever encountered in a game. Hours upon hours have been wasted trying to build the perfect rocket, and time after time they fail.

								Perhaps the best simulator game I’ve ever played. Frustrating, amusing, and beautiful all at the same time. Hours fly by as you lead your space-pioneering Kerbals to intergalactic glory.			",102,35,1,19,24,0,34

								This game has changed me from a solid console gamer into a PC gamer. I have spend 300+ hours thus far in the game and it has been frustrating, rewarding and educational all at the same time. Launching a probe to the Gas Giant Jool and regreting not putting more science modules on board later when you have better building practices. So you do it all over agian. With the easy ability to mod, and the abundance of mods out for the game you are creating your own game, and it is a blast doing it!			",57,4,2,7,8,0,8

								Kerbal Space Program is the epitome of learning to fall with style. It is continuously amazing, continuously drawing my creative side, and it is continuously driving me to create bigger, better, and more likely to fail monsters of Aerospace. Career mode? That's a win but sandbox, the sandbox is where my own bread and butter is. It never gets old to push the limits of things and see how perfectly you can get something to fail. Yes, you will have a lot of failures but it contain the funnest amount of failing you've ever experienced. On top of that there is no greater pride than successfully launching something and taking it around the planet, to the Mun, and beyond. Fly forth little Kerbalnauts and here, you better read this apology for my ineptitude before you launch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Many kerbals died so I could get off of this planet. Many more probably will as a repercussion of my experiments. But I do it with the hope that some of these kerbals will someday explore the galaxy, but it'll take many hours of learning the hard way before that will be a faultless task.			",254,42,9,31,25,3,32

								KSP is one of the most fun educational games out there. It is educational because it doesn't set out to teach you anything, yet will make you want to study orbital mechanics, delta-v calculations and more. After a few days playing this you'll sound like an astro-physist because you'll actually be reading books by astro-physists.			",68,9,0,5,5,0,5

								I RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!Anything I say here probably wont do this game even a fathom of the recommendation this game deserves, I wouldnt even know where to begin to accurately describe this game; pictures give this game No justice, Not even Videos can, the KSP Demo itself gives the game barely a grain of sand worth of evidence as to how fun, cool, intense, nerve racking, Hard as Hell, Pleasing when you succeed, utterly shattered when you fail... And this still doesnt even begin the mile+ long list required to accurately portray all the aspects of this game.But, if you like building anything you can possibly think of so long as it has wheels, wings, or whatever you want... and dont mind risking it explode into a thousand pieces if you fail, or soaring through the empty limitless void of space should you succeed, mind you you might want to visit one of the ever growing list of universal objects you ""can"" visit, and by ""can"" i mean that if you can survive the harshness of space, the long distance trip(s), and not crash if you even get anywhere close to landing, then yes you can visit.Anyways, in short... Buy This Game. Its only gonna get better, and more expensive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
