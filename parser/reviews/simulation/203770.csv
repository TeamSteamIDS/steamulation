												Crusader Kings 2 is a complex grand strategy game.  The most complicated game I've ever played. Be prepared to spend hours and I mean hours confused as hell, looking at youtube, the wiki and forums.   Once it clicks though, it's awesome.  Not for everyone, but its kinda like playing through 'real life' Game of Thrones (there's a game of thrones mod too). You control a land owning character starting on any date between 1066 and 1453 AD (The Old Gods DLC will push this starting date back to 867 if you wish).  You can start as a powerful emperor or a lowly count.  The map you play on is more or less Europe stretching into parts of Asia and Africa.  Your sole goal in the game is to keep your bloodline going (and I believe holding land).  Other than that, there isn't a win screen, there aren't defined goals, its open ended, you play until 1453AD and then the game ends (save exportable to Europa Universalis 4 to continue your game with the purchase of a DLC).  You get a 'score', but that is just a rough estimate on how prestigious and pious your bloodline was.  It's quite possible to have 400 years of super rewarding gameplay without getting a high score.  This is a trend you will see me developing on and is a big part of what makes CKII so awesome.That's kinda hard to grasp, but it is less awkward than it sounds.  The goals sort of present themselves naturally.  You don't often sit there with no idea what to do (again, once you understand the game), you kind of always have something you're working towards.  For a first time player this is usually just become as powerful as possible, i.e. aquire land, become a king, then become an emperor and expand your empire.  If you're an advanced player you can set your own crazy goals, roleplay, or do other things to spice up the game.The game runs in 'real time', with a day going by a few times a minute on normal speed.  You can fast forward and pause.  Most of the time you will indeed be going through various menus.  Arranging marriages, keeping tabs on powerful families, plotting assinations, acquiring territory through political shennigans, keeping your subjects happy, bringing in powerful characters to tutor the children of the realm and hold office, and much more.  You can micromanage to your hearts content, play a more hands off style, or switch between the two.When combat breaks out, it is done by moving stacks of armys around the campaign map, meeting an opposing army will cause a battle.  These really just compose of watching numbers go down, and kills go up, so if you're looking for Total War style combat you arent going to get it here.  Don't be fooled though, many times I've been on the edge of my seat watching these numbers change.  The combat system is quiet nuanced as well. To be the most effective you have many things to consider. Terrain bonuses, attrition penalties, appointing competant commanders from your realm, and more add depth.In all I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played something like Civ or Total War and fancy themself a strategy gamer, is looking for a challenege, and has a lot of patience.  This is kinda the next step you can take into something quite a bit more complicated.  That is the path I took into the game am loving it.The game is still actively having expansions and patches developed for it as of the writing of this review 11/25/2013.Full disclosure:  Your reviewer has not quite finished a playthrough yet but am close.  I have 120 hours playtime. I own the dlcs The Old Gods, Legacy of Rome, and the Europa Universalis 4 save converter.  I solely purchased EU4 because of how much I enjoyed my crusader kings 2 game and wanted to continue playing my empire, I haven't even played it yet.Also: Don't buy for full price.  Even though it is worth it, getting the game and all the dlc all at full price is pretty expensive. The base game is often on sale or in bundles.This is my first steam review so if you think this is helpful give the thumbs up and I'll do some more reviews.  Hope you enjoyed reading.

												*Update* So good I nominated for an award!Word of warning when buying this, it will will ruin all other strategy games!I was a big Civilization fan and whilst it isn't really far to compare the two (they are wildly different in many ways) going back to something like Civ now seems like a huge leap back in terms of depth. The politics, emergent story and shear possibility of genuine scheming in Crusader Kings 2 make other dilpomacy games almost a joke. Once you've conspired to kill a duke with the help of his wife and the hope of triggering a civil war to potentially swing in the favour of your first born heir as your final legacy, nothing will offer the same devious pleasure in other games.By all means try the demo, but don't be scared off by the amount of information. Whilst great, the interface is certainly intimidating at first, but the tool tips are excellently written for just about every button. Just take your time and don't worry about losing to much at first, just mess around and it will soon come to you. This is the type of game that makes you want to write down your stories just to share with other people. Like that time I murdered my own inbred daughter because she was in a plot with my uncle to kill me! Beat that!			",230,30,5,32,44,2,53

												At the age of 16, my character developed a mad crush on a local girl. He crept into her room and banged her, then declared he loved her. 9 months later she gave birth to a child, he decided he didn't like it, smothered this child in its crib, pushed his lover off a balcony and then married a horny Greek princess and did it all over again until he commited suicide at the age of 72 because his son turned gay after coming back from a visit to Constantinople.

												I am sussex, one county in england at the 769 start.I realize I picked a bad start, and need to get land fast. so I took over kent, the de jure duchy.I am now the duke of Kent, but am stuck with mercia, wessex, and northumbria. so I decide to take those too.I am now the king of England. Unfortunately, ireland and scotland seem to hate things that aren't celtic and think they can attack me at will. so I take them over.I am content with staying on the empire of Britannia and never expanding as that brings trouble. except the vikings think they can constantly spam raids on me. so I take over all of scandinavia to stop the germanics.now that I am no longer surrounded by long boats, I can finally rest...and then the muslims invaded aquataine. realizing how screwed I am if the muslims manage to take france and germany, I proceed to commit genocide across the iberian peninsula to ensure christian safety. I can now finally stop conquering...until I notice that africa is only made of muslims since the shia took over mali. so to make sure that I don't get steam rolled later, I take them over too...I finally stop conquering for 50 years... until the mad emperor decides that he wants jerusalem, france, germany, italy and middle francia. so he conquers them all and eventually dies from a combination of stress, depression, and a wound.good thing that his genius son managed to keep the empire from being broken apart from all the lords who just don't like the Haesting family. unfortantely, I lose jersualem from every single muslim joining the jihad. but thats okay, I pushed into egypt and took control of the byzantine empire.The caliphate must have realized what I was planning, for 30 years after the fall of jerusalem he thought he could take anotolia. Neither he nor I expeceted the christianized mongolians helping me. I keep anatolia and eventually take back jerusalem.on May 30th, 1350, I was crowned Roman Emperor and given the nickname 'the glorious'.EDIT: At 820 hours, I have finally beaten my first ironman game. This game lasts far too long if you start at the 769 date since the game lags bad at the end.			",118,18,2,29,21,0,35

												Easily one of the best games I've had the fortune of playing. A grand stragey, which rather than being abstracted out to the extent of Civ or Europa Universalis, allows you to take on the role of a head of state (or, head of county or duchy) and do essentially what you like. Want to conquer Britain? Do it! Want to sit as a count for 400 years? Do it! Want to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire? Well... Good luck.Although the core game only allows Christian rulers (thanks ahyangyi!)  to be played, Sword of Islam adds Islamic groups, The Republic adds republics, The Old Gods adds Pagans and Sons of Abraham adds the Jewish kingdom. Each provides a new style of gameplay, distinct from the others.Grand strategy at its finest, though frustratingly hard at times.			",263,61,11,34,43,2,91

												I bought this game in a Humble Bundle package and activated it on May 14th of 2015. In the 566 days since that day, according to Steam, I have logged 1310 hours in this game. This means that 9.6% of my life since adding this game to my Steam library has been playing Crusader Kings 2. If you adjust to exclude 7 hours of sleep per day, 13.6% CK2 time. If you adjust to exclude a 40 hour work week, this figures to 20.5%.Since installing this game, it has occupied one fifth of my waking non-work life.These are all facts. Hard, sobering, mathematical facts. Some day, if I stop playing CK2, perhaps I will reflect upon these facts. But until then, I'll be conquering the world.			",122,13,3,18,13,0,39

												Dear Diary, Day 1, I played CK2 as a Viking Lord in Norway. I was able to get FedualisAm and reformed Religion. 65 years old and on death door I was able to get Primogeniture passed as a tribe and formed kingdom of sweden and norway.Day 2, Today the throne was passed to me by my father. I was able to take over Finland and Denmark to create an empire. Found a new home in England and that will be the target of my son.Day 3, My father was a viking berserker, He lead an army of 5000 men charging toward 3000 skirt troop but he was manage to get surranded and killed. I got on the throne just 14 years old and I will probably rule it a long time.Day 4, I am still on the throne and now i am now 70 years old. A lot things happened and United Kingdom is now under viking Banner and I am still a bit short of forming the wendish empire. It's Already midnight here so a new day will start.Day 5, It's pass mid night and i will play until i pass the throne to my son. as 70 I will need to slow down and manage my titles, county and Duchy well. Time to be a bit ruthless tyrant and once I die all bad behavior will be washed away.PSSSSttt.. I am now 83 years old.. Why won't i die? All the vassal are extramly unhappy with me taking duchy, Banish overpowered lord. I had to bribe people regulary. Murder over powerful faction member. And forget about Fabricate Claims I need it to keep my subject happy. MAARARAFDAAS... I am now 93 years old.. I accepted the fact that i won't die anytime soon And it's 5:30 in the morning already. Meh.. This is a review? Not a Diary? Why are you Staring at my story.., Buy the game and start your own story.Update:A little update to the fun fact.. he finnaly died at 95. then the heir was 75 and died with the year then the heir was 59 and already mained and ill. He died in 3 month. Now i am playing as a 2 year old infant. Wow. I love this game.			",2441,943,81,289,309,25,343

Product received for free
												So I think it's about that time when I actually review this game. I've played it off steam for more than 300 hours and about 1500 hours on steam, so it's fair to say I've experienced just about all the bugs, highs and lows, DLCs' and changes to the game's mechanics through the never-ending patches on Paradox' end. I will preface this by saying I'm a history nerd and a complete and utter sucker for the medieval era. I'm a nostalgic dreamer who always used to dream about a game that was dynasty (family) focused, as opposed to the total warfare/dominate the universe-type game. So when I got this game as a gift, it was like someone had created the game for me. It's my go to when I just want to pass time and see whatever my Swedish countess or Scottish duke are up to. The level of micromanagement is ridiculous. I love it. But it's borderline insane. Go through the tutorials of the game, and you'll find yourself lost with a sensation of you might know what you did wrong. Don't go through the tutorials, and you might as well be trying to fill in for Slash at a concert, when the most experience you've had playing a guitar was looking at a banjo through a shop's window. It's intense. In the beginning I lost whole countries to distant relatives in other countries and was scratching my head, but eventually I got the hang of it. I think everyone can play this game, but you have to be prepared to put in a lot of effort and willingness to learn its mechanics. And then after that, there are lesser things to learn, such as your wife trying to kill you because you had a sweet dalliance with her sister. Or perhaps the fact that leading your own troops could result in the unfortunate event of you losing your life, and your 3-year old, imbecilic son inheriting your entire kingdom. There's always more to learn, no matter how much you play this game - its excitement will last you a long time. I love this game because of its neverending possibility for replayability. No game will ever be the same. You can customize your characters with an inexpensive DLC (get the DLCs - at least ""The old Gods"" and a few more. They add so much to the game), and you can create the basis of your new game with a new objective. The word sandbox is key, because in this world, you are not only the lord of your demesne, but of your own fate. Do you want to take that neighbouring county? Or do you just want to keep your family strong and safe, provide good husbands for your daughters? Maybe your king has been getting on your nerves and you want to gather allies and usurp his throne? This medieval world is all yours - if you have the gold, skill and time. On the downside of things, I think CK2 is worth €40, but for a four-year old game it's on the steeper side. It's frequently on sale though. Add it to your wishlist and wait; you can snatch it up for a fraction of its original price. I've enjoyed this game so much and had so many angry, funny and downright amazing moments. Wars I thought I'd lose have turned and I've won entire kingdoms. I've romanced my way through entire courts to get women to join my plots to kill people. The level of intrigue, surprises, horrors, joys and entertaining moments are endless. Oh, and...I seduced the pope once. As a gay king. 10/10.			",20,8,0,14,14,0,6

												Crusader Kings II is in my opinion one of the best strategy games out there. Do you like medieval times? Times when you could call your vassals forth and fight against the invader? Or against an ally? Your brother? Your sister? Your cat? Then shut up and give them money!You can play as the brutal vikings and sack the coastal regions, or an Irish nobleman who wants to reunify the broken country, or a republic? Do you want to be the prince of Persia? Ok jokes on the side, additional content has been recently announced, the game is constantly being updated by the devs, and they are truly working hard on it. You have a save file converter to continue the adventures of your dinasty on EUIV, another grand strategy game. Start out small, and try to make your family name shine! You can even customize your rulerz (an additional dlc though). Yes this is a fanboy review.			",183,42,3,27,20,4,21

												My friend and I decided to play a multiplayer game of Crusader Kings II earlier. Never in my life have I ever been more frightened in a video game. Let me explain.My friend and I decided to be counts in different kingdoms and empires. My character was a little interesting.First Name: 12Last Name: ISISGoal: Spread my ""seed"" to all corners of the worldLocation: EnglandRank: Count of KentI had set the goal of spreading my ""seed"" all over the world because I thought it would make for some interesting gameplay, and boy did something interesting happen.The game started off normal, my friend was in the Holy Roman Empire as a Duke, and I was in the nearby province of Kent in England, not far from the border of the Holy Roman Empire so we were both well within diplomatic range. I started to spread my ""seed"" by seducing as many women as I could. I tended to seduce the women who had high rankings, such as the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the Queen of England, Queen of France, and other higher ranking women. My fertility was well above average, and basically any woman I seduced would have a child.After a couple of decades having passed, my friend had become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and I spread my seed to almost every major kingdom and empire in diplomatic range (little did my friend know, he was actually playing as my illegitimate child that I had with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire). You could always tell which children were mine based on their names. Most of my children had the most ridiculous names like, ""THANKS OBAMA"" or ""Nigerian Prince Simulator"". But, there was one child I had that would cause a lot of problems for everyone. His name was ""Forgot the Condom"".""Forgot the Condom"" was a normal child at first. He grew up till the age of 6 relatively normal, but then something went horribly wrong. While trying to seduce more women, I got a notification in the game. This is essentially what the notification said: ""My son 'Forgot the Condom' is not like other children. He does not scream or cry or even get upset, but he observes the world with keen interest. This morning, he burst into bubbling laughter when a cook cut his hand badly and there was blood everywhere. Animals do not like him and he makes a strange buzzing sound when near other children. Courtiers whisper 'demon spawn' and the servants have started to avert their eyes and make covert signs to ward off evil."" After telling my friend about the event (he had a lot more experience in the game than me), he immediately mentioned that I should stop whatever I was doing and kill my child. My friend exact words were, ""Your son is a demon, you have to kill him or it will be too late.""""Too late?"" I asked. My friend remained silent. At the time, the only way to kill your own child was to imprision them and execute them. So, I decided I would try to do that. Well, whenever I tried to imprison ""Forgot the Condom"", he ended up escaping and fleeing the country. I explain this to my friend and he tells me, ""We have to kill him, somehow."" At the time, neither my friend nor I knew about the character search tool in the game, so we had to manually find ""Forgot the Condom"" in all of the provinces. We looked for 30 minutes, and could not find him. After we finished searching, we decided to continue with the game as normal. ""Let's just hope nothing bad happens"", my friend exclaimed.Five years pass, and I get a notification. It reads: ""My dear daughter 'SWAGYOLO420NOSCOPE"" must have suffered a stroke in her sleep last night. She was found drooling in bed, one eye bloodshot, mumbling about a small monster that stabbed her in the eye before it ran off. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my son 'Forgot the Condom', again... As always when something terrible happens, she does seem inordinately happy."" I thought we had been rid of ""Forgot the Condom"", but he was back, with a vengeance.I tried finding ""Forgot the Condom"" again in all of the provinces near me, but I could not find him.Another year passes, my son ""URLUCKYIDIDNTABORTU"" dies. Then my daughter, ""6 Salads"" dies. My son, ""Taco Tuesday"" dies. At this point I realized, ""Forgot the Condom"" is killing all of my children. I entirely dedicated to finding and killing him. I'm looking around for him, and he is killing all of my children. We look for him for 2 years in game, when my friend says something.""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ I FOUND HIM!""""WHAT WHAT, WHERE IS HE?"" I ask.""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ he.... he""""What? What's wrong?""""He is the ♥♥♥♥ING POPE.""I immediately check to see if he is right. My son... my son, ""Forgot the Condom"" is the ♥♥♥♥ing Pope. My friend and I start to freak out, ""How the hell did he become the Pope?!?!"" ""What do we do?"" ""HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE THIS BEFORE?!?!?!""Immediately we start a plot to kill ""Forgot the Condom"". We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late.We had 167% plot power, we were going to kill him, but then the worst thing happen. I get a notification: ""My dear son 'Ebola Paitent 0' has died."" So, what is so special about Ebola Paitent 0? Well, Ebola Paitent 0 was the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, aka my friend. My demon child ""Forgot the Condom"" killed my friend. At this point in the game, the entirety of my children and lineage, the ISIS family line, had been completely wiped out. Except for one person, except for me, ""12, 12 of the family ISIS"". I could no longer kill my son because you cannot plot against your children, I was stuck. I had no where to go. I was going to die, the ISIS family line was going to die. I struggled to find any way to kill the Pope, my friend could not start a plot because his new character was a child. We had nowhere to turn. We were out of options.Eventually, the worst came, ""Forgot the Condom"" killed me in my sleep. I was dead, the legendary ""12 of ISIS"" was dead.The game ended. I had no heirs, and I was eliminated from the game. The game was also hosted by me so it ended for my friend as well.""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ was that?"" my friend said. I didn't even say anything. A few minutes pass, we were staring at the defeat screen the entire time.""We must remember this in some way."" I explained. ""We must remember '12 of ISIS' and 'Forgot the Condom'. We need to memoralize them forever."" ""How do we do that?"" my friend asks.""I don't know, but we must remember them. They are legends and must never be forgotten.""TL; DR The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.			",539,187,10,91,72,7,109

 Everything You Need To Know  (She just want to smoke and create the definitive review for CK2, I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do."")  That Good Good  Good News:  The game is great and endlessly replayable. Pros beat the cons. Stop reading this and buy it, nerds.   Good News:   You don't have to force it. If learning the game isn't immediately fun, stop. You're not missing enjoyment later. Good News:   Losing is fun!  History has its eyes on you. Good News:   Winning is fun! There are easy starts for first time players. Cornwall 1066 is great place to hide.. Good News:   The Game of Thrones Mod is proof that life is worth living. Look how lucky we are to be alive right now. Good News:   The Conclave features getting roasted in the negative reviews can now be disabled, mostly.  Good News:   You're smart enough to succeed even if those Conclave features couldn't be disabled. I appreciate you, a lot. Good News:   Civilization is a strategy board game. If you'd prefer a historical rulership sim, this is it. You're home. Good News:   Most of the DLC is unimportant. Plus, it's easier to learn by starting with the base game anyway.  DLC Importance The base game is playing a Christian Crusader King. Most game features cater to them. The Holy Land awaits.DLC releases are accompanied by free updates, so the current base game alone is still better than the base game at launchDLC rulers (Indians/etc) are advanced variations on the rulers in the base game. No need to buy them until way later.For example, Vikings are a blast, but only if you can appreciate how they're different from normal kings.You won't enjoy these rulers if you don't at least somewhat enjoy the basic ones, so, again, DLC not a major key upfront.DLC rulers are not needed to play the game as it was intended. They explore playing the game as it was not intended. It's not ""You want to play Super Mario Bros as Luigi? Fifteen bucks.""It's more ""For your 1000th playthrough of Super Mario Bros, would you like to pay to play as the Goomba Caliph?"" DLC Cost Remember, the game had plenty of people hooked before the DLC features existed.Buy the DLC you want over time. I had to do that, they weren't out yet!If you still like the game after 100 hours of play, buy The Old Gods. If you still like it 100 hours later, buy Way of Life and Legacy of Rome.After 300 hours grab Sword of Islam. (And Ruler Designer and Customization if you want to get creative.)Snag Conclave and Charlemagne on hour 400, and then you're done.Buy Way of Life upfront if you want. Or add these DLCs in a different order or at a different rate. It doesn't matter.They're not starter material, they're meant to add a fresh spin on a game you want more of. Game is fantastic, but maybe some of these nitpicks are dealbreakers/I don't know your life/You do you   Bad News:  Tutorial is not helpful. Check YouTube or just feel it out. If your hype dies, stop playing. I stayed hyped. Bad News:  This game's multiplayer isn't good but the real problem is them even putting it in at all. Games can take weeks! Bad News:  Bugs. Enough to make Ironman (where console commands and manual saving are disabled) unappealing. Bad News:  Like other detailed projects (think Skyrim, Fallout), it's gonna crash. Mods turn this up to 11. It's worth it. Bad News:  The combat system is functional but uncomplicated. This is not Total War. Don't push it in that direction. Bad News:  Unlike the rest of the game, ideal army composition is not something you'll figure out by playing. Bad News:   Plenty of names from plenty of languages and zero pronunciation hints. Bad News:  Feudal rulers were not absolute monarchs. This can be difficult. You will be tempted to mod this out. Don't. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good. The base game is comparatively lacking in roleplay elements. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good, but you're better off waiting until you're a seasoned CK2 veteran. Bad News:  Occasionally, you may feel like you arbitrarily have less control over your character than you should. Bad News: AI is stubborn, impatient, insecure, and can't see the big picture. Bad News:  AI will be equally mad about being harmed and about being denied some extremely unfeasible goal. Bad News:  Your council gets upset at your heir when you die for... not being you. Bad News:  There's an education event where you can make your kid functional if you harm yourself in return. It's never worth it, and ignoring it is impossible because... Bad News:  This event can actually be gamed, as all mentors can receive it. Simply make a rival mentor a kid, then watch him become a inefficient mess. Unfortunately, this can also wreck valuable NPCs or  anyone whoever mentors anyone . Bad News:  AI never considers that the situation they don't like is still their best option. They always prefer change. Bad News:  Loyalty is not measured separately from opinion. The ramifications of this will become obvious the more you play Bad News:  You lose too much control over your children if they're not in your court. Bad News:  Similarly, you have no power to intervene on their behalf if you couldn't do the same if they weren't family. Bad News:  Split custody issues exist but there's no way of predicting some of them and no mechanic for fixing any of them. Bad News: : When you die and become your heir, you're not given context or explanation for what they've been up to, even though you're now them.  Bad News:  Some of your council resigns when your heir takes over, but they don't mind being immediately rehired.... what? Bad News:  Your heirs will sabotage the stability of your realm even thought it will hurt them later when they're in charge. Bad News: Enemy rulers sometimes continue to rule from places you've already conquered, making them uncapturable. Bad News:  No boat combat. Not a big deal, but the cost of getting and maintaining boats is a lot for just a troop transport.  Bad News:  All of inner Africa south of Muslim-held West Africa feels poorly thought out.  Wack Issues   Bad News:  The game map has grown. India will make your game slower even if you never go there.  Bad News:  You're never going to India. Bad News:  Your laptop will heat up. Blame India. The Game of Thrones mod similarly is plagued by Essos. Bad News:  They chose adding India over strengthening the base game. It has no reason to be here. Bad News:  Norse and Muslim rulers are key to Europe, so their expansions helped the base game. India? Not so much. Bad News: : I just don't get why India is in this game. It adds a huge problem for weaker PCs for a minimal payoff. Bad News:  Dealing with raiders becomes an annoying chore if you control many coastal provinces. Bad News:  Adventurers/Rebels (can be disabled) get bizarrely huge armies. You'll understand when you see it. The Wackest Issue (In-game) Costs are laughably expensive and not relative to each other. The different random events where you can spend money on things often require a literal king's ransom. Some mundane costs are equal to a month's income of Europe's largest kingdom. It is frustratingly nonsensical.  Small Issue w/ Bad Vibes The ruler designer, which is a paid add-on, will not let you create an unbalanced character even if you aren't playing in Ironman for Achievements.This is absurd and an actual legitimate DLC grievance. You can futz around with the console to try to fix it, but it's not a perfect solution. Mod fix is available. Vote Dukakis  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just minding my own business down in the little duchy of Serbia when three royal marriages and two feasts later I get a notification that I have inherited the entire kingdom of Denmark. This game, with all of its DLCs for its full potential, is absolutely brilliant in that it brings character customisation and character development to a whole new level. Certainly different from the other Paradox Interactive franchises but in the best way possible. Each Paradox Interactive grand strategy has their own unique focus of gameplay which corresponds accurately to the time period and Crusader Kings II has definitely nailed it with their focus on indepth feudal systems and royal relations. Also I imprisoned all my Danish vassals and watched Denmark plunge into anarchy under my command. 10/10 would usurp title again			",80,12,2,12,19,0,21

Incest simulator ?This is the title that many jokingly have given this game on the internet. However this far from what the game is, can you perform incest, yes, however the deepth and dynamics goes far beyond mere incestual relations. Main purpose or goal?You are the head of a dynasty, at the beginning of the game, you can choose which dynasty, and who within that dynasty that you want to play as. Do you want to take control of one of the powerful rulers of the mighty Karling dynasty? Or do you want to repeat history by trying to bring a small count in Switzerland from an obscure family known as Habsburg to their glory, as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and spread the Habsburg from there on. With the customize ruler DLC you expand you game a thousandth-fold, you will have to power to not only choose who you want to play as, but you can create you whole new dynasty and ruler. Want a genius hunchback who rules over the Arabian Empire? Do you want to try and backstab your way to the top of the Byzantine Empire with a powerful spy? It is up to you!There is one indicator on how well you have done, that is your Score which the game at the end compare with other great historical dynasties. You increase your score by having rulers with high prestige and piety, but also having other dynasty members in high positions, will generate prestige to your dynasty, giving newborn a higher starting position in life, when it comes to their prestige.There are so many DLCs!Many seem to get overwhelmed by the amount of DLCs this game has, however many of those are cosmetic DLCs, adding other graphics or sounds to the game. The main DLCs that expand gameplay are:I will rank them, with the top being the most important expansion to get first, by my own opinion.Ruler Designer - This will enable you to create your own ruler, only your imagination will limit the replayability of the game.Legacy of Rome - This expansion not only gives more deepth to the Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine, and greek cultures, it also provides new game mechanics, such as military retinues. (Also allow the possibility for castrating and blinding prisoners playing as a ruler of the Byzantine culture group)The Old Gods - This enable you to play the game from 867 CE, and also make Pagans and Zoroastrian rulers playable.Sword of Islam - Makes muslims playable, as The Old Gods each unique religion has its own mechanics.Sons of Abraham - Adds more deepth to the abrahamic faiths and also Judaism. Heresies for religions are also possible.The Republic - Want to try out the merchant life of Venice? With this DLC that will be possible, take control of a patrician family, amass wealth and control the trade zones around the shores of the known world.Charlemagne - Introduces a new starting time, at 769 CE, gives you the option to create custom Kingdoms and Empires.Rajas of India - Allows for control of the Indian rulers. Way of Life - Focus the life of your ruler towards certain areas of his life, want to became a great hunter to catch the fable white bear? Or became the greatest architech in the whole realm?Customization Pack - Customize your ruler ingame, change the beard, hair style, even the dynasty name or shield.Sunset Invasion - If you want to add an extra level of crazy to your game, only recommended for veteran players of CK2, what if the Aztec discovered Europe first? And decided to invade?Save Game converter - If you own Europa Universalis IV and want to continue your saga from CK2, this DLC will enable you to export your CK2 game into EU IV.All the other DLCs are cosmetical.Mods!Crusader Kings 2 has more mods, that will expand your game, one of the more popular mods is a total conversion into a Game of Thrones universe. Where you can encounter spoilers from the series, but it will also make you play out the stories in George R.R. Martin's universe in another direction, should Tyrion Lannister have the Iron Throne? Learning curve?It has a steep learning curve, and the ingame tutorial only scratches the surface of possibilities. I would recommend picking up the game, and play with a friend online, or experiment as a count in Ireland. But when you get a hang on it, it will grab you, and pull you deeper into a world of intrigue, murder, war, romance, and much more. In an forever going struggle for power over the realm, and the world. ",122,13,0,21,38,1,42

												As a northern Jarl. My ambition was to unify the Northern people, as my father had did before me. I set out and subjecated my neighbours. Soon Norway, Sweden, Denmark and half of Finland was mine. My most favored and ONLY son, a true prodigy of my blood line; did me proud when he said he wanted to service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard.With tears in the back of my throat, my heart beating with pride as I saw the ship sail away to a golden sunset. Many months passed without a word from my son. I had many daughters in his absence. I ruled and I went and conquered the Saxon kingdom. The south was open for the taking.I reccive words after putting down a foolish rebellion. That sails bearing the family standard. A Golden tree on a field of green. I made prepartions in the hall. Odin be praised! My son was finally home! As the doors slams open and a man I bearly recognize as my son steps into the light. He seems ashamed despite my smiles. After the feast, I told him it was time for him to take on a wife and make a family.Dark became the hall when he told me the news of deeds in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Sleeping with one of the wifes of the Emperor. He had lost his manhood. I had not gotten my son back... but another daughter.I told my housecarls to seize the creature before me and put him in chains. He did not scream nor complain as my men dragged him away. I have to respect him for that.The day came when it was time for blot, so I personally was the one who placed the blade at my former son's throat and made the leathal blow. The Jarls of the Kingdom, seemed pleased at this. But I knew that behind their false smiles that their resentment of me was now higher without an heir. I had only daughters.Who would have known that my sons life was connected to my own. Bloodlines are like trees. Roots are the ancestors, the trunk are you and the branches are the children. Now without the branches my line has come to an end.As I see the army of my wifes brother come over the hills eager to see my head detached from my body, I can only think what will happen to my memory. Will someone remember this bloodline? Or will we fade into oblivion? Even so, I will see my son in Valhalla. And there we will feast with the Aesir. Odin see me!This is my story.What will be yours?This game is worth playing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you care about the amount of gameplay you get for your money at all, this game probably rates higher than any other game. (Last I read, the average player had over 500 hours on this game.) Crusader Kings II is a strategic game where you spend most of your time looking at a big map of Europe cut into little counties, but it is drastically different from a game like Medieval II: Total War.  Whereas in those games, every nation had rigid boundaries and an entire nation was a distinct, unified entity, Crusader Kings II focuses upon the feudal system of governance, and especially its hereditary system of succession.You are not a nation, you are an extended family through the ages.  You may start as King of England, but lose the throne in a succession war, only to wind up inheriting the Kingdom of France, instead.  It is a game of political machinations more than warfare.You can't just declare war whenever you want to, you need to, by hook or by crook, manage to get a claim to that land you want to invade.  Battles are relatively quick and hands-off (play that Total War if you want to manage the troops directly) but it's the space between wars that makes the game interesting.  To get that claim, you probably need to find some way to get the princess of that land in your bed (or your son's bed), and it's this medieval bloodline plotting that make up the meat of the game.  For that matter, you don't necessarily need to declare war to gain land - just marry into the family that succeeds a throne, and make sure that, one way or the other, your chosen heir also manages to be the chosen heir of a target kingdom, and the kingdoms will be unified upon the death of your current character and the current king of the target land. Likewise, just because you gain land doesn't mean you can keep it.  You need to delegate land out, and succession laws can fragment your kingdom so much that you see hard-conquered lands slip out of your grasp by inheritence without your consent.  EDIT: And since writing this, Conclave has come out to add complexities to keeping your nobles in line.Worse, while whomever you give land will be quite grateful for the first 20 years of their rule or so, their children will have no gratitude for the gift of land your father gave them, and will likely be burning with ambitions you have to keep in check.  Every few decades, your character ages and dies, and succession wars and civil wars are the primary way the game keeps your over-arching ambitions in check.  Rather than letting a large empire mean that no external threat can challenge you, and no internal threats exist, the larger you become, the less vulnerable you are to external threats, but the more vulnerable you are to internal ones. You spend more and more time trying to find a way to bludgeon the rebellious nobles and religious minorities into line.If you get tired of games of Total War, and don't bother completing them because, once you are the strongest power on the map, there's nothing to do but steamroll everything else that stands in your path, then CK2 is a great remedy to this.  (You can still make a world-spanning super-empire, but it's much more interesting to try to keep it when the owners of that land still fight you when you plant your flag there than to just have them mutely pay taxes to you and have assumed loyalty to your cause.)It's a game that's just hard and realistic enough to make the things you do actually feel like you're thumbing your nose at history.  You can play an Irish earl, rise to High King of Ireland, and conquer England.  Or play as the West Africans, and conquer the Muslims and convert them to your pagan faith.  Being a norse viking that captures the pope and sacrifices him to Odin is always fun.  (And nabs the Holy Smoke! achievement.) And if you do it with an unbroken line of Viking empresses, all the better.Mods are also a high point: Play the Elder Kings mod, based upon the Elder Scrolls, and conquer Cyrodiil and beyond as an immortal or vampire, using magicks to summong hordes of demons when under threat. There's an A Game of Thrones mod, as well, and mods to turn the game into something like a space 4X game.  DLC still comes out for the game, as well.  While more than a little annoying to be nickled and dimed, the trickle of new content keeps the game fresh and new achievements are meaningful challenges, requiring players to take up historic underdogs to rise to glory.  Getting a full board of achievements is extraordinarily difficult, but enjoyable for the challenge they provide.  Compare this to Activision, Ubisoft, or EA, where you buy iterations of the same game every year, and throwing down $10 for another year's worth of life in a game is well worth the price.

												I recommend the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.Seriously, if you like grand-scale strategy games, but want something with a deeper ""roleplaying"" element in it, this game is right up your alley. Ultimate goal of the game is to advance your familial dynasty to the top of medieval Europe's feudal pecking order through war, diplomacy, subterfuge, and all sorts of other scandalous medieval shenanigans. You play the game through your character, who experiences text-based events occasionally that you, the player, must choose how he reacts to. You will mobilize and lead armies, fall in love, conquer foreign (and-not-so-foreign nations), marry your cousins and breed your children using the power of eugenics to secure your family's power in future generations -- though not necessarially in that order.Fun♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10 just like the real medieval times.

												11/10 - Would become Earl Cadoc of Cornwall again.CK2 – The Misfortune SimulatorThe Life of Cadoc of CornwallWilliam the Conqueror succeeds in his invasion of England, which is good as Harold was good for nothing. In his wisdom, William decided to create the Duchy of Cornwall and NOT make me the Duke. I remain a lowly Earl.Start plot to assassinate the current Duke of Cornwall, I want that position. Nobody likes me enough to join it. End of plot.The only guy who actually liked me a lot and had great traits, my Chancellor, today died of depression. The only two suitable replacements look more like the living embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins. I chose one of them with reluctance.My wife is pregnant. Hopefully it'll be a boy!My first daughter, whom is to be my heir, refuses to learn any of my traits. To this day, she remains Ambitious, and only Ambitious.The child is born. It's a girl.And to add the icing on the bitter Cake of Feudal Disappointment, my loving wife died giving birth to said child.Got married again!Wife insisted on becoming a Spymaster. Funny, both my wives have been Spymasters...Treason! Rebellious scum have risen in Cornwall, and I am besieged. According to someone of little importance in my Council, this rebellion only had a 6.5% chance of actually happening. I should buy a ticket for the Great Monarch Lottery.Duke Arsewipe of Cornwall has aided me in removing the rebellious scum that infested my lands. I still hate him.Praise be to God! A plague of Typhus has swept Cornwall. Perhaps Duke Arsewipe shall be given a painful and miserable death.Duke Arsewipe lives...yay.My wife is pregnant, I hope it's a boy. I'm sure the saying goes “Second time lucky”.Apparently the saying goes “Third time lucky”, and I am now the only man in a house of my wife and four daughters.Instead of consoling me, today my Court Chaplain came to me to spread heresy. Naturally, I imprisoned him.My Steward is dead, and there are no candidates to replace him. I now spend a portion of my day keeping the chair warm.Today, I learned that Duke Arsewipe had a previous wife who tragically died of Camp Fever. I'm still unsure as to what the hell kind of name 'Hungifu' is for a woman. Those weird Anglo-Saxons.My wife is once again pregnant. Since this is the 'third time', maybe I will be in luck.My first daughter has married the son of the King of Denmark. We are now far more Prestigious, and Denmark are now my allies.It's a boy! Cador is born!My eldest daughter has given birth to a daughter.My second eldest daughter has just married the son of the King of Navarra. We now have an alliance with Navarra. Duke Arsewipe better look over his shoulder from now on.My niece has asked me to help her find a suitor to marry. Rather concerning is the fact that someone has put my newborn son on the list. I will choose her someone that isn't related. I decided to hold a marvellous feast, with only the finest food. Unfortunately, I only have one guest. The feast went well.Managed to convince my Bishop, whom was formerly my Court Chaplain, to become a Catholic once again. Upon doing so, I released him from prison.I have started a new plot to kill Duke Arsewipe, and with a little (a lot) of coin, I have convinced two others to join me. At last, my enemy shall die!For whatever reason only known to them, my two supporters backed out without telling me. To add insult to injury, Duke Arsewipe had the nerve to ask me to let a member of his family educate one of MY children!Turned 50 today. Happy Birthday to me...yay.Today, my WIFE discovered that my eldest DAUGHTER is planning to kill my only SON and heir. I think my family has finally hit rock bottom.My wife is pregnant...A boy has been born! This is becoming a big family, hopefully they won't murder each other.Alas, sickness murdered my newborn son.It's been twenty years since Duke Arsewipe became duke, and for some reason, he still insists on breathing more life into his wretched soul. I may be older, but I will outlive him!My wife is pregnant...again. I really need to calm down in my old age.It's a boy. The family seems to be evening out a bit now.I have no idea how I do it, but I've managed to get my wife pregnant again. My Court Chaplain insists I stop these so-called “shenanigans”.I am blessed with another son.Duke Arsewipe has stepped over the line now. He has asked me to allow HIM to educate MY son and heir. May the Devil take him!60 today. I insist upon outlasting Duke Arsewipe!My eldest daughter's husband has died at the age of 31, and the circumstances are very suspicious.My son and heir is now married to the princess of the Holy Roman Empire!My half-brother, Dumnarth, died today. He will be greatly missed.Insulted my wife by calling her gluttonous and a monster when it comes to table manners. I shall not be doing that again.It is done. Duke Arsewipe finally had his last breath on August 1st, 1101 at the age of 69. I can now go to my grave a happy man.At the age of 72, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall died after a period of illness on November 2nd, 1103. He succeeded in his goal of outlasting his mortal enemy.Rest In Peace, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall. ",28,1,1,11,8,0,8

												I suppose that now that I've logged over 1,000 hours playing Crusader Kings 2 I should carve out a little time to say that this is demonstrably my favorite game of all time (by a factor of five, if you're curious).  There are 16,000 other reviews that will give you more details of what's great and what's not about the game, but let me just add that I have never found a game that better simulates  internal  political conflict within a country.  Think about it: you play most ""great"" strategy games like Civilization, and you'd think that nations were made up of uniform automatons - the worst it gets there is some city riots because you didn't build enough ""Happiness"" buildings.  In CK2 your vassal rulers are individuals, with their individual ambitions and characteristics, and they can be a real pain to manage - sometimes they fight with one another, sometimes they fight with you, and ultimately it's about who's got the most leverage.  The only difference between CK2 politics and modern democratic politics is that ""leverage"" in the 12th century is usually counted in swords; besides that, the backstabbing and intriguing is pretty indistinguishable.  A strong king, just like a strong president, is one who dominates their internal foes so that they can in turn dominate their external ones.That simple innovation is what's made this my all-time favorite game, the one I've been coming back to year after year.  Add to that a dedicated modding community that let's you play out the same internal/external conflict in Game of Thrones, Ancient Rome, or Warhammer, and, well, you've got at least a thousand hours of fun ahead of you.

												Crusader Kings II is an exceptional game in that no other title will make you feel like a ruler as well as it. You're not just a country, like in other grand strategy games. You are a ruler with qualities, flaws, vices and virtues. You can be a Duke who is a brilliant diplomat with a hunchback, an ugly, stuttering dimwit count, or a mastermind plotter/lesbian queen. (I'm NOT making it up). And you can be all that within in a single playthrough, as you re-incarnate into your heir when you die. You have to be good at managing your realm, but you've got to be even better at managing your dynasty by arranging favourable marriages, assassinate pretenders... It's all very involving and requires a lot of micro-management (which you may or may not like).It's not without flaws: the interface could see much improvement and the game starts to slow down when you become powerful. By slow down, I don't mean that your computer has a hard time coping, I mean that there are many more events that require your constant attention, making things move at a slower pace. To be honest, after several hundred hours, I think I'm a bit burned with the game. And that, even though there are entire DLCs I haven't really explored yet: I have only really played as a Catholic or Muslim ruler, but DLCs let you play as pagans, Orthodoxes, republics...And then there are a couple of Mods that are probably worth exploring as well: ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Tamriel"" (from the Elder scrolls series)Still, with so much content and the unbeatable feeling of being an actual Middle-Ages ruler, it's hard to rate CKII anything lower than a 9 out of 10.

I can guarantee you most of the entertaining features you saw in that video are going to cost you at least another 5 USD each. Remember seeing that youtuber raiding england and pillaging all the churches as a viking warrior? 15 USD. Remember seeing them ruling mediterranean trade as the venetian republic? 10 USD. Remember how they conquered all of europe for the caliphate? 10 USD. Remember how they united india under one glorious empire? 15 USD. Remember how they designed their own character to conquer europe with? 5 USD.Remember how not all of the different nationalities looked exactly the same? That's going to cost you another 2 USD per portrait set. Remember how not all of the units looked exactly the same? 2 USD per unit set. Remember all of that different music in the background? That's going to set you back as wellIt's a great gameWould it be worth 40 USD? YesIs it worth 234.48 258.45 USD? No. Not at all. Which is why I couldn't possibly recommend itNow, if there were a way to play the full game without spending hundreds of your hard-earned (insert currency here), then it would be a different story...(EDIT) If you can catch it on a 75% sale like what's on until the 5th of october then that's a solid deal, just know that the 'collection' doesn't include all of the DLCs like you'd be forgiven for assuming			",27,6,0,8,16,0,19

												This used to be my favorite game ever. I have hundreds of hours logged into this game. I even loved crusader kings 1. But Paradox has decided to let some no talent idiots take control of the Crusader Kings 2 project. Essentially they have repalced the main development team and the vision of the game has drastically changed. I have almost all the DLC's for this game and have spent quite a bit of money on it and NOW they start ruining it? Instead of giving us new things to conquer or new characters to interact with or new cool things to do they have decided just to make the old things harder and more annoying. Between conclave and the proposed black death dlc the developers are severely limiting game play by injecting annoying, illogical and unrealistic events into the game. People already plotted to rebel and acquire power for themselves but conclave made it easier for them. There were already illnesses that caused quite a bit of devastation in the game so the new DLC is proposed to maximize that already annoying situation. What fun is that going to be?? Well let me tell you it will be about as fun as micromanaging all your vassals is in Conclave. Basically none. The UI and real time mode of game play severely limit micromanagement oppurtunities.I am very unhappy with the direction crusader kings 2 is going with the dlc's and I will no longer be purchasing them. But even that doesn't stop the new jerk developers because they patch in idiotic things like broken retreat into the game whether you like it or not. I have quite a bit of money wrapped up in this game and the jerks have made it unplayable. The developers are so arrogant and foolish they don't even make their stupid new rules optional. This is what happens when you don't allow negative feedback on your forums and fill it with bootlicking yes men. They pretty much ban anybody who makes the slightest criticisms of their games on their forums. Don't believe me go and see. Screw you paradox. No more money for you.			",52,11,0,34,29,0,32

												This game together with Europa Universalis 4 has completely ruined almost all other strategy games for me. I used to enjoy Civ 5 and I used to enjoy Total War. However since learning to play EU4/CK2, all I can think of while playing other strategy games is ""Why isn't this game as good as the♥♥♥♥♥♥Paradox makes?"". The gameplay is so deep and so enjoying with Grand Strategy Games like CK2 that I almost regret picking it up. I sometimes wish I hadn't open Paradox's box of terrors and maybe I could've lived in ignorance and enjoyed Rome 2, Civ and Beyond Earth. But sadly, I did.Beware:Buying this game may ruin all other games in the strategy genre for you.Ignorance is bliss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Playing virtually any dynasty in this game, big or small, feels like trying to balance on top of a ball on top of another ball. Just when you hit that sweetspot your leader dies, and you fall and have like 30 seconds to have the new guy get up there and figure out how to not lose his balance or else it's game over; or atleast a gut-wrentching downsize.If you bought the game and can't figure it out, play a small dynasty several times through. I've always been interested in Italian history so I played several games as the Duke of Ferrara starting in the late medieval era (1337ad) who controls only two counties. Starting in 1337ad makes it so your technology, baronies, temples and cities are universally well developed, meaning you can concentrate on learning the rules of medieval rulership and how they apply to the game and acheiving your goals for the playthrough. For your own game, try playing as a few different powerful leaders and then as a few weak ones so that you see the difference in player control over your realm.I've now gone back to 867ad Italy, with the Duke of Tuscany, Adelberto Bonifazi. The king of Italy, a foreign invader from the Karling Dynasty of France is leige to the 5 major Italian duchies, and is moderately respected within Italy. Europe is divided from west to east by three different Karling Kings, and the throne of Italy is up for grabs within their house. It makes for fantastic storytelling of italian unification, or fragmentation (which is more consistant with the history books). Find any dynasty that tugs at your fairytale strings and you'll create the adventure yourself. You compile your own ruleset for winning, and you'll play again and again to get it 'just right'. You are allowed to pick and choose from a wonderful list of histrorical characters from the 760's through the 1300's (more with DLC). You might even find yourself on wikipedia learning about how europe, northern africa and western asia used to work. Once you are briefly educated on succession laws, title claimancy, and holy war you'll be well on your way to taking Rome for the Byzantine empire and converting all Christians to Orthodox and thus resolving the great schism, or perhaps you'll begin as a small vassal, in control of a single county and have your progeny expand and reclaim The Holy Roman Empire. Or maybe you'll just want to keep a small duchy in Italy safe from foreign invasion generation after generation and keep your family safe at all costs. It is at its core a sandbox game. You create the goals, you amend them, the world changes drastically, your position changes, there's an opening, the window closes, alliances are broken, new friends arrive at court to save the day, and eventually you forget what the original goal of winning was to begin with. You watch and contribute to the story as generations of genetic triumphs and failures are constantly bickering, warring, dieing, plotting, changing sides for no good reason, and are also generally trying to make sure you don't have a larger army than they do. Don't forget about all the neighbors, who are convinced that they would be better suited to rule in your lands than you are.There are a thousand pitfalls to success in CK2 as there surely were in the more noble times, so always learn from your mistakes and try again. Use google. And always have enough gold to hire an appropriately sized mercenary army and pay them for 12 months. Always. Eight hour playthroughs that fall because of premature spending will remind you of that. Keep your neighbor rulers in the character watch list, keep a constant eye on beneficial marriages, and constantly scan the character find sheet for potential courtiers that would join your court and could serve as councilmembers. Remember that the safety of the family is top priority, so always be able to defend yourself, be it through your own army, your vassals or your alliance's, but never have a substantially smaller force than the neighbors or vassals. That will spell game over. And lastly, please try to remember at all times that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.			",89,19,2,14,54,0,23

												I will not talk about how Crusader King II compares to other strategy games on the market because it wouldn't be fair to them. You do not compare a Picasso with children drawings from school. Students have to do quick flashy drawings for good grades, and do them as often as they can, with accent on flashy rather than on detail. Crusader Kings II is a game that puts the accent more on detail, quality rather than quantity.The game itelf may feel a bit hard to understand at first, but if you give it a moment of your time, it will surprise you. But buyer be warn, if you just wanna play a game where you plug in, then all you do is fancy easy war TW style, or EUIV, then better avoid CK2. Crusader Kings II requires the player to think, quite a bit actually, and consider choices and plan ahead, sometimes for a few decades. It is a real strategy game, and as such it is a gem, since I do not think there is another game on the market that challenges you truly at this level and in such a complex way.Why is it challenging? Well for one, you need to plan your dynasty, you need to plan your marriages to seek advantages and gains, secure the blood line, be wary of who will you end up playing next, and after that, manage your vassals, manage alliances which can only be made through marriage, manage your holdings so you can have more income and troops, manage your realm to pick laws which will either upset or make your vassals happy, or play nice to your liege if you are not independent, watch over your armies when you raise them, pick terrain carefully as it matters quite a bit, be carefull who you put in charge of your armies, watch over you flanks, be carefull what troops you use when, since the holding they come from gives them bonuses, plan your technological advancements, mind religion, convert, play the cardinal game, expand, go on crusades, plot to murder your enemies, to revoke titles, fabricate claims, and so much more.You think that list is big? Its small, even more so, get a mod from the Paradox Forums, and you can get 2-3 times more features, some mods even take you to other worlds, use maps from settings you know and love and add a ton of events and new features. The ammount of depth this game and its modding community offer is mind boggling. Crusader Kings 2 is the Skyrim of Strategy Games. Its got depth, its got versatility, its got deep modability, its a gem.And trust me, nothing compares to the feel you get, when after starting as a Count, you end up an Emperor for the first time...UPDATE: 2 years and a lot of DLCs later... This game is killing my free time still. To date the most addictive game in my life. I've never spent so much time over so many years on the same game...			",148,34,0,99,68,0,98

												This game has so many different narratives it's amazing, it's essentially a book where you're the author yet you're also the reader. What follows is a pretty epic series of events, I'm not the greatest writer but I love this story.Through much  political intrigue and disease alike, Queen Cumman of Eire (Ireland) sat on the throne. She had four children.Her eldest daughter, Muirne, married a king of Scotland who shortly after died in battle against the English. The king's brother inherited the throne and offered his hand in marriage to Muirne. Her Ambition made the choice for her. Five children later, she died in childbirth at 32. Her youngest daughter, Tuathflaith, was born Ugly and through her upbringing, became Deceitful and Gluttonous. No man desired her and so she resides in her mother's court. Through her many pleas to be married to have a family, Queen Cumman is considering one of her many courtiers for an arranged marriage. Her eldest son, Cathal, the twin of Muirne, was taught as a child by Tressach, the Marshal of Eire, a Brawny man who none could equal in tournaments. He grew up to replace his mentor as Eire's Marshal but not for long. The Queen named him as the Duke of Ulaidh, a territory of four provinces including the county of Ulaidh. Her youngest son, Aedgen, wasn't taught in hand to hand combat yet excelled his siblin on the battlefield as a  Brilliant Strategist. Through his desire for land, the Queen entitled him to the county of Ulaidh, essentially the capital of the duchy of Ulaidh. Cathal had declared independence from his mother to create the Kingdom of Ulaidh, to the Queen's surprise. Although not on his own terms, Aedgen joined him. However their relationship with their mother did not change such was their loving relationships. Years passed and King Cathal became consumed by his power. He was now known as Cathal the Tyrant. Having enough and seeking reformation, Prince Aedgen had declared a revolution against his brother. The timing was perfect as Cathal's troops were abroad in Wales attempting to expand his territory. However he had not anticipated Cathal sending a crow to the Queen of Eire who came to stop the rebellion. She had turned a blind eye to Cathal's method of reign, he was her eldest son and heir after all. Although the Queen was old she was a warrior at heart and so met Aedgen on the battlefield.  The rebellion was destroyed in an instant.King Cathal had thrown his brother in the dungeon for a few years despite his mother's pleas to release him. Eventually Cathal had offered to ransom Aedgen for 46 gold to his mother. A ransom for his brother to his own mother. She accepted immediately although not as fast as she realized King Cathal wasn't the same Cathal she had raised. Previouslly unbenknownst to her, she discovered that he had even renounced the Lord, following instead the cult of Waldensian who were heretics of the Church. Queen Cumman made a heavy decision that very same day. She declared war in the name of not only Christianity or her Kingdom, but for her own family. She had petitioned the King of Scotland (the same one, who had now married one of the Queen's kinswomen) for aid to which they accepted without question. Cathal the Tyrant's men were raised. The Queen ordered only her own men to gather, leaving her vassal's men to defend their territories. The Scottish were rallying but it would take them months to arrive. King Cathal the Tyrant marched from their capital, leading 4300 men, half of which were heavy infantry. He was accompanied by a Waldensian priest. The Queen's men of 4458 also marched. Queen Cumman decied there was only one man who, in every right, should lead her army. Prince Aedgen. Her faithful commanders, Mugron and Tressach (the very same man who mentored Cathal), secured his flanks. The two armies met on the plains in Bréifne. This clash would decide the dynasty of Eire. The battle of Ceann Lios was about to begin.SO this story is unfinished because I just had to write about this in a review. I've literally paused the same just as they're about to fight and I'm about to resolve it xD I was controlling the Queen in all of this but everything else occurred because of the game, nothing is scripted and that's what makes the game so amazing. It's a great strategy. At the time of writing, I've logged 39 hours and I bought this game four days ago D:TLDR : If you like grandy strategy and diplomacy, this game is really for you. You don't get to control anything within a battle when it commences (well you can retreat) but watching the events in the battle screen is equally as thrilling as fights in Total War.

												I never played this game before. I bought it on a sale with a hole bunch of what looked like a millian DLCs and had it sitting in my library for quite some time. At some point I decided to pick it up and give it a try. Since I like playing the underdogs I decided I'd try to create a Buddhist World Empire. So I picked some random Buddhist dude on the top right corner of the map, designed a nice flag for him, browsed briefly thru the hair styles and gave him some nice sounding name. And there I was, a new Buddhist Lord in the year of 769. Boy was i confused. So damn much was going on and I didn't understand half of it. I soon found out that I had picked a guy who was the vassal of some other Buddhist lord. It took me about 30 years, but within my first character I was able to marry my lords daughter. My first character did nothing more then that, he just waited until he finally died so his son could take over. After that it was a ever so slowly progression. The more I learned how to play, the better it was. Slowly and steady I extended my new Buddhist Empire, taking over county by county, then losing half of them again to my brother the moment a transition from one leader to his son happened. Rinse and repeat. The bigger I grew, the more I understood the importance of keeping my vassals happy. I tried to adopt. A few times I had to reload because my empire had been torn apart by revolution. It took me about 200 years, until 800 something, until I felt ready to extend to the north. So I slowly took over the Tengri region above me. This worked out fine. I spend some time mixing up the bloodlines, dealing with revolts and stuff, until I finally had something of an stable empire. Now the only way to grow was to the west, into the Arabian empires. I had to reload some times and figure out the best time and approach. I seeded revolutions over there and struck just when they where hit hard by multiple regions braking into independence. This went on for a couple of years, slowly extending county for country into Muslim area. Each time I had conquered a country I did my best to convince the leader to convert to Buddhism, eventually, and very forcefully, spreading the word of the Buddha to the west. By this time I felt pretty confident that I could extend all the way to the Indian regions, where some bits and peaces of Buddhism where still existing. My dream of a big Buddhist World Empire was closer then ever. Boy was I wrong. In the year 1220 a huge army of Mongolian forces arrived and stood all of the sudden right in the power center of my empire. I was, at that time, able to round up a total of almost 11.000 men, a number I had seen increasing over the past 100 years and was incredibly proud of. The Mongols landed with something around between 50.000 and 70.000 men. I gave up fighting withing the first year. I was thrown into prison and most of my direct holdings where taken from me. My Buddhist Empire that I had been so fond of was forcefully integrated into the much larger Mongolian Empire. After some years I was demanded to change my religion to Hindu, which I did with great reluctance. Struggling to survive I tried to marry myself or one of my hires into the Mongolian Empire, but since they where Hindus alone the “Not the same caste” message killed me of. Nether the less I managed to keep my bloodline alive and seed some of them into the Mongolian Empire. I took some of my titles back and could at the very least keep my little Buddhist Kingdom, even thou the Tengri Part was lost for good, since the Khagan himself had inherited that title . I did some attempts of murder, but had no backers and mostly just ended up begin “politely” asked to drop it. I even tried to reclaim the title by force, when I saw a huge stack of 80.000 armies pass thou my land and into India, figuring I might have the time to win this war before they could reach me. I was wrong. So I ended the game as I had started it: a pitiful, meaningless nobody in some little remote state, that had given up his believe and lost every bit of his power to a greater leader.I bow before you, game. I enjoyed every single hour of this almost 60 hour game. I regret nothing. Next time I have so much more I know, I might even not fail as bad. Or even more – who knows. Next I' ll try to conquer the world with some Afrikan Empire...			",76,16,0,18,16,0,16

												Actually, this is not a grand strategy game, but rather an RPG.When you are about eighty, when your face represents a bloody scar from cancer, when all your kids and your dear husband have deceased in the war or of sickness, even your only friend with whom you were used to play chess has passed away, and when nobody believes that you are able to last another year, but quite the contrary, they begin to reach out their paws for your titles and your collection of pictures, which you have been gathering your whole life –all of a sudden you start writing poetry, retire more and more often to your chamber lost in prayers and reading the Bible, that remained from your father to whom you owe literally everything, and then you catch your second wind, go to victorious war against nearby empire and conquer its capital, undertake a succession law reform on a surge of popular jubilation and become a true leader of the boiling, transforming society;and once during the night walk in the distant abandoned corners of your garden you face a cheeky kitten going to become your new and last friend.

												This is by far the most accessible of the Grand Strategy Games that Paradox has made. A wonderfully convoluted game, where you define your goals and the means to achieve them. Be warned, you learn this game by playing it, gradually blooming into one of the most magnificent machiavellian meanies (darn you, profanity filter) the world has ever seen. Rewrite history as you see fit, Scheme and plot, command armies and then laugh at your demise at the hands of your subjects, your enemies, your supposed friends, your children and the wonderfully cruel winds of change and chance.But be warned, this game does not provide you with a goal aside from survival of your dynasty. Do you wish to unite Ireland and then subjugate the heathens that currently hold Jerusalem? How about bringing forth the downfall of the Holy Roman Empire as just a lowly Count of France? Or maybe you really just want to make that one guy pay who plotted the death of your insane, crippled and infirm Court Jester? Do what you want and suffer the consequences.All in all, this game is ripe with dark humour and seems to be easy at first. But it deceives you, sucking you in and suddenly gripping you by the balls, as you die from consumption, your son gets killed in a crusade and your remaining heir turns out to be gay, possessed and a complete lackwit, all while your allies drag you into wars and your vassals rise up in arms against you.So, laugh at the cruel twists of fate, or grow mad from the revelation. Or maybe just enjoy a quiet, uneventful life as a lowly vassal to better lords.			",262,74,4,52,56,6,97

												Good stuff, maybe even the best work of Paradox...But sometimes really unfair (in ironman) e.g.:- started as the count of Nassau- asked the pope for a claim of the duchy of francia - managed to become the duke of francia. - PROBLEM: the family of the former duke had still their counties and were in the position of heritage.- imprisoned and killed all of them, children, women and men.- became a tyrann- Due to feudal election east francia seperated from its former kingdom of west francia.- weak king always lost wars against his neighbors and my own duchy was in high danger- I was way stronger than my king and declared war for the crown- after a few fights the stand of war was 99% - won the last battle- BUT my duke got improisoned=> lost the war imediatly- king took almost all of my counties back- regent refused to buy me out of prison - died imprisoned- the last few counties were split up- lost it, took my mouse threw it at the wall- girlfriend said I was insane - I explained myself to her - she left...10/10 would rebel again ",32,1,0,8,5,0,7

												* Started as a random count in Ireland in the 8th century. * By 800 I had become King of Ireland. * By 1000 I had established the Empire of Britain. * By 1100 I had conquered all of France. * By 1150 I had taken control of all of Italy and crowned myself Holy Roman Emperor. * By 1160, I had launched a war on the Byzantine Empire, won, installed a Catholic on the Byzantine throne and by 1190 the Orthodox Church had been completely eradicated.* By 1200 I had inherited the Byzantine Empire after marrying its Empress, and promptly established myself as the true Roman Emperor. * By the game's end, the Irish Roman Empire controls the entirety of Western Europe and North Africa all the way up to Lithuania, Somalia and Persia, has entirely reversed the Arab conquests and seized control of Mecca and Medina (confining the Muslims to Eastern Arabia and Pakistan), and has even established several trade posts in India, effectively beginning the colonial period several hundred years early. Technology is incredibly advanced, heresies are spreading like wildfire and nobody really seems to care, so effectively the Enlightenment has begun several hundred years early as well. To top it all off, Iceland, the British Isles, most of France, most of North Africa and most of Hungary are now fully Irish.This is just one of the things you can do in this game. Just one.Do I recommend?YES.(Lag gets a bit bad in the late game, apparently because all the Greek characters are using up processing power trying to figure out who they can castrate out of all the characters in the game. Yes, you read that right - the game runs slow because the Greeks are trying to castrate the entire world. Other than that simultaneously annoying and hilarious problem, the game is great!)

												I had a Slavic count take my daughter once. To retaliate, I took his wife and two 15 year old daughters. After his daughters ripened, I made them and his wife my concubines. In a fit of rage, I then took over all of Scandinavia. After living to the ripe old age of 101, my character died in battle. Playing as his grand-nephew due to elective, I imprisoned the daughters, wife, and the children my former character had sired on them. After waiting another 7 years, I took the children of the concubines as MY concubines. I eventually had my bloodline ruined due to incest.10/10 would concubine again.			",16,1,0,7,4,0,1

												Strangely addictive game.  I had this in my library for a while and never figured out how to really play it until I found a community beginner's guide.  After that, I haven't put it down.Its challenging, fun, but not at all a game you can really get through in an evening.

												I went from a Count to a Duke, got married, had childeren, even managed to marry off my daughter to the 3rd in line to the throne and let her keep her name.Then civil war broke out over the crown between the king and his eldest son, I fought for the king and beat back the forces on all fronts except one ( The king and his army were there, so i assumed they would take care of things )But tragically the king died in battle, which left his heir and recent enemy of the crown to become rightful ruler over the lords and lands in the kingdom, concluding the war and putting me in the bad books for taking his farthers side.I decided to rebel, in hopes of being able to give my son in law and now 2nd in line to the throne the crown.The war waged on for many many years and took it's toll on everyone involved.The kingdom was split in half, the West fighting to rid the evil tyrant and the East fighting back with every thing the crown had, but it was not enough, the king's forces were pushed all the way back to the capitol.I was quick to gather more troops from the few of my vassals that were able to help.These were tough times on the kingdom, after so many years of war the kingdom's financial state was in tatters, the lords  were struggling to keep their provinces under controll while fighting off the mass hordes of troops invading their lands.But i knew the moment we had fought so hard for was close at hand.I launched a seige on the capitol with the few hundred troops i had left, the seige lasted over half a year before my forces managed to break through and begin the assault on the castle.It was a bloodshed, an absolute massacre, the king and all his men and been defeated but not before i had lost over 3/4 of my army in the attack.But the war was over, the new King had taken the throne and peace had come to the land.After all the years the kingdom spent in turmoil, only a couple of faces were familiar from the begining.most of these lords are the sons and descendants of those that rode with me against the prince before he became king.Many of their fathers fell in the war but they continued the fight for them.As the years pass following the over throwing of the old king, The lords and houses fight and conspire against one another but nothing major happens within the realm until the king, my son in law and father of my grandson, becomes ill.Shortly after he passes from his illness, many of the lords start to question my grandsons right to rule.A few small rebellions start over in the far east end of the kingdom.My son, heir to my lands and house, rides east to meet the rebels in battle.he defeats three of the rebellions before lossing the battle and his life at the fourth.With only my grandson to carry on the family name, i try my best to gather enough troops to march over the rebels and stop them from usurping the throne.All my effort is wasted tho as the young king mysteriously dies from causes unknown.I spend last years of my life fighting against the kings that come and go, only to fall victim to a event that causes me to be a paraplegic and die alone and incapable of doing anything.10/10 would feel like it was all for nothing again			",7,2,0,3,6,0,11

												One of the best games I've ever played. It looks like a historical strategy game: a large real-world map to play on, countries to control, lands to conquer, etc. But don't be fooled. It is actually a “life simulation game"". You have a country (or part of it), but what you really play is a dynasty, or family. You rule, you fight, you want to see the death of your regent, you kill, you murder, you have parties, you make friends, you meditate, you do business, you love your wife, or make wild loves with your lovers, you have enemies, you are supported by your vessels, you travel around the world, you educate your children, you become the king, you are defeated on the battlefield, you lose your titles, you are nobody again, you are old, you die, you leave nothing but chaos to your sons. You go over the rises and falls of the family, interact with everyone around, and play your particular part in everyone's own story. There are tens of thousands characters in the virtually living world, everyone with his or her own life being written. Sadly you can never have sufficient energy to learn every unique story! This is one of the best games I've ever played, definitely top 5. It depicts every shining and awkward, elegant and wretched moment of a normal medieval noble guy. 12/10Those who give only 11/10, you guys are so mean.			",266,85,9,40,48,3,69

												Endless replayability. CKII may take a while to get into, but once you learn about most, if not all game features, you'll find countless things you can do or try to achieve. Story unfolds itself, because while there is no narrative or script, your actions and actions of others really change the world and characters around your dynasty. Vast personal traits and characteristics that every single one character in game can have make up the story, as their actions are mostly defined by the personalities they have.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite simply one of the greatest strategy games ever made.From the outset - Crusader Kings is not for everyone. It will be best enjoyed by people who are interested in deep systems and the interplay between them. Those seeking a way to crack the ""optimal"" way to play, and those seeking to ""win"" will be disappointed, whereas those seeking emergent systems and effects will enjoy hundreds of hours of discovery. It is therein that lies CK2's greatest strength - creating a narrative through emergent systems.Crusader Kings II relies largely on the player setting their own goals and then working towards them. Be they immediate goals, medium term aspirations, or long term dreams, a large part of CK2's appeal lies in pondering how best to ""exploit the code"" to reach your ends. In fact, the best way to play CK2 is not to play to win, but to let the game ""happen""; to let your dynasty's fortune ebb and flow with the passage of time, creating a narrative of a family streching across the centuries. Crusader Kings 2 is a game that you can sink literally hundreds of hours into and still find out new and exciting things to do. CK2 isn't a perfect game; the learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre, and the presentation is a little short of the cutting edge. But, with a fantastic level of developer support, continual free and paid content additions, hundreds of mods, and a lively, friendly and supportive community, it is fair to say that CK2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time and, for strategy fans, possibly one of the greatest games of all time. For this writer with over 30 years of gaming behind him and hundreds of hours on the game (mostly on the Gamersgate version), it's certainly cracked the Top Ten!			",350,86,14,77,91,5,91

												Below are two versions of my review...  Angry Rant	 I'm tired of all these DLCs and their inflated prices. The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Ruler designer! Also you dirty portrait, unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously Horse Lord's cost is 37.5% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just paid unlocks, not anything ""expansive"". Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For Horse Lords, that's roughly 5 dollars, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a bare bones version of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for CK2 because oh well, right?  Slightly More Rational Rant I'd prefer that more game developers learn from CD Projekt. Witcher 3, as an example, has become incredibly successful and it doesn't require a smattering of DLC to be enjoyable. I have no problem with additional content coming out after the base game's release, but it shouldn't take away the enjoyment from the base game. At some point just make a new game and quit selling us content piece by piece. Ck2 is an incredible game, but suffers from the DLC making the base game unappealing by itself. I didn't want to buy this game for the longest time because of the now classic DLC approach. I can understand that, after 4+ Years, having at most 6 expansions costing $5 to $10 could be reasonable especially if the base game was more fleshed out to start. However, the existing cluster pile of DLC acts as a major turn off for players. It creates the feeling of having to pay for the basic structure of the game and to flesh it out. At this point, we're not judging whether Paradox will make a good game, but how much it will cost us to enjoy every bit of it. I honestly enjoy Paradox games and I hope to enjoy more in the future. Just as usual if you purchase any of their games remember to be patient, wait for sales and slowly navigate the DLC barrier without letting it kill your wallet.UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their community streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanisions then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.			",11,0,0,2,5,0,10

What is Crusader Kings 2?Explaining what Crusader Kings 2 is is difficult. There are 9 ""Major"" DLC""s for this game, which add as much content as the base game, and drastically opens the game. So what Crusader Kings 2 is, greatly depends on which DLC""s you get. What this game is though at its core, is a real time strategy game set in the medieval era's, the base game is from 1066 to 1453. The DLC's The Old Gods and Charlemagne allow for a start date of 867 and 769, respectively, allowing for over 700 years of game-play through the early dark ages, all the way to the beginning of the Rennaissance period. You can start playing as a Duke of a few provinces, under a King. A King, or an Emperor. Through this time, you will be restricted by realistic ""rules and laws"" which governed the world at that time as you balance your lands among your vassals, and family. Keeping the Feudal system together, your people happy, and making sure vassals don't revolt, is much tougher than you'd think. You could start off as a King with 40 Vassals, 70 counties, and countless castles in your control, and in 200 years, find yourself owning nothing more than a half disseveled castle in a province nobody cares about, having lost your seat on the throne, to an usurping vassal who got the better of you. Or you could find yourself in the same situation in reverse, having bested your King on the field of battle, and taking the throne for your own. Holy Wars, cultural differences. Supporting, and or working against your King, or Emperor, vassalizing near by independent rulers, and sometimes, even attempting assassinations against your own family, are all things which you may need to do, to keep your next of heir securely in line for the throne, and your current holdings and estates safely in the family. The game revolves, not around the country, but your family. In Medieval ages, your family ""house"" is whats important. As your current ruler dies, you will take direct control of the next of heir of your house, and they will gain the titles which the laws of your country allow depending on succession laws. The politics are setup pretty realistically to how it was in those days as well. Marrying off a daughter is what made alliances, nothing else. (Not 100% accurate, but damn close enough to be considered ""historical""). Succession laws of how your children are allowed to take the throne, greatly impacts your future as well. All in all if you love Medieval history, and want to learn more about how it worked, this game will teach you things you never knew. If you own Europa Universalis IV, there is a converter which you can get for Crusader Kings 2, Allowing you to convert the world exactly as it is from Crusader Kings 2, into Europa Universalis IV, allowing you to continue your reign of your Kingdom, as you move from the Medieval ages, into the age of Rennaissance and exploration.  There is no game that has better replayability than Crusader Kings 2. I have played nearly 400 different games, and have over 1000 hours in this game. (Before I got it on steam), and not a single one of my games has been remotely close to playing out like any other. -------------------The DLC'sI know there are some upheavels about the amount of DLC's, and some people screaming bloody murder and cash grab insults. I have to beg to differ, and I'd like to explain why if you're one of those people who have been hearing this. This game was released in Feb, 14th of 2012. That's 4 years as of this year in 2016. In those 4 years, Paradox has released 9 ""Major"" DLC's, which open the game up tremendously, and add in depth mechanics, new events, and great game changes, all of which are superb. (You can tell if it's a ""Major"" DLC if the price is over 1.99) These DLC's are not ""DLC's"", they are the equievalant of legit expansions from back in the day, when a developer would release an expansion to a game you had to pay for, which adds just as much as the base game originally had. The Old Gods for instance, allows you to play as the Pagans. All with their own 100's of new events for both pagan and non pagan leaders, new mechanics for the pagans, and opens the game up tremendously in that area, as well as pushing the start date back another 200 years. The Republic expansoin does, well what you think. Allows you to play as a Merchant Republic, such as Venice, AND allows any leader to setup a Merchant Republic within their own country, which greatly increases gold income. Playing as a Merchant Republic is vastly different than playing as a feudal lord, and is yet again another major expansion, adding 100's of new events, entirely new different type of game-play to play around if you're playing as a Merchant Republic, etc. The list goes on for every single one of those 9 ""Major"" DLC's. None of which are a rip off in anyway for the price because of how much each add to the game as a whole.  So what about those countless 1.99 stuff? This is where I can understand if people say ""cash grab"", however I personally would still disagree to some extent simply because being an Indie developer myself, I understand the work that does need to be put in to make it viable. Albeit it still isn't much work over all. The 1.99 little DLC's which change sprites on the map, or allow for more family house crest art to personally change, etc. its over all cheap, and it's entirely up to you to buy it or not. They however in no way take away from the game by not having them, and are all cosmetic. The ones I personal like are the ones which change the look of the people and their outfits, etc. to fit the time and appearance they'd of had for that culture and area in the world a bit more than the stock game. These are all very cheap however, 1.99 to about 3.99, depending on how much it adds, but all of which are about 10x cheaper than going to the movies, which only nets you 1 hour of annoyance while you try to enjoy it, and people decide now is a good time to be loud and annoying.. I'd rather pay the 7 small DLC's for the same price and fully enjoy it for the rest of my life... Step aside movies..			",139,29,0,66,46,0,65

												Iam sorry Paradox, but i have to write this now. I realy like Crusader Kings II, as i played nearly 300 Hours and many more on a non-steam Version. You can have fun with these games, spend hour after hour with it. I will not say the game is bad or not worth a bit of money...but there is a big argument against this game, or i would say against the DLC-Policy of Paradox. It is just insane how this is managed. Just take a look at the numbers...Steam tells me all DLC cost more than 270€ now. Okay lets say half of that is stuff you dont need, content packs etc...still 135€ plus the game for 40€. Iam no new player and played from the first years on and bought everything when it came out. But do you even know how stupid it is if you have friends just starting the game and telling them which DLC they need and stuff? They release a new DLC every few months with a few new things. Often they are good and iam very exited. But the are not everytime worth all the money. And they must be making alot of money thinking about the price. And i know...they say we put out new DLC to get some money to further develop the game and the game will get new content as long as the people buy the DLCs. Okay, that may sound good at first. But how do other game studios manage their stuff? Do they need to get out new DLC every few months for 15-25€(DLC+Contentpack)? NO. And that is almost the price of the whole game. And a DLC might bring some new stuff but not half of the game. So it is just too expensive.But it does not stop there. Iam a real Paradox-Freak you could say. I play almost all their big titles, Victoria, Europa Universalis, Stellaris, City Skylines, Hearts of Iron...you name it, i played hundreds of hours. And almost everywhere it is the same b*llsh*t!!! I want to play some Crusader Kings? Have to buy 2-3 DLCs to be on the newest Version. Stellaris the same. HoI4 the same. Skylines the same. What is that? I was so hyped about Stellaris. And the game was only half done, felt hollow and now they probably want to go the EU4 way and fix it over the years with tons of DLC. I just cant stand it anymore. After these many years iam frustrated and angry. I dont want to support this any longer. And what i hate the most about it, that maybe in a few months, i have some money, theres a sale and i will buys this freakin DLC anyway. BUT I HATE THEIR POLICY! AND I STILL WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF! THEY GOT ME AND THEY USE ME! Combining all their game i probably payed them over 1000€ already. *Put a bad word here*!But they could do it differently. Why not bring out REAL DLC or a decent Add-On. Or Victoria 3. Where the hell is Victoria 3? Victoria was the best game they made in my opinion. But whatever. Someday Paradox will see that their way is the wrong way. Many people i know think the same. They are ruining these great games.tl;dr:If you are looking for an advice...the game is fun and you will probably like it. But Paradox has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Policy. After a few years you will hate them, just like me. (I wrote almost the same Review for other Paradox Games. Everywhere the same Thing)			",579,172,29,80,61,2,106

												Do you enjoy unintentionally (or intentionally...?) marrying your younger siblings to your elderly parents, or conspiring to murder every member of your family, in order to work your way onto the throne? No? Well good, as that probably means you're perfectly sane.However, if you enjoy hilarious occurrences such as this in video games, (especially when they're entirely unplanned!) as well as plenty of random events to help mix things up, I have no doubt that you'll enjoy Crusader Kings II; as CK2 is essentially a peek into the lives of medieval murderers, sex-fiends, club-footed harelip Dukes, as well as many more different combinations of humorously incapable royals inbreeding their way to glory!UPDATE: After a whole string of expansions came out since originally writing this review in Feb 2012, I've decided to re-write it and have added in the list below, containing some of the more essential expansions, as not all are necessarily required:LEGACY OF ROME - This pack adds retinues and factions. As I recall it originally got a bad rap as it didn't unlock additional regions of the map to the player (like Sword of Islam, for example), but these days it really is a staple expansion, and adds a lot to the game.THE OLD GODS - Vikings! And an early start date. Honestly, I feel that the Norse add enough that this is worth putting on the 'essentials' list, as it does shake things up a bit, from the standard 'European feudal lord' formula. Might want to get this after playing a game or two of CK2 though, as a regular feudal lord, perhaps.WAY OF LIFE - I might get flak from some people by putting this into the 'essential' list, but it adds a lot more to do, during peace time. Plus Paradox has fixed the Europe-wide orgy caused by the 'seduction' focus being super-powerful, so it's not as crazy as it was right after its initial release. (For better or for worse! :P )And now for a ""good to have, but maybe don't get it until you've played the game a few times"" list. (Rolls right off the tongue, eh?)SONS OF ABRAHAM - Adds more options, events, etc. for the three Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Judaism and Islam). Solid expansion, but not strictly required. Good for a second playthrough, or if it's on-sale when you first buy/play the game.CONCLAVE - Kind of goes hand-in-hand with WoL above, I feel. Adds more to do (particularly during peacetime) as you're not the sole power within your realm, as your council will try and gradually curb your power and become a force to be reckoned with - so don't underestimate your councilors! Definitely adds a fair bit more difficulty though, as this expansion can result in a lot more civil wars occurring, if you aren't adept at ingame diplomacy and gaining favours, etc. so you may want to save this for your second playthrough.SWORD OF ISLAM - Makes Muslim rulers playable, and adds in decadence mechanics for them. Good for a second or third playthrough, after you have your fill of playing as a Christian.THE REPUBLIC - Same as SoI above, except it makes Republics playable. Adds in trading post mechanics (among others) for more money-making opportunities.REAPER'S DUE - This pack expands upon the existing disease mechanics, and makes the Black Death a very real threat! It also allows you to hire a court physician, who will then proceed to cut your leg off and/or gouge your eye out, in order to cure your cold. Fun expansion, but not essential.CHARLEMAGNE - This adds in a start date even earlier than TOG's start. Good if you want extremely long games that wind up taking a heavily alt-history route, but be aware that Europe will most likely be occupied by 4-5 huge blobs by 1066, so it might become a bit of a slog, late-game.RAJAS OF INDIA - OK if you want to play in India, but be warned that unless you get a huge, sprawling empire going, there won't actually be much (if at all) interaction between India and the rest of the game world. Really, I think they could've just made this into a separate game mode/campaign option.			",231,38,10,53,38,2,64

												Since this is the game I played the most on Steam, I figured it was about time I reviewed it. Now, I don't approve Paradox DLC policy but I played my entire first game of about 90 hours as the empire of Britannia (All Hail Brittannia) without any DLC and the game was still very fun to play. So if the price of all the DLC scares you, give it a try without any DLC and, even once you decide to buy DLC, just get the one that you actually want. For example, I never even use the game music, I always just mute it and play my own playlist so I obviously won't ever get any of the songs DLC. That being said, even if the DLC do not scare you, this game is for hardcore strategy games fans. The first 5 hours of the game will be mostly you figuring everything out and theres really not much tutorials to help you out.If you can get past all that though, this is the most fun and deep strategy game I have ever played. There is almost nothing you can't do in this game. Wanna make your loyal little brother an anti-pope since the pope excommuniated you because the french king (who happens to be his best friend) really hate you? And then later go to war with that pope and make your little brother the official pope for every catholics. You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Wanna make your last born son your heir even though he has 6 older brothers because he has by far the best stats since he was born a genius. And then have to imprison all your other sons when they inevitably plot to murder him? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Want to make Buddhist the official religion of everyone in Europe through war and oppression? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. History is yours to write however you want. Thats why I love this game.The game is also full of random events that always keep the game interesting. Hell, after almost 400 hours, I'm still running into random events that I hadn't seen before (it helps that Paradox sometimes add new ones.) So yeah, despite its flaws, this is my favorite game on Steam and I have no doubt that I will probably play another 400 hours of it eventually.Oh and by the way, when you start a new game, turn off shattered retreat and defensive pacts cause those really sucks and break the immersion. That patch was the worst idea Paradox ever had.			",55,9,0,16,8,0,11

												Let's set things straight: this is one of the best Paradox game and probably my favourite one since it covers a period of time I like a lot and since it's less complex and tactical than other Paradox. It has got, instead, a great RPG component. An amazing mix which makes the game very addicting.Why the negative review? Because this game alone is almost nothing. It lets you play just a very small amount of countries. If you want the full game you must buy the DLCs... nothing new you could think. Well, the problem is there is a HUGE amount of DLCs and after years from the publishing of the main game they're still developing new one. They're getting always more useless, DLC after DLC, while the price gets higher (some of the last costs half the main game...LOL).As a loyal and old Paradox fan i get frustrated not only because they're obviously trying to get any cents out of my wallet, but mainly because after 4 (FOUR!) years I still can't enjoy the full game: whenever you start a new campaign (and a CK game can be pretty long and time consuming) they announce a new DLC with new features and new rules and you feel like you're playing an useless match and feel like abandoning it and wait for the new DLC. Problem is: when you get it, they have already announced a new one.Also, every DLC comes with patches which totally change the rules of the game and you have to learn them again and again and again. It's like playing an early access game, but I've always hated those and I would have avoided it if I had known.Basically they're policy with games lately has become: ""let's publish an incomplete game and let's charge a lot with DLCs if they want to play its full version"" and they're not the only company to do it, but when they finished the game they started to make useless DLCs (there's one of fantasy history in which aztecs invade Europe... which is not a great thing in a game of such historic realism) and to change the rules to worse just to justify new DLCs. They're literally to the point in which a great game is turning into a bad one.Saddest thing for a loyal customer like me was the DLC to convert CK2 games into EU4 games to continue a campaign there. So I, a huge fan who bought all of your games, get rewarded for this by being forced to pay 10 euro just for a crappy converter if I want to ""fuse"" together the Paradox games I possess? Nice policy Paradox...To give you an idea, today you need 165€ just to play the full game (without even considering the massive amount of graphic and soundtrack DLCs or the EU4 converter) and DLCs are still coming out. The game can be good but its not worth half of that price.You better wait till they start working on CK3 and stop squeezing money out of this game. Then maybe they'll lower the price of a 4 years old game (prices are still the same even for the main game) and you can buy a cheap package with all the DLCs.It's not worth a penny before that. You can trust someone who loved this and other Paradox games.			",15,1,0,7,7,0,8

												Edit: I'm about to pass over six hundred hours of playtime on this game and it's all pretty much legitimate. No other game has held my attention for as long as Crusader Kings 2 has. Years have passed and I still come back to this game simply because there is still so much more to do and Paradox Interactive has done a tremendous job in supporting the game with content post-release. Simply put, Crusader Kings 2 is my favorite game of all time, hands down.I've spent over three hundred hours on this game and I don't regret a single minute. Well, not exactly. I regret a lot of things done during my playthrough of this game but it happens after playing a dynasty for four hundred years! This is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in spending hours upon hours trying to decide whether to assassinate that dimwitted son of yours currently in line for your throne!

Take note, KOEI.Would be great if there was another discount on this and it's DLC in a few weeks, particularly the week of September 15, 2016.. 950 years after the start of the vanilla game.

												Crusader Kings II is, IMHO, Paradox's best game.  It's a grand strategy game that throws many of the popular complexities of the genre such as a complicated tech tree, deep strategic combat, and a rich economy and city building out the window for very simple implementations of each and replaces it all with one thing: interpersonal drama.  It's all about what other people have that you want and what you have that other people want, and it produces epic struggles, dramatic twists of fate, and wonderful soap opera fodder.  At the start of the game if you have a small nation, you can play it a bit like a standard 4X.  Locate a smaller neighbor with no major allies, conquer, repeat.  As your empire grows, however, you begin to need to split up your holdings among relatives and friends- a province here, a duchy there.  And then those people begin to want things, and have armies, and begin to plan among themselves.  And maybe you have too many children, and those who aren't getting enough of the land start to hate you.  And maybe your king dies and his underaged heir who fewer people like and nobody respects takes over under the care of one of your trusted vassels, who may even now be plotting regicide.  When that daughter you married off a decade ago and forgot about suddenly inheriets a third of the Holy Roman Empire due to an accident of inheritance laws and a suspiciously high mortality rate among the nobility?  The knives will begin to come out before the crown has had time to settle on her brow, and damage control doesn't even begin to cover what follows.  Play enough of this game, and familicide won't even be an interesting enough story to warrant telling your spouse about after another play session where you stayed up three hours later than you wanted it.  Crusader Kings II is big, and imposing, and takes a long time to play, but there's pretty much nothing like it out there.  It might take a dozen hours before you really get what's going on, and I suspect most people who even try it will bounce off of it without understanding why it's such a big deal.  If it bites into you, though, your time will be repaid with an endless array of amazing stories and crazy alternate histories of Europe.			",339,79,5,65,69,3,89

												While enjoying the Multiplayer feature a good friend of mine became 'The Cuckold'.His Beautiful Norwegian wife decided to take several other lovers and created illegitamate children out of these escapades which we found very amusing and refused for many months to help him get his household under control. After receiving exhorborant bribes from him we set our Spymasters to work exacting judgement on this trifling woman and her lovers. Restoring his honor and his lineage took quite a bit of resources but we managed to sort out the whole 'affair'. He was actually quite upset that she had almost destroyed him.Next game we will all secretly choose seduction focus and lure his wives, sisters and daughters into out bedchambers to♥♥♥♥♥♥him right off again.10/10 for friendship.

												Played as an Irish Catholic chief.Became King of Ireland.Got 'great pox'.Islamic physician called Sami tried 2 treatments in a row that didn't work.Sami suggested an 'experiment' treatment.I told him to go with the well tested treatments.Sami physician rubbed cow poo on me.Made me feel better.Ended up being cured of great pox.To sum it up - An Islamic physician rubbed cow sh*t on the King of Ireland to cure him of Great Pox and it actually worked.Edit: Turns out it made my King a loony.P.S - I had all DLC's installed other than Sunset Invasion and Conclave.Man, I love this game. I could never have this much fun in EU4. The characters/decisions make this game so much more immersive and fun.			",231,29,3,44,26,3,57

												Let me tell you a little story.I was a mere count in Italy, an unimportant man, living my little life, raising my son, loving my wife. But I was pretty popular among other counts and dukes and so it happened that I was elected a king of Italy. Being young and ambitious I started to build my kingdom and earn the fame and glory I knew I was destined for. My reign was glorious, no revolts, no problems, only growth and prosperity and so holding a great tournament seemed like a great idea. But I was a diplomat, not a warrior and so it happened that I got maimed. Two years later I died of a combination of my wound and common flu. My 15 years old son became the king, but the vassals didn´t like him and soon enough they asked him to hand over the crown. He wasn´t gonna give it up so easily and so the war over the kingdom of Italy began. However my son underestimated the strength of his opposition and was forced to surrender. The new king imprisoned him and refused to ransom him, because he still had a claim on the kingdom. Three years later my son died and because he had no heirs, the game was over.This little story, my friends, is the reason why I f*cking love this game.			",54,7,2,20,26,0,23

												I bought this game about 2 years ago for Christmas while it was about 35% off along with Fallout 3 and Dishonored. The trailer for CK2 made me intensely excited for it so I could live out all of my medieval fantasies to my heart's content. Upon opening the game however, I found myself seriously outmatched by the game's steep learning curve. That, coupled with the fact that I had bought two other masterpieces, made it difficult for me to rationalize spending the hours it would take for me to truly get into the game. About 2 months later after beating Fallout 3 and Dishonored, I dedicated myself to learning CK2 and to this day, I regret not doing it earlier. For anyone who wonders why it is so difficult to learn this game, the answer is very simple. It was very difficult to be a successful ruler in the medieval era. How should you know what you can and cannot do without experience? With this in mind, I encourage everyone to buy this game and sink about 20 hours into the game before making their judgements. I am certain that you will think differently about your purchase by that point and truly feel that it was worth it.			",59,17,3,12,4,0,7

												""I got this game on one of the sales, but it's too hard and doesn't make sense!!""Shut up.I'm saying that to my younger self, because I was one of those losers. Only like a week ago I actually gave this game a proper chance. I have ALOT to learn, believe me. My campaigns have been disasters, even in the easiest difficulty mode i have been failing epicly. But I've bloody enjoyed my time in this game, and take this from a guy that HATES losing in games and rage quits frequently. I demand to get better in this game, I will take every failure as a valuable lesson, because you WILL fail in the beginning. I don't write reviews much, and I certainly don't write them very well. I just wanna say that if you have the time, give this game a chance. Don't let it's difficulty and scope scare you, because I guarantee you will not find a more rewarding game than this.

												I was a bit unsure at first, but my friends talked me into buying this to play online.  I am now still playing long after they stopped.  I just can't get enough of playing this as there are so many people to play as in different time periods.  I'm not sure the latest patch has helped or hindered the experience, but the ironman mode makes it a real challenge.  Seriously if you haven't tried this game, there are so many different things to keep people interested.  It's a shame it stops at 1453 each time, but with the extra DLC starting earlier and earlier there is so much more to do.  Serious press buy! :)			",119,50,3,41,30,5,25

If you like the idea of micromanaging a dynasty and making strategic marriages...then get this game immediately.My only honest complaint is that so much of the map is unplayable unless you buy DLC.

												""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" - Lord ActonThe Medieval Age wasn't the brightest moment in human history. War, Assassination, Torture, Greed, Betrayal; those are merely some of the words associated with the atrocities committed by the rulers of the realm. Some good and honest men have ruled, but most rulers couldn't resist the temptation from the power they wield; the power to rule. They were tempted to gain more power, and they are willing to use even the most atrocious of acts to gain it.Crusader Kings II gives players a taste of that power.Starting at any point from 1066 (Or 769 with a certain DLC enabled) to 1453, players are allowed to choose from a very large amount of historical characters that once ruled over a part of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. From the lowliest duke to the highest emperor, the game has no final objective whatsoever, leaving players to create their own story and decide their own goals for their dynasty. Do you want to be the most prestigious family in the world? To work your way up and create an empire that will last for generations? Or simply to make sure your bloodline survives through all the coming conflict? Grand strategy games typically put players as an eternal invisible guiding force controlling a single country, viewing the world from above as a map as they manage the country’s Politics, Economy, Military, and Diplomacy through various factors. These games use simple visuals to accommodate the large scale gameplay. There are no fancy Total War-like massive battles or anything of sort. Almost every aspect of the game depends on numbers. In other words, the main part gameplay is to manage those numbers and the various factors affecting it to the player’s benefit.Crusader Kings II offers a sandbox grand strategy experience into a more personal level; giving players control over a single Catholic ruler (later DLCs adds the options to play as Muslim, Pagan, and Jewish rulers) and continue on as his/her heir after passing away. Instead of dealing with faceless countries, the more personal approach allows the game to have a large amount of characters, be it a lord or a simple courtier. Every character in the game has their own set of skills, traits, and relations with other characters. A major part of the game is managing the relationship between characters by various interactions. You can cement the loyalty of your vassals by keeping them happy with gifts and inviting them to feasts. You can increase the odds of success of an assassination plot by inviting treacherous people within your target's court. You can declare a war for a title your courtier has a claim on. Be wary as other characters could do it to you as well. The best option is to trust no one, not even your friends and relatives. These interactions increase the depth of Crusader King II's strategic gameplay in a very dynamic way.The trademark Paradox's grand strategy gameplay is still present, even if somewhat simplified by the time period. Politics are mostly done by the character interactions mentioned above; with the addition of a player-manageable council the players can use accomplish certain tasks. Economy is much more simplified, with very little emphasis on trade. Instead of training units to form standing armies, you form a temporary military force in time of war, then disband them when the war is over. Your military comes from raising levies both from your personally owned holdings and from your vassals. (Retinues were added with a DLC). Religion plays a major role in the game, with each religion having some unique gameplay mechanic that differ them from the rest; such as the Papacy for Catholics and Decadence for Muslims. While the strategy gameplay itself for most the most part lacks depth compared to other Paradox grand strategy titles, Crusader Kings II still stands on its own as a well-made and unique game.Crusader Kings II is visuals are simple, yet fitting for the game. The map is fully rendered in 3D, it’s nothing breathtaking, but you can still appreciate the beauty of its landscape; although you'll probably spend most of the time using the political map mode. The character portraits are a great mix of realism and cartoony art style which provides a variety of colorful characters faces.The musical score for the game is also worth praising. While not all the music in the game is memorable, they rarely distract you from the game, and for the most part they complement your playthrough with a variety of beautiful music fitting for the era.The game is without its flaws, of course. While the tutorial is an improvement from previous Paradox titles, you will still need to learn most of the game’s mechanics on your own by trial or error. While it could be a part of the fun of playing the game, some people may dislike it. I’ve encountered several minor bugs, but the game is fully playable as of now. Another minor complaint is the lack of naval combat. While historically there wasn’t a lot of naval combat at the era, I wish that navies could be more useful such as for blockading ports. But as for the time this review was written, the only use for navies is for troop transport.Describing everything about Crusader Kings II’s in detail would take a lot of time and energy. Both of which you could be using right now to purchase and experience Crusader Kings II on your own! (Or at least try the demo) Go and create your own story with your dynasty. Be patient and play as an honest, good natured ruler. Or fall to the temptation of power and spill the blood of anyone who stands in your way. The choice is yours.Deus Vult.			",27,1,2,2,2,0,4

												My favorite game of all time. 800+ Hours. They ruined it with this patch. They ruined it with Conclave. I fell into the machine, I bought almost all the DLC (unit packs and songs and content packs excluded) yet they finally broke me. To those of you who know the problems then this was a shattered retreat, a destruction to everything good. This is the greatest game of all time before 2.5. Now it is mediocre at best. They keep trying to fix the game but don't realize they are trying to fix things that were never broken. Wars, factions, CHILD EDUCATION. All broken. They add in terrible things that were never there like coalitions. I wish they stopped adding content after horselords. Unlike most I have an almost inexhaustable wallet for things I like such as this game. Most can't handle these DLC purchases which allow you to use things that should've been in it in the first place. Muslims, Pagans, Nomads, the Byzantine Empire, Republics, Indians. That's a solid chunk of the map unplayable to you unless you continue on with purchases. This was a game where you could play 800 hours easy, but now I'm sick of Paradox ""improving"" the game, and my eyes are open to the money grabbing and micro-transactions which have all but made people hate Total War: Attila. Too many good games have fallen to micro-transactions, it's rude and insulting to us the consumer. Those of you who lay down, eat Paradox's excrement and praise the taste are only encouraging this gross mismanagement of success. I hope this game is fixed, but I will not play it until my grievances are at least somewhat addressed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of writing, this $40 game has $240 of DLC available.Crusader Kings II is a great game - and I'm not using that word lightly, it's a GREAT game - but I can't recommend it.  I've put a lot of hours into this game (more than Steam has counted), but it's never been a fulfilling experience because of all the goddamed DLC.Listen, I'm no enemy to DLC, if a developer makes more content for their game, I'll pay to play it.  But the way Paradox does it is straight up insidious.""This new update adds North Africa to the game......but you can't play there unless you buy the Sword of Islam DLC""""The newest update adds all of India to the vanilla map.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Rajas of India DLC""""We just added the entire Asian continent to the game.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Horse Lords DLC""DLC in this game isn't comparable to DLC in other games, it's not like it adds a weapon skin or an extra level.  Crusader Kings II DLC fundamentally changes the core gameplay of the game, and some things that have DRASTIC changes on how you play (such as the ability to have a standing army, form custom kingdoms, or even the existence of the Jewish religion) are hidden behind 4 years and $240 of DLC.To put it simply, I have never felt like I was playing a finished game.  Every time I turn it on, there's an ad for yet another piece of DLC.  Once I finally save up enough to buy the next biggest DLC pack, another is announced.  It's just not fulfilling.Until Paradox decides to wrap this game up like they've done with Europa Universalis IV and Hearts of Iron III, and put their energy to developing Crusader Kings III instead of squeezing more DLC money out of current players, I can't recommend it.

												Crusader Kings II on first look seems like just another game styled after so many other well-known games that use an overhead map and a time period. That’s where things steer into a different direction. This game may well be the best game created by the game smiths at Paradox Development Studio. It’s a huge strategy game with layers. I would suggest running the tutorial in the game. In fact I would also suggest keeping the hints option on, it is full of valuable playing information.Taking place over a 400 year time span the players take on the persona of a character running the realms and struggling to make it in these troublesome times.Throughout the game life, the character deals with the world and other characters of the court, they have stats and traits; they marry, and have children in hopes of conceiving an heir to the throne. That is the main point too, having a legitimate heir to the kingdom. As that first main character grows older and or dies before their time, as long as there is an heir the game goes on to 1452. Hierarchy and the bloodline are of some importance in this game as it was in yee olden days.The game plays in different ways depending on how the player chooses to start. Hierarchy plays a role here. So if the player starts out as a lower rank of the upper class, say a Count, well you have some leveling to do. There is so much information to be had during game play it can be over whelming at times; thankfully Paradox Development Studio has integrated so many buttons and drop downs to assist the player in keeping track of events and information. Plus the game can be paused to take a break or assess the situation. The interface and game play seems polished enough, though the animations took some getting used to.As gaming goes in the grand strategy style, there is some replay ability here, with so much going on, try different playing styles, be aggressive, or less so. See how things turn out, be a tyrant if you like.The graphics of the lands and seas are beautiful to behold, with clouds shadow and weather passing over the lands as you look down from your almost celestial view from above. Sound is pleasing as well, with music and sound bites setting the mood for events appropriately. This is truly one of the better games to come out from Paradox Development Studio, now like most strategy games, things do not progress always at a fast pace. So some patience in gaming is involved here. Crusader Kings II is exactly the sort of game I was hoping it would be. As deep and complex as its predecessor, but more accessible.

												This is the best game of its genre! My most favorite game! I just love it! It provides plenty of space for the player to fill the gameplay with their own story and characters. I can play this game day and night!Check out my guides:

												With every new addon the gameplay got more restricted, the AI more broken and in the end you end up with a once brilliant game that is a complete cluster♥♥♥♥. A cluster♥♥♥♥ you pay hundrets of dollar/euro/whatever for. They are unable to fix a game of this size, to balance the AI and to get rid of the bugs that are causing with every new patch.And there is no chance to escape the wrecking, for the patches get stuffed down you throat by the forced updates from steam.For Paradox as a developer, games are nothing but cash cows anymore, CK2, EU4 and i bet HOI4 will be no different.Hundrets of dollars for games that get ♥♥♥♥ed up every few month.What a rotten piece of crap my once-favorite game dev/publisher has become.

												Ultimately, after 200 hours on a game (I'm not really a gamer so 200 hours is _insane_ for me to spend on a game) like this, you'd think I could recommend Crusader Kings II. Sadly, I am just not able to anymore. My view of CKII is pretty mixed, so I'll try to give the good with the bad. I'll start with the good first, since I plan to expand more on the bad.THE GOOD-The map is gorgeous and easily the best looking of all of Paradox's games. -Music, even without the music pack DLCs, is pretty great and I've never really gotten tired of it.-The history is, at least on the surface, simulated pretty well and I enjoy having some of the weirder and obscure characters in history able to be played like the last Karling, a random Christian ruler in Seljuk Anatolia, and so on. It's nice that they'll include stuff like that even if you can only access it by skipping to a very specific year.-The early DLCs, particularly The Old Gods, are genuinely fun. I love playing as the Norse during the Age of the Vikings and it's honestly one of the best parts of the game. It's to the point I almost wish The Old Gods was spun off as a different game (similar to For the Glory) to focus on just that era and expand more into Viking clans, religion, etc.-Unlike most I've played Crusader Kings 1 extensively and while there are a lot of steps back from that game, I do like that the council does more than just improve ruler stats. Letting your council micro-manage your realm (before they ruined it with Conclave) is genuinely very fun and makes it feel more like an actual feudal state.-It got me, someone who doesn't really like video games enough to be called a ""gamer"" (most of the games on my Steam are gifts are stuff I bought and never played), to play for 200 hours so that's got to count for something.THE BAD-First off, the DLCs. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the DLCs. Paradox, when I am expected to pay $15 to play as a Jew, when there are literally fewer than 10 Jewish players to even play in nearly _700 years_ of gameplay, how do you even justify that? Really, the DLCs have turned a good $60 game into a bloated mess that Paradox wants you to pay nearly $200 for. Even as someone with the means to do so, this game does _not_ deserve that price and is simply not good enough for it. I've bought strategy games for the PC that start at $100 retail because they are done with mind-boggingly amounts of research, study, and care. Crusader Kings II is not that good.-Besides the price of the DLCs, which is crazy, the amount of content that you have to add on to the game is out of control. Not only does it mean the base game is almost worthless, but that you start to break your game the more you add on to it. It is simply ridiculous and is something that warns off new players when they see mountains of DLC.-Patches that you have no control over that break your game. I am one of the poor people who bought Conclave on Day 1 and even though I have since turned it off like any sensible person, the forced patch means that I can't escape some of the worse parts of the DLC whether I want it or not. Paradox breaks your game for you and there is no real way to go back. I miss the days of the old Paradox games when I refused to upgrade EU 3 for over a year until better patches came around.-Conclave. Just...♥♥♥♥ing Conclave. If you want to know why it's so bad read one of the other reviews but suffice to say it breaks any sense of believability or historical playability of the game and turns it into a game that is almost impossible to play if you are anything more than a duke, and a minor duke at that. -Speaking of which...Paradox, either accept that your games are, you know, games or try to be more historical. You can't be either. Iqta government is not feudalism, CK II can't even begin to simulate medieval economies, and India. Didn't. Work. That. Way. I am a history nerd myself and that's why I enjoy Paradox games, but the way the game has been lately with the recent expansions it is almost impossible to try to play a game historically with the way that CKII works. Economy is a joke, armies don't work how they should, vassals aren't simulated anywhere near realistically, rebellions happen more often than they should for some countries and never for others (I have yet to see the Golden Horde have any problem ruling all of Russia past 1300 and often survives all the way to the end of the game fully intact).-A lot of the bad things in the game feel like a step back from Crusader Kings 1, which is one of my best games ever to this day. Events are basically nerfed and pointless now which severely hampers roleplaying, different numbers for a vassal's opinion of you and loyalty are gone which makes holding empires together almost impossible, armies and economy are massively changed and almost never for the better, and in general CK II just feels...less in depth. In Crusader Kings I, despite a smaller scope, I could really get lost into the intricacies of day-to-day rule. By this point in CK II with all the patches I rarely if ever care who my king is and never interact with him. I can't remember the last time it mattered who I marry beyond alliances, even.Overall, CK II is a slick-looking game with a ton of problems underneath. I keep playing it because it is, on a level, addicting, but it's far too broken and mismanaged for me to totally enjoy it or recommend it. Sadly, since the release of Conclave my playtime has taken a nosedive and it's unlikely I'll keep playing. EU4 is at least fun enough without Mare Nostrum to keep playing but with the forced patches and general unlikeability of the gameplay, I can't say I'd tell anyone I know to play CK II. Oh well, at least we'll always have CK 1.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will start by saying I really enjoy playing the games that Paradox creates. My first thought is to recommend their product. But then we start this DLC instead of update policy. Time and again I have seen this company release new content for their games (many of which seem based off of player mods, and add little to none in way of expanding upon it). I woudnt mind one here and there. Or perhaps if they didnt try to make you pay for portraits, music, and additional gameplay options. It's bad enough paying $15 for a DLC which does very little in the way of mechanics, but Paradox goes much further than that. They want to charge you for new music, new portaits, and new character models. EACH SOLD SEPERATELY. So basically, the games are amazing and fun, but the DLC policy has become so outragous and nickle/dimes you so much that I can NOT advise anyone to purchase their products.			",19,3,0,10,13,1,22

												It's easy to start up CK II and not get what the fuss is about. Another Euro-centric medieval simulator, like we haven't seen that before. With a snail pace and no sprawling, Total War like combat, it seems more like a ""watch time pass"" simulator than a game.But you start a game nonetheless. You chose to start as a small, independent region - maybe the one where you or your ancestors hail from - glory to the motherland and all that. And you just want to learn the ropes, no need to get into anything large. The game starts; you press play and fiddle with the speed. Nothing happens. You leave it on high. Minutes pass; nothing happens. 'OK', let's see what this button at the top left does. You spend the next half hour fiddling with all the info there, trying to make sense of it. From time to time, pop-ups show up, detailing little events that seem to have no impact on the game. 'Oh, cool. This random courtesan fancies me. Who friggin' cares?'.But one message catches your eye - the neighboring♥♥♥♥♥hat has decided he likes your lands and he'd like to make them his lands. You quickly raise your impressive army only to watch in horror as ten times as many butcher them with ease. Your dynasty ends with its founders head on a pile. Game over.OK, that went as well as can be expected - can't be be blamed for not winning with the small guy on the first time. You start up another game, this time as the biggest, baddest nation that you see - what greater joy could there be than to steamroll all your punier neighbors into fine grains of dust? As the game starts, you watch with greedy eyes as the gold rolls into your treasury. 'Yeah, time to build some♥♥♥♥♥♥. 'What? It takes one year, costs that much and increases my army by ♥♥♥♥-all percent in this region only?? Screw that, time to slaughter some franks'. 'OK, diplomacy, declare war... Why is it greyed out? Casus Beli??? WTF is that?'. But no matter, while you were scouring your memory of high-school Latin, the guys to the south have graciously decided to bring the fight to you. 'Pathetic basters, they're like half my size. This is going to be fun'. You raise your levies and merge them into one big glob. 'That skull must mean I'm one deadly S.O.B' you think to yourself. And you march to meet them head on, only to see your guys start to die off before you even get there. 'Doesn't matter' you think to yourself, 'I still outnumber them 2:1'. By the time your armies meet, it's more like 1.5 to 1, and you still barely beat them. But you do. Time to reap the rewards...Your peasants have taken up arms against you.Your vassals have risen up to lower crown authority.Your king has died, only to be inherited by a possessed dimwit.You have been excommunicated.The franks have decided that that small little province on the border is theirs and they are willing to drown you in blood for it.Game over.At this moment you are fuming. You steel yourself - this stupid game isn't going to get the better of you. You start thinking, 'what's the best starting point?'. You start again, this time as a count in province deep in the heart of a stable empire. You start slow, making friends with everyone. Then your lord and brother dies, making you the new Duke. 'Oh, so I don't have to attack everyone to take their land'. You make a mental note. The years pass; through claim fabrication, key marriages and poisoned wines you grab a few more adjacent duchies. A few gold coins later and you are the King of Bavaria.This makes the emperor uneasy. He demands that you release a duchy that he claims is rightfully his. You're too weakened from your last conquest to fight him - and it's just a small province anyway. You grin your teeth and accept his demands. And the years pass again; your line is well loved and respected by your emperor and fellow vassals. You are seen as a keen supporter of his Imperial Majesty. But the strangest thing keeps happening. All the bright, attractive or strong princes, they never seem to make it pass infancy. As generations pass, the crippled, the dim and the feeble seem to favored by some unseen force and raise to the crown. Unsurprisingly, your fellow lords are not happy with this rule.The time has come. You start a movement, to replace the inheritance law with an elective one. A bloody civil war erupts and, after many years, you emerge the victor. You are now next in line to become the most powerful man in Europe. Just. one. more. assassination.And... the Huns happen. Your empire is too weak and you fail to protect your lands against the scourge.GAME OVER.It's morning. You have to go to work in about an hour. You call in sick.You probably are...

												An Indian family fleeing from oppression in their home province found asylum in my Kingdom of Norway. Why not, I thought. The father of the family was a decent warrior, so I allowed him to command troops in battle. He distinguished himself in many wars over the years and was awarded one of the recently conquered counties in Northern Germany. He continued to serve me loyally and has even converted to Norse religion. For his service I gave him a duchy to rule. Generation after generation his descendants continued to marry local nobles.Now, nearly two centuries later, Germany is ruled by white dudes in turbans who think they're Indian, worship Norse gods and train War Elephants. Breaking history has never been so much fun!I started playing CK2 during a free weekend. It looked like something I might like, so I gave it a try. I bought the game the next day along with several DLCs and never stopped playing. CK2 has now climbed to number 1 of my most played Steam games, in spite of being in my library for less than a year. I don't recall another ""game addiction"" that lasted this long for me. And there is the fact that nearly 400 hours into the game I've only played as one of the many game religions, one of the numerous cultures (disregarding the training scenario). Playing as a different religion, culture, starting location, starting rank changes the way you play the game. You could even start your second play through in the exact same character as last time and the way things will go will be entirely different. This game is more complex than any other strategy I've played before. It takes a while to take it all in. Luckily there are in-game hints to what every screen means and what every button does (you can switch these off later, but I found myself checking every now and then). There is also a tutorial campaign that will teach you how to play.What adds to the fun greatly is the fact that you play as a specific character. Their traits and abilities make them more appropriate for certain roles within the Kingdom than others. The current King might make a better priest than military commander, but you don't say that out loud in front of your liege (or their spymaster). Once your character dies, you play as the heir to their titles, this being usually one of their children, depending on the hereditary laws of your realm.Feel like expanding your Empire? You don't necessarily need to wage war to achieve that. Why don't you marry your eldest son to that second daughter of the neighboring empire and then make sure the first-born daughter (already married) has a little accident before she has children? However as I am not the patient type I prefer marching my armies into enemy territory and be done with it. What I love about the battles is that the smallest thing can change the outcome of the battle (much like in history). The commander of your strongest flank was killed shortly after the skirmish began and his confused troops now run around the battlefield like headless chickens? Well, s**t happens. There is always a chance, however small, that things will go wrong. It's up to you to play the odds (don't put your only heir in battle, especially while he's sick) and have a backup plan in case things don't go your way or you might end up losing your realm, or the entire game. Once I lost a major battle and most of my personal army. One of my vassals decided now was the good time to revolt, my stronger neighbor saw it as an opportunity to invade and on top of that a peasant uprising started in one of my counties. Bottom line - I lost it all and had to make tribal huts in Norway my capital, which was a bummer after living in a mighty castle in Western France for two generations.The good news is you can appoint commanders as you see fit, provided your authority within the realm is strong enough to do so. Each of the several types of troops (and culture specific special units) has a different attack and defend stats and these evolve as you research technologies and construct special buildings. Your commanders can employ various tactics during battle, some of which depend on their personal traits and/or martial capability. There are many situations you will find yourself in - often thanks to random events, most of which require very specific conditions to be met first. Many events are bound to a specific time and realms that existed at that point. I will not spoil these for you because I found it to be a lot of fun to face some of them followed by a palm on the forehead and an exclamation: “Of course, I (sort of) remember this from history lessons!”I’ve always been interested in history and considered my knowledge of geography very decent and yet I’ve learned a lot of new facts by playing CK2. My natural curiosity took over and I've since researched many medieval realms and rulers online.If you’re feeling competitive then know that achievements are only awarded if you play on Ironman mode. So please make sure that if you come across a player with some of the most difficult of achievements you salute and/or bow as appropriate.At some point you might find yourself lying on your death-bed. Your son and heir might be an imbecile, your younger brother has possibly convinced half of your court he'd make a better King than you and yet you’ll enjoy every minute of it. This game has my full recommendation.If this looks like something you might like then give it a try. But be warned - You might be buying the new number 1 in your library and may thus face the ""Should I do something meaningful with my day or should I finally become the King of England?"" decision. And we both know it can only go one way from there.			",38,8,0,17,8,0,9

Posted: September 13, 2015
												I'm going to tell you a brief history of the magnificent and prestigious Pasta family; one of the most prevalent Venetian trades families that reigned Venice on and off for some 600 years. Throughout their years and with a very sordid and complicated family tree the Pasta family (stemming from their patriarch, Serene Doge Spaghetti I ""The Fat"") came to amass a previously unthought-of level of wealth. Legend has it that in the late 11th century Venetian spending ground to a complete halt as the city-state had quite literally too much money and not enough places to invest in. A ruthless and cunning family, the Pasta family spared no expense in making sure their trade ports were renowned the world over. If money was being spent in the Mediterranean, the Pasta family got a cut; to do business and avoid them was difficult. To avoid Venice altogether was impossible. While avoiding open conflict as much as they could, the Venetians did get in a few trade squabbles with the Amalfi, only to render the Greek patricians an afterthought when it came to doing business in the Mediterranean. Using a mix of intrigue and some well-placed military show-of-force, the Pasta patricians were able to get a monetary lock on almost the entire Mediterranean Sea, and were even looking to find a weak county along the Red Sea to capture so as to expand their trade empire into India. Venice made many political and cultural strides in southern Europe, notably by turning its back on Roman Catholicism in 1207 to adopt the Cathar heresy. This did very little to dissuade people from trading with them, however, as Rome itself was home to a particularly busy Pasta trade port for several hundred years at that point. It wasn't until Serene Doge Cavatappi III in 1349 did cracks begin to form in the illustrious Pasta mansion, so to speak. Through a series of marriages to various Saxon and Bavarian princes the Pasta family came in posession of a few counties in mainland Europe; far away from warm, balmy climate of Venice. Sitting on a veritable mountain of gold at this point, the Venetian powers that be tended to ignore their lands to the north, and left it in the capable hands of their respective rulers. After Penne IV, son of Cavatappi III lost the election to become the next Serene Doge (an event that did happen a few times during the 600 year Pasta tenure, but few and far in between), he decided to turn his back on Venice altogether and tore his family's ties from the Republic. Adopting a few of his rightful counties in Bavaria and suffering a hard but brief blow from the bizarre Sunset Invasion, Penne and his kin lived in a financial nightmare. While by no means broke, the family now had a mere fraction of the wealth they amassed during their mainstay in Venice. The reason not much has been written about the Pasta family is because after this exodus the dynasty pretty much lost all of its prestige and money. Left with a few counties in Saxony (which were quickly overthrown by their bigger and more powerful Frankish neighbors) and no historical records left over save for a few manuscripts found in the wine cellar of the old Pasta mansion (discovered only recently), the Pasta family became a cold, stale remnant of what it once was. The only surviving history of the family for a while was of its brief stay in mainland Europe, which was far from glorious. ...I did all of this by clicking things on a map and looking at spreadsheets. 10/10 would create a grand trade empire only to fade into obscurity and have a terrible score at the end of the game again.

												This game will teach you all you need to know about subjective morality, medieval history, and incest. If you think you're a good person, I dare you to try this game. You too will be murdering unneeded and unlanded family members and cheating on your spouse while blackmailing the priests who serve under you for better tithes within no time. Ever watched the show Game of Thrones and thought that that Jeoffrey guy was on to something? Maybe you're a fan of Henry VIII, a King of England who lived and breathed debauchery and intrigue (whatever you judge it as morally, that must have been a compelling life, no?) and made war whenver he felt he could? You can more or less act out any medieval power fantasy you'd like here, with options becoming more and more complex as you learn to manipulate diplomacy and how to plan more intricately.I cannot recommend this enough if you're into grand strategy like me.

												If you love strategy then you have to play this game cause it will put your skills to the test.The only bad thing is how the game can move at a snails pace, but its great excuse to do something while it plays.Like eat some pizza, do a bit of cleaning, or watch some videos.My personal favorites for this game is the long spanning games you can have with it and the organic stories to be had.One story of mine goes as followed.....I was a lowly count of Athens, clawing my way up to Doux/Duke and one day emperor.After many years of conquest of my neighbors I had four counties to my name and finally took my title as Doux.Now I served the empire as Marshal of the realm, loyally I fought wars againest the neighboring pagens and muslims.Thing took a turn for the worse when I was wrongly accused of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had hoped my liege would merciful, he was not....Years after my death, my son lead a revolt for elective monarchy and won, shortly after he became emperor.It was then I would get my revenge by executing the last emperor's son.With my vegance complete my family went on to restore the Roman Empire and bring order to chaos.

												Crusader Kings II is a masterpiece of a game.Crusader Kings II scratches an itch that no other game can - a mix of grand strategy, RPG mechanics, and the SIMS.Crusader Kings II can, and will, keep you entertained for hundreds if not thousands of hours.Crusader Kings II is an excellent way to learn and play with history during the Middle Ages. Crusader Kings II has an incredible modding scene, community, and tradition of After Action Reports.Crusader Kings II charges an arm and a leg for the dozen or so DLC packs that expand the base game.Crusader Kings II forces you to see and interact with the content, even if you haven't bought the DLC and can't play it.Crusader Kings II has steadily gotten worse, performance-wise, as a result of this explosion of moving parts.Crusader Kings II is developed and maintained by a company that has lost their original vision and lost this customer. And that is all I can say.			",19,7,0,6,5,0,2

												It's not that I don't like this game, but the DLC is completely ridiculous. Expansions are alright, but there is no reason that they have to release other DLC with them. They have already released face packs, music packs, dynasty shield packs, and probably something else that I'm forgetting, and in their latest expansion, Charlemagne, Paradox proved that they are experts at squeezing every last dollar out of their customers. Just when I thought they had run out of face and music packs to sell, they added clothing packs. There is absolutely no reason that these cosmetic changes can't come bundled for free or at a reduced price with the expansions. In total, Crusader Kings II DLC now costs over one hundred and seventy-five dollars. While there is nothing wrong with the game by itself, the DLC model that Paradox uses is horrible, and is only defended by a group of people that have a cult-like devotion to the company.

 Crusader Kings II Name  - Crusader Kings IIGenre - Grand StrategyPersonal Opinion - The best strategy game there ever was! This is a pretty big game and this is my first review, so I won't delve into it too deep!  Also time played is not true, I have played this game quite a lot offline, unfortunately it does not show offline play hours. Review Crusader Kings II, a game where you can be a King, a Duke, a Count, or even an Emperor, with each level of nobility bringing a new level of difficulty, whereas if you start as a Count, you may start with only one province and depending on where you start you might end up being a vassal to someone else or even have some of your own!Given that you are a vassal, you  may   will  have to compete with other vassals, who will either be lower or higher than you, in some cases you might join a faction with other vassals to try and force the current leader of the country to do things, such as lowering taxes and gaining independence, if you gain enough support you can get things in motion by issuing an ultimatum to the Emperor/King/Duke asking for these things, and if they refuse, you will be able to start a war to get it happening.Then there's marriage, you can just about marry every single person in your kingdom, given that they aren't the same sex as you and they are 16 or over, however you can arrange a marriage for people under 16 (Betrothal).Of course it doesn't just end there, after marriage you can have little clones of yourself (Kids), and build your dynasty, then marry em' off and possibly inherit more land!Also, there are some awesome events that are random and pretty fun. Such as being a lunatic and appointing your horse as your chancellor, or giving birth to the anti-christ. Also, being an absolute tyrant and just murdering your way to the top.Why not discover the ""What if"" part of history, reclaim the Old Roman Empire, make Britain actually conquer the world, kill the pope, conquer the papacy, restore the persian empire. DLC List  Sword of Islam [www.ckiiwiki.com] Legacy of Rome [www.ckiiwiki.com] Sunset Invasion [www.ckiiwiki.com] The Republic [www.ckiiwiki.com] The Old Gods [www.ckiiwiki.com] Sons of Abraham [www.ckiiwiki.com] Rajas of India [www.ckiiwiki.com] Charlemagne [www.ckiiwiki.com] Way of Life [www.ckiiwiki.com] Mods Just thought i'd share a couple of the best Crusader Kings II mods with you!

												Do I recommend this game?Yes, truly I do. Its an awesome game. It develops every single aspect of a strategy game set in the past that are left out of other games. You can have families, friends, allies, non-aggression pacts. You can imprison, execute and banish annoying vassals, you can marry yourself with the daughter of the King of England, and  through the descendants of that union get a claim on his lands. The game is varied, as you an set your game in various time periods across history with hundreds of different factions. You can be a Mongolian Khan or a Holy Roman Emperor just as much as you can be a count in Iceland with no wealth, armies or power. In most strategy games, who YOU in an empire is mostly irrelevant. In the CIV series you're simply a great leader of your nation that rules it forever. Or in the Total war series, you can have a defined character bu everything about him is mostly out of your control or irrelevant. in CK2, all the focus is on your family, as it should be. Your daughters can be married to secure alliances or become great rulers in their own right. Your sons can lead your armies, and can be giving titles you win through war. Some of your sons will love you, others will only try to seize power for themselves. Every single character as a personality, related to their trait that ACTUALLY MATTERS. Be a jerk, become a tyrant and people will hate you, resent you and might even try to murder you This world feels organic and you truly feel a part of it. For all of those reasons, I recommend this gameHoweverIt cant be denied that this game unfortunately has TONS of issues that affect game play. The kind of which will make you want to scream at your screen at how stupid what just happened was. Complete nobodies who actually like you will have you murdered for no reason or  will get themselves 20000 men armies out of nowhere to attack you even tough they don't have a penny on them or apparent claims on your lands. The AI can be incredibly stupid! They cant ever hold on to a king title without being crushed by continuous groups of rebellious vassals. After a century, ever single important christian kingdom will have an elective system of law. Why? Because its what theirs vassals want and the AI cant handle rebellions. You want to battle certain foreign dynasties across history? Too bad, the AI is also incompetent at keeping themselves alive for any long periods. Most great houses in say, 1066 will have disappeared in a bout a century  which COULD be considered historically accurate but at the same time it makes you feel like you're playing this game alone with no actual competition. The AI for the pope can be brain dead. Calling crusades against Kingdoms in India, forcing crusaders to cross the Persian desert to reach their target!The DLC in this game is horrendous. Its DLC whoring that's EA worthy. You have to pay for portraits and songs in the game!!! PURE AESTHETICS STUFF THAT DOESNT CHANGE GAME PLAY. Are you sick of hearing the same 2 god damn songs in repeat? Pay money.The worst about those DLC is what they offer. Without paying extra, you cant play pagans, you cant play Indians, you cant play muslims and you cant play republics. Thats right, more than half of the starting areas are impossible for the player to play unless they pay extra. Others are simply broken and as such are complete rip offs AND THANK GOD I never bought some of them!! They allow you for 5.49 $ to customize your ruler on regular mode BUT not on Ironman mode. But, thats something you could ALREADY DO THROUGH THE CONSOLE. Its vastly useless! The Way of life DLC makes every single male in your kingdom horny dogs that go after your wife, your heirs wife etc... which means, in a game about dynasties ruling across history, your son might just be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of some random count who, thanks to the seduction focus, repeatedly slept with your wife 35 times right under your nose. The ONLY way to make sure your wives don't end up sleeping with every single man in the Kingdom is to pick a chaste one (trait that I rarely see and that they often end up losing) or a lesbian. Apparently, according to paradox, all women were ♥♥♥♥♥s in these times! Seeing how they refuse to truly fix this, thats the only conclusion I can arrive to. They tried to with a new ""reject seduction attempts"" system but since theres always a few master seducers running around it doesn't stop anyone. The conclave DLC makes the game way harder and sooo much less fun. The Republic DLC forces you to use seniority succession and nothing else! Always playing 75 years old? isnt that fun???The Sword of Islam dlc should've been in the base game, same for the old gods. There's no excuses to leave so many factions unplayable even at an 1066 start. Theres also new updates. Lots of complaints about the new update regarding coalitions that can make pagans, muslims and christians band together against you because you took a duchy through a religious war. They NEVER make coalitions USEFUL agaisnt the AI, this feature is SOLELY used to stop the player from expanding, forcing you to wait 30 f*cking years for infamy to go off unless youre willing to fight 8 nations at the same time. Shattered retreats make your enemies armies magically undestroyable while they basicly have safe conduit back to their territories. Which means, wars now drag for SO FREAKING longer than they need to because you can't kill their armies! You cant pursue them either because you will never have enough supplies and risk losing men needlessly. Sometimes, your own armies will retreat at the WORST POSSIBLE PLACES. When you raid a coast with boats and your raiders gets defeated, they sometimes retreat further in the AIs territory even tough their boats is RIGHT THERE. Theres as of date NO OPTION to turn those off. You dont like them? too bad. You have to use mods on the workshop and disable ironman mode to be able to play without themIn short?? This game offers SO much and at the same time sucks the fun out of the game with questionable design decisions, horrible dlc, and annoying AI. Is the game fun? Yes. Of course it is. But after several hours, you realize all the shortcoming of this game and you're bound to be annoyed by them. Btw, buy this game on a sale, that game is often on sale at 40% or 30% off (cant remember the percentage) Yet every other day its over 200$ to acquire the ""full experience"". Just wait a little while and get it on sale			",11,5,0,4,9,0,10

												Other Games: 20$ of DLC? The devs don't care about the game, just money, don't recommend!This Game: 276$ of DLC? Wow Paradox really cares about us and not cash, 10/10 would recommendIn all seriousness, many features in this game are locked behind DLC, everything from designing your own ruler to playing different cultures. Yet this game maintains a good rating, how? If EA did this♥♥♥♥♥♥ the masses would lose they're ♥♥♥♥ing minds. I love playing this game but that fact that so many cool features need to be paid for is just way too expenivse, and unless you're a hardcore fan of Grand Strategy, it just is too expensive.

												Loved this game, I considered it one of the best games I ever played. I also liked some of the major DLC such as The Old Gods, Rajas of India and Charlemagne. Even DLCs that added things I felt should have been there at the start such as Sword of Islam did improve the game. Hell I even liked Sunset Invasion because it made gameplay more interesting in the west even if it is nonsensical. A few of the DLCs did make the game better. There's also some enjoyable mods such as the GOT mod and the Elder Kings mod. I also love many of Paradox's games. It should have been impossible for them to turn me into an annoyed customer.That said the devs have simply made to many changes with patches and DLC that have just made CK2 a lot less fun and they're going to continue changing it. At a certain point all their changes were doing was make everything take longer and be more frustrating to do. The changes to the council, shattered retreats and coalitions for example just make the game more tedious. If the changes you're adding don't make the game fun but just make it last longer then what is the point? All you're doing is annoying the people that are playing and buying your products; you get sick of them changing the game for the worse. That's all without mentioning waiting for them to fix bugs in their new updates, DLC and the ton of cosmetic and sound DLC for the game. The other fact is it must be so offputting for someone thinking of buyng the game fresh. There's just too much DLC. I cannot imagine how offputting all the DLC must be to a new player I mean what is there like 50+ now? I don't get how Paradox don't get that seeing a £30 game with 50+ DLCs with a price of £122 is extremely offputting especially to new players or players that didn't keep up with the DLC. I love CK, EU, HOI and like Victoria but I'll not buy another paradox game. They seem to enjoy releasing DLC after DLC that eventually just end up changing the core gameplay for the worse by making the games more frustrating and take longer. On top of that a lot of the DLC seems to change minor things yet are priced the same as the stuff that makes significant changes.They've ruined EUIV imo, CK2 isn't ruined YET but they've definitely made the game worse than it was and since they're apparently going to be releasing even more DLC for it at this point I've basically braced myself for the game to go more and more downhill. So basically I'll never by another one of their games because I know they'll release DLC after DLC that will eventually suck the fun out of the game I liked. They change things that don't need changing and add things the game was better of without and it's frustrating watching a game you like become worse. If it ain't broke don't fix it would be a good principle for Paradox to start following :(.			",95,46,0,38,31,3,60

												While I love this game and have played it more than any other game in my entire life, I am nonetheless extremely disappointed with the Conclave DLC. The funny thing is, I haven't even purchased it - meaning I can't put my review on its page - but parts of it have still seeped into my game anyway.Shattered retreat is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and does nothing except pointlessly prolong already one-sided wars. The decreased opinion bonuses from vassals make them a hundred times more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and they seem to remain in factions against me even when their opinion of me is extremely high. I've heard plenty of other complaints about the proper DLC as well, like ruining the child education system and making the council as reasonable as a brick wall.It's unfortunate, really. This is such a great game, but this DLC has accentuated everything I didn't like about it and added virtually nothing in return. I can't imagine what Paradox was smoking when they made this, but until they get their act together, I can't recommend a purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was my experience:Play a few games but I don't really understand the game. Finally after an hour and a half of going throught the tutorials a second time I figure it out. Start up an empire in Iceland. I don't bother anyone. I marry a Danish girl and help out my father-in-law with a rebelion and a small war but I don't really cause any trubble. The king of Norge (Norway) keeps wanting to start wars though. One day I get a letter, he wants peace as long as I fly his flage. Seeing as my wife was sick and had died a month before and her father was now losing a war I did not have the gold to help him win I had no other choice but to submit and accepted Norge rule. Immediatly the King of Norge invites me to his grand feast. He treats me well and offers me protection and safety. Alpha as ♥♥♥♥ King of Norge fights the Scots who have been bothering me for years. I ask if my son can marry his beautiful daughter who will one day be the Queen of Norge, and without question or hesitation he sends his daughter to Iceland and congradulates me on entering the family. WIth this my son is happy and I can concentrait on my kingdom. Over the next few years I build up a great army and nearly 1000 gold in wealth. However, I am an old man. I fear the fate of my father, I fear that soon I will die. The King of Norge is not a young man either anymore. One day I get another letter. The King of Norge is plaining to invade Scotland. Seeing as my other son married Godwinson (The King of England)'s daughter I was prepared to invade Scotland and claim all of  England and thus most of northern Europe for the King of Norge. I constructed a fleet of ships, hired thousands of men from the country side and some extra mecenaries just in case, and set sail. This time I was prepared for battle, I knew what would come. It was minutes laters as I prepaired my assault that I watched a Scotish fleet came from the deep ocean and landed on my shores and slaughter my people. Half of Scotland fought me in Scotland while the other half banded together and invaded my homeland of Iceland. And that folks is the story of how Crusader Kings II gives you a cookie, lets you eat it and enjoy it before slaping you across the face and wash your mouth out with soap and hot sause. And I'll be god damned if it wasn't the most fun I've ever had. I laughed and I cried. I was filled with joy and then crushed with defeat. I was a king...I was THE KING...and then I was nothing...11/10 would loose everything again			",48,3,0,12,9,0,7

												Scene: The Duke of Edessa, finally recovering from a recent Muslim invasion and the wounds suffered from it, invaded by the neigboring Byzantine Empire. His armies are crushed and his son is captured and castrated. He loses the war and is left as a one provice minor. He catches the plague and goes insane. He vows his revenge. 100 years later another Duke of Edessa and Antioch, now a vassal of Byzantium, begins revenge for the misfortunes of his ancestor. First he weasles his way into the current Emperor's inner circle and gains his trust. He then seduces all of his daughters and has a child with one of them. He then kills all of the sons of the Emperor, while luckily not being caught. He then recognizes the illegitimate child as his own. He then kills his wife and marries the byzantine emperor's daughter, who promptly dies of syphilis. He then  marries the daughter of the HRE thus forming an alliance with them. He then bides his time until the Empire is at its weakest point. The wait was not long, since 5 years later the Caliph of the Sunni faith called a Jihad for Anatolia. The emperor won the Jihad, but at the expense of most of his armies. The Duke, after waiting patiently for so long struck at the rival family. He raised all of the men of the land and used every last coin enlisting the help of mercenary bands. They marched towards Constantinople to meet the Imperial forces. After winning the battle the duke laid siege to the city. Just as the war was about to be won, syphilis struck again not only killing the duke, but his sons as well, leaving the fate of the dynasty and the war in the hands of a 62 year old, possessed, insane and childless relative. All hope was beginning to fail as the war took a turn for the worst. Then in final attempt at survival he sent the last of his armies to face the larger byzantine force. Then in a stroke of luck during the battle, his troops we able to capture the emperor and his last surviving son. He then in a bout of madness castrated all of his prisoners including the emperor and his son. The war ended and the emperors daughter took the throne, the 62 year old then attempted to seduce woman multiple times until finally it suceeded after his 65th birthday. A sickly, clubfooted, imbicile child was born, who the duke legitimized. He then killed the childs mother and himself leaving the young 1 year old as emperor. The duke's revenge finally seemed complete, until the one year old died from syphilis. (I have no idea how he got syphilis)10/10 would syphilis again			",62,6,1,15,25,0,35

												Imagine being the king of a small European country in the 1400s. Also imagine that you're a homosexual, socially inept dwarf with a penchant for naval strategy. Now imagine your wife is being unfaithful with your overambitious brother who is planning to assassinate you and take your throne, but before he can carry out his plans you are accidentally killed during a fox hunt and your 5-year old daughter takes the throne. This is Crusader Kings II, and you know you want it.			",187,80,7,31,13,2,47

												CK2 makes Civilization V look like Call of Duty. ""Go to war with the other guys!"" ""Get new stuff!""Crusader Kings 2 is a game where you play as a dynasty with no true goal but survive and prosper in any way until the game ends at 1453.You can start anywhere from the High Middle Ages during William's conquest of England to the Late Middle Ages, during the rise of the Ottomans, and play as anyone minus the DLC-requiring peoples, even a vassal of someone else or a little count to rise to victory.The game offers an entire Europe of filthy infidels and christians to convert and conquer, but as you incorporate more vassals and peoples, your risk of civil war will increase, making the conquest of the known world difficult but possible.You can change succession laws so when your character dies like every filthy king does, you won't have trouble with how the hell the crown keeps itself together when you die. Some kingdoms start with Gavelkind, where your kingdom is split among your children, making the conquest of several kingdoms and the stabilization of the world under your rule a farfetched idea, while others may have more proper succession laws.Endless conquest doesn't exist unless everything is lined up; you need an actual reason to take the lands of your filthy heretic enemies. Someone from your Council can fabricate claims to claim that god damn one person, while if there's a filthy infidel on your borders, you can declare a Holy War (unless you're pagan but i think that's dlc required) to take a big chunk of that filthy infidel's land, but risk his fellow infidels defending their INFIDEL religion.The Pope might also call a Crusade to attack an enemy of Christianity or reclaim the Holy City, while the Caliph of an Islamic belief can call a Jihad. Back at home, you can have marriage ties with other nations to get them to be allied to you for future conquests.Is there an insubordinate vassal about to revolt? Rally those who hate him and those who love you in a plot to end his disobediant life! Of course, it's just been revealed that you plotted to kill him, so now everyone knows you've tried to murder him and he hates you.Your neighbour's heresy got him excommunicated, better not♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pope.The Pope called a crusade on you! better not♥♥♥♥♥♥off the pope.The Pope just sent you money for killing the Muslims! Now you can kill more Muslims!Oh.Oh...you've just been conquered by the Mongols.well, all of it has been in vain.And that doesn't even scratch the surface!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a duchess in France who holds control over a duchy spanning from Brittany in the west to Paris in the east. I declare independence from France, forming a phallic image thrusting into the ocean blue of the Atlantic. I wrest control of my duchy from my former liege and execute the king of France because why not.I proceeded to get my great-grandson onto the throne of the Byzantine Empire by assassinating at least 2 teenagers, unifying Western Europe and the Byzantines.Then the mother ♥♥♥♥ing Muslims and their 50000 troop doomstacks came and wrecked my realm that was seperated by all of Germany and castrated one of my vassals in rage.Would recommend for aspiring world conquerers wishing to revive feudalism.

												Don't get me wrong. This game is pure heroin. It's so addictive. I have about 400 hours off-clock.It's just the amount of DLC this game has that makes me not recommend it. It's worse than Civ V. The main game is worthless. If you want to actually play the game, you must buy at least some of the DLC.Stay away until the price drops... a lot. More than -75%, if you ask me. No reason to support this kind of shameful business, where the game is cut to pieces and then each piece is sold separately for a small fee.			",99,4,1,19,10,0,30

												The first thing I did as the King of England was assassinate the King of Scotland. It wasn’t for any particular reason. I had just started running the game for the first time, and wanted to check out the King of where I actually lived. But then I saw the assassinate button. I pressed the assassinate button. There was suddenly a dead Scottish monarch and a massive civil war.Crusader Kings II is a ‘Grand Strategy Game’ by Paradox Entertainment, a lovingly created, complex board game of Europe, where you play as historical character. Unlike other strategy games, where you’re the godly hand that guides a country or force, here you’re a Count, Duke, King or Emperor, with all the extra complexities and joys that brings. You have to handle your lineage – marry, have children, assassinate children, change succession laws – so that the game continues. It is the only must in CKII: create an heir, or on death without one, it’s game over. The rest is really up to you. You could try and forge the Empire of Hispania as one of the Spanish Catholic kings, unifying the other catholic nations there and driving out the Muslim rulers. You could play peacefully as the King of Scotland in a different game, only stooping to war when vassals rebel for their own claims on your kingdom. With certain DLC, you could play as Muslim rulers in Africa and Saudi Arabia, Pagan rulers, or even as a patrician, vying for control of the sea highways and port to get the most profit possible.The board deserves some explanation also: unlike many other strategy games, which use hexagonal or square tiles, here real counties are used, such as Gowrie, Cumberland, Middlesex, Badajoz, Leon, and Maine. And they aren’t just bits of land to get to make your Kingdom look bigger: they hold cities, castles and religious buildings that will increase the size of you or your vassal’s levies (army) when annexed and your income, from tax. You can even improve and build new holdings in these counties, to increase both of these. This is one of the many ways you spend your gold, along with creating kingdoms and duchies, hiring mercenaries, bribing the pope (yup!), assassinations, ect.Though out the game, you will be collecting this gold from the taxes, which is the commodity you will be using most often. Also throughout your characters life, he’ll gain Prestige and Piety: both add to your end game score, which you can use to measure just how well you’ve done after playing all those hundreds of years. Both also act like currencies, with you gaining prestige and piety from certain wars and events, but losing them with other events such as destroying kingdom titles (prestige), creating empire and kingdoms (piety) and reforming pagan religions (piety). Upon your characters death, they add to your score – not, however, a reason to die early.War is enjoyable in Crusader Kings II, but possibly not as important as in other strategy games. You can’t declare war, willy nilly. You must have a cause for war, the ‘cassus belli’. This at first feels very restrictive, as in some catholic countries, the only clear way to expand into neighbouring catholic nations is through the slow fabrication of a claim on the county. But eventually it blossoms into the complex strategy, as you juggle where to war with, with what cassus belli, to what end. It becomes delightfully full of opportunities. The Catholic Kingdoms can declare Holy Wars against Pagans and Muslims and claim their land, along with participating in the Crusades the Pope occasionally calls. You also have ‘De Jure Claims’, where you can conquer counties and land that belongs to the predefined ‘de jure’ duchies, kingdoms and empires, depending if you are a Duke, King or Emperor. Pagans can conquer any bordering counties, or subjugate entire kingdoms once in a life time. There is a treasure trove of reasons to war. And with your army, you can choose who leads the armies, and whether to engage them in battles against other armies, or to siege enemy provinces in the war. But it isn’t the only way to gain land: ensuring you’re the heir to the kingdom through assassinations and plots; through offering vassalization to the weaker, smaller independent rulers nearby. But wars are one of the more enjoyable points in the game, as long as you know how to handle them. There really is no better feeling than slowly building your independent duchy into a sprawling Empire over the years.It is important to say that all the rulers on the map are actively acting towards their own goals, with the games superb AI letting hundreds of characters act and change Europe, even in places far from where you are playing. It is sometimes enjoyable to pause the game, and just look around the map, at what’s happening far away. Seeing distant kingdoms fracture, far of empires grow, really gives the game a sense of scale that is great.And in multiplayer, you can have friends play in any of the Kingdoms, replacing one of the AI rulers. It can be incredible fun, with you playing as different Kingdoms, competing as you expand. You can choose whatever way you want to play with friends – you can assassinate them, declare war on them, or offer to join their wars. If they play as the same culture or religion, you may want to help them, to spread it, or fulfil goals that will help you all. With me and a friend playing Norse Pagans (Old Gods DLC), we started trying to expand my kingdom so that it controlled enough holy sites to reform the religion and grant us much needed security for successions. We’ve also had to aid each other during widespread civil and international war and bail each other out. It’s incredibly satisfying to bail your friends’ kingdom out of an independence war, and know they owe you one when you want to take over a nearby kingdom.The downsides of the game is the initial bafflement due to the complexities of how to combine all the systems for your own benefit, and the occasionally irritation caused by wars for the kingdom after succession. Multiplayer also requires all other players must download the host save file every time they play, which can be a slow, but is thankfully all handled in game.This game is one for those who wish to carve a story and a kingdom out of Europe, and are willing to learn through all the complexities and systems to do so. Once the game finally clicks and you’re away with it, it really is a magnificent game. Whole heartedly recommended.			",93,21,6,31,16,0,17

												Some people bad-mouth this game saying the dlc costs too much or that they should fix this and that before adding in more. But for me a game that 150 euro (or 250 if you buy the dlc later) it been worth it, why, becuse Crusader kings 2 has given me over 1k hours (So far). That's a lot. You'd had to play more than 40 days straight non stop to catch up with that. For me crusader kings is more than a game it's a hobby. Some people spend just as much money (or more) and hours to fix a car for example. In the end it's up to you if you feel like investing time and money into it.			",47,17,0,17,14,0,14

												I keep on returning to Crusader Kings II at random times, wanting to give myself a new challenge everytime.- Start an early era game and play as a Irish Cheif, just to see if I can become Emperor of Britan.- Start an mid era game and play as a vassal of a mighty sultan, and from there on try to take his place. And after that; try to convert all of Europe into Islam.- Start an early era game as a viking cheif, and turn into the mighty emperor of the skandinavian empire, which stretch all the way from Norway till rome.I keep on returning to great DLC's that don't cost much, and I can enjoy for hours and hours. And If I don't like the changes, I simply switch off the DLC...I love Crusader Kings II, my friend did good by adviceing me to try it, and I advice everyone who loves a great grand-strategy game to try Crusader Kings II, along with all it's DLC's!

To gain access to the full gamut of features available to players of this game, you'll have to spend upwards of $200. Most of the ""expansions"" for this game are in the form of $15 DLC packs that add as much content as a minor patch for similar games such as the Total War series or even Civilization.Long story short, don't buy this game unless you are willing to pay nearly $300 for the full experience.

												This is something of a Gateway game to take people into the genre of Grand Strategy games in my opinion, starting you in the place of a feudal lord, merchant republic patrician or as a pagan seeking to reform their faith. I think variety is one of the most important aspects in a game and this game provides hells amount of variety and then some. The scenario is constantly changing, and I literally mean constantly changing as feudal lords die, and new rulers take their place and wars coming from the thin of air to turn the balance in their favor.The game is complicated to grasp at first, and requires some dedication and willpower to see through the initial shock of all the concepts, but it can very much be compared to team fortress and all the new weapons and learning things bit by bit. Same concept of learning, and if you ever master this game there will always be Europa Universalis IV to move onto with the save converter, or if you're feeling bold, Victoria 2.Start your character fresh with ruler designer with only yourself to expand it, and in two hundred years it could become THE leading dynasty. Pick up the Old gods and take the Norse sons of Ragnar and conquer Scandanavia and maybe even Britannia, France and the Holy Roman Empire. This is the game where you aren't restricted by anything, and in a series where alternate history is the norm.Edit: My only concern is that much of the game is locked away under DLC. While I love supporting a developer like Paradox I think I should also offer warning that playing without any expansions will limit much of your variety. I started playing the game when it originally came out and bought the DLC as they came out, but the price will seem daunting to those coming into the game. If you're just coming into the game without knowing anything, I'd recommend grabbing two DLCs in particular: ""The Old Gods and The Legacy of Rome.""			",175,16,1,21,20,1,53

												RIP in pieces CK2.  It was a good 4 years!Conclave patch ruined the game.  Buy and downgrade or DON'T BUY IT AT ALL.  Better yet, huehue, you know what to do. Whatever you actually decide to do, don't reward them for trashing one of the greatest strategy games ever made with the latest patch.  It's absolutely garbage in every way, from destroying the war score system to implementing extremely imbalanced laws, EVEN if you don't buy conclave, you'll still have that horrible patch ruining the game.  Oh yeah, they actually introduced coalitions into CK2 LOL.  THIS ISN'T EU4 YOU SILLY PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING THIS LIKE EU4? URGGGGHH.For the love of God, do not buy this broken game as it is.  DO NOT reward them for making extremely terrible design decisions and implementation.  If you must, downgrade and find old mod versions that are compatible with the last patch.  CK2 IS DEAD.P.S. I realize I don't sound like the most rational human being in the world.  But coming from someone with 775 hrs in the game and even more on another account, they REALLY, REALLY, REALLY messed things up this patch.  Not only that but they're also nickel and diming you for every f-ing update.  They actually released an additional CONTENT PACK for the newest dlc, conclave.  I mean, seriously, they actually did that.  /endranttl;dr, they done goofed and ruined ck2.  if you buy, figure out how to revert back to an older patch and if you want mods, figure out which previous mod versions you'll need to run on the old patch. gg paradox.

												Coming from games like the Total War series or the Civilization games, you might notice similarities to both at once. Think Medieval Total War played completely on the overview map but injected with a touch of Civs intrigue and a lot more provinces/factions. But that is barely, if ever scratching the surface. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones court politics or a history buff interested in having his own alternate timeline sandbox to play in, you are right at home.Want to be an English duke who sleeps with the king's wife and then assassinates said king to inherit his realm? You can do that.Want to start as a Hindu Indian raja and expand all the way to the Mediterranean while crushing the Arab Empire? You can do that.Want to be an ambitious Norse pagan in Scandinavia who amasses enough men to conquer Britain and impose the worship of Odin on all of Europe? You can do that too.Want to be a Zoroastrian prince in the Asian steppes who marries the princess of another khan but also has a b:astard son he got with his own sister? Guess what? Fair game. Before said description drives you to buy everything, be forewarned. 1.If this is your first grand strategy game, you have a bit of a steep learning curve in the beginning that, once surpassed, simply makes the game ""click"".  I absolutely recommend a must watch tutorial by Arumba on Youtube that does a far better job explaining stuff than the otherwise solid in game tutorial. You also might want to start as an Irish count in 1066 to get a hang of the game mechanics. 2. The base game has come a long way since launch and you can have a solid amount of fun with just it in your library. But the meat of the game and the huge range of choices is locked behind DLC. That wouldn't be too much of an issue if there weren't so many of them. I would absolutely not recommend paying full price for everything - sales are your friends as they usually group a bunch of DLC together for a fair price. You also don't need many of the flavour DLC. If you do buy the base game and decide to get the DLC gradually and later, for the safety of your wallet and for the biggest wealth of content, two are a must and are not expensive in sales - Sword of Islam and the Old Gods. Both unlock previously unplayable factions (aside from India) and Old Gods gives you an earlier starting date in the 9th century which many consider the best one (I tend to agree as Charlemaigne, while starting even earlier, isn't well balanced or pretty to look at). The rest you will get will be mostly based on your interests as each expansion tends to target one group of factions and mechanics.If you do have all or most of its content, you might agree with me that this is the most content packed and interesting role playing experience you have or will play in a long time. Simply for the amount of fun, investment and character immersion it is as of now my absolute favorite game of all time, faults and all. If the two points above don't scare you off, give it a chance and you will be heavily rewarded. What is more, the game is probably the best intro to grand strategy games you can find. Europa Universalis IV is another game from the same developer focusing on the Early Modern Era and it has an interesting feature where you can continue your CKII saves in a new time period, potentially making your game last for over 1000 in game years.Join in and welcome to CKII! Deus Vult!			",42,7,0,15,1,0,11

												It's just awesome!This is one of the best game I've ever played so far. It's a strategy game in real time with the pause button :-)It's a sandbox game though there aren't specific targets, but you have to set your own goals, but you'll find yourself reviewing them continously adapting your strategy to either planned or unexpected events.In the game it's well represented the feudal system of the middle age, though you can start playing as Count, Duke, King or Emperor and therefore ramp up and grow your domain size caring about relationships within your own realm, your vassals and the court members, but also building alliances with other rulers via weddings.When you start a new campaign, you pick a ruler between 1066 and 1421 (Christians in vanilla, other rulers unlockable via DLCs like muslims, sea republics and pagans) and the target is to make your dinasty becoming more and more powerful. It's possible to start from 867 with ""The Old Gods"" DLC.You're noble then you should manage only castles or county having a castle in the capital (you could play as mayor if you have The Republics DLC).There are 3 types of character in the game nobles, religious and mayors which manage different types of holding and contribute to their liege's economy and armies in different ways. You can't have under your direct control all your lands, because any ruler has a limited number of holdings (demesne limit), beyond that you get huge penalty in relationships. You can earn other titles in many ways: you can inherit some lands if you're the heir of the relative title;you can speed up when this happens via plotting or assassination of the title holder or why not all the line of succesion before of you;you can push claim raising war, or even fabricate some or use claims of your vassals or relatives to raise the war and expand your realm;or why not decide to have your own antipope, which you can install, therefore having a really thankful pope, and in some conditions it will be even your vassals.For catholics the pope plays an important role, because it can excomunicate you or others, call for crusades, conceding divorces or granting you possibility to invade and therefore seize some other title.The game has also elements from RPGs, indeed any characters has 5 skills: diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intrigue and learning. And many traits either phisical traits or behaviour ones.  You can try to change skills and traits via proactive actions (ambition and plotting) or via casual events.Each ruler has a council of 5 people which helps them with specific matters: chancellor for diplomacy, marshall for armies, steward for the finance, spymaster for the intrigues and court chapelan for religious issues.There are other aspects in the game like buildings, technology research and ... All of these can be done either in single player or mutiplayer!So I've just tried to mention the most important to give an idea of what game you'll play, you're advised that this game has a steep learning curve.I warmly suggest to read the manual, see some let's play and then expirementing, and look for advices, but once you start mastering the game you'll get all the satisfaction and you'll find yourself sinking hours playing without even notice it.

												Crusader Kings II.  If I could choose only one strategy game to bring with me to a lonely desert island it would be this one.  The amount of content is insane (with new content being offered every few months), the updates are frequent, and the game play itself is extremely deep and rewarding.  There are time when I get the urge to play and I refuse to allow myself to because I know that if I start up another game I'll be playing it for the vast majority of my free time for the next several weeks.The game has so much to it that I couldn't even begin to do it justice without writing a ten page paper so I'll leave it at this: if you're a fan of strategy games, get this one!

												I have played this game for over 400 hours. Expanded my Empire from one small Baltic tribe. Expanded real Baltic religion to nearly all north Europe. Then - wham! New patch! Patch which broke all game system. Technology points were all gone, vassal opinions were all gone or of some enourmous amounts. Prestige points, piety points, score points, all gone or of enourmous amounts too. Contacted Paradox, asked for help - got replay that game system changed becouse of the latest patch.Okey I thought to my self, scew these 400 hours or carefull planning and conquest. I will start anew, better Baltic Empire. Not to mention the pain with Viking leaders/founders of Kiev rus and Novgorod, which are imba, packed with stats like on uber steroids, but they also get a huge packs of army right from the start. So I had to defend from them. Plan my battle carefully. Picking a place and time. I beat them in first battle and made them retreat and then - wham! New mechanic - ""Shattered Retreat"".""Shattered Retreat""So that imba unber steroid packed doom ball just retreated and I had to chase them all the way to their lands. Till I got to them, they have already recovered in morale and received reinforcements. I nearly lost that other battle. And it happened again - they just made Shattered Retreat again! And again I had to run around threw all the map just to get into same doom ball with full morale and reinforcements! But by that time my vassals were mad at me because I took their armies for too long and my gold account was empty.I have bought nearly all DLCs for this game. It's roughtly 250 EUROs and I get this, Paradox?!So this is what you developed all this time using your player community money, Paradox?!I am stating very clearly for the new commers - DONT BUY THIS GAME !!! You will be scewed up time after time and after time.Shattered Retreat mechanic was a last nail into the coffin that I am putting this game into, Paradox. You failed miserable... just pathetic.EDIT No.1: Tried to find some solution to this ""Shattered Retreat"" crap. Looked all over the internet: Reddit forums, Paradox forums, YouTube, etc. The only working solution I found was on Steam Workshop mod called ""Normal Retreat"".But guess what?! After activating it, my savefile Ironmode got corrupted. This means I can't do/complete any game achievements! Well done Paradox! I tried a new game, same thing! Well done, Paradox!!! Standing ovations!Looks like Total War games from now on.			",37,6,0,9,4,1,17

												Where to begin.. I'll begin with the bad. This developer is probably the most guilty of nickle and diming it's customers for DLC. Just look at the price tag of this game 159 USD?? I'm sorry, but no game no matter how good it may or may not be is not worth such a price tag.  So, no I would never recomend this game, nor any game made by Paradox due to it's policy of overpricing, and diving small bits and bobs they've released later after the initial release of the game when they should have bundled most of the dlc available into a proper expansion pack as an honest game developer would instead of taking advantage of the consumer.                    The base game is good enough, the graphics aren't great but not everyone is worried about that. It's good strategy fun but at such a price, no. Do not buy this game, it's only driving prices for our games higher and higher, its bad for the industry and even worse for the consumer.			",4,6,1,13,3,0,6

												I would have recommended this game right until the most recent patch. Expanding into an empire becomes nearly impossible as you try and fight off the entire planet in a holy war for one county.The recently added coalition feature might not be a bad idea but its implementantion is appalling. After pressing your claims on a neighbouring area (be that be a county, duchy or kingdom) you find yourself in a similar situation as 1938 Nazi germany. The whole world hates you and is ready to start a world war at a moments notice. The pope will join muslims and pagans alike in this global war against you (despite the fact you are a devout christian) and you will soon find yourself fighting on 4000 fronts at once in a war for a SINGLE province. Rather silly.Do not buy this game in its current state.			",84,5,0,12,4,0,4

												I've only played this game for a little bit, but it's definitely fun every now and then. You absolutely won't find yourself playing for hours straight on the weekend or a day off when you thought you were only going to play for an hour at most. I've never felt the desire to cancel on plans or dates with other people due to intriguing events occuring in my realm. Realisstically speaking, this game has some replayability, and though it isn't addictive to the point you actively avoid sleeping, it's still an engrossing game.Oh and you should absolutely buy the DLC when it comes out, and not when it's on sale. Paradox is extremely fair with their DLC prices and you'll never look at the 6 million DLCs and think ""wow, don't you think that's a bit much for that little content?""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just started playing CK2 and cannot believe how much I've been missing over the years.  I love history. I love strategy games.  And I love roleplaying.  This game scratches every itch that I have as a result of those fascinations.  And it's the only game that I have ever played that can do that.This game tells a story unlike any other game that I've ever played - while also providing a good dose of strategy and challenge. Admittedly, due to the extensive amount of information provided, it requires a good bit of imagination to keep up with the story - but the game comes in at just the right level of abstraction so that new things can happen every game.  Paradox clearly understands emergent gameplay - which so many modern developers fail to understand.I own the vast majority of DLC and do not mind purchasing it.  If this keeps the game relevant and growing, then keep it coming.  I do not expect developers to work for me for free after I buy their initial product.  (Plus, many of the free patches added so much to the game by themselves.  Negative reviews seem to ignore this fact.) Anyways, I've been gaming for over 30 years and have not encountered a phenomenon like CK2 before.Count me in for as long as the developers keep pushing this wonderful game forward.

												Was playing online with friend. Seduced friends wife but got caught in the act. Friend castrated me as a punishment. 10/10 would give friends wife syphilis again.It should be called Walder Frey simulator 2014. Seriously everyone seems to get assassinated at weddings, your spy master is constantly telling you that people are homosexual and you should execute them, your wife is trying to kill you for no reason at all, your 4 year old daughter is married to a 62 year old dwarf from northern Africa, everyone is in incestuous relationships, and you have no idea what is going on. 10/10 game!At first a lot of people are put off by the presentation of this game (those who don't play Paradox Grand Strategy Games that is). The closest the majority of gamers (apologies for the generalisation) have gotten to a strategy game is Total War, Age of Empires or Civilisation; games that keep their audiences interested by dumbing down the complexities and keeping audiences hooked with visual entertainment through battle sequences (Please note, I am not criticising; I am a huge fan of these games).CK2 on the other hand is a colourful map, on first viewing, at best. This is a game that, at first glance - and I'm extending that time period out to your first 2-4 hours with it - seems like a cold, number-driven strategy game. Something only grognards can enjoy, in between tabletop wargame sessions and forum arguments over the finer points of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.And to be fair to first glances, it is. This is a Paradox grand strategy game, one that doesn't just crunch numbers, it grinds them to dust, sprinkles them across 11,715 buttons and menu options and feasts on them. It's an intimidating game to come to grips with, in no small part because Paradox are so terrible at tutorials, and almost as bad at creating intuitive user interfaces.Stick with it, though, and my. Oh my. What begins as a blind exercise in clicking things and getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked all over Europe slowly begins to blossom. You start to realise what those little ""lustful"" and ""deceitful"" character traits on every character mean. You realise that the marriage system is an entire mechanic built into the game, not some pointless piece of window dressing. It clicks that, outside you own little fiefdom, the game is populated by every single noble, religious figure and courtier across Europe (and most of the Middle East).In short, you realise that this isn't a game about war, or empires, or money, or some pre-anointed goal you must achieve to be the ""winner"".It's a game about people. And the relationships between them.So why is it so addicting? That's simple, because it's the only game to have ever been developed (successfully) that's about sex and politics.Most others are about killing. And don't get me wrong, as head of a medieval dynasty, there will be the blood of thousands on your hands when your game is done.But in Crusader Kings II, unlike most other games - its strategy brethren especially - the wholesale murder of your enemies is but a sideshow. A diversion. The hammer you break out when all other approaches to victory have failed.You don't play Crusader Kings II as some disembodied hand, guiding the fate of a people. You play as, literally, a character within the world, part of a medieval dynasty. You can marry. Have kids. Send them off to be educated. Educate them yourself. Choose your own council. Assassinate people. Arrest people. Chop the head off the people you arrested. Arrest their kids, who revolt after you chopped their father's head off. Ask the Pope to excommunicate them. Arrange your kid's marriages. You can even invite people over for dinner.Every time you do one of these things, your relationships with people change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. They'll remember your past betrayals, and respect your past achievements. So aside from juggling the economy and the military of a Kingdom, you'll be spending as much (if not more) of your time juggling politics.And it's amazing. It's not until you're knee-deep in♥♥♥♥♥kissing and horse-trading (well, daughter-trading) that you realise, in all likelihood, you've never done something like this before. At least not something like this that works. And it really does work. Sure, it's based on numbers - quite literally, with each character screen giving you two numerical values, one reflecting another's opinion of you, the other, your opinion of them - but those numbers are just the game's way of communicating the complexity of the relationships, and you soon overlook them, reading past the values and seeing the overall feelings and sentiments driving them.From the mightiest empire to the lowliest county, you'll need to keep tabs on those closest to you, lest someone sneak in one night and poison you. Or stab you. Either or. If they do, well, it's game over.Oh, wait, it's not. Because this is Crusader Kings II we're talking about here, and it's smarter than that.When I said you're playing as part of a dynasty, that was only partially true. You are, but you're actually in control of the dynasty itself. So when your first character dies, provided they have a dynastic heir - whether that be a child or close family member - you take over as them, assuming control of not only a new character, but all their own personality traits, history, family and, most important of all, relationships.Say you're the King of England. You're loved in all corners of the land. But then, one day, you fall from your horse and are suddenly killed. Your son takes over, you think everything is gravy, but then... oh dear. Turns out your son is a homosexual, something jealous enemies can blackmail him (well, you, now) over. You're a coward. A weak ruler. Your wife, probably because of the whole sexual orientation thing, won't give you heirs.Before you know it, a once-happy Kingdom is in turmoil as power-hungry nobles attempt to overthrow you. You scrape your armies together, begin to crush the rebellion, advance on the final enemy, and then... you're killed on the battlefield. Your combat statistics weren't as good as your dad's, you see. You take control of your sole heir (who you suspected was someone else's kid anyway, since he was born while you were off fighting), a kid whose regent is even more incompetent than the last King, and before you know it, the throne is lost. You've gone from control of one of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe to lording it over a few crummy towns.This should be game over. Or at least the point where you chuck it in, realising that there's no hope of victory from here. Only... remember, there is no victory. And there's 400 years of history to play through. It's entirely possible - and I know, because I've done it - to go from a King to a nobody and back to a King again in a few hundred years, courtesy of a slow and methodical game of revenge, of marrying the right people, cutting the right people's throats, climbing your way slowly up the ladder of political power.That scenario I just described? With heroism, tragedy, intrigue and scandal? It's just one story. From one game. In a complete playthrough of 400 years of European history, from the Norman invasion of England through to the 15th century, you'll encounter dozens more. Start your next game, even if it's in the exact same place, and it'll be a whole new experience. Start it somewhere else on the map and it'll be even more different still.The clashes of armies are just as important as clashes in the court or the bedroom, and by pinning a grand strategy game on your relationships with people, Crusader Kings II does just as good a job as George R R Martin has.Happy gaming!

												At first the DLC expansions sounded like a good idea.Then they started breeding faster than the Zerg.I stopped playing the game altogether because it always feels incomplete since I can't afford to buy all the (gameplay) DLCs at the rate they are putting them out.To top things off, Paradox stopped putting DLCs on a 75% off discount, and you can hope for 66% at most. Doesn't sound like much of a difference, but hey, 1000x 1 euro is a lot.Unless the publisher puts out a DLC bundle (which gives you a discount based on how much DLCs you already have) I'll probably never play this again.Whew, managed to go throught the review without comparing them to EA and Ubisoft.

												Feels great when you're playing as the King of Abyssinia and Nubia but need the kingdom of Egypt to create the Abyssinian Empire and you set up the proper marriages and your heir inherits the Byzantine Empire from your wife and your heir's heir likewise inherits the French Empire, allowing the expansion of the rightful world Empire of Great Abyssinia, stretching from Iceland to Sri Lanka.  Next game, you play as a Croatian duke and grow to take over basically everything from the Greek borders to Northwestern Spain, becoming the most powerful man in the Byzantine Empire (despite not actually being the emperor) and eventually declare independence because these ""laws"" are for lesser men.Next game, you decide to change it up and play the Game of Thrones mod and play as the Reynes of Castamere and see if you can beat the mighty Lannisters (instead of having Tywin wipe out your entire house).  After years of carefully setting up marriage alliances, you realize you may have overdone it as the combined armies of the North, the Riverlands, the Reach, and Dorne all join you to defeat the Lannisters.  But hey, as long as you have alliances with all but two of the Lords Paramount of Westeros, why not just take the Iron Throne and rule them all?Oh, don't forget the incest, murder, and seduction for seduction's sake!

												So right out the gate: Crusader Kings II is a good game. It's got scope and range in spades. The kind that you can get lost in for a dozen hours, whatever kind of gamer you might be. The mechanics are pretty versatile, fitting the sort of playthrough you're looking for. If you're one of those gamey, tournament-style players and you just 'have' to minmax to take over half the world before that turn of the century... the tools are there. More power to you.There's also some meat in here for us slow rolling guys. Come up with a neat historical premise and work it through to completion. Or get caught out and castrated by angry rivals. It's your oyster.There's also a whole lot of story going on in this completely emergent simulation. If you're like me and the thought of creating your own alternate histories gets your rocks off, then you're in luck because CKII has by far the most in-depth alt-history game out there. One start date you can create a lasting Catholic Kingdom from within the belly of the Byzantine Empire... another you can fight off William the Conqueror and retain a truly Anglo-Saxon England... or maybe you want play as Poland and take a lesson from your Slavo-Russian cousins and carve an Empire out of the Holy Roman one... Pretty grand stuff and damned rewarding in their own right. The roleplay elements are pretty slick too. The characters you play as (Moreover, their dynastic line) can get as convoluted and involved as your HBO fantasy series. The cool thing about CKII's minimalist style is that it reads a lot like a book, painting a picture in your head of vast fleets of ships and clashing armies. You start to root for these little characters as you aim for a lasting Kingdom/Empire of their very own.But this segues neatly into the game's major shortcoming. If you want a fuller experience, you'll almost HAVE to dig into DLC. It's how Paradox operates. My advice? Your best bet is to take a look at which packs are on offer and nab the ones you can see yourself getting into. Myself, I immediately went for The Old Gods expansion because I'm nuts for Vikings. As you expand your repertoire with the game, you'll know exactly where to branch out. (I also suggest getting Charlemagne if you want the ability to create your own 'original' 'new' kingdoms: like any good Alternate History buff would wanna do) It almost goes without saying that you should wait for a Steam sale if you don't want to fork over your life's savings.In the end, Crusader Kings II is far and away one of the best strategy games on the market. It's also a gateway drug for learning more about medieval history. You'll get to know everything from the Mongols to the Magyars like the back of your hand. Impress all the folks with your grasp of that sort of worldly stuff.Like I said, it's broad. You can dig into this one for 400 hours and still be surprised by the next hundred. Thumb is up.

Posted: December 28, 2015
												This game's learning curve is not just steep... the tutorial is garbage and only slightly grazes the major aspects of the game (it doesn't go into any of the in-depth mechanics that the game so notably advertises about, and it definetly doesn't do a good job at teaching how to play).I play all genres of games and am used to learning strange and odd game mechanics.  I am 30 years old and have been gaming since the original Atari console.  When I read reviews about this game I wasn't phased by everyone saying the learning curve was steep.  I have owned mostly every major game console released, as well as have played a few years worth of game hours in PC games.  On top of that, I have played dungeons and dragons (the dice version with a DM/GM), I have played text-based games such as the original kings quest... I have played many board games, book games, card games... etc... What I am trying to allude to is that I am an experienced gamer with above-average technical and troubleshooting abilities; usually I am the one my friends go to when they need help with figuring something out.I have spent close to 3 hours in the game and still feel I have no control over what is going on within the game, nor do I feel I have a solid grasp on how to gain control over what is going on within the game.  I understand not being able to just pick up a game and master it... but 3 hours is too long to spend in a game to still be constantly feeling at a loss in trying to do something and not being able to do it.  I can play the game, but I in-no-way enjoy constantly feeling frustrated because I'm trying to do something that I can not do.I no longer have the time I had when I was younger to play games, so when I play a game, I want to enjoy it.  I feel I would need to invest a minimum of 10 hours into this game, just to have a solid grasp on how to play it.  That is too much for me, considering most modern non-rpg games can be beaten in less than 10 game-hours.I'm not saying I'm not willing to invest hours into a game, as I've invested close to 120 game-hours into some of my games... but I have searched for more reviews and people, like me, have also had major difficulties in understanding how to manipulate the game (even when some people who are experienced in playing the game helping them).For me... with the horrible tutorial... the insanely large amount of ""buy in"" time required to learn the game... this game just isn't worth it.  There are many easier-to-play and more in-depth games out there similar to this.			",21,2,0,11,0,0,2

												TL;DR: Crusader Kings II takes a long time to learn, so don't buy it expecting it to be something you can just jump into unless you play a lot of strategy or Paradox titles. If you have a lot of time to kill, are imaginative, and love character oriented games then this will probably be a good fit for you. There is a wide range of mechanics from choosing a spouse to trying to assassinate anyone (in the entire game, no essential characters). The DLC isn't as money-grubbing as it may appear at a glance. Not all the DLC may fit any one person's preferences, so I recommend researching what the expansions are and what they contain. I approve of this game!   Crusader Kings II is the game that I absolutely must review (133 hours and growing playtime). I will do my best to remain impartial throughout this review and to address the game as it is, while offering some opinions on things such as DLC, despite being somewhat biased. The game is rather difficult to learn at first, so if you are not a patient person or do not have the time to learn the game and want something you can just jump into, then Crusader Kings II probably isn't the game for you (it took me 8 hours to learn how to play).  On the other hand, if you like strategy titles, participating in assassination plots, conquering lands and have a lot of time to kill, then this might be a game that you'll enjoy. For the most part, I think Crusader Kings II has something to offer everyone, even the strategically challenged (like me. I'm awful at this game and therefore use console commands, but it doesn't hamper my enjoyment at all). At it's core, Crusader Kings II is more about the characters than conquering everything. Indeed, the game ends at a certain date (1453) rather than when everything is under one's thumb or certain conditions are met (excluding the date being reached). Characters have their own randomized events (often fun and quirky) that can shape their stats and relationships with each other. Events can range from having an affair to being possessed. Some events have choices, while others do not. In addition to events and the obvious fighting, there are also plots which allow you to do things like try and arrange someone's death through assassination, go on hunts, or hold a feast. I know I'm really starting to beat a dead horse here, but nearly everyone that has played multiple games of Crusader Kings II has that ONE character that sticks in their mind (mine was a guy that adopted a cat, lost an arm in battle, held a massive funeral for said cat when it passed of old age, and then died of an infection shortly after the cat's funeral). The characters of the player's and game engine's creation are something so wonderful.Some other mechanics include: Marriage (anyone of opposite gender can be married if conditions are met), Lovers (same-sex or otherwise), dungeons with prisoners that can be executed, ransomed, or released, fabricating claims on land to go to war, going to war, hiring mercenaries, converting areas to your religion, and whatever mods may add. The mod community for this game is really awesome, variety-filled and big!  One thing that I rather dislike, but makes sense, is that you have to have a Casus Belli (cause for war) to be able to declare war and go out to fight. This is either achieved by being of a certain culture, having differing religions, or a claim (fabricated or legitimate). On the bright side, this does prevent the AI from ganging up on you.Something rather off putting to a newcomer of the game, at least it was to me, is the large number of DLC. Most of the DLC is cosmetic in nature, while a few do add some changes to the game (improvements or otherwise, I'm looking at you Conclave). The really neat thing, in my opinion, about   the DLC that adds functions is that some of those functions are patched into the game for free. One such example would be India's landmass was patched into the game for free so that players may fight and conquer India, but to play as an Indian you must own the DLC. In terms of which DLC to buy, I'd say use the search engine of your choice, figure out what the expansions are, and then what they contain (if that strikes your fancy, of course). I will say that while amazing, I don't feel the DLC are necessary and that the base game provides more than enough entertainment, but they certainly are fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. The systems and mechanics seem to be balanced perfectly for emergent narrative. While the strategy is awesome, I find the best part of this game is the stories that develop from those systems.The depth is amazing. I’ve played over 100 hours now and have only really played one full game, and 2 half games. My first Ironman game (no loading saves) I started as Denmark. I managed gained Norway, but lost it despite assassinating tens of people in the succession line ahead of my heir. I made inroads into Sweden before taking it entirely (after the then King got taken down by a mercenary army), then married my way onto the throne of Lotharingia and used my new power to take Pomerania - in the process becoming the most powerful ruler in the Holy Roman Empire. I demanded independence from the Holy Roman Emperor who buckled before me, splitting the Empire in two. I basked in glory for several decades (holding several feasts and tournaments) before a massive continental war spanning over ten years, during which my successor lost control of Lotharingia and Pomerania. Once the dust cleared, I had to settle for being Queen of Sweden and Denmark. But you don't mind stuff like that happening - playing a count or a duke can be as much fun (and way less stressful) than being a King or an Emperor. I held onto those two kingdoms while gaining Finland, before marrying the Kaiserin of the Holy Roman Empire! Everything was coming up Chris, but then she sadly died in childbirth - leaving my son as the Kaiser. Comparisons to game of thrones in game form are not far off, in fact there is a mod (I haven't tried) and like GOT there is absolutely no guarantees of a happy ending. In my game I managed to become the Kaiser and clung grimly to the throne until the end of the game. All that in just one game - and I haven't even got the latest expansion yet, which adds India. The multiplayer is great too, playing with a friend means you can work together and there is someone there to enjoy the narrative with you, and leads you to great stuff like marrying your buddy (in the game) and then cheating on them. Or making them your Master of the Hunt. One complaint would be the learning curve, in that I had no idea what I was doing for the first 20 or so hours. Also periods (years sometimes) can go by with not a lot happening, but I just speed it up in those instances. Once you invest 25 or so hours into learning the game, the rewards are amazing.

												Starting as Byzantine Emperor in the Viking Age in Ironman mode, I promptly began fighting off the Muslims on the border of my Empire and reclaimed several small islands. Given my huge income of 100+ gold from all my vassals, I decided to upgrade Constantinople and many of my holdings. Hours later, I mended the Great Schism by conquering Holy Lands and declaring them mine. Most of Europe became Orthodox and I removed the Pope from his seat, leaving no Christian rulers. I was then known as ""The Saint"", and gave birth to a long line of Byzantine Emperors who ruled with iron fists, seeking to return the Legacy of Rome.After years of crusading and aggressive expansion into Italy and the Middle East, I reclaimed the old Roman Borders. The Roman Empire was once more established, but Rome was not done. All the land from Constantinople to Egypt, Egypt to Spain, Spain to France, Germany, parts of Russia, and all of Scandinavia were to be conquered. I gained the S.P.Q.R achievement for restoring all that belonged to Rome and more. Much of the Middle East was conquered and pushed back. With an income of 500+ gold a month and trading posts spanning around the entire Empire, I was set.Until it all changed, the Golden Horde formed and attacked me after I just finished off the 10th civil war to lower crown authority. The Khan stole a great chunk of land, and I was seriously low on man power. The Golden Horde continued to push foward, while my army was busy fighting off civil wars and religious rises. I finally managed to win my civil wars, and was left with a few years time to rebuild my army. 600K+ troops later with a personal levy of 80K retinues, I took back what was mine and destroyed the Golden Horde. With less than 30 years left until end game, I was looking forward to saying I conquered most of the world without cheating. Yeah, not so much. My cousin forms the Kingdom of France and fights for independance, and somehow most of my Empire flocks towards him to rebel against me. My army is cut in half, and I am busy trying to fend off France while also being attacked by mysterious figures that start assassinating my bloodline. I eventually murder all of my cousins children, excommunicate him, and then murder him. I am victorious, the Great Emperor Buoso II. Little did I know, I had a falling out with the rest of my bloodline for killing a family member. My title is usurped, and I am forced to watch as my Uncle begins to lose Kingdoms worth of land to vassals rebelling against their liege. I assassinate him and try to marry my child into power, but before I can do that his son is also killed by that mysterious assassin. This leaves no rightful hier to the Empire of Rome, and it splits apart again.Every duchy, county, kingdom, and what have you in the entire world splits up into over 500+ independant states. Everyone starts fighting for power, and I sit there having just lost a game I spent over 50+ hours on. My jaw drops. My computer couldn't handle the entire world fighting and I eventually just gave up on that game. Crusader Kings II can change in the blink of an eye.10/10. I'd play that♥♥♥♥♥♥again.I have some pictures here (not of my final result, but showing much of the progress).http://i.imgur.com/2I9JmLT.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/REBviYv.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/5nLhLny.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/pYaMvOg.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/UHs9d9a.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Xcqa26M.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Iy0Tsj8.jpg?1 ",28,2,0,2,5,0,2

												The title Crusader Kings 2 falls under the so-called grand-strategy games. The term is well-earned in this case and before you start the game be warned that there is a steep learning curve. Do not pick up this game if long-winded games that requires hours of hours to finish is not your thing. Do pick it up if you like games like Civilization, Alpha Centauri, or Europe Universalis. Having said that, and perhaps you do not know these titles, lets get into what Crusader Kings 2 actually is.Like all grand-strategy games Crusader Kings 2 is (but need not be, I will get back to this) for instance about creating a dukedom, kingdom, or empire, keeping those under you happy less they revolt, and creating a proper army. Unlike many other grand strategy games (outside of other Paradox titles) this game is actually historically correct for medieval europe, the middle east, and India. That is right, did you ever want to play as William the Conquerer? This game gives you that opportunity.That immediatly leads to 'need not be' clasule I said before. Unlike other grand strategy games you do not play a 'faction' or a 'nation', but you play as an individuel e.g. Ghengis Khan. The game doesn't end when you die, however, no it follows the rise (and fall) of your family as your dominion grows on the map. Depending on your succesion laws you might be playing as your oldest, youngest, or even a random family member. You might even go super modern and have daughters rule on purpose, not 'just because' the male line ended as was more the case in the time period between 769-1452 AD (which how long the games played out assuming you have two DLCs).The game features cultures (e.g. German, Anglo-Saxon, Berber, Russian, Visigothic, and Tamil) as well as religions (e.g. Hindu, Catholic, Coptic, Karasite, Tengri, Sunni, and Germanic) and this including with recently conquered, traits of a person, your history with them perhaps, can all influence what people think of you. Wil you marry out a daughter for an alliance, or perhaps with that genius of a man so you can get him to court and get a good advisor? This is all dependent upon you.Thanks to all these features, as well as the fact that once the game starts randomness kicks in and the historical accurate timeline is lost, means that you will never(!) play the same game ever again. Mechanics wise yes, but give it enough time and the map will look quiet different from last time, different kings and emperors, and perhaps e.g. the Byzantine empire might have fallen by 1100. What will you do? How will you influence medieval Europe? I say it is time to find out and play Crusader Kings 2 for yourself.			",16,8,0,12,4,1,3

												Crusader Kings II is a great starting point for anyone who's been looking to get into the grand strategy genre but has been overwhelmed by Paradox's previous titles. Fairly easy to learn, and with all the gameplay improvement and alternative history mods, you'll get plenty of time for your money.As someone who's played over 500 hours in Deus Vult, I did find it a little disappointing that Ck2 didn't inflict the same amount of ungodly punishment that the previous games did; One of the best experiences in Deus Vult was getting beat down constantly and getting back up, but I'll be the first to admit it was probably for the best. Ironman is a very interesting feature that suffers slightly from the constant autosaving disrupting gameplay, but this may not be such a big issue if you have a good computer that autosaves quickly.Now one major concern is the unending horde of DLC. I really don't approve of the direction Paradox Interactive is going with their DLC for Ck2, paying for historical dynasty shields? Ehhhh.The game is priced at $40To get all the major DLC's (Expansions) alone costs $55As It stands, CK2 is not worth buying full price. Wait for a sale where the collection is 75% off and grab it.

												Backstab, fight, talk and murder your way to victory.Wow, just wow. Another hit title by Paradox, an almost certain must buy! Launch yourself into an immersive, and ever changing campaign, spanning over 500 years (providing you have the Old Gods DLC). Ever wanted to be King of England? Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire? Or simply wanted to be a low-lying Baron? Look no further, Crusader Kings II is for you! Crusader Kings II is certainly one of the best Paradox games out there, with a whole new gameplay interface. If games like Victoria II and Europa annoyed you because the lack of character interaction, Crusader Kings II is perfect to settle that fetish of yours.Dive into the famous Godwin family in 1066, and try fight of the Norse hordes, and the Norman aggressors, or make your own House (with the ruler designer DLC), and help it rise into the anals of history. CKII has an in-depth system of character interaction, where you can do anything from sending them a gift, assassinating them, offering them vassalage, or organising a marrage, anything is possible in CkII.Buy this game, all it's DLCs, and get lost in the (almost) never-ending and ever-changing campaign, which will get you hooked from day 1, to the end-day.Enjoy!

												This game is awesome. Start out as a little guy in Ireland and become the Emperor of the British Isles, and then lose it all in a generation and you're a count again. Except this time you're a count somewhere in Germany because on a previous character you married some German count's daughter, and he had a feud with someone who murdered all of his sons and you ended up inheriting it. Well now I guess you're in Germany so you start all over again. You fabricate some claims, and invite some claimants and land them, allowing you to take land for them that will be added to your overall realm. Eventually you're big enough and you've bribed enough people that you manage to get yourself elected Holy Roman Empire. Now the might of the Reich is going to go down upon that upstart Duke who thought he could overthrow you as Emperor of Britain.Every game can be this interesting. Try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best grand strategy games of all times. When CK II appeared on steam was pretty much sceptical about it, but when i started to watch Northernlion's LP series i was into this game. CK II is not easy strategy game, however learning curve is quite interesting, and only will learn by trial and error as it requires to be patience. Learn to manage your county. Succeeded? Now it's time to rule as Duke or Duchess. Try plotting, scheming, bribing. Change your succession law and crown authority. Slay anyone who stands against Catholic religion, start Holy war against heretics and expand your realm.As for multiplayer, it is great feature because it allows you to play with friends and do whatever you want either coop till end of time or play against each other.Score: 10/10.

												-Plays multiplayer as king of Denmark with a buddy as king of Sweden. We unite Scandinavia and reform the faith. I basically become the Pagan Pope.-The King of both France and Germany (Charlemagne's empire before the creation of Holy Roman Empire) dies... last and only heir is a guy exiled in muslim Spain who converted to Allah.-King of France and germany is now muslim zealot, refuses to convert to christianity, forces most aristocrats to convert to Islam and uses them to convert the people too.-Allies himself with Muslim Spain and proclaims Jihad after Jihad on us because the Pagan holy sites we captured used to be Frankish lands. Muslims form the most powerful alliance in Europa. We hold our ground, losing and taking back Saxon lands. We pillage neighbouring lands to invest into the army when the onslaught begins anew.-Catholic brits and italians send crusade after crusade to try and retake Catholic lands to no avail. They slow the Andalus down but they keep coming to die in the frozen wastes... It has been 5 Jihads now. Around 20.000/30.000 soldiers thrown at us...EACH TIME.-We manage incredible victories due to clever strategy. We counter-attack with our own holy wars because they cannot declare war on us at their leisure during truce. I take the lands of Flanders. My friend takes Germany, I crown him Emperor of the Germanic people, bulwark of the faith.-Most of France is converted now. The holy wars still rage on, though the muslim threat is being contained by a clever use of Pagan and Christian Holy wars during muslim internal struggles in order to even the odds.-The last king of Italy dies and the Byzantine Emperor inherits the title. A new challenger joins the fray. Stronger than ever. Catholic Aquitaine revolts and with our indirect help, becomes independent.-Yet it does not end... I can already hear the warcry of the faithful heathens coming to spill our blood. Allahu Ackbar... Allahu Ackbar...Ragnarok, the end times, are coming and it's symbol is a golden crescent.10/10 Would create nightmarish dystopian far-right propaganda by accident again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thought I'd do a proper review of this game because there are none, most are just an event description or part of someones playthrough with no information about the actual game. Or something lame like ""best game ever played. the end"" Thanks for the really helpful info guys.This is a grand strategy game similar to classics like Civilization. It's set during the Middle Ages to the High Middle Ages. You take control of (or create your own) dynasty/family and try to survive. How does it play? Slowly... very slowly.The game is essentially just a huge map with a few single soldiers dotted about representing armies. You have a few menu's with options such as changing laws (which you have to wait for 10 years to change) and there is your council who can do a few things on the map such as fabricate claims, train troops, plot etc.Conquest is not easy especially if you're catholic, as its full of realistic mechanics such as the pope in his pointy hat telling you ya can't invade good christians willy nilly. But these mechanics and the random events that pop up are what make the game shine, it makes it a much more realistic and satisfying experience and some are just plain funny but they do need to be made more flexible to make the game more playable. In order to conquer someone you need to justify it, so for example you could have your son marry a local lords daughter and when they have children they will have a claim to the lords land, that's the 3rd generation! So you spend a lot of time waiting around for events to pop up and people to do the things you assign them to, building up armies, waiting to get pregnant, waiting for the children to grow up, waiting for someone to kill the other heir ect.It's like a song of ice and fire or game of thrones the game (and not that telltale♥♥♥♥♥♥ this has real freedom to create the imbred zealot dwarf family of your dreams, pushing kids out of windows and capturing concubines, smothering babies and that classic poisoned wine, each playthrough tells a unique story (if the events randomly pop up) but its in a realistic medieval setting (no targaryens but theres a good mod out there), history buffs should enjoy this game, especially if you're into that particular part of history. But like I warned you everything takes a VERY long time to do and most of the time you are sitting twiddling your thumbs which some will find boring.I've played this game for well over 300 hours on and offline and I do like it, in fact it can be addictive and the soundtrack is great too but unfortunately Paradox are well aware of how much of a gem this game is and do an EA - The Sims franchise style dlc system where they sell you the game in chunks and each time they bring out a new DLC they update the base game to balance it out so if you don't have the DLC I would imagine this would alter gameplay in a negative way. But at least with those sims games you get actual content. But what is the DLC in this? Not much really, they just add new functionality to the game which affects game play a bit and they can be fun but you don't really get a lot for your money. The game is just a huge map with a few crude single soldiers representing an army, all adding functionality does is create a new sub menu or events which are just text, so really you shouldn't have to pay for them and they should be in a free update as they are just a few lines of code or maybe Paradox should finish the game with the holes filled... I mean with the DLC options included in the base game instead of behaving like subscribed early access but everything is about money so what do you expect, this is why I don't recommend this game. Sorry fanboys the truth hurts and not all of us have loads of money. Wait for a sale or until Paradox have bled it dry and everyones bored of it and pick it up at a more realistic price, this game is definitely NOT worth £122.99 (14/02/2017). If you cannot wait until then this game is not for you, it's all about waiting.			",61,5,1,17,9,0,1

To put it simply it is a ""what if"" game of devious backstabbing’s and marching armies with bloody family interactions. It has multiple flavors and paths to greatness and not all of them are killing your way to the top. The fact that you can change the history of Europe while truly caring what your customizable dynasty is plain awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a Kinslyer becasue my father was an a**hole. I started a plot, in which 15 others joined in my conspiracy. 12 poisionious snakes were procured (6 of which i bought myself because others could not, or would not).  My father died in a bed of slithering snakes on his honeymoon.  My heart went out to my father's new found wife so much that i married her that day. But the chambermaid discovered all 12 snakes and told everybody. Now half the people i ploted with are now ploting against me. That is why I am a kinslayer			",204,40,1,29,28,0,25

												Where do I start. This game is addictive as all hell. It is a pure character role play orientated game where you play generation from generation of your family throughout the dark ages with everything revolving around how YOU as the player mould your character and his/her successors. This does mean that a single playthrough from just 1066 to 1453 can take in the excess of sevral days.Have you ever wanted to play as a Spaniard with Russian culture who is a staunch believer of the Zoroastrian faith and conquer Germany? In this game, you can! That is just the tip off the iceberg of insanity. I have had a succession war with my 1st born son who was also the SPAWN OF SATAN, literally a hell baby.Now understand this game can be daunting to new players especially because there are no real good tutorials provided by the game. That is definitely a shortfall and has to be made up with Youtube tutorials or experienced friends who play the game. The other problem is how random some events can be which can royally screw over a fresh game. I wont go into details but I am sure many of my fellow players can recount situations the destroyed their games. Also It pretty much a requirement to get game mechanic DLC such as Old Gods and the Republic to get the most out of the game. That is the only real problems I can think of with the game. Otherwise its an excellent game with challenges and character driven role play. Fantastic modding community always re-inventing the game and extending the hours of life this game has. I don’t think this game can be adequately compared to any other just because how unique it is.I rate this game 11/10			",361,84,9,53,60,2,97

												Hello, thanks for buying this game. Would you like to start as a ruler you enjoy? Buy this DLC... Would you like to start in an earlier time period? Buy this DLC... Would you like to have a feature that should be included in this game? Buy this DLC... Want to be able to accomplish some of the achievements in the game? You must buy DLC... That's right, you can't even get 100% achievements without paying more!I just hate DLC driven games, it is criminal, I bought a shell of a game and now must pay more to make it more immersive.

												The best way to describe CK2 is with the stories you create. So here's a tale that happened a long time ago in the far away land of the domains of the Wendish Empire. Once upon a time, there was this Emperor of the Slavs, called Grozscon, who was a magnanimous person, a true born leader and a great military strategist. He arose to power in the age of 22, after his father and elder brother died in a battle against rebels.  At the age of 30, he already had conquered most part of the Holy Roman Empire, the Balkans, Scandinavia and most part of Russia. When he completed his 55, he started a great campaign to conquer England. In one of the battles, his youngest son, Dobieslaw, died. But that did not distracted the old emperor and finally the war was won.  As we grow old, our health start to fail us, and this was no different with Grozscon. He was diagnosed with leprosy, the purgatory in earth, so they say. And at the age of 81, the old emperor passed away, leaving 4 sons and 3 daughters.  Hir heir, Boleslaw, also had leprosy and was at the final stage of the disease and died with only 4 months of ruling. The Empire was in the hands of the grandson of the great emperor Grozscon, who was called Mieszko, The Effeminate, Duke of Silesia.   Mieszko was a poor ruler, a cruel and sloth person, which made him very unpopular with his vassals. Therefore, rebellions started to appear in every corner of the Wendish Empire, leading to great civil wars between Mieszko and his uncles. While the empire was in great chaos, the marvelous Empire of the Greeks flourished and grew strong and eventually took many provinces from the Wendish Empire. The Holy Roman Emperor, ever the opportunist, also invaded and at the last the Pope in Rome called for a Crusade against the Wendish Empire.    Mieszko now finds himself deposed, with only a count title in a god forsaken province and watches in despair as the Empire is thorn apart by endless wars and new rumours comes from the east, were a man controls many riders and conquers everything his set his eyes. 10/10 Would play again and kill all the sons except the perfect heir ",39,8,3,13,4,0,9

												I painstakingly micromanaged my first born son's education, choosing his educators and rotating them to ensure he got a well-rounded education.When he turned 16, his attributes were solid, particularly in martial. My warrior son will lead my empire into the next generation!Then, I saw that he was gay.Not a big deal. My gay warrior son will lead my empire into the next generation! So, I got him a wife, hopefully to make him forget men.It seemed to work. Just a while later he asked to join the Varingian Guard. I gave him my blessing. My gay warrior son will fight heathens and in killing them forget about men.Two years later he returned to me. He was blinded and castrated. My gay warrior son was now mutilated and a eunech. I ordered him to take his vows and he quietly lived out his years in a monastery without eyes or gonads.My second born son will lead my empire into the next generation!			",14,10,0,9,8,0,9

												This game is realy good. And, if you want, you can makes stories out of it. Like my 200 year gameplay as house Breizh (Kingdom of Brittany) A nice story, but i cant remember it good enough to tell it :(But you can make better stories, or create big country... or a little one. You can start big, you can start small. Maybe you are a vassal? or maybe you want to play in Westheros (GoT mod)? You can do it in this game. Just buy it... but be carefull.This game have one problem (besides occasional bugs) many DLC´s. You want to play as pagan? DLC! You want to play as a horde? DLC! You want to start game in earlier? DLC! You want to play as muslim? DLC! Republic? India? DLC!But not only big ones, i can understand those big ones. But things like, make african... their color (hope it sounds ok), or indians, arabs, franks, germans, norse, finns, russians, and so on and so on. Or MANY other things, as a DLC. But if you can buy it, or live without it, you gonna have a GOOD time.			",54,4,3,12,8,0,6

												I learned a lot of geography from this game and EU IV.Seriously, come trivia night, my geography is really on point. Capitals, country locations, rivers, I know that stuff.Which is nice.This may be the most complete and well rounded historical simulator available, and its mechanics are unique without being gimmicky. You see CK2 is about forging a dynasty, which is a fancy way of saying a rules heavy family. It's technically sandbox and you can have quite a bit of fun with it. You can roleplay as the traits that you have, or just try to make every character into Julius Caesar, or just keep assasinating popes, forever and ever. When your character dies, whether it be at 4 or 88, the play goes to the direct heir, whether he or she be 4 or 88, and you are given control over their decision making process. As long as your dynasty has not died out in terms of inheritance laws, and someone in your dynasty has a sufficient title the game will continue until it stops after maybe dozens or a hundred hours of game play. You manage titles under your realm. Count is the lowest, than Duchy, than King, than Emperor, with some variety on the names depending on your culture. The key here is feudalism, that is vassalage. The standard is to pledge fealty to someone of the next higher title, who then pledges fealty to the title above them. This standard is never reached unless you conquer the world and make it be reached. In general, there will be sovereign Dukes, Counts pledged directly to Kings, and Emperors often forgo vassal kings. You have advisers which are assigned from your court,  which is a pool of loyal or disloyal followers whom you can consider for various roles, and to accomplish various tasks. These advisers assist you in running the operations of your feifdom, and allow religious, educational, espionage, stewardship, and martial decisions. Each character has an RPG style stat for each of these, and these along with a portion of your wife's stats and your advisers stats creates the stats used in game for you.Key decisions in this game are marriage, and war. Marriage is the influence you have over your dynasty, and you can get good traits, titles, claims on titles, or political alliances in exchange for the matrimony. Wars allow you to cement alliances and shape the geopolitical landscape. There is much more to the game, as it has surprising complexity, but this is not to be a guide.The game is visually very appealing, despite largely being a giant map. The music is nice, and even after several hours you may not be bored. There is also a ton of DLC for this, for better or worse. These are largely all expansive on the game, and most will be on for most games. Some like the Sunset Invasion are cheesy alternative history which you likely will not want on at all times. There are an absurd number of starting rulers at any of a number of initial scenarios, and a bit of imagination makes all interactions fun as you write your own story of world history amongst the players who have interesting personalities derived from their traits. This game remains an absolute treasure, and is still updated from time to time.			",579,200,12,50,50,4,85

												As I'm coming closer to the 300 hour mark I think it's my obligation to honor this game with a short review.Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that just provide you with everything you personally ever wanted in a strategy game, though you never knew that you wanted that before you tried it out. How could I have known my weakness for arresting and torturing christian priests wandering the plains of Russia?Sure, getting started can be rough and frustrating, as the tutorial barely scratches the surface of the ocean of possibilities that is CK2. And even now, after burning more than an entire week of my precious life time with this game I still learn new mechanics and features every time.But once you understand the main aspects it's pretty easy getting completely absorbed in this medieval reality show where you are both director and protagonist.And after I fought the emperor in an open revolt, trapped him in the Alpes where his great army died of starvation, and then duelled him in personal combat on the highest mountain surrounded by thousands of frozen corpses, stroke him down with my Damascus Steel sword, spilled his blood on the snowy plains, and then took the emperor's crown from his dead, cold hands, while ... simultaneously seducing his wife - I knew I would love this game. If you also want to spend your nights creating your own historical BBC documentary I'm the last person to stop you.All you need is a strong imagination to fill the ugly text boxes with life and perhaps a full wallet if you intend to participate in their crazy DLC policy. Which I would only adivice you to do if you already know that you're addicted anyway.			",27,2,0,6,6,0,14

												While truly there are lots of things to enjoy about CK2, and everyone finds his own most favourite part in this game, I personally find the stories it creates the most exciting part about it. For example, this story happened just yesterday.One day my character was chilling in a carriage in his old family lands in Hungary when suddenly he was ambushed and taken prisoner by some weirdo in Brittany. The freak tortured my character with rats. What is worse, I had no money to buy my way out of the prison. At the same time, my lovely new wife became pregnant, and, for obvious reasons, this could not be my character's child. After the first daughter came the second and only then my unwitty spymaster uncovered that the weird guy and my unfaithful wife had an affair! Sadly, due to my liege's incompetency in managing the realm, my lands were constantly pillaged by vicious pagan tribes, leaving me with almost no income. Moreover, the regent that was installed to rule in my character's place was a nice and a charitable guy. He shared all of my petty income with the starving and underprivileged. He did not like my character either and never agreed to anything I have asked him to do. My poor character ended up in a dark and cold oubliette after his friend tried to rescue him and failed. He soon passed away, betrayed by everyone. He only needed 20 more gold coins to buy his way out...Soon after the news reached Hungary, king's brother was selected as the new king. Being an envious, lustful and ambitious fellow, he always found his brother's wife to be prettier and more attractive than his own. He immediately divorced and married the unfaithful widow. A few months later, the new king decided to relieve his stress by embarking on a carriage trip to his old family's lands, when suddenly they were stopped on a road by a group of french-speaking hoodlums...

												This is essentially Game Of Thrones: the game.In my first game, I played as an Irish ruler, and got him married to an English lady to cement an alliance, allowing me to begin a conquest of Ireland. My wife proceeded to bear me daughter after daughter, which due to the country's male inheritance laws left my vassals unhappy.Then, her father dies and she is left as his heir - she returns to her home county in England. Whilst there she bears two more daughters (seven in total now!), which seemed a bit off with me as how can she have my children when in another country?It emerges that she was sleeping with a local Bishop. I realise I need a new wife if I'm to ever have a male heir, yet I can't divorce her or I'll end up making enemies of the English. So, I start a plot to assassinate her.The very first person who offers their help with killing her? The bishop she was sleeping with! And he'll be most valuable, having lots of ""access"" to her! My plot is in motion!And then, said Bishop gets royally drunk and blabs about the entire thing to everyone, my wife is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone thinks I'm scum, and I have a troop of daughters at my ankles.Damn fun game, the emergent gameplay is outstanding.

												If you are buying this game, remember that you are not buying a complete product. You are buying a platform for DLCs which are the vast majority of the game. Paradox restricts you very tightly as to whom you can play, and when you can play, and what you can do if you do not buy hundreds of dollars of DLC. I personally think Paradox's DLC model on this is very unethical and would not reccomend this game to anybody who wanted a full game for a reasonable price. You can only play as western christian rulers from a relatively narrow timespan if you do not have dlc. Paradox seems to have gotten better with this, as EUIV has a DLC model that allows a full gameplay experience without DLC, but the DLC enhance it, but this is just a demo to make you want to buy dlc.

												Love the game, VERY FUN. One of my favorites.Literally over 100 dollars of DLC. Around 40 of which in my opinion, is essential to fully experience the game. About half the world is left unplayable due to the inability to play as Muslim and Pagan characters. I'd be completely alright with this if they weren't in the game to begin with, but it's not. It doesn't feel like an expansion pack, it feels like unlocking bits of the game.I'm honestly surprised EA didn't make it. I'd be completely convinced if it was broken and buggy.

												This game down to it's core is politics at its basest form.♥♥♥♥♥kissing the powerful and the many while plotting to become the powerful. It's also  a very archaic form of politics since current politics only♥♥♥♥♥kisses the powerful.This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get used to, I personally had a lot trouble getting into it. But give it enough time and you'll find it quite simple and even 150+ hours in I'm still learning a few extra tricks to give me more advantages. Another thing you might find daunting is all the DLC and there is a LOT of DLC, it will give you a lot more hours and I mean a LOT more hours of gametime as you play the different types of religions/governments.It also remains quite true to how large kingdoms and empires were run. The bigger they got the weaker the ruler at the top got, since you have to appease all your vassals and pray they start a revolt that you can put down.If you're not sure if you want to play this game there is a demo available, so you don't have to take a gamble with this game.Now I shall get back to kissing the asses of all my vassals!

												As France, my king died and my son inherited. Within five minutes, I got the event that gives you a pet cat. I screamed in joy. When he died, I buried him in the garden, his ""favorite place to play."" Actually teared up. In honor of him, I formed the Empire of Francia and proceeded to destroy the entire military of the Holy Roman Empire, then fight five civil wars and multiple wars in Spain. Marrying into all of the top nations, and allying myself with all of them. Except for the Holy Roman Empire, of course. I murdered all of them. My heir is a lunatic, but he is marrying the heir of England. 62 and wife is still popping out kids.Hoping my emperor can live for 9 years so my heir can come of age. Hail Francia. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game basically runs like a diplomacy simulator, enabling the player to build their own dynasty the way they want it to be. With an array of different options at your disposal, and a citizenry to keep happy, Crusader Kings can present a challenge. Using Historical time periods and even historical heads of state, The appeal of Crusader Kings 2 moves beyond lovers of Diplomacy games. Dealing with Heir's, Vassals, and underhanded siblings, Crusader Kings allows you to micromanage your dynasty, enabling a player to give their line a personal touch. I don't typically go for these types of games, but in fairness, it is fairly well done and offers a lot of playability options so I have to recommend it if that is the kind of game you enjoy.

												I used to ship this game and with over 800 hours (I have a lot of offline time, trust me) I believe I can say that I’ve played through the majority of what this game has to offer. I won’t even lie, I have enjoyed this game immensely throughout most of my hours played and I think it is a good game everyone should experience at some point during a sale. However, that all changed when the updates attacked.*proceeds to stare at the DLC using peripherals* He whispers solemnly, “I’ll be seeing you in a minute”. I have played this game for the better part of two years and I have to say that I absolutely hate the direction of the updates placed upon this game. Even though you can opt for old versions of the game in beta, I feel as though the game has moved backwards at times. 	My most recent issue with the game stems from some bull crap I got during a war I started with Norway in Scandinavia. I attack and completely decimated their army, I also managed to take their capital and 80% of their fiefs (got like 1/100 percent for it). Even so, the war percent dropped form 80% to 30% in a second for no reason, I wasn’t even attacked. Long story short, other countries attacked me after like 30 years of holding all their counties and I lost. The game has some serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to work out and I’m tired of sitting in a game for hours on end strategizing for it to all crumble away due to unexplainable ♥♥♥♥ery. I’ve seen a lot of crap in my days playing this game (Believe it) but boy does this♥♥♥♥♥♥takes the cake. Nothing close has ever happened to me like this before the recent updates (At least not at this scale). I even summoned 7500 troops using my massive prestige and I was still defeated out of some form of broken attrition.	Now for my biggest gripe about the game *Walks over to DLC and whispers in its ear* “Its’ time”. Holy crap this game has more DLC then fricking Total war games. I bought the vanilla version of this game on sale for what I though was a reasonable price. However, shortly after I bought it, they released a “complete” edition of the game which I thought was all of the DLC. WRONG! I’ve never been angrier about making a video game purchase in my entire life. I would rather rebuy No Mans Sky than rebuy the entire game I had with DLC for another 40$ (which was cheaper than just buying all of the DLC). You would think they would at least give all of the DLC to me (you know... since it’s “complete”). Seriously this game makes EA look generous. I appreciate buying DLC if it adds flavorful content and improves on the game, I’m all for it! But when your game pushes out tons of DLC and about 50% of it is complete garbage, usually priced at 15$, it makes me question my sanity. Ps. Despite all my rage *rock music intensifies* I still recognize that I can raid Rome to the ground, kidnap the pope and sacrifice his corpse to Thor. If it wasent for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC scamming and crappy update direction that somewhat makes you feel as though you need to buy certain DLC, this game would be perfect. Really tired of being treaed as a wallet by developers I put my faith in. TLDR: Don’t get shafted by this game by buying it with a bundle. I recommend buying it for like 10$ when it goes on sale again for the vanilla game. There are some good DLC like Viking Conquest etc. but make sure you read all the additional DLC reviews before purchasing. Yes I am mad.			",35,9,0,18,9,0,15

												It all began in one small kingdom. I was a wise king, who married Hungarian princess. We had 2 children, one daughter and one son, my heir. My wise uncle taught my son everything he knew. I had one very trusting vassal, who had stronger military than me. Luckily, he was my close friend, and he wasn't greedy, so I didn't have to assassinate him. I appointed my cousin to be a regent in case of my death, just until my son grew up old enough to rule. Everything was perfect, peace and prosperity ruled over my kingdom. But suddenly, I fewer hit me. I fell into bed and never recovered.My regent took over. His wife was an arabian princess, who was a bit greedy. She plotted to assassinate my son who was soon to become the king. Regent knew this, but decided not to imprison his wife, instead he waited. Her plot was a success, the heir was dead and her son became new heir. Feeling pressured by his council, new king, my cousin, imprisoned his wife for murdering my son. She was prisoner for 2 years, then he decided to execute her so he could get married again. He married a Hungarian princess (I guess it was in our blood to love Hungarian girls :P) and he also married his son to the princess of Aragon.My vassal didn't mind the change, he respected the new king, but hated his son. Finally, our army had become stronger than our rival's and we attacked. We crushed them and made their old ruler our vassal. Alas, not all was fine. The king was injured in a battle and became incapable of leading the country. Soon after he died. His son took over the title. But now, he had a problem, his father's most faithfull vassal hated him and became his rival. He tried to bribe him and award him honorary titles, but that hardly worked. He had even sent official diplomatic envoys few times to try to sweet talk the vassal, but that didn't work either. That had a great impact on army size of the entire kingdom since almost half of that army came from that vassal.The old vassal, whose kingdom we conquered saw an opportunity. He plotted to kill the new king. Other vassal supported him. The new king found out about it and decided to act. He had tried to imprison the old bugger, but he failed and there was full scale war again. Except now, their army crushed ours. The king was captured and assassinated, his wife was banished and his child was made a puppet king. The old bugger was a regent and controlled everything. One day, petty little king was playing on the balcony and suddeny, the edge of it collapsed, the child fell over and died on the spot. The old bugger became the new king, he betrayed and assassinated the other vassal so he couldn't betray him. He hunted down and killed or banished every member of my dinasty. And that was the end of my royal family.If you have read all of this, I can go on with the actual review. As you can see, this is just one of the many stories you can create in this game. It gives you a lot of possibility for replayability. Also there is a Game of Thrones mod, which is awesome.BUT, I will not recommend this game because of it's awfull DLC policy, which shows no respect for the new players. Sure, the game is regularly on the sale, but that doesn't justify that price. So, just like in my EU4 review, I will join the protesters against this kind of DLC policy and will NOT recommend this game. Paradox should learn about DLC policy from CD Projekt Red.

												Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game based around familiy dynasties, political power mongering and in short - trying to make sure you have the biggest wealthest family in the world. The game spans ~400 years of historical time between 1066 to 1453 and offers historical events and references that you can either choose to follow or create a new alternantive timeline from. Do you start a 'War of the Roses' battle? Does YOUR family takeover the Papal? Building relationships, marriages, alliances and faking claims is the key. If this sounds all very Game of Thrones then you're right - it is. Crusader Kings II is the best GoT game on the market at the moment, and that's all thanks to engine being used.Crusader Kings II is the end result of many years of creating and improving on Paradox's Clausewitz Engine (the engine responsible for Cruaders Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron franchises). If you're familiar with those games, you might feel familiar with CK2, but the truth is this game goes beyond what the engine has produced before hand. The Clausewitz Engine is in sense the major selling point behind CK2, so while the graphics aren't anything special (and are little more than 3D Marker Pieces) the true beauty unfolds as you play.I can't think of many greater feelings than the moment you're 50 year plotting to get your Grandson into place of power from his lowly Duke title to Lord pays off. Sending your Master of Whispers into a neighbouring region to spread lies and cause dissent amongst the vassals, while you forge a plot to fabricate claims to the title and ursurp the Lordship. So good.Paradox have managed to support the game well since release in the form of DLC Expansions, which have opened the game world up and expanded the 'fringe' empires to be just as complex as the 'key' European ones. However they've also supported the game with post-release patching and balancing, so they're not ones to sitback and take your money.I'm honestly finding it hard to explain this game, the only advice I can give is; if you've ever wanted to play the Game of Thrones this is the closest you'll ever get. In fact, do yourself the pleasure of visiting: http://citadel.prophpbb.com/forum3.html and checking out the amazing Game of Thrones mod these guys have been making over the last year or so (WARNING: May contain spoilers for TV viewers).

												(I'm french, so sorry for my mistakes)This game is one of my favorite game ever so far. I got it a year ago and I'm never bored of this game. With each DLC that came out, the game became sometime harder, sometime easier, but I am not complaining about it. Each extensions gave something new to this already awesome game. However, some of those DLC shouldn't exist because they are quite basic, like the Old Gods or Sword of Islam. This game is always a suprise because there will always be something strange that happens, like a jihad for Denmark, or a crusade on France. If you like ahistorical game, this one is for you. Oh, and did I mention that you can lay in multiplayer? The multiplayer part of the game is awesome, even if the servers are unstable. You can so so much stuff stupid with your friends! For example, nearly half of my play time on this gamer is on multiplayer with only one friend!And for those who seek a challenge, try to do the achievements of the game, some are quite hard and will ask you a lot of time of practice! (Kingdom of David for example)As a conclusion, I do recommend this awesome game and if you ever buy it and like it, try the multiplayer with 5 or 6 friends, you'll never the world the same way, especially if you have the conclave DLC.PS. Again, I'm  sorry for my mistakes. ",34,3,0,11,6,0,15

												This game is fun and all but it gets repetitive quick. If I bought the DLC it would probably fix this problem but their is too much DLC and the DLC is too expensive for me to consider buying it even on sale. I can't recommend this game in good faith because of the exorbitant amount of DLCEDIT*******I managed to get my hands on most of the DLC for under 10 dollars canadian. I have concluded that  owning the DLC makes this game a genuinely great game. However I will still not be recommending this game based on how ridiculous the amount of DLC is. If anyone who is reading this review plans on just buying the base game with no DLC DON'T DO IT you will be bored out of your skull. I cannot overstate how boring the base game is.

												I'm going to try and keep this review short and simple but take note this review is hard to make short. To start off this gmae is like no other it is pretty much the most interesting game you will find. I Truely suggest you atleast try the demo. This game is for all gamers no matter whoever tells you its not. I have been playing this game for awhile to know this isnt just one game you forget about! You will make more momments in this game alone or with freinds that you will never think twice about how much money or effort you spent. The developer's are truely great and are always updating the game. There are many DLC's and i do suggest you buy them to get the full experience this game has to offer. The most defining game features in the game are:700 years of gameplay (with dlc)Your own history in the medieval ages with one familyTons upon tons of days of replayability (no two games are alike)Conquering europeI Give this game a 10/10 and its my opinion that any person and/or gamer can get into this and love it to death !If you have any questions about Crusader Kings 2 or just want to enjoy a nice group full of people that love the game PLEASE contact me, freind me, or even join my group we would love to have more people interested in this game !10/10 A must buy			",50,1,0,10,21,0,14

												One of the Best Grand Strategy Games I have ever played. However unless you have the money to get the DLC, the game is only a shell ehen pruchased without any DLC. This game however with the DLC can be amazing at best, but a lot of the time you are gonna need a lot of patience. Overall, the game is great but beware of the DLC and the fact that buying one of these games form Paradox will likley lead to many hours and possible purchases of other Games such as HOI IV and VIC II. A great game for a Grand Starategist!			",14,2,0,2,3,0,4

($5.00)And that's only the DLCs that actually add new Mechanics to the game. There's another 50+ flaor packs that add skins and music that cost upward of $100 altogether. Seriously, this is an amazing game that I'd reccomend ONLY if you buy the dlc on sale.			",148,13,0,18,55,2,35

												So I installed the Game of Thrones mod..- Play as Daenarys - Liberate cities a la the actual narrative- Get caught up in maintaining the cities a la the actual narrative- It's ok, my dragons are keeping the revolts at bay, the Wise Masters of Essos will tremble at my feet - Give birth to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son out of wedlock. Name him Jon2- Give Jon2 his own dragon to continue the trend- He still can't inherit even though I legitimise him- Rebel army of 30,000 rises up in Mereen - My dragon-led army of 16,000 annihilates it- this ledge is rickety...- I fall off ledge- Targaryen dynasty comes to an endValar Ledgeghulis			",110,8,1,7,7,0,9

												Possibly the best game ever? I have sunk a LOT of time into paradox games in my time, but this is by far my favorite. Control a man and then a dynasty, enjoy intrigue and politics and strategic marriages. Build your empire and shape your world. Start as a count and work your way up to emperor, reunite the Roman empire, or even inherit Byzantium as the HRE. the amount of things that I have done and can do in this game astounds me, as does every new paradox game. 100/1/00			",77,15,0,30,26,3,22

												  (sorry for the length)  A constantly politically shifting and difficult Europe centric world where you can form your medieval kingdom the way you want it, if your many enemies alow it. The game itself is pretty amazing in scale and with the newest update pretty difficult. Your goal shouldn't be to build a sprawling empire, but to get your family to stand the test of time (that's not to say that controlling a centralized depositic empire is a bad thing) and Paradox is still updating the game and adding more expansions onto it, that's not even mentioning the amazing mod's for the game, if you are in to game of thrones or warhammer, post apocolyptic America, more historical accuracy, less historical accuracy, ect.  If you survive through the ages you can also convert the map file to Europe Univerails 4 and play in a new age, which is nice if you like EU4. (It hasn't grown on me)  The game can get pretty ridiculous too, hilarious at times like when your 8 month old daughter is friends with a 41 year old mercenary captain who is never around. Or when the king of Sweden and Finland inexplicably becomes sunni muslim, and is then promptly assasinated by all of his coutiers and vassals for their religous differences. Good times...  You'll need a powerfull rig though if you want to play all the way though, like with all paradox games it slows down over time, and that's a bummer, though there are probobly mods that remove detail from the map and such. The Price is also pretty steep when you look at it, but if you get it on a sale and don't buy the artsy dlc, it's... do-able. It makes sense considering the game needs a good computer to run it on.  If you are buying the game to play with friends, all players will play with the dlc of the host of the game lobby, so only one of you will need the dlc. When I've played multiplayer games I have played with mod's, and experianced a lot of desync's, which essentially end the game, which is upsetting, but that might just be me or the mods (Dragons in game of thrones mod)  Also if you click or press buttons duing the loading screen the game might just crash. It's because of the game engine from what i've been told. 10/10I bought the artsy stuff too, skins and such (but not the E-books) all the crazy, amazing, or just plain ridiculousness of the game is what earns it the description of ""Grand strategy""			",43,6,0,16,16,0,17

It's defiantly a niche title but if you like grand strategy, paradox games or the feudal system then you will love this.

At the young age of 9 I ♥♥♥♥ed my mother and got her pregnant, wasn't my proudest tumble, so I got rid of that child. Later on my disgusting mother slept with the heathenous Pope as a revenge for killing our son. I decided to let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ live just to have someone to torture on a bad day. My mother on the other hand I caught plotting to kill me so I hanged her. During my reign I lost an eye, an arm, a leg and was severely injured multiple times, but my excellent military knowledge served me well throughout the years. It was a good reign, the Sultan died a natural death at the age of 74. Long live Andalusia!10/10			",86,12,2,16,10,0,19

												I started in Ireland, and converted everyone to Catholicism, cutting down on alot of violence.Then my king was murdered by his wife because she was cheating on him with his brother. My King's son became king and all the bishops hated him and he had like 20 children, so I was confused.Then I found out he was a master seducer and had had children with literally EVERY SINGLE FEMALE (except for his mother) IN MY COURT. He sudenly fell off of a castle after almost every single lord in the kingdom (totally not started by me) plotted his death.Unfortunately, now the rest of the lords had become pagan and Ireland was conquered by a holy war from the final Catholic province. My only surviving descendant was gay, and cowardly. He didn't last long...10/10, would plot against Master Seducer again.			",221,23,1,23,20,0,41

												As someone with both an interest in history and a 100% non sexually interest in incest, this game easily got my attention at release. Since then many things have happened. More hilarious bugs have come to live and Jews jewing Jews in Judea have come into play as well. The gameplay is, like in all Paradox games, bad. This, however, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. As with all Paradox games, you will eventually get to live with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of it and end up deriving a form of masochistic pleasure from the game. 10/10, Mikkels Games NetworkSigned, Mikkel the Great, Steam Explorer, Internet Celebrity, Cult Leader, spokesperson and lead developer of MekkilsSuperHaus.PS.

My First Proper Game- Start out as a single province in Ireland.- Set up my court and give out titles.- Get married. Make an heir.- Everything is going amazingly.- Declare War on the neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly.- Give province to my most trusted courtier.- Declare War on the another neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly, again.- Give province to my other trusted courtier.- Life is going incredibly well, soon Ireland will be mine!- SUDDENLY, one of my stupid vassals rebels for no reason!- Crush the rebels and go completely mad, imprisoning him and all of his family then executing them all! No mercy for traitors!- Everyone hates me including my wife!- People starting plotting against me left and right!- I get super paranoid and start executing everyone!- My other vassal rebels.- Some random place I've never heard of declares war on me.- My army is totally crushed.- Laugh like a mad man and lose EVERYTHING.- Game over.10/10 would go completely insane and lose everything again.

												Easily one of the most entertaining games Ive ever owned. I picked this game up for 10 dollars on sale, and for the first time ever I feel like I owe the company more money for what they provided me!Disclaimer: This game has the absolute steepest learning curve Ive ever overcome. The tutorials are pretty useless, some are broken, and dont explain features too well. Most everyone learns how to paly by watching youtube videos, of which there are many excellent series.Disclaimer Disclaimer: This is not for those who enjoy fastpaced gameplay. It is not like the Total War franchise where you take command of your armies. The entire game is played out on the map. That all being said with a little patience and little imagination this game offers literally endless fun. So many different ways to play, every single game will be different. And if any of you people out there are familiar with the phrase ""Its fun to loose!"", then this is for you.Youll get so many cool stories to tell, and the community is nothing short of wonderful. Everyone is helpful and polite (for the most part, much better than most other communities). Highly, highly recommend this game. 9/10.			",111,16,0,29,46,2,61

												Crusader Kings 2 is probably the most reactionary game ever made. Imagine Game of Thrones without the fantasy stuff. This is a game about killing your kin to steal their lands, diplomatically marrying daughters off to sadistic freaks, crushing peasant revolts, and crusading against the Mohammadeans. Whether you chose to play as the Holy Roman Emperor or the count of a single back country province you’ll have plenty of court intrigue to keep you occupied. It is ½ grand strategy game, ½ dynastic RPG, and 100% awesome.With the various DLCs you can play as non Christian religions too. I highly recommend picking up at least the Sword of Islam and Old Gods DLCs so you can play Muslims and Pagans respectively. ",380,53,11,47,48,1,97

												You know, ive been playing paradox games ever since europa universalis rome and in that time iv e played at one point or another most major paradox titles espically their strategy titles.Now out of all those titles, crusader kings 2 overall  probably isnt any better than its counterparts europa 4, hearts of iron 4 and victoria 2..but it does have something that none of the others do..in fact while the aforementioned games are  similar to each other crusader kings 2 stands out..europa 4 attempts to combine various aspects from  all of these titles into one large jack of all trades that everyone can enjoy, victoria 2 embraced the economic side of paradox strategy with some hearts of iron style warfare..hearts of iron 4 while a massive improvment on the third entry in that series is still a war sim far far more than anything else.Crusader kings was intended to be grand strategy meets rpg, and it pulled that off wonderfully in the process however something uniqe and special in the gaming world was born..something that i have never been able to find a sutiable comparison for when looking at all aspects of a game..there just isnt another game that pulls of making you feel like you are that indivudal king or queen even though you arent because they are often actual historical charaters .so that every year of thier rule feels personalized to you despite the fact that the game isnt tryin gto say YOU are that ruler.At the same time your ruling for hundreds of years over dozens of rulers so how could each ruler feel individual, and to an extent that applies however..imagine the old idea of re incartaion, throughout the eons you are reborn essentialy the same sould but into different bodies and lives ((or as a tree)) adapt that slightly and you have what playing a ruler in crusader kings 2 feels like.Now i could elaborate further as i intended to cover the other points i wished to make but this review is getting a bit long so ill wrap it up...there would have been at least four blocks that size.The point is this game does something you will not find anywhere else, you may find individual aspects in other games or even a combination of a few but overall there simply isnt another comparison, at least not yet. So very simply put if you like the idea of roleplaying as a king or queen while running a country paradox style than this is the game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crusader Kings 2 is real time/paused strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. Same developer who made other great games like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3 and Stellaris. This game is based on Middle Ages to start of renaissance, where EU4 starts. Without DLC starts around 1066, but if you have dlc\'s like Old Gods and Charlemagne you can start it on 700\'s.However before saying this game is all about invading other lands like Civ and Total War, no. Because this game is unique. You rule your dynasty and lead it through the age. You have to control your family by marrying other people for example Holy Roman Empire\'s princesses. Then you extend your family and realm. Same time there is world map, where you can invade land, like in every strategy game. But only land available is Europe, North Africa and part of Asia. There are many events in this game. I\'ll explain hordes, rebellions and crusades in this review. There are many hordes. For example Mongols and Abbasids. If you have Sunset Invasion DLC, Aztecs are gonna invade Europe too. Hordes born quickly and rise by invading all neighbor realms. They are hard to defeat but they collapse easily with rebellions. Rebellions are events where claimer of duchy of puppet state declare war on country and try to switch government or get independece. That\'s why you see all rebellions threats on your intrique menu, so you can prepare at threats or plot to kill threats. And last, crusades. If you part of catholic or orthodox religion, pope or archbishop might declare crusade to invade Jerusalem, Anatolia or any lands where real life crusaders were. You don\'t have to join crusade but if you join and get most points you\'ll gain all lands that were invaded in crusade.Family relations are pretty important as your sons that have bad relation with you might try to kill you or start rebellion. And affairs are just gonna anger your wife and your children. However having family member in countries like Holy Roman Empire might help you make alliance with them, so that is useful. On my game, I just spammed my every daughter on big countries, HRE, England, France and Byzantium.Combat works really well, but units are pretty hard to make and army levies might rise too big.Overall this game is great and I had alot more fun with it than with Civ or EU4. I recommend it!			",112,2,7,13,9,1,16

												The best (it's clear that Paradox own the genre, but this is their best one) Grand Strategy game. Whilst fans of strategy games may miss the interactive combat, this game makes up for it by being more interactive in other aspects such as diplomacy. Take your house and make it last throughout the ages! Who doesnt want to conquer the world? It is one of the most complex games I have ever played and the learning curve is extremely steep, yet through playing the game it is easy to overcome (tutorials are provided, but they arent the most in depth). The game has multiple DLC packs (which arent required, but they do make it more fun) and is being updated regularly. Be prepared to become frustrated; I built my custom house (DLC) and it lasted throughout many centuries and when it came to  the 6 Generation, I was emperor of The Byzantine Empire, Britannia, Francia, The Holy Roman empire. The person I played, was infertile, and all other relatives had been killed off or were women (the game is against women, the populace hate you if youre a female ruler), my character died and with it my House. 100 hours I put in, to lose.But remember, losing is fun!9.8/10 losing the .2 for castration being available to only greeks.

												Great. Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC ""Old Gods"". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.   There are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:   - Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).    - King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.    - Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.    - The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).     -The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.    The basic provincial unit of the game is the ""county"". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the ""wrong holding type"" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.Realm LawsThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.   Gender Laws are the following: Agnatic – Only males inheirt Agnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs. Absolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)However, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.   Inheritance Laws are: Gavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession. Feudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game. Seniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships. Primogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny. Agnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father's titles. Patrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit. Investiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court. Elective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court. Tanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty. Ultimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death. Appointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders. All feudal titles are granted by the Grandmaster and revert back to him after the holder dies. Papal Succession - Pope's succesion law where elected Cardinal's chose the next Pope among themselves. Only used by the Pope if the player owns the Sons of Abraham DLC. King and Emperor-level characters also have a special set of available laws, the ""Crown Authority Laws"", which simulate the power exerted by the monarch over his vassals. For example, with ""autonomous vassals law"", the monarch cannot revoke vassal's titles, and they only provide levies to their liege if they hold him or her in high regard. In ""absolute crown authority law"", the vassals are entirely forbidden of waging war against each other and foreign enemies and must provide a sizable amount of levies.That's a really really good game for about 1894172381274109487128409 hours of gameplay.

												After a dozen games that ended misrably for my character and his dynasty within only a few years after starting the game, I have finally started a game that lasted for more then twenty minutes.I started out as Leon, and all was well. Nothing happened, all my vassals were cool with me. Then I realized my kin in Aragon started to invade the moslems below us. Not wanting to be overpowered by Aragon a century later, I proceeded to take a small coastal province. I then promptly forgot what I was doing and spammed summer fairs and feasts for a decade or two.When my first character died(Alfonso), he had quite the sum of prestige(around 500 or so). And, with the game engine doin' its thing, Alfonso's succesor(his son Alfonso) got around 200 prestige. Following his dear father's footsteps, Alfonso Jr. spammed the ever-loving crap out of feasts and festivals. But, not more then five years into his reign the pope rang him and asked him to join in a crusade against the moslems. Coincedentially, the targets for Christiandom's righteous wrath happened to be the nation directly below me.So, of course, Deus Vult and all that. I invaded two small provinces in the first part of the crusade. After conquering these two places, I sat on my bum and waited the crusade out, jealously guarding my newly acquired lands.Then, suddenly, as though the Heavenly Father himself thanked me for my participation in the crusade, I acquired half of Spain.Not really sure how.But, Now my prestige started to sky rocket. First, it was 300. Then it was 400. Then, 500. 600. 700. And on, and on and on it went until I had nearly 900 prestige by the time I was thirteen. Que another decade or so of me stealing tiny chunks of realms from the muslims that remained in Spain. Not only was I the terror of the muslims, I had backed the nation of Aragon into a corner, with only two land-locked provinces and a handful of coastal lands.I then married the Queen of France.And, by the time I reached my mid twenties, I was the stuff of legend. Having already held my Grand Tournament and accumulated nearly 2000 prestige, I was on top of the world. Loving wife how owns the entirety of France, promising sons, total alegience of all my vassals.Then I became a homosexual.Nothing wrong with that, not even my vassals batted an eye at it.But they started to get worried when I went insane. Barking at people, wearing shoes as hats, the usual crazyness.I also happened to be fighting a war with Britain in defense of France at the time, all while manipulating the law to make my son's kingship more secure.Then I ♥♥♥♥ed up. I failed to see that choosing Senoirity as my inheritance guideline, I completely removed all of my children from the line of inheritence. Instead, It was my cousin.But, you know what they say, practice makes perfect.TL;DRBecame one of the most legendary kings by the age of thirteen, married the queen of France, went insane screwed over my family. This game is a must buy.			",36,6,0,13,8,0,13

												Crusader Kings 2 is the campaign of Total War, set to focus not on a nation, but on a family.  Your house must become as powerful as possible, this involves a lot of political manipulation and throwing money around.  As I say, the game is the campaign - there is no real control over your battles like in Total War, what you enter the fight with is all that contributes to your victory.  That is a shame, hopefully by the time Paradox decides to do Crusader Kings 3, they'll have worked up the nerve to go for it.While I cannot recommend the game to every type of strategy game fan, this one has been a lot of fun for me, and has presented me with a lot of challenges.

												The armored Cataphract regiments from the Komnenian household guard led my Anatolian armies in the east while a smaller force of Varangians led a simultaneous invasion of muslim-held Sicily in the west. Infidel armies were crushed underfoot, provinces fell one by one, and the petty emir's begged for peace as the Byzantine Restoration swept to all shores of the Mediterranean. ""Good!,"" I said, ""this was getting too easy!"" when the Sunni's finally declared a jihad. My forces took the initiative and several large mercenary companies and 20,000 Byzantines landed near the Nile before the first infidel armies even reached my borders. Small muslim armies were swatted away as they attempted to repel my invasion, but they were no match for my men as we ravaged the Egyptian delta. The Shiites declared their own jihad against the recently ""liberated"" sicilian holdings a few months after we landed in Egypt. ""Whatever,"" I chuckled, ""the mighty sons of Rome do not fear a these desert men!"" I recruited more mercenaries and landed in Sicily just as the first Shiite armies began to trickle in by boat. Each month brought a fresh wave of infidels and we crushed each attack and pressed on with the sieges.But months turned in to years, and the trickle of muslim armies became a steady stream of larger and larger enemy armies. My fleets began to frantically criss-cross the Mediterranean, ferrying whatever regiments I could spare from theatre to theatre to counter each wave. My men were winning every battle, but we were losing soldiers faster than they could be replaced. I watched in disbelief as my army and Varangian core in Sicily was overrun, trapped, and annihilated, and the Shiites crossed the strait to capture my holdings in Italy. Then my armies holding eastern Anatolia were forced to pull back to a defensive line near the Bosphorus as large muslim hosts pressed towards my capital. My Egyptian invasion force had been significantly weakened by endless waves of Sunni's, and the desert sun was killing even more. I evacuated Egypt and pulled back the remaining armies to regroup in Greece.My war chest was also running out, which forced me to disband the remaining mercenary companies to keep them from rebelling, and scrapped large portions of my fleet. My disbelief turned to horror as the Shiites landed in Greece and the Sunni's crossed the Bosporus and laid siege to Constantinople. I gathered what remained of my fragmented forces, nearly 20k men, around Athens and won a close battle over a large Shiite force that had crossed into western Greece, and finally convinced the desert men to agree to peace in exchange for the Sicilian duchy I had won years earlier. My men then charged north, defeating a small muslim host that surrounded Constantinople and relieving the city for a few months. But another Sunni host of some 50k crossed the strait soon after, forcing my army to retreat and threatening to destroy my last hopes for the Restoration. The situation had gone from dire to impossible.And that is when they appeared- A force of 50k imperials arrived on a fleet outside my capital, led by the Kaiser himself. A few years into the war, I had arranged for my son to marry the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor in the west, and although he had officially joined the war in my defense, up to this point, I had only seen a few small inneffective armies in Italy. I marched the last sons of Rome north-east, and joined battle just as the Kaiser landed at the head of his great army. Together we overpowered and crushed the muslim forces, and the Kaiser's fleet prevented a muslim escape into Anatolia. The infidels were completely destroyed. Soon after, the Sunni's finally agreed to a white peace that left my Eastern empire intact. I never forgot that the true sons of Rome had been saved by the pretenders in the west, and our alliance lasted for generations until the new Roman Empire and the title of Augustus was finally restored.For those of you wondering, this did actually happen during my play through way back in 2013 and it was the reason I became hooked on CKII until I eventually graduated to Europa Universalis 4. This game is unique in the strategy genre and I would recommend it to people that enjoy the Total War series, but always wanted more depth in the character aspect of the game (e.g. Kings, Princes, and Generals). If you are on the fence about this game, then check out a few of the Game of Thrones mod videos on youtube- I never played the mod, but watching the LP's sold me. Enjoy!			",4,1,0,1,8,0,9

												Just... if you have a life, stay away from this game.Imagine taking the Sims. Now, make every character in the Sims religious and despising every one else that's not their religion. Then make them ten times more evil. Now, give them an inordinate amount of power and make them kings of lands stretching from Iceland to Bengal. Add a sprinkle of chaos and human interference, and you have Crusader Kings II.You control a king or doge and guide his actions and rulership. Be a tyrant, be a ruler of a docile disposition. Just keep a hold of your vassals, win the elections, and make sure to kill that kid that has a claim on your title.Often events pop up that give you options. However, the effects of your decision are neatly laid out for you, meaning there is little sense of randomness of what happens. You pick the thing with the best effect. The events are sometimes repetitive, and you always usually end up choosing one option throughout all your playthroughs.Although there are characters with traits and personalities, you as a player will, unless you diliberately keep your character's traits in mind, play to your own wants and needs of the game, not what the character you are controlling will want. The game's overall very fun, but lacking in documentation, and for a Strategy/RPG, does little to encourage the RPG side of things. The game's tone is usually serious and historical, but occasionally tongue-in-cheek. (especially if you get the lunatic trait) Sometimes, especially with DLC, the game can become fantasy or simply ridiculous (e.g., in Sunset Invasion the New World, more specifically the Aztecs, can colonize the old world, instead of the other way around. In The Sons of Abraham you can father or mother the spawn of Satan unknowingly. Unknowingly, that is, until he kills your entire family, leaving him as the only heir, then killing you and taking your throne.)In some ways this game is ""How to be an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 101"". It has a freaking ""evil plan"" mechanic for crying out loud! In others it's also ""How to be a Radical 101"". Christians can go on Crusades, Muslims on Jihads and everyone else on Genericly named ""Great Holy Wars"".This game is also great if you like Game of Thrones. Murder? Check! Incest? Check! Anyone can die, no matter how important? Double-check.I'd recommend this game to the following people:Evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sReligious RadicalsStrategy FansParadox Interactive FansGame-of-Thrones FansPoliticians			",19,6,0,21,3,1,4

												I always review the games I buy, and I usually do it after having owned and played them for around a week. CK2 is different, and in order to review such a game I had to play it more. And more, and more, and more, until finally, I believe that I have played this game enough to say that this is the best game that has ever been made! A game with both such depth and width has never been made before in my opinion.Here you can murder your son simply because you want to marry his wife, or you can seduce your sister if you want to go a little bit game of thrones. Speaking of game of thrones, if you get your hands on someone you don't like, you can torture, mutilate or murder anyone! In times of need you can even become a cannibal. Want to discreetly get rid of an annoying uncle? Put him in the vanguard of your armies, or fabricate false stories allowing you to imprison him without opinion-penalties from your subjects. But who cares about their subjects? Just imprison him and execute him publicly without reason, beacause you are the lord!I approve this message.			",9,1,0,4,13,0,5

												You know you’ve been playing too much Crusader Kings II when you start arranging betrothals between your and your friend’s children and spend the rest of your time musing on heraldry. Crusader Kings II is an ambitious strategy masterpiece full of intrigue, diplomacy, and war. The player controls a single noble dynasty through the European middle ages in a world as changeable as it is engaging.One word I would definitely not use to describe Crusader Kings II is ‘accessible’. When I first started the game, I had to sort through dozens of menu screens and tabs trying to figure out to do. I can’t be sure, but at one point I think I accidentally attempted to abdicate the Duchy of Kent in favor of my Norwegian half-brother. There certainly were helpful messages and tips in great abundance, but if I really wanted to spend an hour reading, I would be downloading O. Henry short stories, not starting up a new game.Once you do get the hang of the controls, though, Crusader Kings II opens up to almost endless possibilities. You can expand your dynasty by clever power play, strategic marriages, or through military force alone. If you work hard as an impoverished count, your grandchildren could be kings and queens. In a game revolving around diplomacy, however, the AI can be a little off-putting in its lack of complexity. While computer players are reasonably clever, they always make the most rational choice, which makes you feel a bit out of place as you attempt to coerce an Arabian sheikh to help you to invade Sweden.The graphics are nothing to write home about, unless you wanted to let your folks know that games can be released in 2012 and still run on any computer more advanced than an abacus. The Crusader Kings II interface is basically a detailed map surrounded by different menus. If you weren’t wearing your glasses, it would look a lot like Total War, only you can’t zoom in for battles- all physical conflict is resolved off-screen as you watch the number of troops still alive decrease. The constant music definitely helps to distract from the less-than-interesting graphics. The same tracks are played over and over, but they’re epic enough to make it worth it.The beautiful thing about Crusader Kings II is the way it generates stories through emergent gameplay. Take King Tudwal the Great, who loved gardening but would occasionally fly off the handle and kill his own family members, or Count Oberto, who despairingly turned to a scholarly life after failing to find a bride for his homosexual nephew. These aren’t characters you find in most Triple-A games.If you only want to relax for a few minutes, you would probably be best served playing Plants vs Zombies, but if you want to spend a challenging 400 years taking over medieval Europe through vilest treachery, Crusader Kings II is without rival. Now if you’ll excuse me, my uncle just raised the banners of Scotland in rebellion against his Welsh overlords.			",52,15,1,28,16,0,21

												I have 965 hours in this game so far.  That is 40.2 DAYS of playtime.  This game is way too addictiing, run away before it is too late! Run AWAY!BUT if you do give into temptation:As the King of Castille I once went very much insane.  I was convinced I was possessed by the devil and whenever we had fish for dinner it would talk to me while it was on the plate.  Jesus whispered military advice into my ear and I became an unpredictable brilliant tactician who no one could withstand on the battle field (probably because I was so insane).  10/10 would be possessed, talk to fish & Jesus again.

												This is a great medieval simulator. The combat aspects are extremely downplayed leaving you to focus on your court polotics and intrugue. You play as a medieval lord ranging from count to duke to king. You journey through time making plays for power within your kingdom you will advance through lines of succesion to the next generation. Go on crusades to claim the holy land from infedels, and wage holy war against the pagan heathens, all the while staving off rebellion and rogue lords attempting to usurp your domain. This game features rts sandbox and rpg aspects and it well worth the  sale price of $10 for the vanilla client. IMO the republic dlc, the old gods dlc, and legacy of rome are the most worthwhile and neccesary dlc. The rest mostly just come down to personal preferance and what you think you will play.You can find plenty of mods on the paradox forum including a game of thrones westeros mod (the whole time i was playing vanilla i was wishing there was a game like that and when i found it on the forums i was ecstatic). The middle earth mod and tamriel mods are in development as of yet.If you are unsure about buying this game give the demo a try or maybe check out some lets play videos on u tube. Overall this game is wonderful and deserves your attention if not only briefly to experience the greatness that is ck2.			",627,162,11,125,73,6,98

Then they show me there holy book and i start studying it and i find out that there is some god there is older than all the other gods which is sleeping under the sea. So im like ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥"" but i can't walk away becuse i have already clicked yes, so we go out to the sea and the people start saying strang words like ""oug hhsjc xbao"" and then i see some big shadow coming out of the water. Then a popup comes up and give me the decision to either scream He comes!HE COMES or try to stop it, so i try to stop it by getting a longboat and sailing to the monster. A popup says that the monster have a human-like body and tentacels on its face that loks like a sguid. I ram the boat into the monster and syddenly i woke up in my bed covered in sweat, the guards say they found me laying on the beach and i asked if they saw the monster but they dident know what i was talking about.I got the trophy called ""Godslayer""Then i relysed...I KILLED CTHULHU, HELL YA!Best game ever 10/10 will always play again.

Crusader Kings II is a medieval politics grand strategy game. Maneuver nobility relations as you seek to expand the power and prestige of your dynasty, generations after generations.Pros: Where to begin? There are countless characters (thousands): barons, counts, dukes, kings, courtiers, family members and everything in between for every city, barony, county, tribe, sheikdom or other political region denominator. Relationship behaviors are based off a multitude of character and personality traits. You manage a character, and upon death his heir, then his heir, through centuries of history as kingdoms and empires rise and fall, acquiring lordship over titles through conquering armies, political weddings, intrigue and backstabbing. The base game is set specifically for Europeans during the crusades, while expansions add Northern Africa, Middle East, Scandinavia, Western Asia and India, with each distinct culture and religion having its own tribal, feudal and monarchic mechanics. Many random events allow you to determine what type of person your current character becomes, engrossing you in the story of each of them, influencing and determining the fate of any trivial or world changing event. The game is regularly and constantly being updated: I'm not only referring to the multitude of DLCs that add historically accurate ethical portraits and cultural armory, but actual core mechanics are regularly revised, enhanced and added to by the developers. The game is fully open-ended, and leaves you to determine your political goal. Do you wish to rebuild the Roman Empire? Unite Great Britain? Overcome enemies in a world-wide crusade? Overthrow the Pope? Found Ukraine? Survive the Mongol onslaught? Endless possibilities!Cons: The game has a high learning curve, and new comers must be willing to put in hours of learning, trial and error, and tutorial reading to understand how every mechanic works. Graphics are passable, barely enough to serve the game's purpose. Even at easier levels, difficulty remains high and players must be willing to go through constant frustrations as you are limited to decisions your character makes as a single person, which means there is no direct control over the outcome of battles, plots and events. The game can be slow at times, sometimes requiring months, years, decades and even generations of in-game time to bring any plan to fruition.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.This game isn't meant for everyone. It requires a lot of patience and dedication. But the game can also be immensely rewarding when you successfully achieve your goals. This game left me retelling the tales of how, as a count, I married my firstborn son to a duchess so that my grandson would inherit the king's throne (and expected to play that character two generations later), just to have my second son get branded as a kinslayer for killing his eldest brother, becoming my new heir and throw my entire plan to smithereens! The game is addictive, so if you have the patience to play through Cruisader Kings II's demo tutorial, you just have to get the entire game!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												After 1800+ hours playing Crusader Kings II, the most recent DLC and free content expansion, Conclave, has forced me to withdraw my formerly enthusiastic approval.  CKII used to be one of the premiere Grand Strategy titles available.  Sadly, over the course of several expansion/DLC releases the game has lost its way, becoming increasingly tedious and straying far from the original wonderful gameplay.  The Conclave DLC and the accompanying free content patch was released completely unbalanced and apparently largely untested.  It caused a widespread negative reaction which forced Paradox to immediately begin work on a fix patch.  That patch, now in open beta testing, goes a long way toward fixing the worst of the problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.  The root of the problem is that the entire concept of Conclave makes councils far too powerful.  The intent of Paradox seems to be to make the game more difficult and thus hinder the ability of players to ""paint"" the map all in the color of their empire.  The intended result was achieved.  And now the game is a mess of micromanaging council votes and council favor which detracts from the initial design concept of a fun game focused on dynasties and war in the medieval period.  Paradox might as well change the name of the game to Crusader Kings II: The Council -Hindered, Blocked and Trolled.  The game is no longer focused on dynasty and conquest and religious fervor in the medieval milieu.  Now it is just a grumpy, greedy pseudo-democracy council simulator set in a medieval era with the player forced into spending inordinate amounts of time dealing with fractious, constant council problems almost to the exclusion of everything that once made this a great game.   Congratulations, Paradox.  The greed pushing a need to continually release more DLC to line corporate pockets has finally sent the core game into oblivion. You succeeded in satisfying a vocal minority who wanted the game to be more difficult (with no proof that many of those who complained had even played the game beyond the Easy setting).  In return, you've so drastically altered the basic gameplay that Crusader Kings II is no longer really about Crusader Kings.  You've turned a fine Grand Strategy game set in the medieval period into something entirely different. Short of removing the Conclave DLC and the free content expansion entirely, there is no fix for this.  The game has moved too far from its original design concept, which attracted many of us to the game in the first place.  There are other better democracy simulators available.  They aren't Grand Strategy games; but neither is Crusader Kings II since the changes of the last expansion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ppl on my court want stuff i dunno about.Have been looking for hours to like this game, couldnt find it.Maybe it's full of strategy but just hidden in way to many screens and options.

												The CKII Experience:1. Create an awesome looking character with so-so traits.2. Marry a  princess from some far-flung kingdom.3. Sire some children (and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s)4. Use your so-so council to spread your influence over nearby lands.5. Fabricate some claims, infuriate some nobles, and rise from a count to a duke.6. Your character becomes depressed, stressed, and possesed.7. You die in a Viking raid from some distant pagan chiefdom.8. Your heir, despite your efforts, becomes a tyrant.9. His councilors contstantly join plots to kill him and eventually his siblings rise up and, with the help of the freaking Holy Roman Empire, revoke your titles, imprison and execute you.

												An amazingly realized strategy game. Unlike other series in the genre of strategy concepts aren't as abstract. Allowing a level of immersion and even storytelling (your own, a true sandbox) to take place on a playthrough that just doesn't happen usually in the genre. It has an elegant and easy to use interface, the biggest learning curve is the terms used I think and sheer information to take in.

												Just downloaded the vanilla game last night along with ""A Game of Thrones"" mod from moddb.com.  First playthrough has gone something like this...- Started the game as Rhaegar Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion.- Kidnapped Ned Stark's sister, Lyanna, and hid her in the Tower of Joy near Dorne. - Spent twenty minutes figuring out how to sail off of Dragonstone Castle.- Found Robert at the Trident and rewrote GOT history by crushing his army to a pulp and throwing Robert in chains.- Became King when dad was assassinated in King's Landing by Janos Slynt.- Sent Janos Slynt to The Wall for his troubles.- Sent all remaining advisors in King's Landing to The Wall for good measure.- Laid siege to Storm's End Castle and burned the Stormlands to the ground.- Went to the Tower of Joy and knocked up Lyana Stark.- Robert was furious and demanded Trial by Combat.  I appointed Ser Arthur Dayne, Sword of Morning as my champion.  - Robert is diced to pieces.  Dayne maybe breaks a sweat and spends days washing blood out of his white cloak.- I went back to the Tower of Joy and knocked up Lyanna once more for good measure.- Rebellion ends and everybody falls in line for a few months.  - My♥♥♥♥♥♥of a little brother, Viserys, somehow gains thousands of supporters and attempts to usurp the throne. - I uncovered his plot and had him thrown in the Black Cells.- He is 11 years old so the Night's Watch won't take him.  I have him executed instead.- The High Septon hated that and declares a holy war against me.  Nearly all the lords in the Seven Kingdoms join in.- None of my vassals answer my calls for aid.  - I almost surrender when I realize the leader of the rebellion is the High Septon and located with me in King's Landing.- I quickly raised a levy and stormed Baelor's Sept.- The High Septon is dragged out, imprisioned and sent to The Wall.- The Second Rebellion ended the next day.- I made all the factions that were mad at me inter-marry.  - With about 200 weddings going on, nobody knows who to fight anymore so I've bought myself some time.- Currently, I am searching for dragon eggs in Essos.23/10, Would kidnap Lyanna and send everyone else to The Wall again.Thank you Paradox and CK2: AGOT Dev Team!

												Crusader Kings II is a game from those masters of ""grand strategy"", Paradox Interactive. I never played the original Crusader Kings, but Crusader Kings II has been one of the most consistantly enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a strategy game. Even with 150 hours under my belt, I'm still gaining skill, and with every DLC, I'm encountering new events and new ways to play. Even the base game is a delight to play, but unlike many other games, the DLC is actually worth having, and every major DLC expansion adds a new dimension to the gameplay. When I first started playing, even with just a couple of hours of experience, I knew enough to be competitive. If you're new to Paradox Titles, I'd suggest checking out a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube, or reading T.J. Hafer's wonderful ""Crusader Kings Chronicles"" on the PC Gamer web site. The game is a sandbox, so your goals are your own. You can try to create an Empire, or you can just try to hold on to what you have at the start of the game. You can use military conquest to expand your holdings, or you can strategically marry and assassinate your way into greater power. Your options are limited only by your cunning and imagination.But it's so much more than just a strategy game. It's also got roleplaying elements. Every character has a set of five stats that range from 0 (totally incompetent) to 20 or higher (genius) that determine how he or she runs their County, Duchy, Kingdom, or Empire. Diplomacy makes your vassals and your neighbors like you more. Marshal determines how well you command your armies. Administrative determines how well you manage your finances, and how large a territory you can hold personally. Intrigue determines both your ability at plotting against your enemies and discovering plots your enemies are making against you. Learning has an effect on the rate of technological advancement, and several other factors.In addition to these five stats, each character has traits, both positive, like ""Brave"", ""Diligent"", or ""Just"", or negative like ""Craven"", ""Slothful"", or ""Arbitrary"". There are also numerous ""neutral"" modifiers, like ""Honest"" that increases your Diplomacy, but decreases your Intrigue. There are also genetic traits that can come into play, both good and bad. The first time you have a ""genius"" child, you'll be jumping for joy, and the first time you have an ""inbecille"", you'll be wondering how hard it would be to ""dispose"" of him. But be wary. That imbecille might be the only hope of continuing your line.Because that is what the game is about. It's not about your country. It's about your dynasty, your family line. Even if you start as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Emperor, and wind up as the Count of some random backwater in Eastern Europe, so long as your family line continues, your game continues. But even if you are the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, if you have no remaining members of your Dynasty, then it's game over.It's a complex, but not complicated, game. Make no mistake. There is a learning curve to this game, but once you've learned the basics, you will find yourself coming back to it again and again.			",9,19,0,19,19,2,19

SummaryAn amazingly complex and engrossing game that can make the hours fly by.ReviewCrusader Kings II is difficult to classify. It’s a grand strategy game, a sandbox game, and in some ways a political simulator. It also happens to be one of the best role-playing games I've ever played.  I’m not even sure where to begin describing it, but what I can say without reservation is that it’s extremely immersive and fun, which is quite a trick that developer Paradox Interactive pulled off when you consider that the vast majority of the gameplay takes place in menus.The premise is deceptively simple: you play as a king (hardly a surprise given the game's title), and your number one goal above all else is to have an heir in place who will claim your throne upon your death.  When your character dies, you assume the role of his heir, and so on down the line of succession.  Die without an heir and it's game over.But of course it’s not quite as simple as that.  As a king, you’re naturally going to want to expand your realm and accumulate wealth and prestige, and this is where you find the meat of the game.  When you start, you can choose to play as anything from a lowly vassal like a duke or a petty king ruling a single province to a monarch of an entire country.  This also serves as a secondary way to adjust the game’s difficulty since a duke or petty king is going to have a harder time of it than the ruler of an entire nation.And this is where things get interesting.  I call Crusader Kings II a role-playing game because it’s all about navigating the treacherous path of court intrigue and maintaining relationships with the other characters in the game.  Sometimes you might want to have a good relationship with someone, or sometimes you may want them to think very poorly of you, and there are numerous means for doing both, from performing favors, or handing out honorary titles (including Court Jester, which never makes the recipient happy), or even straight-up bribery.  If you have a troublesome vassal, you can try and woo him back into your good graces, throw him in jail, or plot to have him killed.  Any action you choose will always have long-term consequences, for good or ill.  For instance, if you arbitrarily throw someone in jail, or attempt to have them murdered and it’s discovered, you’ll take a relationship hit with other characters almost across the board, and this could be a problem if allies refuse to come to your aid during war, or you end up with a revolt on your hands, or other characters hatch their own plans to kill you or your heir!  It all becomes a delicate balancing act as you try to keep your friends (and enemies) happy while scheming to steal land and titles out from under their noses.In addition to good old fashioned political intrigue, you will also encounter a number of random story vignettes that present your character with various choices that create a short, branching narrative, the ultimate consequences of which could be positive or negative, depending on your decisions.When things come to blows, and they inevitably will, it’s time to raise an army and clash steel.  Unfortunately, this is not the most engrossing part of the game.  Your armies march around in multi-unit “blobs” represented by a single soldier sprite with a number indicating the size of the army and a small line representing its morale.  Essentially, if your numbers are higher than an enemy army’s numbers then you’ll (most likely) win the battle.  And that’s pretty much all there is to it: march your “blob” around, defeat other blobs, and lay siege to enemy provinces until your war score reaches 100% and you can force your foe to concede to your demands.  I’m not saying this is necessarily easy, and wars are extremely costly, and sometimes you’ll be thrown an unexpected wrinkle that will turn what you thought was an easy victory into a crushing defeat, but you’re not going to find detailed tactical gameplay here (although full disclosure compels me to mention that I’m not an expert in this game by any stretch, so there may be some nuance here that I’m missing).  At any rate, the simple combat mechanics are adequate because war really isn’t the focus of Crusader Kings II even if it is an important aspect given the setting.Crusader Kings II plays in real-time, but you can pause at any point if you need breathing room to untangle a particularly difficult political conflict.  You can still interact with the game when it’s paused, but your orders won’t take affect until you start the clock again.  This prevents the game from becoming overwhelming even when things get complicated, which can happen very quickly and often without warning.  Thankfully the interface is very well laid out and places the copious amounts of information you need to manage your empire within easy reach, usually no more than one or two mouse-clicks away.  However, it is a very complex game, and even with over 80-hours under my belt to date, I feel like I’ve still barely scratched the surface.  In order to understand Crusader Kings II, you need to have a basic understanding of Medieval politics and laws, and this isn’t something that most people possess.  For instance, a pop-up will inform you that you have a “Wrong type of holding in demesne”.  What does that even mean, and more importantly, how do you fix it?  Or you might discover that your kingdom is at risk of fragmenting into the hands of multiple petty rulers when your character dies because of a potential succession crisis.  Why is this happening, and what can you do about it?  The game’s manual and tutorial missions do a rather poor job preparing you for your career as a crusader king, so you’ll probably want to find some “Let’s play” videos or a strategy guide or two.  I also suggest keeping a web browser handy while you play because you’ll inevitably have questions throughout the course of the game.Graphically, Crusader Kings II is probably about as attractive as a game like this can be with the majority of the display occupied by a vast interactive 3D map.  Details are added and subtracted depending on your zoom level, so it’s easy to pull out for a quick overview and then zoom in close enough to see individual cities and holdings dotted across the landscape.  It also runs beautifully in Linux, which always scores extra points in my book.  Sound effects are pretty basic for the most part, but you’ll mostly be listening to the music anyway which is period appropriate orchestral selections.  It can get a little bit repetitive, but there are several music packs available as DLC to expand the score.Speaking of DLC, if you’re contemplating a purchase of Crusader Kings II, you might be staggered by the fact that there is, at the time of this writing, nearly $250 worth of full-priced DLC currently available, and you may find this off-putting, but consider this: the vanilla game offers a complete experience in and of itself and can give you hours of entertainment.  In fact, I would recommend you play it sans DLC at first to get a feel for the game and to decide which DLC actually appeals to you, because not all of it will (and you should probably wait until it’s on sale anyway to get the most bang for your bucks).  I personally only have around half of the available DLC including several expansions and some of the unit and music packs, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out simply because the other content doesn’t interest me.  I should also note that when Paradox does release a major expansion, it's always accompanied by a patch that adds new features and content to the base game for free.This review could easily be three times as long, and I still wouldn’t feel like I had given a comprehensive description of Crusader Kings II.  So let’s make this simple: It’s a great game.  Buy it.			",101,21,3,8,10,0,21

												An excellent game, thourghly immersive in its environment. With the couple of DLC i have, it is immensly enjoyable, with many playble factions, and Factions-within-Factions(playing as a count or Duke under a King/Emperor). Combat simulation is relativly simple, just move your army to the same region as the enemy, and it will auto-engage, not much micro-managing as far as i've found.  Political and governmental simulation is also a fairly easy thing to learn, but there is an ever deepening filed to play, with all the ins and outs constantly being learned about and balanced. Further adding to this is the constantly changing world, making alliances and ties to other nations very diverse. To what i can tell, the Development team went all out to bring a great game forth, highly recommend this, definetly worth the buy, as are many of the DLCs.10/10 for me, easily will take hours of my day away.[6/25/15 Edit]: In my Croatia campaign, successfully got my son killed in a war, then died from a wound in that same war, then beat it as my grandson.10/10, best war yet.

												Grand strategy game (real time with pause) taken to a very personal level: rather than making sure your country prospers, you are the head of a dynasty and growing prestige of your dynasty is your main interest.Being a ruler of a prospering country certainly helps with growing prestige, but at the end of the day your dynasty must prevail, not this or that country... When you die, you take up the mantle as your heir - and really the only way to lose is not to have a heir at all, never mind the possible ruin you put your kingdom (duchy? county? empire?) in.Feel like assassinating your old, barren wife yet? Or at least making some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to legitimize on the side?Have you seen the cinematic  on the store page? Go see it. If you think they're joking - nope, stuff like that can really happen. Every bit of it. And more. Much more. Real game of thrones  material here. You can build an army and conquer, but dividing with intrigue and tactical assassination is also a big thing.Emergent gameplay in a true strategy at its finest. The stories you can tell after you're done with your playthrough? Priceless.There may be quite a bit to take on at first learning-curve-wise but it *so* much worth it.  ",360,123,16,65,24,3,110

												If you are a fan of strategy games, and more specifically, grand strategy ganes (ig. Civ) crusader kings 2 is a must have game. The game begins in the year 867, or 1066 depending on if you own the ""The Old Gods"" expansion or not, and you must guide a noble family through the medievel era. This may seem bland to someone without experience with paradox interactive grand strategies, but it is certainly not. This game is very similar  to Game of Thrones(there is a Game of Thrones mod also) imagine playing as the lannisters, starks or any family in westeros of signifigance. As in Game of Thrones, intrigue is paramount. I have countless times murdered my children and siblings in the name of preserving my realm and i have been assassinated by my siblings and brothers countless times also. Intrigue however is not the only component of CKII, military, religious, and economic gameplay is as rewarding as Intrigue. When all of these elements work together, the Game is damn good. Imagine you are the king of Sweden. Your younger brother is the King of Norway and your uncle is your vassel, duke of Lappland with a measly 4 holdings(counties, castles, cities, and temples/churches/mosques). Your spymaster is unskilled and your uncles plot to claim your kingdom for himself has gone unnoticed. Even if the kingdom of Sweden is the most powerful of nations, you can still lose a war to revolting vassles. Especially if a foreign king like your afformentioned brother helps the rebels. It is gameplay like this that you experience in crusader kings but so much more dynamic than i could ever hope to explain on paper. In my opinion Crusader Kings II is the best grand strategy game ever, fans of the genre and newcomers alike can appreciate it: 9.5/10			",148,13,4,21,22,0,32

												You know, I feel like ,compared to some of the great players (e.g. those mad tings' with 2000+ hours invested into the game) I really haven't experienced that much. In fact, I haven't even managed to run through a full game yet, that is both from the DLC-given 769 Charlemagne starting date and the vanilla 1066 date, and I like to consider myself a competent player - atleast I would hope so by this point... BUT, by my sweet black baby jesus' grace, it was when all of this hit me that I decided to write this review.That is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.400+ hours of gameplay, nearing 500, and I still haven't managed to finish a game? CK2 is the ultimate strategy out there. It doesn't recquire particularly acute battle-planning however, that is all done by a simple combat simulator and AI Martial Ability, no. This sort of strategy is that of court intrigue, seducing the Queen of Lombardy and marrying her so your heir becomes King of Italy whilst also coming from a family of barbaric Norse pagans?What? The predominantly Catholic Italians don't like the idea of having a Pagan King and try revolt against you? Beat them down then, that's what your well groomed retinues are for.But still your Council might find themselves growning a tad bit agitated with your ritual sacrifice of their fellow Christians and might attempt to, instead of overthrowing you competely, limit your power with diplomacy and the use of a strange concept. Democracy. Well, ♥♥♥♥ them, send your spymaster with his seditious intent to capture or kill them.All this in the meagre period of twenty years.Who knows what other trials, tribulations and resounding triumphs, await you upon your purchase of this game? Well to answer that. No-one. Because the possibilities are, literally, absolutely infinite.Oh and I also suggest shelling out, legit, everything in your wallet on the main DLCs, which are everything exluding Aztec Invasion.

												It feels like this game was made for me. It's a highly detailed and story-driven Feudal Sim, and I love it. I chose it over the other paradox games because of the prospect of having to struggle within my own lands to get anything done. The DLC offer very different ways to play the different cultures, while still uniting it all in one map. Highly recommended if you are into this kind of thing, and it's especially good to start with a YouTube tutorial of some kind, especially reading the wiki. Has lots of depth.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid example of a once great game ruined through pointless revisions and unnecessary changes to the core mechanics. After patch 2.5 the gameplay is more tedium and frustration than it is fun or interesting, and CKII has become so buggy that it's borderline unplayable as certain government types.This game has been progressively worsening for a quite a while now, but conclave has absolutely broken the experience.Why?-The council exists only as a gameplay obstruction as opposed to an interesting feature on it's own.-Managing anything larger than a small kingdom will now result in endless revolts to increase council power, with very little the player can do to avoid it.-Defensive pacts are an interesting idea, but ultimately don't play nice with the game mechanics and aren't very historically accurate. (For an excellent example I played as Carloman Karling and I had the invasion of Saxony event fire, due to my previous war to press my claim on West Francia almost every independent slavic pagan declared war on me to defend the Saxons. Which by the way, makes absolutely no sense and results in an almost unwinnable conflict.)-Shattered retreat suffers from a similar problem mechanically while being a good idea in theory, it simply doesn't work well in game and makes some conflicts ridiculously difficult or just pointless.(holy wars and prepared invasions are the best examples of this)-The new education system makes creating a decent heir mostly reliant on rng as opposed to a chosen guardian's existing traits.Despite all this I would still say this is a decent game, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore. If you're going to buy CKII, get it on sale and avoid some of the dlc. Also roll back to a patch prior to conclave for a better experience.			",87,18,0,27,12,0,32

												Oh, don't get me wrong, it's an awesome game. But I feel like I'm playing a damn demo. 95% of the game is cordoned off. 75 dollars of DLC (maybe more)? I don't think so. I didn't pay for a 40 dollar demo. Nice business practice.			",122,15,2,12,16,1,28

												I have loved playing this game, but sadly, conclave has broken so many features of the game.  Your council is almost uncontrollable unless you are a boss, and crown authority is now pointless to mess with because you AI vassals do whatever they want regardless of your intent.

												I played CK2 using ireland from the year 887( Or near enough to it). I managed to conqure the rest of Ireland, Take most of the UK from the lords and kings over there. My first king managed to live to 100yr, but once he got to like 50yr things started to go a bit downhill (Madness). My younger wife was very bitter after finding out i been having an affair for a number of years with another woman. So to take revenge she decided once she became my regent that she was going to claim more and more of my land as her own (For the good of the kingdom in her words..yeah right).This on my death and all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s i bread meant my hair didnt get to be king for very long before getting killed by one of his half brothers...This half brother then decided to mary into a muslim fraction. This wasnt much of a problem until his hair decided he wanted to follow his mothers religion and then went on to change the religion of Ireland and most of the UK that i claimed. Its now the year 1024, it seems everyone hates me. No one seems to want to marry my children, A number of different fractions are coming for my head and my gold is running low.10 out of 10: Would become most wanted death man in the world again.

												Have you ever thought to yourself ""Hmm... I need something fun to do but my taxes don't need to be done for another few months"" then look no further, my dull friend! The ultimate border and treaty simulator is here to satisfy your every need. Ever wished you could have a wife and just divorce her and kill her for bearing no sons? Done! Ever wished you could just ruin everyone elses day because of their religion, like a kid kicking over someone's sand castle because ""Mine is better""? Look no further. Crusader Kings II is here to satisfy all your medieval fantisies (So long as though fantasies involve looking at political issues instead of any of the knighthood or battle aspects). If you like like strategy games so in depth that you can practically drown in them, this is for you!			",154,20,0,16,20,2,19

												By far, one of the best games I've played in my lifeIn Paradox's game progression this one is the first, and it occupies middle ages from 1066 to 1452 (or from 867 if you get the DLC for it). In game you basically have to choose dynasty and play till you die or till the game itself ends. And it's really ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. You might get kicked out of your throne and die poor with no heirs or you can survive and be emperor of whole Europe.This game is great fun because:1) It is really hardcore2) The map is quite big, so variety of dynasties to play is really decent3) Things go quite different every time you play, so it doesn't become repetitive4) There are some quite competitive achievements in game, for example restoring Roman Empire or sample5) It is quite historically interesting, you can watch how things changed around 1000 years ago6) Nice graphically made landscape7) It's not just about having wars. It's about being a ruler. You will have to do a lot of things there, from starting and ending wars to marrying your offspringsWhy this game isn't flawless:1) Some really stupid and unrealistic things might happen. For example, Russian kingdom turning to catholic religion or black-skinned king of Britain (This is what I had only, most noticeable things)2) There are really many DLCs and getting them can sometimes be worthy, the most significant ones are like 8$3) Some DLCs are really stupid, for example the one with Aztec invasion. It's just plain idiotic.4) This game might be sometimes TOO hardcore. You won't be able to play it normally before you complete tutorial, so bother yourself with that. And it's gonna take you a lot of time to start playing good. I actually started becoming good at this game after 100h only and still would sometimes get ♥♥♥♥ed.Overall, this game is a great fun if you want some good time-spender, if you want some historical interesting events, if you're tired of real-time strategy games or if you just crave some difficult gameplay and not-so-stupid games. This is what you have to get then.9.8/10, would play again and again			",161,33,5,11,14,1,17

												Hello Gamers! PET here with my Crusader Kings II review!First of all this is a hard game to pick up but once you do it will create one of the best and unique experiences you ever encounter (in video games lol).If you follow my video at the end of the review I guarantee you will be able to pick up the game. If not...CK2 is a Grand Strategy Game. You will start around year 1100 and play until around 1300 (don't remember the exact dates. You can change the start year but the end year will be the same).CK2 is a game about your dynasty, about politics, about your vassals and about surviving your dynasty. One of the reasons why this game is hard is that it does not give you a purpose. You can do whatever you want and this might be confusing to some people. You will get that ""now what?"" experience. Not only that but you will be able to play with any king/duke/count in Europe. As you see I wrote a person title and not a country. Why? Because in CK2 you play with a person from a dynasty. Your purpose is to expand your dynasty, marry your sons so they can create children, marry your daughters to other powerful rulers so you will have a claim on that territory... oh yes yes...CK2 follows the feudal system and that's one of the reasons why people find this game hard. For example you can not declare war on another person without having a De Jure claim. What does that mean? Well it means that you are entitle to that territory because you might have a title that contains that territory. Oh yes, you have titles.Really, I think it's much easier to just watch my review & tutorial here:

												So I started off as a lowly Welsh Count, a vassal of the King of Wales.  After a generations-long struggle to successfully build up enough strength to rise up against my king, the only son of my previous character was born.  A just, gregarious and well-loved leader saw a sudden surge of support from other Welsh Counts and even an Irish Duke across the Irish Sea.  After forming alliances and taking enough in taxes to bolster my growing army with another 3,000 men in the form of some European mercenaries, I challenged the Petty King of Wales and laid claim to each of his counties one by one.  The Kingdom of Brethonniad was born!150 years into the game, a complex web of marriage and strategic sowing of dynastic seeds in Irish wombs led to my eldest nephew, the Prince of Brethonniad and the heir to everything that I had fought for, not just lining up to inherit my crown but also preparing his own eldest son and heir to inherit not just the crown of Brethonniad but two Irish counties from his noble mother and, on top of that, a strong claim to the Isle of Man.This is the heir that the dynasty had been preparing the kingdom for all of this time.  Another kind and just character with military expertise and noble blood was coming, expected to unite Wales and Ireland against the English and begin to assert control over the whole of the British Isles.However, the elderly King of Brethonniad was not finished.In his dying years, he found a new lease of life following the death of his respected Norwegian wife and queen.  In his late fifties and of ill-health, the King sought a new wife with whom he could enjoy his dying days.  To the surprise of all involved, a child was conceived.  There was a new heir.      The previous heir was no longer next in line and his prodigal son, set to challenge the English, took a giant slip on his climb.Out of the frustration of those around him, the new king grew up to be a tyrant.  Imprisoning family members and mercilessly excecuting them at will left him with a rebellion on his hands.  Who was in charge of the rebellion? The previous heir, father of the prodigal son.  With little or no support from his vassals, the king was unable to recruit a strong enough army to quash the rebellion and lost his title to the usurper.  With only a female heir, not yet in her teens, he worried that she would not be strong enough to undo his destructive ways and recover the prestige of their lineage.  Little did that matter as he later remembered that he had changed the succession laws to absolute agnatic primogeniture in his proud idiocy and the titles passed on to a distant, obscure male relative married to the count of Fife.Wonderful game.  Would play again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was awesome. Key word 'was.' Poured a lot of time and effort into my Empire only to have an update absolutely ruin the ability to play any further. Apparently updates to this game have been doing this for awhile (making previous saves unplayable) the community would have you believe that plenty of warning is given on the forums. Whilst this may be true, purchase/playing of the game is in no way a binding agreement that a player must stay active on the forums and actively be a part of the community. Something you'll need to be (apparently) unless you don't want to be pre-warned about getting your save-games dicked. Of course there is plenty of warning about the available DLC in-game, but that takes precedence over anything else I guess... Great game, terrible update model. Extremely upset. Removed from my heart and /common file. :(EDIT: I gave the game a second chance and progressed well until receiving a sudden and inexplicable error message forced that game to a close too. I could not find any information online about what was happening so I signed up to the Paradox forums themselves and left a post in the relevant location asking for tech support. It has been viewed but gone unreplied to for the past two days. I guess you're scrwed whether you join the forums or not. In conclusion: don't purchase the game and don't support the developers. All in all a very frustrating experience playing (?) and dealing with their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥performance in the gaming industry. Not good enough.			",22,0,0,1,2,0,3

												CK2: Used to be good, ruined by ahistorical, impractical, overpriced, and game-breaking DLC. Probably one of the few games left that charges you for cosmetics & add-ons in addition to the base price. Don't buy the DLC even on sale, best not support this business practice. Charging for cosmetics and add-ons are acceptable only when a game is F2P, and this mentality is spreading thoughout the gaming industry. Paradox used to release fewer but more complete DLC in the past, but they are regressing.Paradox: Godd*mit Johan, fix games instead of milking them. Fix AI instead of being lazy and putting a land passage across Otranto. For once in your life, read feedback outside of the Paradox forums. The reviews are negative for all your recent DLC. Stop acting like a butthurt kid when you see the slightest form of even constructive criticism.EDIT: Oh great, they released yet another DLC to fix the problems of the old one...EDIT2: Everyone seems to suddenly love the game again. Well I will not be fooled.			",50,8,0,11,14,0,16

												Crusader Kings II is by far the most detailed dynastic sim (and only decent one) I've had the pleasure of playing. Imagine becoming any landed nobleman from the past and rewriting your family- and the world's, history. Any strategy gamer or enthusiast should look to this title if they want a level of depth and detail beyond anything else out in the market. Better yet, finish a play through and then load your save game file onto Europa Universalis 4 and watch your empire through the next era of history!			",76,15,0,29,26,4,44

												Crusader Kings II is the ultimate medieval strategy game, period.  And this is coming from a guy that has a BA in history from Rhodes College with a focus on medieval studies.  It is the type of game that you won't instantly love or even understand.  That's because it's an incredibly deep and complex game that has almost infinite replayability.  You can play as a lowly count of a single territory and try to work your way up to king (or emperor).  You can also start as a duke, king or even William the Conqueror and try to hold onto England as a Norman! Along the way, there will be treachery, fighting with your vassals, fantastic feasts (where you even choose the food and entertainment), religious crusades, crazy random events, arranged marriages, succession wars, family and court politics, etc. etc!   For those of you who have played Europa Universalis IV, this game has some similarities but is more focused on personal relationships.  You play as a dynasty from a single bloodline.  If all of your heirs of the bloodline die out, it's game over!  When your ruler dies, depending on the laws you set, your heir takes over.  To top it off, this game has TONs of fantastic expansion packs.  Play as the vikings starting even early in the 900s or play as a merchant republic, etc. etc.  The game is so deep and detailed that you don't even need the expansions, but they will keep you busy for hundreds of hours more.  They really nailed the feudal system and all of its complex and crazy relationships.  I once built a castle in my home territory.  I gave it to a relative and thought I was safe.  They married a powerful princess from Norway who kept her title.  All of a sudden, I had a single foreign castle right in the middle of Ireland!  It reminded me of the French castle in Monty Python's Holy Grail! The music is fantastic and really fits with the period.  The one negative I will say is that the learning curve is steep and the tutorials are prettymuch awful.  To really play this game, you'll need to invest some time either reading a few guides or watching some tutorial videos.  (I recommend Ck2 guide for newbies youtube series by SeeKayEm99.  There's a ton of parts and a few things are outdated but it's still great for learning.  You only need to watch the first few to get the hang of things)  So, I would heartily recommend this game to someone who loves strategy games and a challenge as well as history.  Be warned that there's some micromanagement involved.  Sometimes, your heir will need a royal marriage and you'll need to spend some time looking at various matches and alliances around the world.  Anyway, pick this game up if you have patience, love strategy games, and don't mind a steep learning curve.			",132,64,7,64,43,0,51

												I don't write many reviews but, I think I've sunk enough time into this game to give my thoughts. And my thoughts are- Pretty darn good. Sure, when I first got the game I had the same problems most have, I looked at itm the tutorial and repeated a hundred times. ""What the %$# do I do?"" But when things start to fall into place and you know what's going on and how to control things. It's wonderful.I love history, and this game is reliving, and rewriting history all in one go. Ever curious to what would have happened in 800ad if Ireland united and took over all of Britannia and became a medieval superpower? Try it out! It won't be easy, starting as a lone Irish count working your way up to unite ireland while staving off the vikings, scots, welsh and english (sometimes others!) But it's rewarding to look at your family tree, see your starting count ""Count Bob of Connacht"" and look down to his current living great gandson ""Emperor Bob III of Britannia."" And relive all the intrigue, war and crazy things in your head that happened from A to B for your dynasty.It doesn't end there. The ""Irish Empire"" is born- You really think the Frensh, or the Holy Roman Empire is going to let you have all the power untested? You think  aJealous half brother count is not going to start a revolution. Should you make them fear you, love you, respect you? Combinations of all? Go completely crazy? The choices are endless, victories and defeats.Ireland aint yer thing? Well with all the DLC you can really be anyone, Original game gives you access to most of the European nations of Catholic and Orthodox beliefs. Old gods lets you start form a earlier time period and play any Pagan religion. Sword of Islam allows any Islamic nation and so on!Mods are also great, giving more and more gameplay. Ever wanted to play ""Game of Thrones"" on CK2? There's a mod for that. Want to start in ""The old gods"" time period and make every nation no larger than one territory and see what empires arise where? There's a mod for that.Endless game, endless fun.9.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the first two weeks of playing Crusader Kings 2 I sucked so bad at managing my dynasty that game sessions usually lasted for about an hour or so before they descended into chaos, civil wars and invasions, which inevitably lead to the complete annihilation of the great house of Insertnamehere and its disappearance from the pages of history.  And I didn't even mind.  Even when you fail at CS2, you fail so spectacularly and so interestingly that you can't help but enjoy yourself. Mayhap a long lost cousin emerged with an army and an ultimatum, seizing the throne and throwing you from high king to lowly duke? Mayhap that lovingly concocted poisonous wine you gave your spouse for you anniversary finally kicked in, but you were discovered and now his or her lover plots revenge? Or mayhap you managed to unite the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity under the watchful eye of a united Rome, only to have the Golden Horde drop by for tea and biscuits?Whatever happens you'll greet it with a grin 'cause, damn it, you won't be able to help yourself.

												For the first two weeks of playing Crusader Kings 2 I sucked so bad at managing my dynasty that game sessions usually lasted for about an hour or so before they descended into chaos, civil wars and invasions, which inevitably lead to the complete annihilation of the great house of Insertnamehere and its disappearance from the pages of history.  And I didn't even mind.  Even when you fail at CS2, you fail so spectacularly and so interestingly that you can't help but enjoy yourself. Mayhap a long lost cousin emerged with an army and an ultimatum, seizing the throne and throwing you from high king to lowly duke? Mayhap that lovingly concocted poisonous wine you gave your spouse for you anniversary finally kicked in, but you were discovered and now his or her lover plots revenge? Or mayhap you managed to unite the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity under the watchful eye of a united Rome, only to have the Golden Horde drop by for tea and biscuits?Whatever happens you'll greet it with a grin 'cause, damn it, you won't be able to help yourself.

												If you like games with emergent story (That is, the story is created through your gameplay rather than pre-written), than this is an excellent game for you.  I'm on about my 4th or so dynasty, and I love the drama that comes out of pulling off some clever tricks of politics or military strategy.  For example: In my most recent game, I started as the to-be-King of Sweden.  I united Sweden before the end of my first character (when you die, you switch to playing your heir), and spent my second generation adding Norway and pieces of Ireland and Holland to the mix.  I was having some problems in the heir department though, even with 3 young concubines all I was producing was daughters (about 6 of them).   Worried about how the Norse would react to a female ruler, I sighed with relief when I finally got a son... only to have him murdered in his crib by his eldest sister.  I banished her from my kingdom and then fortunately had another son... and then a third.   This was a problem, because as the King of Norway and of Sweden, my sons would each inherit a different country, dividing my empire in half right as I prepared to go to war with Denmark to unite Scandanavia.  Unfortunately, I died of old age before I could come up with a solution (like murdering one of the sons, or finding some other way to disinherit them).   So now I was the 5 year old king of Sweden, and my 4 year old brother was king of Norway.  Within a week, both kingdoms were in open rebellion.   I was able to help my little brother keep his throne initially, but when a section of the Sumonesko to the north declared their independence, I wasn't able to hold off the wars and I had to surrender the Throne.  Deciding the best solution would be to get myself killed and pass my titles to my little brother, I placed myself under the mentor ship of a 21 Intrigue vassal who hated me.  This surprisingly did not result in my death, but instead I hit 16 with a 21 in Intrigue myself.  I murdered the king who had overthrown me, and then his oldest daughter, mostly out of spite (but also to keep the realm in chaos while I finished the war with the Sumonesko).  Finally, I was ready, and declared war on the child-Queen-usurper and found about 3/4ths of the nation willing to join me (the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who threw me off the throne 15 years ago, mostly).  I retook the throne and I'm recovering Norway and the north from the barbarians who moved in, and preparing once more to move on Denmark.  Long live Sweden!			",220,54,2,44,36,0,53

												Crusader Kings II is not Civilization. And, unlike other Paradox games such as the Europa Universalis series, it is not hard to learn. You play as a ruler, of a county, a duchy, a kingdom, or an empire. You choose initially from the set of rulers available at the start of the game, which is by default anyone in power in 1066 CE Europe (Further back with the Old Gods expansion) and from then on, things get rough. If your ruler dies, you then play as your immediate heir. If you have no heir, then you lose the game, so the simplest goal would be to have your dynasty survive the lenght of the game (some 400 years). Only there's so much more to do than survive. You have to plan marriages for your daughters and sons, deal with an often angry Pope, vicious neighbors with claims on your lands, angry subordinates who may be plotting to kill you or usurp your titles, a derelict king or queen who thinks they're posessed by the devil and are putting the kingdom you belong to on the fast track to destruction, an angry horde of mongols rapidly advancing, a holy war tearing apart a nearby kingdom, and so much more. It doesn't take long to get immediately caught up in the scheming and politics of even the tiniest duchy, and before you know it two hundred years have passed, kingdoms have risen and fallen, assassins have come and gone, plagues have ruined your best laid plans for succession, and you realize it's eight AM and you've been caught up in medieval rulership for all night.

												Probably the best game Paradox has ever made. The game is a complex sandbox where you play as nobility in the real world, trying to forge your dynasty into every corner of Europe, Arabia or India. You can play anyone from a lowly count, up to the emperor of the medieval roman empires.It has happened that I've devilishly laughed with great geniune delight as I expanded my kingdom of Burgundy deep into the HRE, wondering for just a moment why I don't have any friends. However that was instantly replaced by rage and confusion as soon as I realized that my character had died ""under suspiscious circumstances"", and that I now had to deal with an astronomically awkward inheiritance.There are also many ways to challenge yourself though the game as you can choose to play either as a christian, muslim, viking or slavic nomad ruler - most often carving out a place in the world for yourself and your dynasty through conquest, murder and marriages. Every gameplay feels meaningful depending on who you choose to play as because every place and every situation your happen to find yourself in present new obstacles to overcome. It's only in the later part of the game when you tend to snowball that the game slows down.I recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, but alas it has taken a wrong turn with the latest DLC; Conclave.This is not a review. Instead I'll give instructions to the buyers...I consider this game done before the latest expansion, and I do recommend buying this game and all the DLC that seem interesting (maybe not Sunset Invasion even if it seems interesting).And just to make sure you have exluded the game breaking DLC, revert the game from the Steam game beta participation to version 2.4.5.I think version 2.4.5 and most of the DLC released until it will give you at least few hundred hours of addictive gameplay...I do not have the latest and the second last expansion Horse Lords, but as the the expansions (dlc) are released, game ai, mechanics and map does change to include the content for the basic game. When you buy the DLC, you get to play the content yourself, instead if you don't have it, you cannot use it, only ai can. Also, you can disable the bought dlc any time if you do not want to include it (Sunset Invasion).I've not played the Conclave content myself, instead i played 50 hours after the update and didn't like most of the changes which seemed to have removed some of the prior content and replace it with poorly working substitute. It didn't make sense to buy it, so I just reverted the game to a point where it was working without it.Also, there are some other DLC that make changes to the basic game, so if you plan to play only with the basic game, maybe some very early version is the best way to go. My experience, I bought most of the DLC before I started playing. (Until Old Gods)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok let me start off with the game itself, the game is amazing. One of the most addicting games i've ever played (I played the game from 2013 on a pirated version, but lets ignore that). Even without dlcs the game is super fun and you can spend alot of hours just conquering,role playing,plotting and bringing the heathens to their knees. There's so much content in vanilla itself that I can't blame them for charging alot for dlcs, yet I can't stop but think that alot of dlcs (Like portraits and unit packs) should have been added into the game free of charge, or atleast they could have added some way of getting ingame currency with achievements so that you could atleast once in awhile get a dlc when you explore the vanilla content to the maximum. Or another good solution would be to lower the price on older dlcs, so that the whole dlc pack doesn't cost 3-4 times the price of the game itself.What's also problematic is the multiplayer, it's rather buggy and weird as in alot of paradox titles, alot of ""out of sync"" problems.Pros: Extremely alot of content in vanilla, on which you can spend alot of time playing. Really fun game overall. Rather fun 'big' dlcs like : The old gods, Sword of Islam etc...Cons: Way too much milking the whole dlc thing (All the dlcs cost 4 times more than the game itself,seriously paradox?!) to the point where you need to pay money so that your whole map isn't filled with only 2 character type sprites and where you need to pay money so that your crusader units look like crusaders.Overall the game is great, and it's quite sad how paradox is milking the whole dlc thing.

Instead of bad factions. And I wish there were more things to fighting wise. Like This guys a good fighter and this guy sucks. I really like the idea of the duel system on A Game of Thrones mod.

Then your great uncle Frank will take over for you and several civil wars will ensue for control of your kingdom. At the same time 2 different super powers will decide to pounce on you in your moment of weakness, Then all of a sudden British Italy with a Norse king is asking the Indian pope for permission to wage a crusade against the Irish-Iberian muslims.

												Crusader Kings II is not Civilization. And, unlike other Paradox games such as the Europa Universalis series, it is not hard to learn. You play as a ruler, of a county, a duchy, a kingdom, or an empire. You choose initially from the set of rulers available at the start of the game, which is by default anyone in power in 1066 CE Europe (Further back with the Old Gods expansion) and from then on, things get rough. If your ruler dies, you then play as your immediate heir. If you have no heir, then you lose the game, so the simplest goal would be to have your dynasty survive the lenght of the game (some 400 years). Only there's so much more to do than survive. You have to plan marriages for your daughters and sons, deal with an often angry Pope, vicious neighbors with claims on your lands, angry subordinates who may be plotting to kill you or usurp your titles, a derelict king or queen who thinks they're posessed by the devil and are putting the kingdom you belong to on the fast track to destruction, an angry horde of mongols rapidly advancing, a holy war tearing apart a nearby kingdom, and so much more. It doesn't take long to get immediately caught up in the scheming and politics of even the tiniest duchy, and before you know it two hundred years have passed, kingdoms have risen and fallen, assassins have come and gone, plagues have ruined your best laid plans for succession, and you realize it's eight AM and you've been caught up in medieval rulership for all night.

												After a whole lot of hours on this game, I feel I owe it a more detailed review.Crusader Kings 2, ultimately, is an experience. This is a good thing and it's most active selling point - It's not a game you win or lose, it's a game you craft stories from - as all the other reviews will likely show!It is a game that appeals to multiple playstyles. If you want to be the grand overseer, some sort of mini-god surveying all that you have and making incredibly far-sighted decisions about where to conquer, who to ally with and what wars to start, looking at it as a gamer rather than a character? You can.If you want to look at it as the character you are, say King Eucedis ""The Fat"" Salian of England, roleplaying as a man obsessed by excess, greed and pride, while simultaneously ruining future generations of your family tree by seducing all the courtier's wives and having a large pool of illegitemate children? You canIf you want to play it as a complete and total joviality, name your family the ""Megatrons"" and rename every single English city after each Sonic the Hedgehog level, because why not? You can.All of these and many more are games I've had. Sometimes the game hates you and wants you to suffer, such as letting your 25 year old genius, attractive king who has all the claims in the world die from a cough, leaving you to inherit as your 1 year old, dumb, hairlipped son, who immediately gets rebelled on by his better brother, leaving you a peniless and landless wreck. At other times, the game loves you and even though you played as a merciless, heartless father who had a child with his eldest son's wife (who also never had any more children) and then he immediately dies and because of your inheritance said child inherits, but the brother ends up staying loyal and true, which gives you more than enough forces to make the others kow-tow.All of the above scenarios have happened. More have too. More still will. If you enjoy having fun stories to tell people, or even fun stories to look back on, this game is for you.The only two downsides - The game has a lot of DLC, which all add a lot to the game. This is somewhat mitigated by them regularly being on sale, but the cost still adds up. I must admit though that even having that, I mostly still play as the Christian rulers that start off accessible, alongside the Norse - The key is to experiment after purchase of the base product with it online, as if the host has the DLC you can use it in an online match. That way you can get a feel for what you want. The second downside is the game layout. The game is not massive on visuals, aside from the pretty map and such, so most of it is small character portraits and menus. This has the side of making the game complicated because it's not initially easy to understand where you go wrong.But I promise you - if you put the time into the game, it pays off.

												When I first purchased this game, it was to please a friend who also owned it. But after a few hours of playtime I fell in love with it. All aspects of this game are excellent, from the family aspects of marrying yourself into new powerful families and raising children to be great rulers, to the intrigue aspects of plotting to kill your friends and enemies and safeguarding yourself from plots. I would recommend this game to anybody who is a fan of strategy games.			",40,2,0,1,6,1,3

												Pretty good game, and as they have just added India it's even better. But their is a good bit they should add maybe. Like more peace treaties and more events maybe? I feel the events are ruined because there aren't anymore events to experience. The mods make it better thought to, like CK2+. I wish they had more factions to, like to help the King out. Instead of bad factions. And I wish there were more things to fighting wise. Like This guys a good fighter and this guy sucks. I really like the idea of the duel system on A Game of Thrones mod. It was real interesting. Only because if you didnt have the right traits you died. And it was completely random also.			",39,6,0,16,2,0,6

												Crusader Kings II is a very good game. I think it's fun to play as a ruler and that you meet resistance along the way. You can pick ambitions, fulfill others ambitions so that they like you more. You can throw someone in prison, assassinate or excommunicate him/her but it might backfire on you. That CKII support mods is awesome, although I've only downloaded one so far.One of the best DLC:s I've bought is the Ruler Designer. With it you can change appearance, make the shield design as you want it and add traits. When I started playing this game I didn't have that many DLC:s and I felt that the base-game as it is was kind of boring. Luckily they sell the DLC:s cheaper from time to time. Now that I have played it for some time with the extra content I must say that it is much more fun. It's a shame that you have to pay extra money for DLC:s to be able to truly enjoy the gameplay. That's how it was for me anyway. The reward-system in this game could be better. Maybe some more in-game rewards in form of likes, money, prestige. To be able to get achievements on Steam, I have to play in Iron Mode. I have not dared to do that yet. It would be very nice if I could get some by just playing the game in any mode. CKII already has a lot of traits but I wouldn't mind to be able too choose among even more.I would absolutely recommend this game. If you like strategy then I think you would like CKII. It is not the easiest game. The longest rule I've achieved is until my Kings son took over after his fathers death. It was chaos from the start of the sons rule because he had some bad traits. The shortest rule I've experienced is one I've played recently. The man got sick and died shortly after. So many things can happen along the way and it's interesting to follow the rulers development. To try again with a new ruler after the last one failed. Something makes me keep playing it. Maybe it's the pace, the challenge or that you can customize so much. Or perhaps it's the freedom and choices. Doesn't really matter. I enjoy playing this and will keep doing just that. Maybe my new ruler will succeed where others failed. Maybe...

												Over 100 hours played and counting. Pretty decent strategy game.Pros:- Decent learning curve; not too hard, not too easy.- Variety of character customization makes for a good amount of different playthroughs.- Good Workshop content.- Vikings... 'nough said.Cons:- Some of the DLC doesn't seem worth the effort.- Occasionally slow gameplays (little to no events at all).Overall, I found it worth the money (bought collector's on sale). Only had 1 or 2 crashes, but it was mainly after an update. Would definitely recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game without its DLC is very limited for example you can't play another country/county/state etc... unless their Christian and a Monarchy type goverment.The reason why i don't recommend it is because unless you'r willing to cough up the full 130 something euro for the game and all or the majority of its DLC it will feel like a fracition of what you thought it would be,but i suppose even then with it's limitations (in the Vanilla game,not with dlc) there is undoubtly great time to be in CK2 but no game should be able to get away with a price tag of 130 unless their gonna give something more then what i was supposed to have when i purchased the game.

												Crusader Kings II is my favorite game of all time. Its depth, complexity, and staying power are unmatched by any other game I've played.That said... ♥♥♥♥ you, Paradox. The amount of DLC they've♥♥♥♥♥♥out for this game is absolutely shameful. Discounting all the cosmetic stuff, most of the big content expansions are things that should have been in the game from the beginning, and frankly the game is nearly unplayable without at least a couple of them.Play it, it's great. But the gnawing feeling of guilt you get when you realize you bought into the DLC scam they're running here lessens the experience a bit.			",167,27,1,46,12,1,13

												To start off this game has been an amazing journey, I bought this because it was in my queue long ago. I am just a person who is interested in one strategy games and two historical games. This one fit the bill perfectly and when I purchased it I was extremely impressed. Before playing this I had never heard of Paradox nor played any of their games, after this game however, I love to play all of their games. This game is exciting and allows you to rule as your own medieval ruler after that you can do just about anything you want. The community for mods is also great and makes excellent improvements to the game the devs also have made excellent expansion packs. Many reviews will talk about the devs failures and how DLC is over priced. I do not agree with that in any way, I have slowly purchased most of the dlc and have loved every bit of it. The DLC add great content to the game and bring in new and interesting features. Yes the game is a lot of money if you purchase the game and then all the DLC however, how I like to see it as this you are getting multiple games out of one game. You want to play as a Viking you can do that, you want to play as a Muslim Caliph you can do that, you want to be a Catholic King you can do that, you want to be a Byzantine count you can do that. My point out of that is you can be anything in this game you get the chance to make your own story over and over and over again. Sure the game is not perfect however, no game is the game is special however, and this game will allow you to have a great time on it. The learning curve is steep and at some points extremely hard, thats okay though thats the fun of the game the harder you have to work the more spectacular the experience will be. I hope you enjoyed this review and I would recommend you begin playing this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It was a tepid summer night and a fresh but soothing breeze flew over the landscape of the county. It wasn't just some county, it was the one county where Lady Justicia ruled fair and just. A county where no rules would be broken, no secessions could happen, where no farmer or subject would stand up against their beloved duke.This is the story of your county. After investing gold into the possibility of renaming the ancient old and unfitting county name, your county ""Anal for free"" felt renewed. Reforms flushed through your political system and your subjects were simply happy with what they had and felt treated fair in your feudal government.The pope tried to gain influence of your county once again, so you decided to do what the gods actually wanted from you and you moved back in time to relive the old roman religions, pray to Jupiter and from there you can achieve something even greater:  Restore the Imperium Romanum in its greatest fashion. Bring back peace, power and prosperity to every subject in the known world with you as their Caesar and with the hellenistic gods at your side.Your dream of restoring the Imperium was brought down to reality when someone knocked on the door behind the balcony you stood one.""My lord, you have to come out and do something! Quickly!!""You sighed. Once again, some vasall who doesn't like your new traditions tries to make himself and his fiefdom independant or join another county - obviously illegally, since you are their de jure feudal lord for hunderds of years already.You turn around and look into the blue eyes of your servant. She was a young girl, merely 20 and already mother of 16 children of which 12 were mongrels. However, when she was walking through your capital, trying to climb over the piles of garbage and excrements that once again piled up in the middle of the main market, you couldn't resist to stop your palanquin and have her join you.It was the best sex you had in your long 50 year old life. Your other twentyfour wives didn't really like the new girl, but you had all right to rule both over your god given county as well as over your women, so none of them actually had a choice and those who disagreed with that simply died in a tragic carriage accident.You slowly walked over to her and touched her face. She cringed for a moment and looked at you with her begging, big eyes. You ignored your empathy and pushed her back inside, onto your bed. Quickly you tore down her dirty dress and without even really noticing, you slapped her eleven times because she started to scream and begged you to not do what you decided to do seconds ago.""P-p-p-please my lord, not again, I'm already pregnant again!"", she begged. Without even thinking about stopping for a second, you simply whispered: ""No worries, I'll clear that pipe and make room for a new one.""You felt the feeling of pure power when you sensed the warm, moist sensation on what you called the Small Lord. What an excellent feeling that was. This was the reason you beheaded twelve of your former wives and it was the reason you got the county in the first place, because who could have thought that the former duke died only two days after you married her daughter in an orderly way (because you bribed him before of course), so that you became the next one to herit the county.It was the sensation that made the world true and it should be the one that would keep humanity alive for another 1000 years at least.Your servant screamed again and you simply pressed your sweating hands on her mouth, pressing so hard that you wondered if you would break her petite chaw if you pushed just a little more.Slowly you moved the Small Duke back and forth, increasing the great sensation that made you feel comfortable and it wouldn't be long until you felt the power of a thousand suns pressing inside your duke. The power that empowered mills to crush wheat, the power that made it possible for a ox to plow your land for the farmer that was working on it. You moaned as your speed increased even further and your pressure became unsustainably high. All of the sudden, your inner steam was released through the valve that the gods gifted to you inside of the greatest of all limbs. You kept laying for a moment longer, then got up and went back to the balcony. Your glance moved slowly over the peaceful fields that your workers had worked on over the day to capture as much of the sun's power as possible to keep your war machines running and fill your treasury.The moon watched over what the gods gifted to you and you were happy. After turning around, you realized that, once again, another servant could not keep up with your power and had to concede at your might. ""Oh well"", you thought, ""I'm sure she got enough money to pay Charon for her last trip.""Quickly you grabbed her leg and threw it out of your now blood filled bed, so that she landed on the other two corpses that you forgot to throw out last morning. You called for your only male servant that you employed only for the reason of reliability and had him move them all out of your chamber.You went back on the balcony and took a last glance at the farms - your farms - that were burning. You ignored the sounds of dying farmers and screaming children, while the troops of the neighbor county moved their trebuchet in position to hit your castle below you. Thousands of armed soldiers who tried to take away what you alone owned to enslave your people and make them part of another empire.The smell of burning wood and blood filled your nose. It was a good night.And it was good to be the king.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game. You must LOVE Grand Strategy games for enjoying it, since here you have to take next to everything into account: Not only making sure that your territory is prosperous and that you have a nice economy, but also taking real care of diplomatic relations, religiosity, lineage (you don't want to lose because you had no children), vassals and liege...But, how is it that I vote it negative? The DLC.There are a lot of DLC that are way too expensive for what they bring. It really is annoying to see such prices for things that should be in the original game, such as new textures for armies or new portraits.			",40,35,0,7,7,2,23

												Brilliant game.Even without mods (but with some DLC) the game is still amazing. Dealing with Vikings, Muslims, Christians, Mongols, your neighbours and your friends is a real struggle at times. The game's combat system is great and the dynasty idea along with the ability to rise from a county to a kingdom is so fun!My only real complaint is: Surely your vassals would be afriad of you? I think the vassals revolt far too much and considering that you know of their faction couldn't you not arrest them for Treason?Playing as Muslim, Viking, Slavic, Mogol or Christian is so very fun, with tonnes of experiances in each playthrough not one will be the same. Great game!Oh, and it wants all your money for over expencive DLC's, or just play with a friend on multiplayer and use their DLC's.			",27,6,0,8,14,0,17

												A grand-strategy from the masters of the genre Paradox Development Studio. The game will feel familiar to those that have played other games from the developer, Europa Universalis etc, yet will be refreshing and worthwhile because of its focus on intrigue and dynasties rather than trade and nation level politics. Crusader Kings II is one of the best, if not the best, grand-strategy game of recent years. The game offers hundreds of hours of gameplay (especially if you have the expansions) because of the vastly different experiences the various religions, cultures and ranks of nobility offer. The RPG elements and focus on your personal dynasty add another layer of depth with the micromanagement of every marriage, alliance and well placed dagger in the unfortunate cousin's back. The game is full of events from restoring the Roman Empire to building a flying machine, which add a lot of flavor and keep the playthroughs interesting and amusing. The game also has a very good modding community, with mods ranging from the small ones that bring alternate flags and portraits to the total conversion mods such as: 'A song of Ice and Fire' mod:  Game of Thrones [forum.paradoxplaza.com]'Elder Scrolls' mod:  Elder Kings [forum.paradoxplaza.com]The mods, especially the total conversions, add a lot of value to the game.The game is not beginner friendly, not by a long shot. Despite being more simple than other games in the genre the information overload will be a lot, especially for new players. If you're willing to take the time to learn the game, it will be an amazing experience.  I recommend the game to anyone who's interested Game of Thrones-esque intrigue.			",437,84,13,67,59,6,96

												Strategy game, where you might actually care when a piece on your board dies. (Short version)Pros: it's a Great strategy game. Complex, and we'll thought out. It's the kinda game you would want to put down roots with you current territory, before foolishly beginning your quest for world domination.Cons: incomplete without these 30 other dlc. It really feels that way, like your missing out on half the game. I get what companies do that for, buy buyer beware, they aren't cheap.			",85,20,2,32,19,0,19

												Rating 8.5/10Make sure you buy the CK2 Complete Pack on sale(GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY)This is a must have for any grand strategy fan.  (BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			",49,0,4,8,18,1,23

												Crusader Kings 2, the inbreeding & murdering simulator where you control over your independent ( or not ) state and either horribly die to muslims, pagans or the Holy Roman Empire. Also your dynasty has other independent kingdoms under their rule and you're their heir, so have fun plotting to kill ONE of them for 10 years only to have them get a child, another child and another after that. Then you realise you're a pagan as well and you could have just gone for the subjugation of Norway + Denmark. Suddenly you're in Spain and the muslims kick your♥♥♥♥♥until your daughter marries the 9th princess of the HRE and suddenly you own Jerusalem. Also it's been two days since you started playing.

												A game like no other. Yes, it is mostly watching the map and sometimes giving orders (which means clicking 2 or 3 buttons). But if you want a medival simulation as realistic as possible, then this is the game for you. Just do not expect a lot of action going on. Also do not expect a real-time or turn-based strategy game. This game is not about conquering the world (Europa Universalis IV might be more your game then...), it is about simulating the feudal system. Therefore, there are mechanisms in the game, such as inefficient taxation when you own too many provinces or the gavelkind succession laws that splits your realm between your children when you die. While these might look like huge fun-blockers for an average gamer, they perfectly make sense in this game. Again, this is a feudal simulation and it excels at this.Recommended DLCs: The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome.For long-term playability: there is a huge amount of mods, including some total conversion mods that put you in the world of Middle-Earth (Lord of the Rings) or Westeros (""Song of Ice and Fire"" aka ""Game of Thrones"").

												This is a sandbox game where you given direct control of a single individual with the goal of preserving your family legacy. Gameplay is strategic and chaotic. It's one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time and I did start to really get into my character and their families.For example,  One of the Nordic Kings sieged my castle in Dorset while my army was away helping an allied king, imprisoned my pregnant wife and then after she gave birth to my first son (while I had Agnatic Primogeniture Succession laws), held HIM hostage, took my wife as his concubine - and then continued to siege my lands.When my army finally returned to the de jure Kingdom of England to take revenge, I was faced with 10 to 1 odds and no allies strong enough to make a difference.  So I decided I would have the Nordic wife-stealer killed in his sleep. My (now technically) ex-wife was MORE than happy to contribute to the plot and he was killed in a carriage while travelling. My involvement was discovered and the Nordic King's son was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could not diplomatically persuade him to free her.So I tried a DIFFERENT plot against the son, except now I couldn't get anyone to back the plot. Even my ex-wife had moral qualms - she was free of her concubinage and had nothing personal against the 12 kid who we had thrust onto the throne. But I wanted my son and wife back.I couldn't use brute force, I lacked the numbers.I couldn't use diplomacy, I had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Nords too much.I couldn't use Intrigue, no one shared my vision.I couldn't use Religion, I wasn't pious enough.Sure enough, the 12-year old Nordic kid grew up to be a more terrifing fighter than his dad and decided to take his revenge by once again sieging Dorset.I was eventually thrust right back into the familiar postion of Elodie - except instead of a dead lumen mother, I had a dead duke dad. A young girl with no allies or experience needed to fight her enemies.Except where Elodie had magic powers and a kingdom's resouces, I was a poor muggle countess. It didn't end well.So I started a NEW game where I took particular note of the original Nordic King I was fighting and what he did and I have managed not to draw any attention to myself thus far.I am LOVING this game, but it was incredibly expensive even during the Summer Sale where everything was 75% off or more. That is perhaps the main problem with this game, although it has not deterred me.			",152,56,1,65,16,3,20

												One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. The amount of depth is amazing, and the text based build allows for very easy modding. Although some parts of the game may be ahistorical, owing the limitations of the game engine (Namely, the portrayal of Byzantium and the Islamic caliphates as decentralised, essentially feudal realms), there's still much fun to be had. With two years of DLC and patches under it's belt, and a further year (At least) to go, I can only see it getting better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're into medeval-themed games and enjoy strategy, boy is this the game for you.TL;DR Steep learning curve, have a friend / youtuber teach you, wait for the game to be on sale to get all the DLCThis game is incredibly fun, but the steep learning curve turns many people off though. Once you get a used to how the game works though, the possibilites are endless. I strongly recommend having a friend/family member teach you the basics of this game. What's that? You don't have any friends? Well lucky for you, there's a plethera of youtube videos that you can learn from, but it will take more time than being taught by someone in person. One of my favorites is ArumbaAnother thing that may seem ridiculous is the amount of DLC this game has, and that is not entirely incorrect. A lot of DLC is not essential, like the portiat DLC, but it does help with immersion. The essential DLC is just if you want to stay in Europe, but this game does offer playable characters from Iceland to India to the Asian Steppe. If the game is on sale, and you have $50 to spare, buy the complete edition of the game with all the DLCBEFORE BUYING DLC, MAKE SURE YOU READ THEIR DESCRIPTIONEssential DLC:CharlemagneOld GodsWay of LifeRecommended DLC:Merchant RepublicLegacy of RomeRuler DesignerSons of Abraham			",95,14,0,11,19,2,14

												Rating 8.5/10Make sure you buy the CK2 Complete Pack on sale(GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY)This is a must have for any grand strategy fan.  (BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			",49,0,4,8,18,1,23

												Strategy game, where you might actually care when a piece on your board dies. (Short version)Pros: it's a Great strategy game. Complex, and we'll thought out. It's the kinda game you would want to put down roots with you current territory, before foolishly beginning your quest for world domination.Cons: incomplete without these 30 other dlc. It really feels that way, like your missing out on half the game. I get what companies do that for, buy buyer beware, they aren't cheap.			",85,20,2,32,19,0,19

												If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a ""sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator"" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?The short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your ""friend"" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥ It goes on and on.Now, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.Onto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.This game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.

												I assassinated a count and his 4 juvenile daughters just to make my borders line up like they were supposed to. I accidentally married my heir to a countess, so he went off to her court where she ruined his stats and then murdered his firstborn son (in her defense, the son sucked). I needed to get my vassals into line after a messy inheritance so I cranked up taxes then brutally crushed revolts to show all my nobles that im hardcore.

												My friends recommended this game to me and at first I was doubtful but I got it on sale at £7.50. This game. This game is amazing, the depth of the roleplaying and such. It's very surprising how attached you get to the character you play and those that you choose to ally yourself with. I played a game with my friend with him as the emperor of the Byzntine Empire and me as the count of Cyprus.- Joined a faction-Faction rebelled-Faction lost war-I got imprisoned by my friend-Got castrated and blinded-He made me king of Greece- 11/10 would get castrated againIn all seriousness though, this game is great, BUY IT NOW!!!!

												This is a sandbox game where you given direct control of a single individual with the goal of preserving your family legacy. Gameplay is strategic and chaotic. It's one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time and I did start to really get into my character and their families.For example,  One of the Nordic Kings sieged my castle in Dorset while my army was away helping an allied king, imprisoned my pregnant wife and then after she gave birth to my first son (while I had Agnatic Primogeniture Succession laws), held HIM hostage, took my wife as his concubine - and then continued to siege my lands.When my army finally returned to the de jure Kingdom of England to take revenge, I was faced with 10 to 1 odds and no allies strong enough to make a difference.  So I decided I would have the Nordic wife-stealer killed in his sleep. My (now technically) ex-wife was MORE than happy to contribute to the plot and he was killed in a carriage while travelling. My involvement was discovered and the Nordic King's son was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could not diplomatically persuade him to free her.So I tried a DIFFERENT plot against the son, except now I couldn't get anyone to back the plot. Even my ex-wife had moral qualms - she was free of her concubinage and had nothing personal against the 12 kid who we had thrust onto the throne. But I wanted my son and wife back.I couldn't use brute force, I lacked the numbers.I couldn't use diplomacy, I had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Nords too much.I couldn't use Intrigue, no one shared my vision.I couldn't use Religion, I wasn't pious enough.Sure enough, the 12-year old Nordic kid grew up to be a more terrifing fighter than his dad and decided to take his revenge by once again sieging Dorset.I was eventually thrust right back into the familiar postion of Elodie - except instead of a dead lumen mother, I had a dead duke dad. A young girl with no allies or experience needed to fight her enemies.Except where Elodie had magic powers and a kingdom's resouces, I was a poor muggle countess. It didn't end well.So I started a NEW game where I took particular note of the original Nordic King I was fighting and what he did and I have managed not to draw any attention to myself thus far.I am LOVING this game, but it was incredibly expensive even during the Summer Sale where everything was 75% off or more. That is perhaps the main problem with this game, although it has not deterred me.			",152,56,1,65,16,3,20

												These types of games always seemed to look a bit daunting and boring to me. However once giving this a go I am completely hooked! The depth in this game is amazing and you need to think of many ways to extend your boundrys, not just sending troops from one area to the next. Only problem is this game has made my old favorite Total war seem so arcade like and repetitive. I just wish there was a game that had the great campaign of CK2 and the epic battles of TW.

												Crusader Kings II is one of those glorious sandbox/emergent game play titles where success and failure are two sides of the same coin.  Start with just a county and build a legacy to staggering heights - then watch it come crashing down!  Conquer medieval Europe!  Unite Ireland!  Take back Spain!  Defend Rus from the Golden Horde!Be warned: like Dwarf Fortress, event details take place in your mind's eye.  There are no fancy graphics - just a lovingly detailed map, and units marching across it.  There are no cut scenes - just pop-ups containing a nice bit of art, event details, and your potential responses.It's like The Sims meets Civilization, and it's glorious.			",245,33,4,64,35,1,45

												Crusader Kings II (CKII) is the most tactical strategy game of all time. From the producers at Paradox, it incorporates a number of features missing from most strategy games, and provides a robust modding experience allowing players to rewrite history on their own terms. As a person who detested Paradox games, I went into CKII expecting to be turned away, but instead, I was sucked in to an intricately unique character development system.Unlike most strategy games focusing on war and city-management, CKII's character development system sets the bar for future grand strategy games. Literally every character in the game has traits. These traits culminate into a character's statistics, and their behavioural A.I. For example, characters with the ambitious trait are aggressive in pursuing actions to further their own personal agenda; however, characters with the content trait tend to be passive. Characters who are lustful pursue multiple relationships, deceitful characters are more driven to betray others.As your nation's leader, you must juggle between these behaviour types, and more, to create a peaceful and large country amongst threats from various warring fronts. You have rebels, political strife, assassinations, the Mongols, the Pope, and simply ill-fated events, such as the plague. Age is also a factor, and as you and your council grow older, your favorite characters are more suspectible to illness, and negative traits, such as being infirm. One day, my talented leader died because his heart wasn't healthy enough for sex. The game is profoundly deep, and you'll feel like it accounts for everything.Speaking of sex, the game dives into very controversial taboos that would make some developers squeamish. There is imprisonment, torture, concubines, bi-sexual relationships, pagan religions, cruelty to children, making someone eunich, and that's just the original CKII content! Intrepid modders have already added slavery, assassinating your own children, and fantasy content, such as Succubi, werewolves, and vampires. The game is what you make of it! CKII also has an ambitious Game of Thrones mod. It includes a customized map, and all the characters from the show with their corresponding behavioural traits, events, and more.CKII is a ground-breaking ambitious title setting the bar for future strategy games. It's character-driven concept is fresh and innovative, and I hope Sega's Total War series embraces some of its ideas.			",62,27,1,17,8,0,7

												A Grand piece of work in the Grand Strategy Genre of Grand Strategy games...Humor aside, the game has a strong focus on managing relationships (especially amongst your vassals) and guiding your dynasty from the Dark Ages to the High Middle Ages. The ""Sandbox"" effect and replayability of Crusader Kings II is by far it's most prominent feature, no two play-throughs will ever be similar. The Scope and scale of the game, and it's gameplay depth have been greatly increased since it's launch by many well-priced ""core expansions"" (Sword of Islam, Old Gods, The Republic, Way of Life, and Horse Lords). Offering countless hours of replayability, a good level of gameplay depth, and a vibrant modding community, Crusader Kings II is probably (in my opinion) one of the best Strategy Games of all time.

												I have enjoyed this game much more than I anticipated. My favorite aspect is the length of time in which to create a lasting ""family dynasty."" Paradox (the game studio) has offered, for better or worse depending, several downloadable content (""DLC""s), not all of which are crucial, but offer different enhancements. ""The Old Gods"", my reason for purchasing this particular DLC, allows the player to begin the game in AD867, instead of AD1066. Crusader Kings II, affectionately knowns as ""CK2"" which ends with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in AD1435 (I think), has a DLC with allows a ""saved game"" to be exported to another Paradox game, Europa Univeralis IV, or ""EU4."" EU4, which is quite different, allows the CK2 game to continue on past 1435. CK2, has more detail when it comes to creating a family dynasty that lasts through hundreds of years and allows a player to play in a dynastic succession. If you have more questions, please ask!

												""The king's eyes shot open, but he could not move. There was a hand over his mouth and a dagger above his head.""Crusader Kings II is perhaps the best and the worst. It makes you believe that there is so much more possible out there, and there is! But it's so hard. So, so hard. But it is not a punishing hard but rather a challenging hard. You become more and more invested and you want to complete this challenge given before you. The achievement system does well to provide you the challenges. But at the same time, because it alludes to so much, it's hard. Hard not to imagine that there could be more. With the new conclave (even if you have to pay for that), it does well to expand upon such expectations.

												Started as Lesser Poland, intent on forming an empire.I conquered 95% of the land I needed, working on getting a claim for that final province. This province is a holy site needed to reform my pagan faith, so I can push back on the never-ending tide of christianity. The religious fervour eating away at me, I tranformed into a lunatic possessed by the Devil himself.After bearing 28 children, my 3 concubines start conspiring. Unable to cope with my mad, insatiable lust, they fill the basement beneath an inn I happen to be staying in with manure and promptley set fire to it. I and my cohort are blown sky high.In the following succession crisis, Pomerania and Lithuania break free, Poland fragments and I'm left as a single county count with more claims than I can ever pursue, but powerless to press them.Would play again 10/10.

												Probably my favourite strategy game of all time. It is a very in-depth game which looks at the complex relations a ruler or lowly count must maintain to stay in control of your vast or small empire. You can play as anyone you want in Europe and beyond.The A Game of Thrones Mod is also amazing as it has totally converted the entire world, added events, traits and people to the vast world inspired by GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire.This game is regularly on sale so it is a good buy for those who like other games such as CIV 5, Total War or other Paradox Games such as Hearts of Iron 3 or Europa Universalis 4.EDIT: A few years on and this is still my favourite strategy game of all time, with each free patch and DLC release the game just gets better and better. Whilst the game may be daunting to learn in the beginning it is certainly worthwhile. The huge DLC list may be off putting but only a handful are what are considered the core DLC (ones that add major features to the game past visual packs like portraits or songs packs etc) and there are plenty of lists you can quickly find with a Google search of which are the most recommended.

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played. I'm going to be honest, if you want your game to be action packed, this is probably not a game for you, as it is a 100% strategic game, especially in Ironman (not cheating, only autosave) mode.I've tried explaining this game to a couple of people and it's just not possible, 'cause there is just so much to it.Not only can you roleplay perfectly in this game, you can raise your Dynasty from the Count of Paris to the King of France, it's all in your hands.It might not be action packed, but trust me, if you are playing as a Count with a 45 year old wife, 0 intrigue (trait for killing people etc.) no children, and thus no heir, you are going to be Game Over.I can't say enough how much enjoyment and pleasure this game will give you if you love medieval, strategic games.There is, however one downside to it, if you buy the game without DLC's you are going to have to pay A LOT of money to really enjoy the game (have the ability to play as Muslims, Jews etc.) There are ofcourse Game + DLC packs available on the internet which will give you enough DLC's to play the game properly. Game is NOT recommend without the mayor DLC's.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It has a VERY steep learning curve, but for strategy fans, I can't recommend it enough, its a very unique game. Basically, the goal is to last as long as you can, its over when ether you lose your last piece of land, or if your ruler dies without a heir. Its very complex, but so worth it once you get the hang of it. I mean really, how many games come along where you can say you had the Pope assassinated? Unlike a lot of strategy games, its not so much about build this and conqure everyone, its more about surviving and the political intrigue of the times. People will try to fabricate claims on your land, your second wife may try to have a son you had with your first wife assassinated so that her child will become the rightfull heir. You can start in Ireland and work your way up from count, to king, then conqure Scotland and England to form the Empire of Britannia. You can stratigically marry off your daughters to prestigous people of other countrys, then their sons will have claim to those lands. Theres different rules too, which you can change so that daughters can inherit, or that women can even inheret on the same grounds men do. There is a LOT to the game. The DLCs add even more, such as being able to play as pagens and sacrificeing your prisioners, if thats more your thing.			",94,20,0,53,32,2,20

												While very hard to get a grasp on at first once the intricacies of the game become apparent it will yield a phenomenal virtual experience that deserves praise. It is also due to these small, somewhat obscure mechanics, that the game allows for great replayability and a rewarding gameplay. Truly a game for either the history geek or the strategy-fanatic.

												While it's not for everyone, the hours I've sunk into this game are a testament to its quality. While not very graphically impressive, the game makes up for this lack by having highly detailed people and places, and is about as historically accurate as one can get. It's really more of a Dynastic/Kingdom sandbox simulator than a game, and really lets you experience what it would have been like to be Emperor, King, Duke, or Count. Critical thinking, and long term strategy are essential to surviving (even your own children you groom to be your heir may try and murder you if you don't pay attention, or have an inept spymaster.) You're more or less just living a story as you decide to tell it. Playing it like any other game will result in frustration, and the extinction of your house within the first 100 years.

												I may have only played this during the free week, but once I did, after the week was over I put it on my wishlist. It is a extremely strategically based game and requires your full attention during every moment. It is overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it really fast. Mastering however takes time and patience. If you like Civilization V, then think of this as a really really in-depth medieval era type game play, with a little less unit building and more economy based.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've spent waaaaay too much time in this game whether modding or playing it.This game certaintly has a hard learning curve but once you understand it the game is incredible.  I recommend choosing the Canary islands and speeding up the game for around 30 years and then saving and reentering as a random person in the world.  It is incredibly satisfying seeing the insanity that is possible and slowly working your way up the ranks.Even aside from the world the game brings, if you don't like medieval Europe then get a mod that is a post-apocalyptic North America or Skyrim or Game of Thrones.  You can add magic, werewolves, and many other assortment of Fantasy beings.  There's a mod that completely transforms the game into the space age.  Counties are now worlds and it adds a ton more content with all new cultures and religions.Even better than all that, if you don't like a small part of the game, even part of a mod, you can just take it out.  The coding language is incredibly easy to grasp and you can remove or change pretty much everything in the game.  The only real downside of the coding side of things is the fact that there aren't really many guides out there and the ones that are out there are kind of lame and lack support.  That is all forgiven by me though as you can easily reference other mods and the game code itself to see how they do things.To add even onto that the console in the game is well done with numerous commands.  If you want to cheat you can cheat and if you want to play legit you can play legit.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has some time and the small commitment to learn the game.

												The sheer brutality of ruling Medieval Europe made available to you on your computer. I doubt I will ever have the ""Paragon of Virtue"" trait in any of my games. In order to be a strong leader you have to be smart, keep your vassals happy, forge alliances, make sure your heir is strong and that he inherits all of your holdings. I bought the Charlemagne expansion pack, and I am currently playing Charlemagne.Crusader Kings 2 is an awesome alternate history generator- I was able to marry Gisela into the Byzantine Imperial family (historically the attempt to marry her to Leo, Constantine V's son, did not happen since the contract was broken. In real life she became a nun, and ultimately was the abess of Chelles Abbey), which provided the foundation for a formal alliance with the Byzantium in the game I am playing now. I can't wait to see how history unfolds based on this, and all of the other choices I have made up to now. The only drawback to the game is that it's really hard to play the game ""out of the box"". The tutorial modes are not that great. I had to watch a few videos of gameplay on Youtube, enough to get a basic grasp of the game. I watched these two and went on with my own designs for ruling. This is the better of the two gameplay vids that I watched:

												This game is only worth it if you've played other strategy games and gotten bored because there isn't enough detail.You can plot to kill a member of your court, join a war, start a war, arrange marriages, imprison people, execute those people and quell some rebellious villagers while you're at it.In my game I helped my uncle take over Norway and once he had won using his wealth and considerable armies I had him assassinated and inherited it all at almost no cost to myself. Felt very game of thrones-esque.The one thing to be warned of is that since I bought this game a couple years ago the developer has removed things from the game and resold them as DLC, they've also added a bunch with DLC and continue to do so but my advice is to be careful with your money because you can easily overspend on this game to have a more ""complete"" experience.*EDIT* I should add that this game is very poorly optimized so even though it's a very fancy 2D game you can easily encounter very significant FPS problems given that the game seems to only utilize one CPU core. It starts off strong but the longer the game the more Ai characters your computer has to manage and that slows it down considerably.			",154,17,4,31,27,2,55

												I do think I could write rivers of ink about this game but, mostly, that would be missing the point of a good review, in particular a review that should be good for new player.So let's start with basics and the game's feeling: you control a dinasty, you get to decide things about your realm, your subjects and your family members... and then your ruler dies horribly and then you get a new character and everything can change (usually for the worse, true GOT style).There is little logic in Crusader Kings II mechanics, and most of time this happens because it actually reflects historical Feudalism. If you like logical strategy games you are mostly in the wrong place.That does not mean that you cannot find your logic trail here and there bust most of the time you just need to KNOW what triggers what. It is mostly about knowledge and less about strategy.That said the best part is the narrative side. The mix of events, character personalities and objectives can create funny stories.It is, and it has been for a while, my ""just 5 more minutes"" game, replacing Civilization, and I am quite confident it will stay like that for a while.If you like this mix but also more coherent and hardcore strategy experience move toward Europa Universalis IV. That is the agme for you			",58,38,0,26,11,0,20

It takes a lot of time to learn, but can be very fun. It simulates family, friendships, rivalries, etc. Because of the complexity, it can be very intimidating for new players, so only buy it if you're willing to put in the massive amount of time it takes to familiarize yourself with the game's basic mechanics.

												This game... ahh this game. I was introduced to the world of Paradox games via EU3, and it was during the wait for EU4, it's acclaimed successor, that I fell into the world of Crusader Kings 2. Before anything else I will tell you this, Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I have spent countless hours having absurd amounts of fun staring at little marching sprites and glorified statistics pages on my computer screen. I have put more planning into securing lands, titles, marriages, etc in this game than I have on probably most anything in real life. I wouldn't have it any other way. The sheer amount of DLC is abusive and must be bought at massive steam discount. Much of it is purely aesthetic and need not actually be bought at all. But this is made up for with the sheer number of quality mods, including huge overhauls like my personal favorite Game of Thrones one. CK2 is basically the gaming embodiment of Game of Thrones whether the blades my little commanders are wielding are Valyrian or Damascus Steel.The point is you should buy this game. If you like strategy, if you like grand strategy, hell if you like court intrigue on TV, you will like this game. The learning curve can be a little steep. But a little effort to learn the game is paid back tenfold with endless story forging opportunity. Because that's what this game is, the most incredible merger of sandbox strategy and deep plot there ever was. Hopefully the people in your life will be at peace with seeing you less often.

												Crusader kings II is the holy grail of grand strategy games. On the grand scale you control a king and his realm (Or a duke or count if you'd like) and make various decisions to benefit it. On the smaller scale of things, you become entwined in a web of international politics and plots, domestic politics and plots, feudal succession laws and many other things. It's a game where everything in the world actively affects everything else in the world. DLC is not required at all, but it does double up the game size with each DLC, each adding even more replay value to a great game.			",143,8,1,15,7,1,29

												This is one of best strategy games on the market. It has one of the steepest learnign curves of any game I have every played. I highly recommend dumping the time required into so that you can get immersed in one of the best strategy games ever. On top of that, the developers, Paradox Interactive, regularly update the game along with the DLC that comes out. Crusader Kings II also stands as a reasonable example of good DLC. All of the DLC packs were made post launch and some of them are incredibly high quality. 8/10, would buy again.			",349,54,3,36,24,3,46

												If you are looking for a grand strategy game, this is it. I came to this game as a fan of the Total War series, and initially looked upon Crusader Kings II with trepidation. However, I can honestly say that this game more fully scratches the grand strategy itch than any other. A word of warning, however. The learning curve is extremely steep. If you try to jump right in, you will surely drown! That being said, if you can devote the time to learn this game's expansive intracacies (every time I play, I learn more), you will not be disappointed. Who I would recommend this game to: Any strategy gamer that is not satisfied with calling ""Clash of Clans"" or ""DoTa"" a strategy game. If you wish the Civilization series had more depth, or the Total War series more historicity, this game is hands down for you.Who I would NOT recomment this game to: people with low attention spans.For me, hands down the best strategy game I've played in years.

												This game is only worth it if you've played other strategy games and gotten bored because there isn't enough detail.You can plot to kill a member of your court, join a war, start a war, arrange marriages, imprison people, execute those people and quell some rebellious villagers while you're at it.In my game I helped my uncle take over Norway and once he had won using his wealth and considerable armies I had him assassinated and inherited it all at almost no cost to myself. Felt very game of thrones-esque.The one thing to be warned of is that since I bought this game a couple years ago the developer has removed things from the game and resold them as DLC, they've also added a bunch with DLC and continue to do so but my advice is to be careful with your money because you can easily overspend on this game to have a more ""complete"" experience.*EDIT* I should add that this game is very poorly optimized so even though it's a very fancy 2D game you can easily encounter very significant FPS problems given that the game seems to only utilize one CPU core. It starts off strong but the longer the game the more Ai characters your computer has to manage and that slows it down considerably.			",154,17,4,31,27,2,55

												Crusader Kings II has slowly became my favorite strategy game after many hours of pain and toil I have faced as a new player. This game is brilliantly made with many ins and outs to its gameplay weither you are the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire or just a lowely Count. The experience of Ck2 is not made to ease players into the the game, it will take you many tries to begin to understand the game fully...but that is the fun part of it. Ck2 will have you coming back again and again with its DLCs and different senerios, so the replay value of this game is very high. All together my only complaint is the base game paired with the DLCs can be very expensive. Luckily you will find sales on the game paired with the DLCs that make it much more affordable for the casual gamer. This game is not for the casual gamers though, I wouldn't reccomend this game to those who have not played Grand Strategy games before like the Total War series. But for those of you that like this type of gameplay you will love this expansive world of trials, murder, strategy, family values, and utter domination. Crusader Kings II is A truely masterfully made game.Pros:-High Replay Value.-Fun and sometimes hilarious senerios.-Grand scale.-Well made AI system.-Functional multiplayer.-Intresting story lines and challenges.-Complicated Strategy.-Great gameplay.Cons:-High price paired with DLCs.-Some minor glitchs.-Not the easiest tutorials(I feel this can be a plus though because it makes you experience the game through trying it).On a scale of 1 to 100:           95/100			",67,7,4,12,21,2,30

												Let me describe how my first Crusader Kings 2 game began and you'll hopefully appreciate the fun that this game can offer:my character was over 60 year old Duke of southern Ireland. I had two sons, eldest of which was to be my successor, but who had such personality quirks that I really didn't think he would be the right heir. I preferred the younger son. So I sent the eldest on the most dangerous assignment I could - collecting taxes and hoped for the best (or worst). At the same time I noticed that I had good relations with France and the king of France happened to have two daughters (princesses) in the ripe age for marriage. I tested my luck and offered to wed the other and my eldest son could wed the other. Luckily the king accepted my proposals and there I was, married to a french princess. Not long after the marriage I decided to start fooling around with the other princess as well, because you can't go wrong with two french princesses and as my son was all the time fetching taxes, you had to give some warmth to the lonely french woman in another country. Not long after I got good (bad) news that my son had been killed on his taxation trip and I managed to get the right son to be my lawful heir. I kept the princesses though to myself naturally. At this point I noticed that the french king had an heir, son of age 8 or so. This wouldn't do because I wanted to get France for me as well so I put some plans into work and decided to assassinate the brat. I went a bit over the top though because I invested so much money into the assassination that it had approximately 300% success rate and indeed, after a while I got notice that he was at the same time thrown from the balcony, put into fire and shot with a crossbow. But if you want to get rid of a french king-to-be you better make it right the first time, can't be too careful!			",79,33,0,31,20,2,28

												I didn't realize I haven't reviewed this game.  This game is awesome. Game of thrones mod, without mods just so much fun.  The pace is great, the stories are fantastic.  Long term, i would be able to look the battles in a bit more detail.  Not looking for control of units, but it would be cool if they you had the ability to watch them fight it out.  I know it isn't part of the scope of the game, but I would still love to watch some of these epic battles take place in 3d.Anyway, great game.  I like the fact it is real-time, but feels like a turn based game.			",48,9,2,17,17,1,22

												Played this game alone and I married my cousin. I played multiplayer with my cousin and then married my cousin.10/10 Best cousin marriage simulator. Good for the whole realm.But for real, this game is absolutely incredible. I remember when I first saw this game. It was about three years ago and I totally thought this game looked like an overly complicated piece of junk. And boy, was I half right. After totally brushing off this game I started getting really into Civ V. I really loved how immersive the game was and how it wonderfully wove together culture, technology, and history. Eventually, after 200 hours of gameplay, I grew tired of that game and moved on. I moved on to Warband and played over 200 hours of that wonderful game. Yet I still grew tired of it.So I looked online for more strategy games and I came across this game again. At this point I was desperate for a strategy game that could also immerse me in a beautiful world while also giving me something I would take pride in fighting for. So I gave this game a chance and after 500 hours I am still playing this game. Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing grand strategy game that puts you not only in charge of a realm, but in charge of your family's house.  The goal of the game, if there is one to be found, is to bring as much glory to your realm and family name as you can. This can be attained by many different means and that is one of the things that makes this game great. You are put into a position of power in the Middle Ages and destiny is yours to write. However, this game can throw terrible twists your way. Your great genius leader can be killed in battle leaving your young daughter to take the throne in a world that hates female rulers. Or maybe you will find yourself hoping your King-Jeoffery-of-a-son dies so that way your strong, attractive, and genius son can take the throne. Or my greatest nightmare: You can be playing as an Eastern European nation and the Mongolian Hordes begin to knock on your door. Crusader Kings is one of the greatest games I have every played. It is wildly complex and can take over 50 hours to master. But don't let that stop you from giving this game a try. Because once you get a feel for how the Crusader Kings 2 world works, you can let your ambitions run free and carve out a glorious realm with characters that somehow manage to create a story that seems like it could have happened. 10/10 would have my vassals revolt against my 16 year old female ruler during a Mongolian invasion for Poland so I can inherit France and the HRE again.

												This is probably the best strategy game paradox has ever made. It has excellent modability and replayability, deep and complex mechanic, constant support (at least until they release new game), good visuals and music, and It gets even better with mods like AGOT (game of thrones) or CKII+ and VIET.There are however few issues with game engine - the longer you play one character/dynasty the slower the game gets, bugs start to appear, family trees keep getting messed up, crashes occur, AI gets worse. This hasn't been fixed with patches.I also disapprove of the excessive amount of addons and dlc's, and would've preferred if they bundled them together or kept some of them on sale constantly.

												This is a premiere strategy game. It is NOT tactical. Let me repeat that. Tactics are NOT NOT NOT involved. I see too many people try this game expecting something akin to Total War only to get turned off by the lack of tactical decisions. ""Strategy"" games are more akin to simulation games in essence. You plan your course of action through dangerous circumstances to achieve the best victory possible. Strategy is knowing when to fight, where to fight, how to take advantage of your situation for long-term benefits, and other similar questions. Tactics is ""how to fight"" and this game does not cover that. It is a question of logistics rather than tactics. Do you have enough troops, rather than are your troops fighting at optimal efficieny. Do you have the defensive high ground, rather than whether or not this unit happens to be in good terrain at any given time. Do you catch the enemy army off guard, rather than using flanking to decimate part of the army. If you expect a Civilization-esque game, or something like Total War. Check your expectations. Go online, and watch gameplay before buying. You are probably in for a surprise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have the patience or a friend to teach you how this game works, it´s a game you can easily spend hundreds of hours in. If you are into strategy games I can definately recommend this one. It´s not the easiest to learn, in fact, after fifty games you will still learn more about this game, and with the continuous supply of DLC you will not get bored of this game quickly.Now, why is this game so great?+ A big map that gets expanded occasionally. You can start of as a viking king in Norway and eventually rule India, or start as a Russian Slavic pagan and become emperor of Europe. And who knows what Paradox is preparing to add next?+ A hundred of options with a thousand of choices. Whether you start off as a viking or a muslim, you will encounter similar problems. However, every religion, culture and country has it's own way of solving those. And as your character develops he will unlock (or block) other options. You'll never stop exploring these options.+ Easier and harder gameplay is possible, so whether you are new or experienced you will always find your challenge+ Great multiplayer, especially with friends. Whether you like PvPing or play versus the computer, a good multiplayer match will always keep you interested. Connecting to other players has been made easier (compared to how it was in the past), and is easily done via steam.+ Events and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold.This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.+ You can create your starting king with the ruler creater DLC+ Loads of DLC that add new and interesting things to the game. When playing multiplayer, only the DLCs owned (and activated) by the host are available. If you play with friends, have the person who hosts most often get some DLCs, so the others won't need them.+ Starting date can vary from 769 to 1337 (there currently are six bookmarks, respectively the Early Middle Ages (769), the Viking Age (867), the High Middle Ages (1066) , the Alexiad (1081) the Age of the Mongols (1241) and the Late Middle Ages (1337).+ No game will every be the same. After a hundred years into the game, you will notice considerable differences in each game. A game would not be realistic if not without flaws, so here are some of the downsides- Event and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold. This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.- Multiplayer can sometimes be unstable, especially if you play with more than 5 people. Desyncs will happen every now and then (usually you can play for an hour or two), and you have to restart your game to properly solve it. This is less common if you play with less player and if the internet connections are good. (If you have good internet, and so do your friends, this is MUCH less likely to happen.)- At first, this game might be very complicated and confusing. I recommend playing with someone with experience, if possible. - Once you get to a certain size, you will become quite unstoppable (although there are a few big armies coming to Europe, like the mongols, that might make you lose lands again). Overall I would easily recommend this game. Once you grasp how this game works, you will be able to spend hours and hours of your time into this, exploring the near unlimited amount of options, and seeing how every game is available. If you play with friends, get a co-op game going. 9/10			",159,14,0,20,16,1,21

												Ever loved games like medieval total war but couldn't bother to do the RTS parts of the game? then this is just for you.Crusader kings 2 puts you in the role of your leader king,baron,patriarch whatever you decide to start with, unlike similar games you can't choose what you want to construct or what kind of units you want to train , but you can choose who will educate your sons, who do you want to marry , who do you want to war on via diplomacy tricks in order to expand your empire and much more including setting a plot to kill your  brother so you can become the next king and have it all ruined because of one the people who joined your conspiracy got drunk and didn't keep his mouth shut , no two runs are ever the same aside historical events.The only downside i can see in this game is how most of the factions are dlc content ,if you want to experience being the leader of the turks and declare a jihad on half the christian empire then you need a dlc otherwise you can't play them same with a lot of really fun factions like venezian merchants.

												This game is the largest stakeholder simulator ever created. Make sure to keep your vassals and court happy to avoid revolutions or any sort of a turmoil. I have enjoyed the game so far. In particular, I liked the random events that take place throughout the game. For example, your son’s wife can get possessed by a demon and slay half of your family or your younger son will decide to assassinate you and all his older brothers to inherit the crown. Equally, sometimes you are that very person who coldly murders most of your family while being driven by hunger for power. In any scenario, you will have plenty of fun while rewriting world’s history. It feels like a game with a storylines alike Game of Thrones – intrigues, assassinations, betrayals, seduction and other joys of life.I would personally advise to play this game on Ironman mode only, as it forces you to embrace all the chaos you have caused and all challenges that have emerged in the game, forging your mind to be more strategic next time and also not trust anyone.

												I have 500 + hours on Crusader kings 2 and it is probably one of mmy favorite games, let me give you an example of just how awesome this game can be. When i first got the game i decided i would play in ireland at the 867 start date.  i would eventually conquer all of ireland and scotland and wales. my king was king Eric V he was a badass as he had conquered wales for the glorius Irish empire. however his second son was lustful of the throne, his name was Bob (no joke) since i had the law that only the firstborn son of the ruler would succed, Bob killed his elder brother Aethulwulf and inherited the throne for himself, but thier was a crucial flaw in his plan. Aethulwulfs son Eric still lived, and the game let me play as Eric not bob. so i spent my entire reign as duke of connacht ploting to take back the throne that was rightfully mine. in the year 1024 me and my sons decided taht it was time to take my birthright. i demanded the throne but was rejected by uncle Bob and i started a civil war that would last 20 years. the irish and scottish lords on my side and the other lrish and welsh lords on bobs side. needless to say that war killed off 13 family members including Erics second and fourth son. by the end Eric had killed Bob and all his children, but was maimed. he died a year after taking the throne from his wound. i would later port this game into EU4 and conquer the world. when i was about to port my game to EU4 i looked at the history of my family, and Bobs name in history was ""Bob the bad"" 100/10			",37,3,0,8,8,0,18

												Crusader Kings 2 is a very unique game. To date, I haven't played another strategy game like it, and it's likely there aren't any. This game can make somewhat similar games, like Civilization, feel quite disappointing.This game is all about your family, politics, your characters, your religion, your culture... there's a lot of depth. And after you've played for a few hours, you should have a story worth telling to someone. Stories that alter history. It easily beats out almost every other strategy game I've played in this way.This is one of the few games where it's okay to kill your wife, your brothers, and your uncle's 2-year-old child, all for the sole purpose of aspiring to be even greater than they were.Be warned, this game can be very frustrating: You learn more through your failure than your success, and sometimes there's something big you've overlooked for the last day (or month) you've been playing. I highly recommend you try the demo and watch some people play this game online (Youtube, for example) before you're determined to buy it.It also has some of the best modifications out there for any strategy game, including a Game of Thrones mod that's well acclaimed and probably the best Game of Thrones game out there. As a sandboxy medieval European story simulator, this game shines. You will giggle at the death of little boys and marrying their sisters as you inherit land and claims for war. Very rarely do I feel like I waste my time with this game. There's no grinding. And Paradox tries to improve it with patch after patch, which is nice.The only downside, in my opinion, is the way the DLC is released, with song packs, skin packs, etc. however, the higher priced DLC is worth buying for the most part - just read what it's about before you buy it and you should be good to go.This is, by far, the best game Paradox has to offer, and one of the most worthy games on Steam to buy.

You can marry into someones family and then assasinate all the heirs that ahead of you in the inheritance, you can war and crusade against infedels to expand, or you can wait untill someonens nearby descends into a civil war and then try and pick off as much land from them as you can manage before their civil war ends. This game has a steep (like STEEP) learning curve but it is a curve that makes you feel like a genius after you master it and can be played for hours and hours			",106,11,0,50,51,1,72

A breath of fresh air with a unique perspective. If your an adult gamer this is an absolute must buy. If you are an intelligent teenager you may like this as well. Anyone younger should not apply, THANKFULLY. Paradox has always been great about making wonderful games that are art and art is not a democracy. If you focus grouped your game to see how wide of an audience you could mass market to then please, respectfully, go F yourself. Thankfully, this game is not made to cross platform appeal to everyone from 5 years old to grandmas. Long live Paradox, my favorite game developer.			",17,0,0,8,4,0,9

												Great, unique game that any grand strategy enthusiast should purchase.Crusader Kings II fills an excellent niche of strategy where the goal is to control and survive internal struggles as it is to survive the machinations of your neighbors.  A full-blown character development and dynasty system gives incredible richness to the world and the player's attachment to character, family, and kingdom.This is fantastic game for single or co-op play.  It takes a long time to learn and master, but once you've got it the game becomes very fun and satisfying.My primary complaints lie in the underdeveloped economic side, underdeveloped religious system (especially for non-Catholics and non-Norse) slow casus-belli capture-one-county-at-a-time conquering system, and multiplayer instability.Note: The developers have consistently released new content for the game, which is incredible.  A lot of the key additions are also given for free for vanilla users.  That said, there are some DLC expansions that add important new systems or create additional depth to existing ones, which therefore should be purchased with vanilla.  If on a tight budget, I would definitely pick up Old Gods.  All other DLC at your discretion.			",106,16,0,20,8,0,20

												This game will hate you. It will leap up and slap you in the face. And as a result, you will never want to leave its side. As a wise man once said: Life has no Ctrl 'Z'.A great many things are beyond your control, unusual in a strategy game but far more true to reality. Perhaps you will pause in your travels at a tavern, nurse a cool ale, and the tavern will explode, killing you instantly. Son of a... Is nothing sacred?Or maybe your favourite son will take over as regent when you grow old and decrepit, only to steal all your titles and imprison you. Bet you're regreting your refusal to aid your brother in killing the little sod now, aren't you?Perhaps you become just another in a long line to die from Medieval Europe's most dangerous plague - 'Suspicious circumstances'?It's never entirely clear how suspicious they are, or what you're supposed to do about it, but you know what they say - Life's a female dog. Or maybe, at the ripe old age of 84 you'll die from syphillis. Irritating it might be, but you'll be unable to fight the surge of pride that you were still getting it on at an age when most men's fading eyesight ensures they can't even see the appropriate body parts any more.And the list goes on: vassals tearing your Empires apart, mobs killing your tax collectors, rioting zealots, crusades, becoming blinded, castrated, imprisoned, diseased, incapable, having your son born the anti-christ, or, god forbid, losing your favourite hunting hound (why, why, oh cruel, wretched world?). CK2 will punish you, and you will love every second of it, because when you do manage to pull everything together, nothing in life will bring you more joy. Not since Firefly has anything been more deserving of the tagline 'Someone ever tries to kill you, you try to kill 'em right back.'			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It easily beats out almost every other strategy game I've played in this way.This is one of the few games where it's okay to kill your wife, your brothers, and your uncle's 2-year-old child, all for the sole purpose of aspiring to be even greater than they were.Be warned, this game can be very frustrating: You learn more through your failure than your success, and sometimes there's something big you've overlooked for the last day (or month) you've been playing. I highly recommend you try the demo and watch some people play this game online (Youtube, for example) before you're determined to buy it.It also has some of the best modifications out there for any strategy game, including a Game of Thrones mod that's well acclaimed and probably the best Game of Thrones game out there. As a sandboxy medieval European story simulator, this game shines. You will giggle at the death of little boys and marrying their sisters as you inherit land and claims for war. Very rarely do I feel like I waste my time with this game. There's no grinding. And Paradox tries to improve it with patch after patch, which is nice.The only downside, in my opinion, is the way the DLC is released, with song packs, skin packs, etc. however, the higher priced DLC is worth buying for the most part - just read what it's about before you buy it and you should be good to go.This is, by far, the best game Paradox has to offer, and one of the most worthy games on Steam to buy.

												This game is the largest stakeholder simulator ever created. Make sure to keep your vassals and court happy to avoid revolutions or any sort of a turmoil. I have enjoyed the game so far. In particular, I liked the random events that take place throughout the game. For example, your son’s wife can get possessed by a demon and slay half of your family or your younger son will decide to assassinate you and all his older brothers to inherit the crown. Equally, sometimes you are that very person who coldly murders most of your family while being driven by hunger for power. In any scenario, you will have plenty of fun while rewriting world’s history. It feels like a game with a storylines alike Game of Thrones – intrigues, assassinations, betrayals, seduction and other joys of life.I would personally advise to play this game on Ironman mode only, as it forces you to embrace all the chaos you have caused and all challenges that have emerged in the game, forging your mind to be more strategic next time and also not trust anyone.

												Crusader kings 2 is a really fun game. It might look intimidating at first because of all the things you need to think about (especially if you take a big character for your first game). But the basic are pretty easy to learn. Playing this felt like an episode of GoT.This game has almost unlimited replay capacity and gives you a great sense of satisfaction when you defeat and conquerer enemy territory. Another plus is that now, the game has official servers so its much easier to play with friends. As for the DLCs, i'd say they're worth it (excepts for the one with the Aztec invading Europe, that makes absolutly no sense whatsoever). My favorite 2 are the old gods (you get to play as vikings) and the ruler designer (create your own dynasty).I've had my fair share of hours of play and i can say, if you're into history, you're going to like this game (hell if you're not you might start to like it now)			",35,12,0,10,1,1,5

												This is indeed grand strategy. And it is excellent.Multiple aspects of this game elevate it to its status at the pinnacle of its genre. First of all, the deciding factor for me that makes it better than other Paradox games is the added RPG element. No longer are you simply commanding a country and desperately trying to stop inflation. Now you also feverishly work to impregnate your barren wife and secure an heir while assasinating your cousins left and right. If that doesn't sound like fun I don't know what does.There's also the great open-ended freedom of this game. Unlike Civ, which is simply a race to dominate, Crusader Kings allows you to do whatever the heck you want. Feel like taking on the Golden Horde as King Kazimierz of Poland? Give it a shot. Or just chill as Earl Murchard in Ireland where literally nothing happens.Did I mention that there's a 32 person multiplayer mode?TL;DR- You should totally get this game. ",234,85,6,40,27,3,54

												Two years ago, I got CKII on special offer just for the hell of it, and I played it for about 4 hours. Now, I've logged about 800(Make that 900) hours on it. Well, When I played it for 4 hours...I hated it. it was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complicated, boring, I couldn't work out the systems, it was BORING. I only played it when I got bored, until one day, in september 2014, I was playing it out of boredom and I married someone. Her father died shortly after, and she inherited his duchy in norway. Then, my character died and his 15 year old son became head of one of the most powerfu, duchies in Norway. fast forward 100 years and We're kings of norway and england. fast forward 50 years anf we're counts of some rocks in Cornwall. then, we became kings in less than 25 years. And that's the magic of CKII. anything can happen. It's impossible to describe, do I'll split it into pros and cons.Cons: a learning curve of 90 degrees and an absolutely disgusting tutorial system that teaches nothingPros: when you learn the game, It becomes a vibrant, sprawling mass of politics, marriage, religion and warfare, trying to get on top and stay there while everyone else tries to kill you, and desperately surviving. The game tells a story of events, families, murders and warfare. Oh, and incest... It's gritty and down to earth, showing the reality of medieval history in the ways history class never could, whilst giving a delightful account of the bedroom antics of rednecks and showing that one kid, one wife who likes guys a bit too much, one bad trait, one guy with that ♥♥♥♥ing trusting trait can completely screw up a plan that has been in progress for 100 years, only for you to turn events around and become king of Spain, when you actually meant to be king of Scotland.In short, this game can be tlked about endlessly, but only understood and loved when it's bought, when you climb that pile of corpses that mainly consist of your brothers because ypu havent got Primogeniture succession/ Climbing the learning curve and play it. It's been my favourite game for the last two years and has won that title easily due to it's ability to be remarkably simple, yet so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complex, you're always learning.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eh. Crusader Kings 2 is embletic of Paradox's greatest virtues and flaws. On the one hand you have a truly immersive game worth hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay, but at the same time any attachement to the game itself erodes as they go for breadth instead of depth. In an year in the lifespan of one of their games, you can be sure that as much as six months will be unplayable for one reason or another due to the cycle of DLC - > Bugs -> Patch -> Bugs -> Patch - DLC that leave the base game a complete mess for new players and forces you to take on the whole of the DLC to get an actual cohesive experience. For me it's kind of telling that the most solid previous generation game they had was Victoria 2 which ceased recieving DLC a long time ago but was still a lot of fun and almost never had any bugs at end of focus period. When you add into that Paradox's tendency to decide how you can or can't play your game (closing off North Korea mode, multiple ""fixes"" to player-chosen game-styles and not allowed achievements in single-player), then it becomes a very love-hate relationship with a largely well-meanign company slightly too reliant on DLC to keep their franchises going. I'd give CK2 a thumbs up purely for appreciation for the hours of quality gameplay provided but given how burned out it's left me on Paradox as a whole I find myself unable to do that.

If you want Primogeniture (oldest son inherits your land) you must not only pay 15 shekels for the piece of sh()it conclave DLC, but actually enable it.Sad to see what was a decent game turn to absolute horseshi()it because the devs are retroactively removing content. I'll be deleting my copy and wont bother pirating any future versions.Companies should take note though, Paradicks figured out how to stop piracy.

												Really not my sort of game, despite me trying my darndest to enjoy it, for I have friends who love it. Thirty hours in and it still only makes limited sense to me (and no, I'm not a complete and utter idiot). Far too much seems dependent on luck, for a start. Event pop-ups occur where you can make some rather limited decisions, and there will be cases of 'fourty-percent chance something you don't want happens, sixty-percent something you do want happens'. Quite a lot of cases of that, in fact. If that makes for enjoyable gameplay for some people, then have at it - I'm not stopping you. For me on the other hand, constantly saving so that I can reload if I get buggered over by RNG isn't what I'd consider to be fun (or I guess you could play ironman mode and let fate take its toll, though I rather play the slots at a casino than this all day, for they offer about the same level of entertainment and cost the same, what with this game's ludicrous amounts of DLC).Most of the game seems to consist of waiting. Wait for your piety and prestige stats, both of which are doing some very subtle things you probably won't realise at first due to the tutorial mode failing to teach you much of anything. You can speed things up, but then I suppose it's just a case of waiting for the things you want to happen but faster. Apparently there's strategy involved, but if you can make sense of it you're doing better than I did. Infantry units get combat bonuses when standing on certain terrain for example, but good luck telling what sort of terrain you're on as it's pretty damned hidden away - I only figured out how to tell about twenty-five hours in. If you do realise what's going on, good luck telling if that bonus is ACTUALLY having an effect and isn't bugged, like a lot of things in Crusader Kings 2 seemingly are.Then there's the fact you have no actual goal to achieve presented to you. Some people love that, apparently, take Minecraft's success for example (though even Mojang decided to add an 'end boss' to their game). I personally just sit there and wonder ""why did I pay for something that's telling me to make my own fun?"". If you have any hobbies, I'd go do those instead. You could say that you should aspire to take over the world - well, okay, but is it actually enjoyable? Only if you're a particular sort of person, it seems, as I'd be bored to death by the time I manage it; most of the game involves nothing but waiting. The game just isn't fun - I tried the multiplayer, and when it wasn't ""desyncing"" (which was a CONSTANT issue, desyncing being tantamount to a crash as you had to exit and restart the game when it happened to someone) for half the game I was tabbed out and talking to people on Skype, as the only convenient way to play multiplayer is on the slowest setting - after all, having people pause when they need to is impractical - and thus the only 'gameplay' I was experiencing was, yet again, waiting for stuff to happen.I'd like to try and deconstruct the individual mechanics of the game from my limited understanding of them, but really, there's no point. If you're not already playing Paradox's ""grand strategy"" (a genre I'm pretty certain they alone make games for) games, chances are you won't enjoy this. I'll end this on something objectively bad about the game - its DLCs, or more aptly put its micro-transactions. Multiple, tiny and worthless 'infantry packs' for soldier units you barely pay attention to and multiple 'portrait packs' for the already rather poorly rendered ruler images. Then there's the DLCs that actually add gameplay content - supposedly, they come with free patches that add content even without you purchasing the DLC when they're released. That sounds great and all, but then you hear that those patches have a tendency to come with a host of game breaking bugs and it apparently takes Paradox forever to fix anything. Great. Though I haven't actually purchased any of the DLCs, I have experienced them via my multiplayer escapades, and they seem extremely limited - essentially, think if you modded Super Mario Bros, for example, so that you're running around as Peach instead of Mario. That to me is what the DLCs appear to amount to, what with them consisting of apparently exciting new features like ""new start dates"" and new rulers to play as, or then you have the Way of Life DLC, where you pay for about five-hundred words or so packaged into event pop-ups that are just more of the same RNG nonsense as before. I suppose that's all great if you already enjoy the concept, but where the game's appeal originates from I cannot even fathom. I never felt like I was applying much strategy (though I suppose you do with extreme patience), I was never having much fun, and I think my friends enjoy the game more than they would otherwise because of their apparent interest in history (which this game pretends to have a lot of, that being historically accurate gameplay, which is also a complete lie as you'll never truly play the lives of infamous rulers, the game simply isn't even nearly sophisticated enough to achieve such an experience). If you want to learn history, great - but read a book, don't play this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved playing this game, me and my friends played over 100 years on the lowest speed together and then it encountered a problem when it just randomly  crashed on january every year we googled it and apparently it is a common problem and happens all the time and is totaly unfixable no matter what you do.Have they bothered to fix it?Nope?Why, because ♥♥♥♥ you we want your money.This game had my heart and it ♥♥♥♥ed me, all my friends uninstalled after that and we never plan on playing again.

												TL;DR: Time-intesive game+ Fragile save files = Recipe for disaster.Very frustrating.The game is fun enough, but runs on the concept that you invest a lot of time into one particular playthrough.Thats fine, especially if you like the sense of achievement it brings when you do finally rule the world starting from a humble tribal lord in the middle of nowhere. It gets annoying however when those save files become very easily corruptible, and you lose all your progress, or cannot earn steam achievements because it didnt load all the expensive dlc you forked over hard earned cash for...I have lost all my progress on a couple of occasions. Im always careful, but the games inherent structure is shaky: the save files are super fragile (sometimes loading a game before its finished doing its calculations is enough to corrupt a save file), and these are by their very nature save files you need to use often and for long periods of time.Its a recipe for disaster and I regret having spent my money on it, which I say about very few games if any (honestly, check if I have any other negative reviews for any games).

												Crusader Kings II is a vast pretty map with an enormous database of historical figures and all their relations, titles and whatnot, that plays out as a giant real time spreadsheet. I've enjoyed many abstract games with minimal graphics (Dominions, Conquest of Elysium, Tales of Maj'eyal etc), each with large inventories of foes, items, locations and so on. But I cannot say that I even began to enjoy Crusader Kings II.The learning curve is vertical, with tiny icons studding nearly every window. While there are tool tips to go with each view, because of the number of little buttons and icons, I had a difficult time figuring what each section of the tutorial window went with what controls. Even when I did digest what a tool tip might mean, I still had little idea what the described control did in the larger game.About six minutes in, I was asked by the tutorial to pick an ambition for my King. Since he was single and there was already an alert about only having my brother (who doesn't like me one bit) as my sole heir, taking care of that seemed like the natural first order of business.Forty-five minutes later I'd clicked on everything that I could find that had anything to do with anyone in the game getting married. Not only could I not marry my ruler to anyone, I had absolutely no idea WHY! While I noticed some contextual tooltips that listed out qualifiations required for a particular action, most of which were dense and had obtuse names, I couldn't find a anything that would tell me why my young King could marry no one.The kicker for me was the tutorial telling me that my choice of getting my King married was a wise and sensible first ambition. There even came a tutorial window directing me back to the marriage window that I'd already discovered on my own and could (as near as I could tell) in no way afffect.I could have perused the manual or searched for guides online, but spending nearly an hour on one step of a tutorial and getting nowhere made me feel decidedly unwelcome.I'm sure there is a deep, rich game under all the very specific terminology, the family trees, under the byzantine UI screens and between the insane number of tiny buttons and icons, just waiting for someone wonky enough to sort it out. Normally, I feel like I'm that wonky person; not so with Crusader Kings II.I found the game entirely unapproachable, so I've given it the thumbs down. I have no doubt that there are the patient few who have cracked the UI and are conversant in all the very specific terms for medieval succession and the associated ranks and whatnot. But if you're not willing to learn a whole set of antique jargon and navigate screens studded with damnable tiny buttons, and abstracted into meaninglessness icons, you're like me and this game isn't for you.

												Great game, even though a bit clunky and outdated, but the recent changes in Paradox developement policy make me strongly question whether any potential buyer should actually support this.Crusader Kings II is a highly-complex (to the degree where it easily becomes overwhelming to new players and can, literally cause a game over in less then one minute of play time) Grande Strategy, in which you take control of a dynasty of medieval rulers, trying to lead your family to power and glory.You can expand via forging claims or creating new titles, followed by your armies marching across the land. Or wed your sons and daughters to create alliance that may or may not last decades, or may even have your grandson on the neighbouring kingdoms throne, in time. Or you skip that 'in time' part and just go and murder everyone else who might lay claim to the throne to put said grandson there. Or, just murder that one too and inherit the throne yourself.Jep, this sounds a bit brutish, but that's the way Feudalism works. And after all it's not a onesided story... watch for ambitious sons, or you might find that your wine tastes a bit funny.In the end, CKII is an oustanding game for anyone interested in a mix of medieval dynastys, light RPG and deep Strategy. But be warned that the game is hard, unfair, sometimes utterly random and difficult to get into.As well, be advised that the Multiplayer mode is painfully unstable. With a lot of patience (and reloads) it's possible, but usually a better choice to play Singleplayer.However, this actually great game is sadly overshadowed by the publisher behind it.Paradox started out as a niche game producer with a lot of effort and heart. But across the years they have more and more developed into a mainstream game industrialist and more and more often it feels like they prefer to storm their supporter's wallets instead of hearts.Low-quality, bugged, patches are common among multiple games (most mentionable CKII and EUIV), the dev's behavior in the forum is... erratic and unprofessional at times and on top of that Paradox has started to build a history of dropping the support for games even whilst promised pre-purchase packet content wasn't ever delivered (namely, War of the Vikings).Result: 7.5/10 A bit clunky and without reasonable Multiplayer, but still a solid game.But still, avoid  purchasing this or any other Paradox title. Vote with your purses and hope they redeem their ways.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever played Civilization and thought it would be great if the whole game were the middle ages and I actually got to oppress the peasants, then you will enjoy this game. Similarly, if your family reunions make you wish you could speed up time and exert exacting control over who everyone in your family marries, this game will really blow your hair back. And finally, if you like playing The Sims but wish you could invade your neighbor and burn their ugly house down, well, I count myself fortunate to not be your vassal.The gameplay really nails a humorous historical blend of strategy, simulation and role playing. The user interface is packed with information that can draw you in for hours, once you master the very steep learning cliff. The graphics are fairly minimal, but honestly just right for the game.Unfortunately, so many of the extras that you wish you had control over are fairly pricey DLC, for what they get you. Want to tell your uppity heir to shave his stupid moustache? $4.99. Tired of everyone looking the same, wearing the same 5 outfits or having historically inaccurate ethnicities? $1.99, $0.99 and more for each part of the globe.They have expanded the game several times, and the features continue to be added even if you don't by the expansion. From this standpoint, you can get many hours of new gaming experience out of it.However this makes for an unpredictable experience. I bought the game to enjoy multiplayer with my wife. While the added features are great, the stability of the game has its ups and downs. Recently, the Mac version of the game has been very difficult to enjoy. Crashes to desktop and out-of-sync errors become more and more common as our conquests abound and demense expands. Any more, we can't reliably go for more than hour without one of us suffering a setback and having to fully reload the game.Another common problem is that the game will protest that we have different versions when setting up the multiplayer server. This requires us to fully reload the game again.I love the game and wish I could play it more. I'm not opposed to paid or free expansions and feature additions, but given the choice between a rock solid, unchanging game and a buggy, evolving game, I'll choose the former every time.

												I must say, I really love this game. The developers are really good on support, listening to community input and are continuously improving the game. Yes, they have a lot of DLC, but that downloadable content is great quality, well thought-out and really enhances the game. If you don't want the extra visuals, because, let's be honest I don't usually zoom in that far, you don't need them. But asides that, great game. Rajas of India not a big need unless you want to really conquer like Alexander the Great.			",136,27,9,14,70,4,54

												I've never posted a review of a game before, but after realizing I had well over 1000 hours of play time on Crusader Kings 2, I felt like I owed it to the game to review it. CK2 may possibly be the best RPG I've ever played. The sheer amount of diverse outcomes in any game puts the replayability through the roof with every monumental achievement and rage quit defeat motivating you to come back for more. On top of that, you can't help but actually learn about the medieval timeline and feudal government structure by playing. If you enjoy history and always wanted to be a part of it, CK2 was created with you in mind. An absolutely stellar game all-around in my opinion.			",4,5,0,3,12,2,11

												Crusader Kings II doesn't have any plot or main story to go trough. Instead you have only one objective. Make sure your family never falls and try to make your dynasty as prosperous as possible.This might sound boring at first but in reality it´s extremely addictive. There are many ways to try and climb the ladder. While sometimes brute force is enough, often you need to be way more devious. While marrying your son to someones daughter might seem harmless at first, it gets way more profitable once her brothers have mysteriously fallen. Having good relations is always important unless you want to be cornered against multiple armies or just find your main charracter being stabbed to death leaving your young child on the throne unable to deal with the matters at hand. As changes can happen very quickly, Crusader Kings II makes you put in your A game or otherwise you will be swept back into nothing or to total extinction. While the suprises can be depressing at times, coping with these problesm is what makes the game so addictive. Prosperous moves aren't always the wise ones. Marry your daugher to the neighboring kingdom to fight your enemies and yes you won. Too bad they decided to invade you during the next generation as they had a rightfull claim to your throne. Expand carefully and make sure you will win both now and in the future.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Amazing game proving combat was not the only battlefield in feudal Europe, north-Africa and ArabiaYou will be faced with an initial difficulty and complexity but after 15 hours of dedication you will understand the basics and after a 100 hours you will still new learn tricks to use.Good for both roleplaying and gaming the game.The only RPG that doesn't let you move your character and the only strategy game that allows you to kill any annoying vassal or kinsman without losing its difficulty and becoming a god-game.Furthermore Paradox is generous with its DLC giving free updates at every DLC and make the mechanics possible in your non-DLC game such as Republics rising and Pagan raiding. as a bonus if you want to solely play with friends all DLC are taken from the host meaning you can try a DLC out with a friend before deciding to buy it.-Amazing replayabillity-A true world with countless scenarios-A good AI-Vikings!-Mangement both Macro and Micro-Intrigue-Lots of characters to pick from and lots of starting dates.-Allows roleplay and power-gamingIf you decide on buying the game I would like to advise starting in Ireland aka Nooby isle and get familiar with the interface and some mechanics before trying on something bigger.

												Played as a Germanic Frisia and raided the shorelines of England. After the king the great died and left the kingdom to his 14 year old son I decided to take the seduction focus and I made the Christian mother to the king a lover. I then decided to burn England again, sacrifice the mother to the Allfather and leave the kingdom filled with B A S T A R D S, my B A S T A R D S.Crusader Kings 2 is by my opinion the best game from Paradox. If you really love to play games that makes you think or you love conquering land then there is no better choice than this.What makes this game so good?: The fact that you take your own choices that will effect the future so much. You can start as the Holy Romans and form Prussia, or you can lose all and have to play as a small kingdom far east. The basic game is simulated to act the historical events, but you can change them and make your own history.This strategic simulator will conquer more of your time than it will of Europe.There are problems of course, handling your vassals, defending your kingdom and keeping your dynasty alive. But the worst thing is that you have to buy expansion moduels to play as other charakters or different religions. So buy the expansions, but only when it is sale on them.If you are still holding back from buying it, then ask yourself. Do I love independence, difficulties and history?			",48,7,0,24,22,0,29

												Fairly steep learning curve. Once you get into it and get the hang of it, the possibilities, and fun, are endless. I highly, highly recommend this game to fans of grand-strategy games. The lack of depth when it comes to combat may turn some off, as this game isn't similar to the Total War series in the slightest. Overall, I'd rate it a 9/10. There are still some minor things that could be fixed, some things fleshed out more, but overall the game is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the attention span to play it.

												Takes a really good game to make me play for 16 hours almost non-stop on my first session.Crusader Kings 2 is an RTS like many of Paradox's previous titles; highly complex (where your typical RTS is concerned) and providing a highly realistic simulation of empire-expansion. Every facet, save tactical involvement in battles, is explored with detail, and with much at the player's control.One of the key features in CK2 is it's dynastic political system. Not only must you secure your line of succession through heirs to continue in your quest for glory, but there are no formal alliances. Everyone you can count on is either directly in your sphere of influence and thus obligated to serve, or aligned through familial ties.Even though I bought it during the sale, as previously I was unsure, now that I've played Crusader Kings 2, I can definitely say I'd not have issue with paying full price for it. This is even one of the few games I wouldn't be opposed to paying full price for DLC.5/5			",77,7,1,7,4,0,31

												Put it this way, I've played plenty of games where you can beat your enemies into submission, but never one where you can shag their sisters afterwards. Politics, Intrigue, War, Diplomacy, everything. This game has it all. No tactics to speak of but that only adds to the depth in its own way. On a different game you might say, ""hmm, his army is twice the size of mine, but hey, I can probably beat him, I'm a good general'. On this game, you are more likely to think, 'If I go up against him I'm going to get my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on a plate. I'd better stay on his good side until I'm strong enough.' This is a great strength of the game, and you have to set long term aims and goals if you want to win. For example, at the start of my most successful game, which was as Duke Ethelred of Wessex on the Old Gods campaign, I ruled a small Duchy in the South of England, with a massive Norse army making its way south to burn and kill everything. Through a hefty bit of luck involving several strategic alliances, I was able to secure control of England. By putting a woman on the throne of West Francia, who my heir then married, I was able to begin a process of conquering all of France. When the crusading era arrived, holy wars brought me muslim spain and the Holy Land. In 1140, The House of Wessex now rules as Emperors of Britannia, the masters of Western Europe and the Levant. It won't be enormous military might alone that brings you success, you need to utilise every ounce of political acumen you posses, taking advantage of every opportunity that comes your way, praying that you don't make the wrong choice. ""My Lord, the Duke of so-and-so is rallying your vassals against you"". ""Oh I'll be fine, I've never been more popular."" Next thing you know, ten thousand men are kicking down your door. In my view, the perfect strategy game.11/10			",8,4,0,4,2,0,13

												A great game for those interested in the period and/or fans of Paradox. Taking control of either: a count, Duke, King or Emperor there is no aim but what you choose to do. Reform Norse paganism? Hell yeah you can. Make Edmund Blackadder and have him take the throne of England? You bet your sweet ragamuffins you can. There are certainly a few drawbacks as with most games however they're usually very minor or a hilarious bug that you can post in the forums and laugh about. I love this game and I'd recommend this game to whoever asks me if it's worth buying. Beware though, it's a fairly deep rabbit hole. 9/10			",98,33,3,24,27,1,37

												Best freaking purchase of a strategy game in a long time. Not only is it increidibly in depth but you also get an education while playing, while some characters never existed others did. Like Genghis Khans's in the game, assuming you even make it that far. If you want a good strategy game then here you go, I acutally got this game half off for 20$ and I would pay the full price now if I hadn't of bought it. This games just awesome. The only change I would implement is more tactical choices during battles, you can choose which commander to lead your troops, and I like how they implemented a new system where you can choose the commander's for each great part of the Army e.g. left wing, center, right wing.

												Buying Crusader Kings 2!? The game by itself should be in the bucket list of every Strategy gameplayers.  Gameplay, strategy, actions, reality are great. BUT (yea it is a huge but) with lots of DLC without knowing which one I need for core which ones are secondary, it creates a huge consideration buble in my mind.On the financial perspective you should not buy this game nor support the studio, because there is no need for extream number of DLC's like Train Simulator. We had a economic crisis. You have customers with limited budget because you actually develop this game for niche (Strategy Game) players. If the studio wants to make more money they should release less DLC more main game content. So from my point of view, game is must but with this marketing/sales strategy it deserves to be on hold list till they release ""Game Of the Year/Legendary"" full content package with a 75% discount.6/10 because of studious sales/development strategy.

												Amazing game proving combat was not the only battlefield in feudal Europe, north-Africa and ArabiaYou will be faced with an initial difficulty and complexity but after 15 hours of dedication you will understand the basics and after a 100 hours you will still new learn tricks to use.Good for both roleplaying and gaming the game.The only RPG that doesn't let you move your character and the only strategy game that allows you to kill any annoying vassal or kinsman without losing its difficulty and becoming a god-game.Furthermore Paradox is generous with its DLC giving free updates at every DLC and make the mechanics possible in your non-DLC game such as Republics rising and Pagan raiding. as a bonus if you want to solely play with friends all DLC are taken from the host meaning you can try a DLC out with a friend before deciding to buy it.-Amazing replayabillity-A true world with countless scenarios-A good AI-Vikings!-Mangement both Macro and Micro-Intrigue-Lots of characters to pick from and lots of starting dates.-Allows roleplay and power-gamingIf you decide on buying the game I would like to advise starting in Ireland aka Nooby isle and get familiar with the interface and some mechanics before trying on something bigger.

												The most accessible of Paradox's flagship 'Grand Strategy Titles' may as well be it's best. Crusader Kings 2 is a Dynastic simulator set in a turbulent medieval Europe. The player takes control of a character and is tasked with creating a dynasty that will endure the test of time, political intrigue and backstabbing family members. Not unlike other Paradox GS games, the systems are quiet hard to grasp but in due course, one begins to appreciate the complexities and the possibilities they entail. My personal GOTY for the year 2012 and favorite medieval mass murder simulator. Play it!Latest Update 2016:Game's changed so much since launch. Still spectacular though.			",318,128,5,103,38,2,82

												I've played this for hundreds of hours (hard to believe, actually) and nearly all that has been spent in the Game of Thrones mod. I don't have huge interest in the period and have little knowledge of the various houses and dynasties. And, in CK2, that's where the interest is. You're not taking England, France, Spain, etc, somewhere by the end of the game, you're taking a dynasty. And that might not be very far. You might get imprisoned and die in jail, then must carry on as your infant son, who dies before reaching adulthood - game over (actually happened to me). Or you might reach the end of the game, having ups and downs, and only have 1-2 provinces more than you started with. The game is focused on characters and their relationships and all your greatest plans can come to nothing because an important person dies. And often people will die, or lose traits/abilities, randomly. You could die naturally in your 40's. Die of depression. Lead your armies in every battle and lose the 'brave' trait. Be a superior fighter and lose a duel to someone who can't fight (AGOT mod). And all seemingly, based on invisible random dice rolls. This can be incredibly frustrating, given how important characters are. It's something, if you're invested enough, you can fix with console commands and save edits. Or you can just grit and bear it. For me, I wasn't invested enough in medieval Europe to do so but I am in Westeros. But it's frustrating work that shouldn't be necessary.If you like the setting, or a setting provided by a mod, enough to live through the games frustrating randomness, there is great enjoyment in trying to build your dyntasty and watch the lives of your kin, your friends and your enemies, playout. If only Paradox could come up with a way (maybe in CK3) to tie your fate less to chance and more to your actions and those of the AI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""My Lord, the Duke of so-and-so is rallying your vassals against you"". ""Oh I'll be fine, I've never been more popular."" Next thing you know, ten thousand men are kicking down your door. In my view, the perfect strategy game.11/10			",8,4,0,4,2,0,13

												This game is a great RTS  that I've loved since the moment I've bought it. It is one of the more realistic representations of medieval time as well with demesnes, vassals, duchies, counties, empires, etc... All in all this game is great for any strategy gamer. Love this game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game for those interested in the period and/or fans of Paradox. Taking control of either: a count, Duke, King or Emperor there is no aim but what you choose to do. Reform Norse paganism? Hell yeah you can. Make Edmund Blackadder and have him take the throne of England? You bet your sweet ragamuffins you can. There are certainly a few drawbacks as with most games however they're usually very minor or a hilarious bug that you can post in the forums and laugh about. I love this game and I'd recommend this game to whoever asks me if it's worth buying. Beware though, it's a fairly deep rabbit hole. 9/10			",98,33,3,24,27,1,37

												Best freaking purchase of a strategy game in a long time. Not only is it increidibly in depth but you also get an education while playing, while some characters never existed others did. Like Genghis Khans's in the game, assuming you even make it that far. If you want a good strategy game then here you go, I acutally got this game half off for 20$ and I would pay the full price now if I hadn't of bought it. This games just awesome. The only change I would implement is more tactical choices during battles, you can choose which commander to lead your troops, and I like how they implemented a new system where you can choose the commander's for each great part of the Army e.g. left wing, center, right wing.

												I have spent so much time playing this game! Infinitely replayable, every game is different. I don't know many games that give you the option of playing a Byzantine King as well as a Viking Jarl. In a lot of these types of grand strategy games, you make your own fun. This game just has so much going for it, that with a little imagination you can sink 100s of hours into it like I did. Scheme, poison, or just plain overpower, there are many ways to the top. Once you get there, rest assured everyone below you is trying to take your land. Paradox is great about adding new content too. The Old Gods was my favorite, making an earlier starting date and bringing Vikings into the mix. Do yourself a favor and give CK2 a try.10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I juist finished my first game. It only took me 14 months. About 651 hours. I really recommend the game. I've just bought the 3 expansions that came out while I was playing.If you, as I, enjoy watching a map for hundreds of hours, thinking up one master plan to conquer the world after another, this is your game.Also, you can (and should) kill your wife because she's to old to produce an heir and doesn't have nice big stats like that new courtier, although you could also just ask the pope for a divorce, you'd probalably have to bribe him, unless he is your vassal of course... Anyway. You can also see Poland get ruled by a midget; have delusions that you are a werewolf and accidently kill your perfect trophy wife; ransom your prisoners; recreate the roman empire; focus on debouchery; accidently leave your heir in a city with typhoid fever; not so accidently have your sick heir lead a very small army in a very hostile place; and have 3 concubines if you're the right culture.With the last expansions you now have a council that makes ruling your realm an absolute nightmare, you can also get way more diseases, torture peope in detail, and join a cult of devil worshippers if you should so fancy. And when the Caliphate is proclaiming it's 8th jihad for Jerusalem and my council disagrees on absolutely everything I want to do, I do. I do fancy some devil worshipping and torture in the morning.			",14,6,0,7,6,0,5

												I'm unsure why I'm doing this, seeing as there are no words fitting for the amazing powers of this game.As someone fond of strategy games myself, who has never played a Grand Strategy game, as CKII is known as, I found myself deep within the midieval politics, heading downriver to a waterfall of certain death, and I had no paddle. It took several plunges over the side before I actually figured out how to avert this crisis. That's just the nature of the game; hard to learn, a learning cliff, and great fun awaiting you once you  know what you're doing. Go! Change history! Watch Norway conquer England instead of William the Conquerer, see the Crusaders actually succeed in something (Most likely not gonna happen), dismantle the Byzantine Empire or the Holy Roman Empire, or just sit back on your throne in your unified Ireland, laughing as Europe stuggles against the Mongol Horde...But remember this: ""Losing is Fun!""

												Simply put this game is awesome.Why don't I recommend it? Because it could be better.If you are going to buy this buy it with all expansions.trust me you won't regret it.When paradox promises endless replayablity they deliver.One thing the game excels in is giving you a feeling of achievement.In most non-paradox games when you end a playing session you amy have built a base or have gained the best weapon but in essence you haven't really done anything.the weapon or base make it too easy.Once you reach your goal you are done.However with CK2 thats not the case,you may have become emperor of the HRE but that doensn't mean that yor game is over,your son could just as easily loose the title as you gained it.And even when you are done with the game theres always the conversion to EU 4/3 to carry on the journey.The graphics are good and the music is very fitting.Still if you've never played grand strategy I suggest you try the demo.Just be aware the demo is not the finished product so you should use it only to judge the core game and not the nitty gritty details of teh game.

There are so many decisions to be made that can affect your family, A marriage could lead to an alliance, or it could lead to a rival making a claim on your for your crown. What to do with prisoners and traitors? You can execute, banishment, release, take away titles, each choice you make effects how your vassels view you and could increase your hold on your kingdom, or breed rebellion among your people.  Should you go on a hunt, have a feast, blot out the infidels or sponser a fair to gain favor with the peasants, every choice you make can bring reward or potential ruin to your dynasty.

												Best kind of surprise package by Paradox Development Studio. A game which gives you the challenge of trying to keep your dynasty alive and in power whilst also tempting you with expansion and wealth. Take part in holy crusades to re-take holy catholic lands and earn prestige through wars. If war's not your game, use cunning and intrigue with strategic marriages and spies to help fabricate claims on land, call in allies and take the land without lifing a finger.If you get the DLC's you can play as the muslims in the east, become a caliphate and declare jihads and watch as your fellow believers sweep accross Europe in the name of Allah. Bring the Byzantine Empire their previous glory and reform the Roman Empire, gaining justifications on all her previous holdings.Watch in a twist of history as the Aztecs land on European shores bringing with them new and strange diseases. Watch as they cut down kingdoms and forge their own empire.Play as a Republic, forgeing a dynasty of wealth and power through trade, then use this new wealth and power to cut out your own empire. (Like the Romans did!)And soon you will be allowed to play as Pagans, like the vikings and plunder gold and wreak havoc in the name of Odin. Each Pagan will have its own unique taste.You can even create your own Dynasty and play as yourself and your family.I've got to say, the care they put into this game makes it 100% worth every (now extinct Canadian)penny I paid. Not to mention how open the game is to modding. There are mods that completely change the game. Play the Game of Thrones or Elder Scrolls! There are actually mods that allow it! Not to mention all the other mods out there, it's great.It's a must buy even if you don't like games like this, it might change your mind.			",260,41,3,58,51,3,57

												Do you enjoy killing family members? Do you like to ruthlessly kill your neighbor's sons in hopes of obtaining his land? Have you ever wanted to have the Norse religion spread all across Europe? If you said ""Yes"" to any one of these questions, Crusader Kings II is for you! Now you can commit crimes against humanity, sleep with your brothers wife and cause the destruction of everything those pesky Catholics ever knew and loved. All without any real world risks! Please note: Yelling ""Finally I killed my son and inherited England"" may cause family and friends to become concerned about your mental stability and moral and ethical well being.(As an additional serious note: This game is decently challenging to get into and even harder to master, but has an excellent simulation of life in Europe during the medival period, has wonderful story-telling potential and will teach you a thing or two about European medieval history without you even noticing. Crusader Kings II will make you cry, laugh and learn all with only a map, some faces and a cart full of fun and interesting choicesIf you like history and strategy games, you will love Crusader Kings II.)

For historical buffs, people who have a fleeting interest in history, or those that enjoy a deep grand strategy game with varying scales of management will each find something here.  My only regret is not having waited to purchase huge gobs of DLC during previous sales.  So much so, that I am considering the purchase of the latest content at full price!  Gods help me...

												An extremely deep and clever strategy game, Crusader Kings II is the ultimate time sink. If you can manage to get past its substantial learning curve, you will find yourself deeply engrossed and always coming back for more.Frequent updates and an exceptional modding api give this game almost endless replayability. Whether you want to smooth out the rough edges and add some flavour (VIET) or create a twisted alternate reality of your favorite fantasy universe (A Game of Thrones and The Elder Kings), there is definitely a mod for you.

I go crusading, and she starts a rebellion after she got overthrown, now I have to wait like 10 years for her. I die, loose all warscore, and now play as my son. I re-join the crusade, become gay. Then the rebellion is done, but there is a bug that destroys betrothals while revolting, and she won`t accept my betrothal this time. After wasting my life pointlessly crusadin I have pneumonia,I lie down on the floor and cry. A few years later I die, and now I play as the moron sister who always tried to kill me, the heir is not off my dynasty, so I am going to get game over. Then I learn there is a law called tanistry for celts. I manage to save my dynasty to get the game bugged the day after.11/10 would play as moron, waste houndreds of hours only to loose the game again.Another time, restore the roman empire as a polish emperor. I get 7 daughters, and then I get one son while I am like 60. One of my children is a demon, she kills 5 of my children, including my son(heir) then I play as my oldest daughter son, who is a powerfull king and my vassal. Then I seduce my demon aunt, and marry her after putting a baby in her belly.  Meanwhile: Mongols become muslim, and mali becomes catholic, totally randomly.

												This is the ultimate medieval dynasty simulator. You rule over realms in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and India and have many different cultures and all christian faiths at your disposal and yes, you can change both during the game.You play one character at a time, a person with skills, virtues and flaws which has inherited titles, prestige, money and also claims on titles from his parents. You can wage war, but only when you have a proper (medieval) reason to do so.Holy War, assassination plots, cheating on your spouse and inheritance of land just through succession will be part of your daily routine if you play this game. You can work your way up from a low Count title to becoming an Emperor, become a heretic, annihilate cultures and religions and make your dynasty the most powerful one in the world of CKII, dominating the world from Portugal to India and from Norway to Ethiopia for centuries.The expansions allow you to try different religions (Norse Pagans, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews...), different governmental systems (Eastern Rome, Trade Republics...) or expand the gameplay in other directions (deeper focus on roleplaying or certain religions, earlier start dates etc).Buy this game. But be warned, it's about characters, not about optimizing economy or developing technology. Another warning: It will eat up your time...			",373,102,2,64,29,4,81

												I bought this game and then for the next week barely managed to keep eating and sleeping. I was wary because Paradox's last title, while historically brilliant, had a bit too high a ratio of menus and info to meaningful decisions. This game on the other hand is not only a fantastic representation of the period but also perhaps the best alternative history engine ever created. If you like management games with omnipresent failure conditions (Tropico, for example) and you're okay with making up your own goals or playing for the sake of seeing what happens, then you have to get this.

												There's very little to say that the dedicated, vocal and truly helpful CK2 community has not already said.  Grand Strategy is the name of the genre, but everyone knows the game is really both a broad and deep Medieval Dynasty Simulator.The learning curve is often described as steep, but it is only as steep as you want it to be.  Want proficiency in all the subsystems so you can build a dominant hegemonic empire?   Just want to fool around with history and see what happens?    The game will happily take all comers.If new to the game, don't worry about the DLC avalanche.   Try out the base game and see if it's your cup of tea.  (Hint:  if you like history or strategy or power or maps or even sweeping dynastic stories, it will be your cup of tea.  If you like all of these things, then welcome home.)			",46,9,0,22,7,0,42

												This is rather a simulation than a game. It has synchronisation issues and crashes in multiplayer sometimes.  the player need an imense amount of time. The game does not really have a steam integration neither does it help players connect with other players. it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLCs at insane prices. there is almost no music and the extra tracks are DLCs that cost extra.It has hell long loding screens. it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial which is probably the most boring thing to get into ever. But i still would recommend it. its a very good game. its complex. fun to play with friends and has many other very cool features. its one of those games you can play almost passively at one time and very actively at another.If you are looking for a world domination game this probably ain't really the thing, because it takes very long time to ammess smaller regions with war and war usually brings less new land than a few well placed marriages.31 hours of playing and i'm still not sure if i really understand all the mechanics. so yes this game is great, but its surely not everyones taste.

												This game is seriously addictive. I can't stop playing, but it's great. Downsides are that it's a bit tricky / intimidating starting out, not much in the way of a good tutorial, and it can be complex. However it's still very accessible, just make sure to clock a few hours before writing this game off and get in the swing of things first if you're initially struggling. Great if you want to transition from more popular strategy like CiV into more complex games. The Game of Thrones mod is a must if you're a fan of the series. Absolutely recommend this if you appreciate games with depth.			",57,22,0,18,15,0,8

												A brilliant game, which models accurately and immersively all of the political intrigues and dynamics of the era. The game, however, is rather lackluster if played completely bare of mods- it requires several of the main expansions to really become one of the best. Part of this is the fact that certain gameplay styles and religions are locked from being playable until you purchase DLC which can cost upwards of ten dollars.The game, beyond it's diplomatic and intrigue features, is actually rather bare. Combat is incredibly simplistic, and often numbers will win a battle regardless of the skill or quality of the opposition's troops. The economy must be taken at face value- the different types of settlements provide nothing but a choice between high tax and low levies or vice versa. Churches are something you will probably never build outside of roleplay, as your player character cannot use them (theocracies are locked from being playable) and they provide both medocre taxes and levies.Some mechanics still need tweaking, often successions between dynasties and rapid succession between characters is a little too seamless, as the strength of one's claim after a title has been usurped is irrelevant, as is the legitimacy of one's dynasty- if there is no eligible heir within the dynasty, the title will succeed to the character with the strongest claim in the game, and if that is not an option, it goes to the most powerful vassal in the realm. Often this will happen with little disruption to the operation of the realm, even whilst wars are being waged. History demonstrates that there would be significant upheaval if 5 kings succeeded to the throne within the space of a month. In the game, however, this is not the case.All in all, however, these things can be overlooked, in favour of acknowledging the massive amount of effort that has been put into the game to make it immersive, easy to learn and fun to play. It is quite accessible, however there is still much to learn if you wish to master the game of thrones.			",70,6,2,17,38,0,29

												Hours played is conservative because I generally play offline. I like to try out a lot of different games and genres, but I always come back to CK2 (and I lose entire weekends to it when I'm supposed to be working). My favourite strategy game by far.It wasn't easy for me to learn (to be honest, I'm still absolutely terrible at it) - I had to look up things online frequently at the beginning - but even screwing everything up can be fun. I love the dynastic aspect of it (think Rome TW's dynasties but better). I get a kick out of marrying people off and stealing heirs. I don't often play an aggressive game - you can war and pillage if you feel like it, but you don't have to, which makes the game ridiculously replayable for me because eventually I get bored of raising armies and chasing idiots across the sea.My favourite part is earning kingdoms through a couple of generations of sneaky, well-placed betrothals. Which always inevitably backfires. You start doting on your little bloodline, get cocky because the wives start popping out geniuses all day erry day, and then bam, your only son gets landed by inheriting some obscure dead relative's puny county, marries an inbred forty year old, and screws up all of the beautiful perfection. I fangirl this game so hard...The game is frequently updated, and for me, stability is rarely an issue. I love the DLCs (yes, even Conclave). I want more events, and traitors, and faces... as I said, fangirl. But I've played this so much, and I still find new stuff in every playthrough. Well worth the steep learning curve.

												One of the best games I have played in years, CK2 is also, in a genre notorious for hard to learn games with absurd complexity, not quite as hard to learn as other grand strategy games. You play as a Lord/Lady in a medieval world and seek to... do whatever you please, really. More often than not, that means getting and maintaining power, by any means neccesary. Diplomacy, War, Intrigue, Assassination, and much more is available for you to make your heart's desire come true. In other words, this is the Game of Thrones: You win or you die. Speaking of which, there is a Game of Thrones mod for this game... and it is awesome. :D			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												Crusader Kings in an incredibly indepth sandbox medieval grand strategy game. Simply put you are given a map and a dynasty and your task is to do what ever you want with them! Take a lowly Count and raise him (or his heirs) to Emperor. Eliminate your rivals at court through intrigue. Conquer Europe and Asia in the name of a restored Empire! You choose an objective to achieve and use the games carefully designed features to achieve it.Things to note: There is no real time battles; numbers, terrain and generals dictate win/losses.It's not a graphically interesting game; don't expect the spectacle of the Total War series here.It can be tough to get into; initially the game can be overwhelming but if you stick with it you won't be disappointed.In my opinion this game is a must have for any strategy fan; push through the learning phases and you will loose hundreds of hours to this game.More info in the video bellow for those interested.[url=https://youtu.be/QHbOkqzLrCc/url} ",62,14,0,15,24,1,32

												This is a pretty nice game to be honest, although, really, I enjoy it a lot more since I got a fair amount of the DLC.Been on and off this for some time, but the more I play it, the more I love it. It's not like the Total War series (which I originally thought it would be like) at all, it's so much more gritty and, in some ways, devilish. It gets to the point where you manage to get past the learning curve which, thankfully, isn't too steep, and you're able to build a nice kingdom that has secure borders and is the ire of many. Pretty soon you'll have people bowing to you and wishing your might didn't come crashing down on you!The intrigue system is, for all intents and purposes, your home at some point or another. You'll be using this to stage either Grand Feasts or Mass Conversion to a religion or culture, but it's more fun after a point to be the WRONG religion in relation to your neighbours. Makes things  very  interesting. There is a little bit of micro-managing, especially when it comes to trying to get claims and manipulating other powers, but once you get this down, you'll be living in a spinster's paradise.

												No doubt that this is a great game.Crusader Kings II can hook you in on a historic strategy gameplay. There are tons of possibilities of fame and shame on this game. Essentialy you play as a dynasty, whether your dynasty be the line of kings and emperors, or be just vassals, that is your choice. Though you start small as a lowly vassals, it is possible for you to become emperors, and it's also possible to be ""demoted"" to dukes at the same time.This game have quite deep (and quite correct) simulation of kingdom life. You have to have a heir to continue your dynasty, keep your vassals weak, keep your liege happy, and so on. You can't wage war on every kingdom, you have to have a valid cause of war for that. To gain that cause war, you have to work hard. You can send your steward to create some fake claim, or you can start a holy war, or you can combine assasination and marriage so you can press your claims, etc.There are so many mechanics in this game. The problem is that this game's help and tutorials are next to useless in explaining this or that to you. But on the other hand, the tooltips are really handy. You can know why this vassal is mad, or why that vassal is happy. Nearly all components in this game can be explained by the tooltips, though the mechanics is still hard to learn.In the end, this game should be bought. For me, it's 9.25/10, slightly beaten by EU IV.			",410,96,25,72,120,2,141

												This game is holy. Despite the difficult interface (for those new to paradox games) and the inevitable steep learning curve, the game is fantanstic. It is the closest thing to an actual medieval political simulator (although not perfect). (Almost) All the DLC are worthwile and add something to the game. The Game of Thrones mod is superb, the platform of CK2 works brilliantly (apart from the soundtrack, which you simply turn off and play the hbo soundtrack instead). If you are interested in the game make sure you take the time to play through the tutorials, which will help you to get started.			",19,2,0,4,9,0,12

												One of the best strategy games out there, and for sure the very best medieval political game. You have to really think about your plans, short and long-term, forge the right allies, and use assassins and marraiges to protect yourself from opposing powers. The rebellions and infighting is really well done.Been playing for over 300 hours and don't see myself stopping anytime soon.9/10.			",85,33,0,40,27,2,20

												I did not get to play Crusader Kings 2 very long during my free weekend time, thus I did not accomplish much in game, but I have got to say this few hours hands on with it has me interested in the series more than I ever had been before.  I would recommend this game to anyone a fan of strategy and ""empire building"" games. Crusader Kings has a lot of depth to it, more so than many strategy games I have played as of late, so its something that you should take into account if you are interested in this game.

												A wonderful game of grand strategy and choices, CK 2 is all about guiding your family dynasty to greatness during the Mideveal period of history.  There are so many decisions to be made that can affect your family, A marriage could lead to an alliance, or it could lead to a rival making a claim on your for your crown. What to do with prisoners and traitors? You can execute, banishment, release, take away titles, each choice you make effects how your vassels view you and could increase your hold on your kingdom, or breed rebellion among your people.  Should you go on a hunt, have a feast, blot out the infidels or sponser a fair to gain favor with the peasants, every choice you make can bring reward or potential ruin to your dynasty.  The only drawback in this game is warfare is a bit simplistic. I do enjoy having to have a real reason to go to war, not just because I can. This title definitly has taken ahold of alot of my free time. I also enjoy that the developer is actively supporting their product and are constantly patching and upgrading the game and mechanics along with providing new DLC content at the same time.

Mainly the ""Losing is fun"" attitude. The game is an endless cavalcade of royal families backstabbing and incest and plotting in courts, but there's no game over as long as you have still some heirs with which to continue the saga. Very much like Game of Thrones. Highly highly recommended.			",554,177,10,94,66,6,114

												Do you enjoy killing family members? Do you like to ruthlessly kill your neighbor's sons in hopes of obtaining his land? Have you ever wanted to have the Norse religion spread all across Europe? If you said ""Yes"" to any one of these questions, Crusader Kings II is for you! Now you can commit crimes against humanity, sleep with your brothers wife and cause the destruction of everything those pesky Catholics ever knew and loved. All without any real world risks! Please note: Yelling ""Finally I killed my son and inherited England"" may cause family and friends to become concerned about your mental stability and moral and ethical well being.(As an additional serious note: This game is decently challenging to get into and even harder to master, but has an excellent simulation of life in Europe during the medival period, has wonderful story-telling potential and will teach you a thing or two about European medieval history without you even noticing. Crusader Kings II will make you cry, laugh and learn all with only a map, some faces and a cart full of fun and interesting choicesIf you like history and strategy games, you will love Crusader Kings II.)

												I bought this game and then for the next week barely managed to keep eating and sleeping. I was wary because Paradox's last title, while historically brilliant, had a bit too high a ratio of menus and info to meaningful decisions. This game on the other hand is not only a fantastic representation of the period but also perhaps the best alternative history engine ever created. If you like management games with omnipresent failure conditions (Tropico, for example) and you're okay with making up your own goals or playing for the sake of seeing what happens, then you have to get this.

Then the rebellion is done, but there is a bug that destroys betrothals while revolting, and she won`t accept my betrothal this time. After wasting my life pointlessly crusadin I have pneumonia,I lie down on the floor and cry. A few years later I die, and now I play as the moron sister who always tried to kill me, the heir is not off my dynasty, so I am going to get game over. Then I learn there is a law called tanistry for celts. I manage to save my dynasty to get the game bugged the day after.11/10 would play as moron, waste houndreds of hours only to loose the game again.Another time, restore the roman empire as a polish emperor. I get 7 daughters, and then I get one son while I am like 60. One of my children is a demon, she kills 5 of my children, including my son(heir) then I play as my oldest daughter son, who is a powerfull king and my vassal.

												This game is quite possibly the easiest and most addicting of the Paradox grand strategy titles to get into.Audio - The base audio that comes with this game really captures the mood of the time, with additional themed soundtracks you can purchase for a small sum. Even the effects really add to the game with relevant sounds notifying you of births, tithes collected, war declarations, etc.Environment - You put yourself into the role of a ruler ranging from the 8th - 15th century AD with a map ranging from the Indian subcontinent to Iceland, Ghana to the Steppes of Asia. Though this range is smaller than with other Paradox titles, with unique mechanics like the tribal system, the Indian caste system, and such there is a great feeling of variation depending on where you start in the map.Replay Value - With thousands of characters to choose from (or you can choose to make your own), tens of religions, cultures, and various ruling styles the replayability in this game is endless.Shill factor - The list of DLC that comes with this game is daunting, however most of it is cosmetic. The refreshing thing with Crusader Kings 2 is that with each large patch (such as the one which introduced India) all players will benefit from free content regardless of whether they want to dole out more dosh for DLC.It's a fun game, especially if you enjoy a bit of roleplay. Go buy it and ♥♥♥♥ around as a duke, well worth the cost.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. Whenever I feel like playing a Game of Thrones game, this has so far been the closest thing to that experience for me. Don't mistake this for a replacement experience for a game like Europa Universalis or Total War, because while you certainly have the ability to run and expand your own country, this game is more about dealing with individual people and climbing your way up to a place of power (and then staying there!).

												I bought this game and then for the next week barely managed to keep eating and sleeping. I was wary because Paradox's last title, while historically brilliant, had a bit too high a ratio of menus and info to meaningful decisions. This game on the other hand is not only a fantastic representation of the period but also perhaps the best alternative history engine ever created. If you like management games with omnipresent failure conditions (Tropico, for example) and you're okay with making up your own goals or playing for the sake of seeing what happens, then you have to get this.

												Worked my way up from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ count to a king in ireland. Betrothed my son to a scottish queen. I go crusading, and she starts a rebellion after she got overthrown, now I have to wait like 10 years for her. I die, loose all warscore, and now play as my son. I re-join the crusade, become gay. Then the rebellion is done, but there is a bug that destroys betrothals while revolting, and she won`t accept my betrothal this time. After wasting my life pointlessly crusadin I have pneumonia,I lie down on the floor and cry. A few years later I die, and now I play as the moron sister who always tried to kill me, the heir is not off my dynasty, so I am going to get game over. Then I learn there is a law called tanistry for celts. I manage to save my dynasty to get the game bugged the day after.11/10 would play as moron, waste houndreds of hours only to loose the game again.Another time, restore the roman empire as a polish emperor. I get 7 daughters, and then I get one son while I am like 60. One of my children is a demon, she kills 5 of my children, including my son(heir) then I play as my oldest daughter son, who is a powerfull king and my vassal. Then I seduce my demon aunt, and marry her after putting a baby in her belly.  Meanwhile: Mongols become muslim, and mali becomes catholic, totally randomly. The strangest♥♥♥♥♥♥may happen here, be prepared11/10 would marry sexy demon aunt, and let a demon kill my whole familyOh, and did I mention the grandfather of the demon?

												Crusader Kings 2, or CK2 for short, the game that introduced me to grand strategy games as a genre and Paradox games in general. For me the best feature of the game (this might be seen as a combination of different features of the game) is that it focuses on characters. By this I mean that I take the role of a character and my decisions influence me and others around me. The game plays a lot like a more traditional RPG (BioWare games comes to mind). While spending to much time deciding who I should marry, or if I should go hunting or just attempt to seduce my lieges wife you come to realize that this game also has some very interesting strategy elements to it. Managing your levies and planning the expantion of your realm is something that you can spend a lot of time on. The best part is that you don't really have to do anything unless you want to. If I don't want to go to war over a neighboring county I don't have to! The game can be played the way you want. I can go on and on about all the things you can do in CK2 but I will close this review by saying that CK2 is a wodnerfull game. The RPG elements is what makes me coming back time and time again. Some ending remakrs:- The game can be very overwelming in the begining. I still don't grasp all the systems in this game and the best thing is that I don't really have to. Take your time, watch some tutorials or use the in game scenarios to slowly learn the game, it is worth it.- Hover over most things to get more information, just something that might help early on and can help you learn the game a bit faster.- Have fun! Play the way you want to play. Don't be afraid of testing things out, you can always load the game if you want to or live with the qonsequneses.Hope you enjoy!			",147,35,1,33,13,0,26

												Simply put this game is awesome.Why don't I recommend it? Because it could be better.If you are going to buy this buy it with all expansions.trust me you won't regret it.When paradox promises endless replayablity they deliver.One thing the game excels in is giving you a feeling of achievement.In most non-paradox games when you end a playing session you amy have built a base or have gained the best weapon but in essence you haven't really done anything.the weapon or base make it too easy.Once you reach your goal you are done.However with CK2 thats not the case,you may have become emperor of the HRE but that doensn't mean that yor game is over,your son could just as easily loose the title as you gained it.And even when you are done with the game theres always the conversion to EU 4/3 to carry on the journey.The graphics are good and the music is very fitting.Still if you've never played grand strategy I suggest you try the demo.Just be aware the demo is not the finished product so you should use it only to judge the core game and not the nitty gritty details of teh game.

												Crusader Kings 2 is a great original grand strategy game incompusing vast amounts of management and entrigue that most players will not be able to wrap their heads around their first attempt or even two playing without the help of a expieranced friend sitting behind them.From top to bottom there are characters in every part of every kingdom and empire no matter how big or how small, how powerful or weak those characters exist and can make huge accomplishments if chance or will provide them with the means. Empire > King(s) > Dukes > Counts > Barons, Mayors, Bishops > Your councilers > a plethera of courtiers > and huge armys, what do you do with this giant mathmatical fractoral? Who knows what you want but each part of the chain has people that want individual things and they will try to guide the system to their will if you don't. ""This is the game of thrones.

												Over the years I've logged over 1250 hours in this game. To say that it is one of my favorites would be an obvious given. What i like the most about it is that it focuses on the lives of a dynasty that I can create and develop over the annals of medieval European history. With all of the expansions this can also be extended to the mid east and Indian subcontenant.  The game continues to evolve with each successive addition to add more and more variety between governing types, religions, cultures, and even lifestyles. I would not call it high action, though it has its moments, but a game that can be paced and simply enjoyed in terms of strategy. If you love strategy and the intrigue of dynasty building this game is for you.As a bonus; if you're a fan of game of thrones.. the game of thrones mod is amazing.			",46,11,0,11,25,0,29

												I picked this game up on free weekend ""Can't be that hard,"" I said, ""Being king is easy!"" I said. I loaded up the tutorial, and all was going well. I had fought back agaisnt a rebellious vassel, had a proper heir and everything. That's when it all started. My own brother had asked the pope to declare me a demon or whatnot, something like that. Anyway, I had begun an assassination plot agaisnt him, and I tried to convince my nephew, his own son to join me in his assassination. He refused and went crying to his father, ""UNCLE LOOFA IS TRYING TO KILL YOU, PAPA!"" I soon declared war on the poor guys, before my vassel had rebelled agaisnt me because it turns out his daughter was married to my brother. He was soon publically executed, until all the kingdoms due south of mine were apparently all besties with my vassel, and oh dear, turns out they murdered my heir before the ragequit.Deus vult.Edit:While king of Leon, the black death swept over europe. Now, I, the king, didn't think I'd have to worry. I had to worry. First, my wife was infected. Then my children. Then me. What did I do? I offered to some muslim emirates down south to have my youngest son. Of course they'd accept, they'd want a hostage to keep control over me.Oh, how they were wrong.While they where considering the offer, I myself contracted the plague. That was fine, though. Even in death, my plans would work. As Pedro was shipped away to the south, a jihad was declared. Soldiers poured into Leon, but then Pedro arrived.Soldiers were taking and razing the land as they moved towards the capital, but in a coughing, painful fit of laughter, king Alfonso died in his throne, knowing that in the big picture, he had won.Pedro, you served Leon well. Thank you.			",54,4,0,4,17,1,15

Crusader Kings II takes place between 1066 and 1453, and there are literally hundreds of characters throughout that span that you can play as. Being a king is very different than playing a count, but neither’s journey is less interesting. The stories play out constantly, whether you play a provincial count or a godlike emperor. While your goal is ostensibly to sustain your dynasty as long as possible, Crusader Kings II is more about the journey than the goal. Getting there is more than half the fun.Crusader Kings II is complex, and the tutorials explain perhaps a third of the stuff you’ll really want to know. After a week of play you still have burning questions about major game systems that just aren’t covered in the tooltips or manual. But the potential is totally there, so long as you can stick with it and conquer the sometimes-overwhelming interface. There are little buttons everywhere, and while the interface is pretty useable once you get used to it, it’s never as easy to find specific characters or visualize their relationships as it probably should be. This in particular makes the game feel impenetrable at first.Overall Crusader Kings II can be a heck of a lot of fun. The more you understand, the more fun you have. Once you start getting past the learning curve you’ll find yourself more and more absorbed by all the complex little dramas that swirl around your nobles.THE GOOD- Challenging gameplay- Strategic interpersonal relationships- A complex and deeply rewarding system of diplomacy- Many DLC's for expanded play- Well-designed and easily navigable menusTHE BAD- Steep learning curve- Complex game mechanics- Overwhelming interface- Many DLC's are needed for optimal playDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE ",109,25,0,18,59,0,23

												Played as a Germanic Frisia and raided the shorelines of England. After the king the great died and left the kingdom to his 14 year old son I decided to take the seduction focus and I made the Christian mother to the king a lover. I then decided to burn England again, sacrifice the mother to the Allfather and leave the kingdom filled with B A S T A R D S, my B A S T A R D S.Crusader Kings 2 is by my opinion the best game from Paradox. If you really love to play games that makes you think or you love conquering land then there is no better choice than this.What makes this game so good?: The fact that you take your own choices that will effect the future so much. You can start as the Holy Romans and form Prussia, or you can lose all and have to play as a small kingdom far east. The basic game is simulated to act the historical events, but you can change them and make your own history.This strategic simulator will conquer more of your time than it will of Europe.There are problems of course, handling your vassals, defending your kingdom and keeping your dynasty alive. But the worst thing is that you have to buy expansion moduels to play as other charakters or different religions. So buy the expansions, but only when it is sale on them.If you are still holding back from buying it, then ask yourself. Do I love independence, difficulties and history?			",48,7,0,24,22,0,29

												Best freaking purchase of a strategy game in a long time. Not only is it increidibly in depth but you also get an education while playing, while some characters never existed others did. Like Genghis Khans's in the game, assuming you even make it that far. If you want a good strategy game then here you go, I acutally got this game half off for 20$ and I would pay the full price now if I hadn't of bought it. This games just awesome. The only change I would implement is more tactical choices during battles, you can choose which commander to lead your troops, and I like how they implemented a new system where you can choose the commander's for each great part of the Army e.g. left wing, center, right wing.

												4.5 / 5 -- It's really a good game for strategy lovers, esp. of Civ. ilk, though it is not the same game by any means. Also, if you play as Emperor it's much easier than lesser nobels ... and very entertaining if you are into the intrigue/diplomacy aspects more so than battle. I'm anxious to return to the game...I still have my original game dynasty. :-D			",90,49,0,62,13,2,28

												Crusader Kings II is difficult to get into. It requires a lot of invested time to get a handle on the mechanics. But once you do, the payoff is immensely satisfying and endlessly replayable. A must for fans of history, and of grand strategy.			",90,24,0,19,10,0,9

												A great game for those interested in the period and/or fans of Paradox. Taking control of either: a count, Duke, King or Emperor there is no aim but what you choose to do. Reform Norse paganism? Hell yeah you can. Make Edmund Blackadder and have him take the throne of England? You bet your sweet ragamuffins you can. There are certainly a few drawbacks as with most games however they're usually very minor or a hilarious bug that you can post in the forums and laugh about. I love this game and I'd recommend this game to whoever asks me if it's worth buying. Beware though, it's a fairly deep rabbit hole. 9/10			",98,33,3,24,27,1,37

 Crusader Kings II Review This is going to be a long in-depth review into Crusader Kings 2 so you better get some snacks to fill yourself up for the read.  Gameplay (8/10):  Crusader Kings 2 is a very unique game in the category of gameplay. It gets this uniqueness by bringing 2 genres together in a way different then usual. These two genres are RPG and real-time strategy. Unlike a game like Age of Wonders III where your RPG elements come from designing a undying hero, Crusader Kings II lets you create and play as characters that range from weak to powerful yet no matter what are extremely mortal. In Crusader Kings II your character has a set of traits that they start with however this can change in a blink of an eye. These traits can be obtained and loss through events and the traits can alter certain events meaning if you truly want you can play as if you have those traits. Crusader King II also brings in RPG to a slightly bigger level with not only managing relations with the outside world but with realistic an historic vassals who can leave powerless if left unattended. Also Crusader Kings II makes you manage your vast and growing dynasty in the game who can press their own inherited claims. In the category of strategy Paradox brings their classical style of strategy to this game with you playing and altering the past from historic time marks from between 769-1453 which then you may convert the save file so you may continue the saga on another Paradox strategy game. In the end where this game lacks is due to the massive locked content behind DLC (more covered later). Certain religions and start dates are completely inaccessible because of this.  Mechanics (9/10):  One area where Crusader Kings II excels in is mechanics. Unlike its counter-part in Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings II has a great variety of things to do even during peace time. Crusader King II has an in depth relationship system where certain decisions you make and traits you have can have an effect on a relationship with someone. These effects are shown as numbers where +100 is the highest opinion you can get while -100 is the lowest opinion you can get. Crusader Kings II is a game where relationships can turn from sweet to sour with the help of another system, the intrigue system. The intrigue system can be used to plot and kill people of your choice however if caught can drastically change the situation.  The systems work well and fit in together like a perfectly planned puzzle, even the marriage system. Using the marriage and intrigue systems in unison you can make your wife claim all of her brother's land and then she can pass it on to your heirs. There is three major systems that I haven't talked about that form the basis of this game. The first one includes a hierarchical feudal system. Firstly there are counts (the weakest playable characters) who own pieces of land who have barons living in them. If you have a few counties you may become a duke and etc. all the way from kings to emperors. The base mechanic is that you may only have vassals (people with land under you who pay taxes to you) that have a lower rank. You have a max amount of vassals you can have before you begin suffering from penalties, this is to stop rapid expansion and is to balance the game. Another base system is the holding system. Every character has a set amount of counties or baronies they can hold (a.k.a holdings). Duchy, kingdom and empire tier titles do not count as a holding. In a matter of fact having multiple of one of these titles can boost your holding limit. The final major system is the casus belli system. Unlike a game like Civilization V you need a casus belli to go to war (i.e. it is a reason to go to war). You may get these by fabricating claims or by naturally inheriting claims and more. There are so many more mechanics but then this review would become miles long but overall mechanics are detailed and in-depth, the only problem can be the huge number and complexity of them.  AI (7/10):   Like most strategy games Crusader Kings II has a difficulty option that changes the way the AI works. However it is unconventionally placed in the options menu. Yes this allows you to change the difficulty of a save mid-way through however it changes the difficulty of all the saves. Looking at the actual difficulties the differences between easy and hard can be seen. In easy the AI plays more passively and only declare war for casus belli they already have and rarely ever fabricate their own claims. In hard this is different as the AI will take a few more risks and is more likely to jump on someone's weakness even if it is a small one. Also they more pro-actively fabricate claims on other people's territory and in harder modes the AI is much better at vassal and family management. However there are smaller aspects of AI that is useful yet terribly flawed. If you have excess holdings you are able to let a AI give out your excess holdings. This piece of the AI is broken as it can give out the duchy your capital is in and make one of your vassal massively over-powered. In my opinion the gap between easy and hard is too great and a finer scale of difficulty must be used. In addition to that the easy AI should be given some more intellect so very basic decisions do not come out with the most outrageous decisions that even a new player would not make.  Price (6/10):   This is often the deciding factor when buying a game and that is the price. The base version of the game is £25.99. In my opinion this is a fair price but this is where the drawbacks come in. This game has huge amounts of DLC that when bought and added have great changes to the game and bring in a lot of new features and a lot of these features were developed after the game came out. However this is not the thing with all the DLC. When choosing a character you choose a person out of the map but some of these characters (e.g. Muslims) you cannot play in the base game. The game goes furthermore to rub it in your face by discolouring the play button, deactivating it and by saying ""You need to buy the Sword of Islam DLC"". That is not the only problem. Some of this DLC seems pointless. Although a lot of these pointless DLCs are 99p, these are things you would expect to be part of updates. For example new music, new textures for cultural units and even more useless crap. Yes people may say ""it is a business they need to earn money"" but do they really need to go this far? I think not. To get all the content of this game it costs a staggering £122.99 (This number is not outdated). This is by far the biggest dragging point of the game.  Overall (8/10):   Overall this game is very unique in its content. Despite its slight complicity once you’re into the game it just becomes second nature. It’s one more turn equivalent of just that one more kill or just that one more plot to finish effect does leave a massive effect on you. Oh and not to forget it huge replay-ability where no two runs are the same. I believe that the overall good quality of the game can somewhat make up for the high price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Takes a really good game to make me play for 16 hours almost non-stop on my first session.Crusader Kings 2 is an RTS like many of Paradox's previous titles; highly complex (where your typical RTS is concerned) and providing a highly realistic simulation of empire-expansion. Every facet, save tactical involvement in battles, is explored with detail, and with much at the player's control.One of the key features in CK2 is it's dynastic political system. Not only must you secure your line of succession through heirs to continue in your quest for glory, but there are no formal alliances. Everyone you can count on is either directly in your sphere of influence and thus obligated to serve, or aligned through familial ties.Even though I bought it during the sale, as previously I was unsure, now that I've played Crusader Kings 2, I can definitely say I'd not have issue with paying full price for it. This is even one of the few games I wouldn't be opposed to paying full price for DLC.5/5			",77,7,1,7,4,0,31

I don't even mind that there is a ridiculous amount of DLC; I'm happy to throw as much money at this game as possible so-long as they continue to develop new features and improve on the existing ones. The enjoyment and play time you will get from this game easily makes it worth the price. Even with my play time I feel like I have barely scratched the games surface.			",62,4,1,6,3,0,8

												Let me start of by stating that Paradox Studios is by far my favorite company. They make their games mod friendly, they create games with great depth and amazing mechanics that essentially develop into hours and hours spent constantly replaying as different characters in different eras of time. Not only do they release the game with this much customer care, but they also continuously update it and include features without DLC that dramatically improve the game. Crusader Kings II is a ridiculously fun strategy game that you'll be able to spend hours and hours playing, while never boring in the process. It's character development and focus on historical realism makes Crusader Kings II quite possibly the best video game ever made. New comers to strategy will find it really hard to understand the mechanics at play, as it took several people that I know (as well as myself) HOURS of gameplay to finally get a clue as to what we were doing, But, once you understand the game, you begin your reign over the medieval world.

												Considering that I've got more than a month of real time put into this game, I can definitely say I recommend it.  However I should note that the vast majority of that time comes not from playing the base game (which is decent) but was actually spent playing the stellar Game of Thrones mod.  It's literally better than any of the actual GoT games.  Seriously, check it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fairly steep learning curve. Once you get into it and get the hang of it, the possibilities, and fun, are endless. I highly, highly recommend this game to fans of grand-strategy games. The lack of depth when it comes to combat may turn some off, as this game isn't similar to the Total War series in the slightest. Overall, I'd rate it a 9/10. There are still some minor things that could be fixed, some things fleshed out more, but overall the game is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the attention span to play it.

												As of now, I have ~200 hours in this game and I have to say I love it. However, there are some things you should know before buying this game.1. The learning curve is semi-steep2. There is no 'objective' per se. You have to find what YOU want to do in the game.3. You should have the major DLCs like The Old Gods, Charlemagne, The Republic, Sons of Abraham, and Legacy of Rome.I'll admit that initially this game appears to be an overwhelming database of content, but the truth is that it only looks that way and is in no way confusing once you get about five hours into it. There are too many features for me to mention, but I HIGHLY recommend buying this game as it has tons of replay value.Update: ~800 hours in and the game still is just as fun. I can't recommend it more!			",93,11,0,13,18,0,14

This game has huge amounts of DLC that when bought and added have great changes to the game and bring in a lot of new features and a lot of these features were developed after the game came out. However this is not the thing with all the DLC. When choosing a character you choose a person out of the map but some of these characters (e.g. Muslims) you cannot play in the base game. The game goes furthermore to rub it in your face by discolouring the play button, deactivating it and by saying ""You need to buy the Sword of Islam DLC"". That is not the only problem. Some of this DLC seems pointless. Although a lot of these pointless DLCs are 99p, these are things you would expect to be part of updates. For example new music, new textures for cultural units and even more useless crap. Yes people may say ""it is a business they need to earn money"" but do they really need to go this far? I think not. To get all the content of this game it costs a staggering £122.99 (This number is not outdated). This is by far the biggest dragging point of the game.  Overall (8/10):   Overall this game is very unique in its content. Despite its slight complicity once you’re into the game it just becomes second nature. It’s one more turn equivalent of just that one more kill or just that one more plot to finish effect does leave a massive effect on you. Oh and not to forget it huge replay-ability where no two runs are the same. I believe that the overall good quality of the game can somewhat make up for the high price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												CK2 is awesome. Mainly because it depicts lots of characters in great detail. Your game will be not just conquering territory it will be roleplaying as ruler who must establish relations with his vassals. You must rely on them and not let them become too powerful, or they would overthrow you. Dying by hand of assassin is real possibility for Feudal Europe (or Middle East which is also part of the game), so is dying by plague or other illness. And then you will go on playing as heir to your character, which leads us to another important and fun part of the game - dynasty making, which if played well could give you new lands without war and claims for new titles (casus belli is extremely important in European politics, you can't just declare unjust wars right and left).Disadvantages:1) bugs, mainly due to rich mechanics of the game that was changed in game development. There are many bugs, but you won't encounter more than few. The reason is gameplay is different for Muslim Caliph, French King and Mongol Khan, most bugs affect only specific rulers under specific conditions.2) Game slows down all the time. It is especially annoying on slow PCs. You start game on old laptop and it is quite ok for first century, but then your game is 10 times slower and you just have to quit playing.3) Tactical battles are too primitive. It is not Total War, nothing spectacular.Summary: worth playing is you like medieval history or like strategy games.Advice: wait for sale. -75% happens. And buy with all DLCs as.package.

												I really do'nt know what to say except: this is an excellent game. The way the entire system of  Medieval World was set up; the makers did a wonderful job. I am a history teacher, I thought I was informed about this time period. How mistaken was I. Now, this game has help me understand the mind set of the Medieval times. Also, how things worked in that time. Please, I highly urge you to purchase this game, mainly if you love this time or not you will be pleased with this period of our history. Try it! You will NOT be disappointed. The most important aspect of this game, is to be patient. Remember, this is a game you must think matters through and not go in without thinking first. Think before you do and not do before you think. Finally, the A.I. is competive and the story lines are great. Remember, no game is perfect, but this is an absolute wonderful game. I wouldn't NOT tell anyone to buy a game that cost a good amount of money on something awful.			",20,1,0,1,20,0,43

TL;DRThis game makes Jaime and Cersei's p0rn shoot at Joffrey's funeral seem like rainbows and unicorns. ___________________________________ 26 year old king: Involved my sweet uncle by granting him a title and some hot, sinister honey to a plot to assassinate the nurturing breasts that fed me from my youth--my own mother. Imprisoned my sweet sister unsuccessfully. Now she is determined to tear her flesh and blood apart. Betrothed to an eight year old who had the specialty of being humble, a plus in my book! Everybody did it back then when this was considered to be the norm, at least for the British monarch, but now I finally got a taste of virtually grasping its essence in its most truest form. Alas, once I quit the game because I was getting very sleepy did the sudden realization of what morbid behavior I had done begin to gnaw deep within my grief, drenched soul. Taylor Swift's Shake It Off! always soothes me at day's end. Swift's angelic voice and mesmerizing twerking won't even relieve this guilt trip of mine. What have I become? WHAT. HAVE. EYYEEE. BECOME! ...the only logical solution is to start a new game to redeem myself. I feel better now.			",92,16,3,15,9,0,5

												Crusader Kings II is one of those hit-or-miss games. It will miss with 95% of the population. Hell... you probably only have this game because of a deal, received it for free, or purchased it in a bundle. Amongst strategy lovers, 75% of you guys will consider it a miss. But... for those of you who are as stubborn as myself, this game will suck you right in. Before we continue any further... I have attempted to play Crusader Kings II almost 5 times before I actually enjoyed it. I quit 5 times out of frustration and simply not getting this game. If you love strategy, you must keep trying. Once I did understand the complex mechanics, I fell in love... just not with my first wife Matilda that I may or may not have simply used for an alliance with the Duke of Flanders. If you're reading this... sorry dear...My highest recommendation for beginners, start off at the bookmarked game and play as William the Conquerer. If he still holds the title, William the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you're a little behind. Move up a few months. Playing as William the Conqueror definitely helped my learning. And once you get a feel, you'll want to play as one of the Kings of Spain. Poor King Sancho dies, leaving his kingdom divided amongst his 3 sons. They are respectively the Kings of Galicia, Leon, and Castile. Will you be the youngest King of Galicia, who struggles with his Portugese Duke who plots to overthrow him? Or the middle King of Leon, the plotter with high intrigue that holds the support of his two sisters and his mother in his realm... Or perhaps the brave King of Castile who has under him the legendary El Cid, the greatest military mind of his time. Now, let's backtrack for a moment... Crusader Kings II has an in-sane amount of roleplaying involved. There are even fantasy elements that are added with some DLCs that come about, some of which let you fall in love with a horse, seduce your sister, eat your vassal, sacrifice virgins to God, or blind and castrate your own father. If that's not good enough, create your own character and dynasty and destroy history as we know it. Now here's a little example of something I normally do in a normal gameplay. Almost all my playthroughs, I hated the Holy Roman Empire. Solution? They give the pope a million reasons to hate them. Get enough money, piety, prestige, and the pope can grant you an invasion right. Net the right alliances, and you can storm into claim the Holy Roman Empire for your own. But suddenly expanding so massively will only get me overthrown... so why did I bother taking it? Simple. I destroy the title and grant everyone independence and watch all hell break loose in a nation that's magically divided into 100 country-states. Now, that being said, Crusader Kings touches base with a variety of religions, cultures, different ethnicities, and government. There are many playstyles and no one way to go about winning. You may become the Emperor of a grand Empire, such as the Holy Roman Empire, or be a starting Count that aspires to become a Duke or even overthrow the King... If those don't work, become a Republic state and work on building your house and fleet to make money as the more notable factions of Venice or Milan. With so many elements to this game, you may expand your influences and become Emperor through some basic means of marriage, alliances, marrying off your children and siblings, fabricating claims and fighting for claims. You can grow your power through military might and expand one county at a time. You may also save up and focus on wealth, expanding your land toward finances and heavy taxes, and putting that hard-earned gold to good use... and by good use... obviously we mean to kidnapping, assassinations of enemies, buying the pope's love, buying your liege's affection, heck, buying everyone's affection so that they may support you and elect you to becoming the new ruler. Oh... right... did I mention you could also just do the kidnapping, assassinations, and various other ploys yourself, start factions against your lord, and simply screw up anyone at your leisure? And if that isn't your thing... be pious and be with the Pope, and he will surely grant you invasion rights, which then may be called to action through alliances and simply declaring war. If that doesn't tickle your fancy, you could be the master of diplomacy, and let the people who love and support you do the plotting for you. As a ruler, you will come across many random events that determine the path your kingdom and your character goes. As a summary, Crusader Kings II is a must-play for strategy lovers, history lovers, roleplay lovers, and peoplewhosecretlylovedoingevilthings-lovers. You and I both know that you will all end up either castrating your own brother or sacrificing virgins somewhere along the line... Crusader Kings II is the gateway to heaven and hell with immense replay value, amazing roleplaying elements, and most important of all... sleeping with your brother's wife and letting your brother raise your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child.Did I mention you get to name your kids and any land you own...?Yours TrulyThe Emperor of PonylandDynasty of Rainbows and Magic			",84,13,2,41,16,0,51

												Since purchased this game it has slowly consumed my life. Getting a good nights sleep for work is secondary to ensuring the curs in Wessex suffer my wrath and spending time with my real wife has given way to sending what ammounts to bribes to my fake wife in hopes she'll put out and I can get an heir. 10/10 would pay my wife for sleeping with me again.

												Probably the best game I've played in a long, long, time.In my opinion, it's more choice & consequence focused RPG than strategy game. At least, that's how I've been playing for twenty hours, thus far. I've had so much fun as my randy Transylvanian duke, with a penchant for seducing every woman at court, and the wives of others - sadly, he later died in his bed due to a mysterious snake being in there with him; haters gonna hate, I suppose.I had hoped you could play as a religious order, or an unlanded noble - that would make for even more awesome roleplaying - unfortunately you can't. I highly recommend this, with some of the major DLC - especially ones which add even more character interaction, choices, mechanics, etc. I'm currently playing as a merchant prince of Venice, and it really is a very different experience - I feel like some sort of mob boss.My only complaint is the battle system. It's often just a frustration - which is why I was glad I didn't have to focus on it as a merchant prince of Venice.(P.S. I only fell in love with this game when I stopped playing it as a pure strategy game, and played it for the immersive character interactions. Haven't been able to stop playing it since.)

												Brilliant game. My only complaint would be that after 1000 hours played (this account and another) i've yet to play from start to finish. This isn't due to me getting bored and restarting, its simply due to the fact that after a few 100 years the game becomes unplayable due to lag. Maybe my computers just terrible but I know im not the only one that this happens to.			",15,0,0,2,14,0,17

												All those good things I said about Crusader Kings?  They apply here too.  This game is just amazing.  The interface is better, the graphics are better, the messages and information clearer, and the game play, while requiring a little more patience, is more satisfying.  Still it may be a little much for newcomers to grand strategy, so I suggest checking out some gameplay vids on YouTube after you've messed with the interface a bit.			",175,41,6,32,22,4,50

												So I started my game in the Old Gods start as the Hroflings, they ruled a single county. I expanded and became the petty king of the Northern sea, I saw that my faith was dying so i converted to catholisism and married a french princess at 52, i know had 14 kids and 5 of whom were male. I then married them to countess's and duchess's around the world. By my second ruler i had built up a large army and joined a crusade for the holy land. I was crowned the King of Jerusalum and gave my 5th and 6th son vast amounts of land in that area while my heir got cyprus. At this point my wife had a satanic daughter and tried to kill my other children. I married her off to some fat 74 year old count in hungry, thats a form of punishment. After that a great jihad was declared and all my lands were taken from me, My 5th and 6th son converted to islam to save there skin. From here my next son married the queen of aragon and my grandson was crowned king. i was content to live out my days as a good king, but the Aztecs picked the wrong homosexual dwarf to f with, they tried to invade my lands and i called on my mass of relatives to defend me, which incledThe King of PolandThe King of England10 random dukes in the Holy Romand Empire 5 dukes in Byzantuimand of Course my kinsman the Sunni Caliph We trashed the Aztecs and on that day the pope and the Caliph fought together.10/10 would have Muslim relatives again..

												This game is seriously addictive. I can't stop playing, but it's great. Downsides are that it's a bit tricky / intimidating starting out, not much in the way of a good tutorial, and it can be complex. However it's still very accessible, just make sure to clock a few hours before writing this game off and get in the swing of things first if you're initially struggling. Great if you want to transition from more popular strategy like CiV into more complex games. The Game of Thrones mod is a must if you're a fan of the series. Absolutely recommend this if you appreciate games with depth.			",57,22,0,18,15,0,8

												WARNING: This game is not for everyone. The first 3 times I attempted to play CKII, I just kept the game paused while I looked through what seemed like hundreds of menus and tooltips for about an hour, then closed the game in exhaustion. You will need to learn many complex game systems, and you may also be inspired to study medieval history just to have a better understanding of a particular region, culture, religion, or style of warfare. If you have the discipline to learn it, this is a pretty fun title.Once I finally started, I married a cousin for her inheritance, fought off a rebellion by my strongest vassal, then lost the crown when my brothers attacked my kingdom. When characters die, you keep playing as the chosen heir in the dynasty. Ultimately, my descendants went on to be Emperors. Except that feeble one who fell off a balcony. Total accident.

You can start as small Irish count and create kingdom of Ireland or start as Holy Roman Empire and try deperately to hold it together while expanding the AI in this game are quite intellegent they will often wait to attack till they know you are distracted they will get you excomunicated to hurt your rep and sometimes offer a marriage knowing that if you accept they can call you to join a war they are losing, This game is basically like Total War Series but with reversed roles in those games the combat is the meat here the Strategy is the Meat of the Game.

												Crusader Kings 2 is important for a number of reasons. It's one of those games that you can only get on PC due to the sheer amount of depth to it. When you start the game it is very confusing and very baffling, so I’ll start off with why you should play it and then how to get into it.If you played Total War and you hated the empire management element but loved the battles then this game probably isn’t for you. What Crusader Kings 2 provides you with is essentially a toolbox for managing your Dynasty. But what is a Dynasty right? Well you play as an independent country or a duchy in the middle ages and when your character dies you play as their heir, and keep on playing until you have no heirs left. Which can happen if you manage to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the whole of Europe.What this leaves you with is a game that is based almost entirely on intrigue and plotting. You marry not out of love, but to forge strong alliances so that you can call them into war. You can assassinate people who don’t like you and try and manipulate situations so that you end up in power. In my first play through my daughter killed my son to solidify herself as heir, I then discovered the plot and had her executed. My brother than hated me for killing my daughter and had me killed. Then I went on playing the game as my brother – who everyone actually liked because he got rid of a terrible king. He then ruled for a ridiculous period (50 or so years), united Ireland and had a ton of children with 3 different wives. Once he died, all of the children started plotting against each other to get themselves into power. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.It sounds great on paper right? But mechanically it’s quite complicated because there are SO MANY moving pieces to consider. This is the how part of the review. When you start, you want to do as many tutorials as you have the patience to sit through, and then do a learning scenario like playing as the King of Leon. Once you’ve done that a few times, then I strongly recommend picking a kingdom on Ireland and having your short-term goal being the Unification of the Kingdom of Eire. There are a few really comprehensive guides and wikis on this game, so do have a look at those as well.It’s a treat to play this game once you get into it. Just don’t come in expecting a Total War game. What this is, is essentially dynasty simulation at its finest. So fine that there’s a really awesome Game of Thrones mod for once you’ve got to grips with the game! Oh, and be wary of those Mongols in the 13th Century. Those guys are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ",272,59,5,44,25,5,47

												I urge everyone who purchases this game to not throw in the towel after a mere couple of gaming hours. With over 11,000 buttons to click, terms to remember and legalities to learn, it is definitely more complex than your average hack-and-slash, but an extremely rewarding experience when you stick with it. I would most likely compare this game to chess, especially its tutorial. When my grandfather taught me chess, he showed me all the cute little figurines, showed which way they could move and kept winning for seven years, until I finally mastered the game enough to beat him. This is exactly how I feel like with CKII. I played through the tutorial, read several different guides and have an extremely helpful friend with over a 1000 hours of this game under his belt - and I still very vaguely grasp what I'm doing. My daughter is the wife of the Kaiser - good stuff - but is it - but who should I kill... That's what a fraction of a second of the game feels like. All of this is emphasized by the fact that you literally don't know what you are supposed to do  - you choose it, there are no built-in goals. In conclusion, this game has an extensive learning curve. It takes time to master, but is very rewarding once you do. 8/10			",75,22,1,14,16,0,26

												Let me tell you some actual things that I've done in that Crusader Kings II:I was the Queen of Wales, and I saw that the person who was third in line for the duchy of York was an unmarried woman. She had three young children, two boys and a girl. The current Duke of York was a young man, with a single son, and a chaste wife. I invited the woman who might inherit York to my court, and I arranged for her to marry into my family. Meanwhile, I betrothed all of her children to members of my family. Being a member of my court, she had little choice in the matter. Then, I murdered the Duke of York, sending assassins after him. It took a small fortune, but he was eliminated. His young son made a poor feudal lord, being four, and it was quite easy to convince his court to murder him. With that murder, my erstwhile courtier became the Duchess of York. Two generations later, thanks to my long term family planning, the Duchy of York came into the possession of my family.I was a Scottish Duke, and I served my king loyally for two decades. He was my friend, my cousin, and I served with pride as his chancellor. But he sickened and died, and his young child became king. A wee lad of six, and I was made his regent and tutor. I also discovered that I was his heir. So, I murdered him, and usurped the crown. My new vassals were unhappy with my actions, so I purged them and replaced them with cousins. I betrothed my son to a brilliant, lustful Byzantine princess, and all seemed well. Until my son swore an oath of celibacy. With needs her husband could not fulfil, my daughter in law turned to me. Not so long after, a baby boy was born. I legitimized the child, murdered my son and my wife, and started over with my new family. I was known as Malcolm the Good.I was the Empress of Cymru (once known as Britannia), and my realm had turned to the Cathar faith. The Cathar faith is a Catholic heresy that believed in reincarnation, that a person might be man or woman in any given life, and which believed in gender equality. Being Cathar, I was able to land a woman with a fine mind for tactics as a countess, and I made her my marshal. When the Caliph declared a Jihad against me, trying to retake Hispania, I gave her command of my armies. At times, all three flanks of my main force were commanded by women. That countess led my armies in every major battle, becoming pregnant twice during the course of the war despite being 39/40 at the time of the births. She was wounded more than once, she led armies into battle while being outnumbered 3:2 or worse, but she never lost a battle. She became the second most famous person in all of Europe at that time, with more prestige than the Pope or Caliph or Byzantine Emperor or the Khans. By all accounts, over three hundred thousand infidels were killed by her forces. After the war, she suffered from depression, she lost her courage, but she was still the best person to lead the fight in a Great Holy War against the Norse tribes, far from her home in Portugal. She died at home, and one of her born-on-a-battlefield sons succeeded her.I was the head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark, and a treacherous family member gathered an army and struck directly at my capital. He destroyed my retinue army, and assaulted my capital. Outnumbered, with no support from my allies, with my other family members choosing to support the usurper, I was forced to surrender. I remained a duchess, but all of the barons and mayors and religious holdings in my territory reported to the usurper. For a decade, I raided Ireland and northern France, carrying off loot and hostages for ransom. Building myself a great hoard, I waited until the right moment. Eventually, the usurper became embroiled in a war in East Francia, fighting most of the still powerful Karling family. With his armies weakened, I hired mercenaries and I struck at his capital, assaulting it and all of his holdings. He tried to bring back his armies, but my own force outnumbered his almost four to one, and he was crushed. He died in battle, and I imprisoned his brother and heir; I banished him from my realm, reclaiming my rightful titles as head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark.I have conquered Europe in Odin's name. I have forced the wives of my defeated foes to become my concubines, and I have shed oceans of blood in the name of women's rights. I have accidentally married my great-granddaughter and deliberately married my sister. I have served Popes and I have murdered Popes. I have been trained in the art of war by a Ronin. I have had misadventures involving a merry band of outlaws in my forests. I have restored the Roman Empire. I have murdered spouses for fun and profit. I have seen battlefields where the dead number in the tens of thousands, and fought wars where neither side could muster five hundred men. I have turned back the Mongol hordes, and I have watched in despair as they annihilated my armies. I have conquered Rome for Islam, and I have retaken Jerusalem for Christ. I have plotted, murdered, schemed, fabricated, built factions, sent bribes, hired mercenaries, raised armies, raised children, murdered children, arranged marriages, taken lovers, banished prisoners, executed prisoners, shown mercy to prisoners, died childless and alone, died with far too many children holding power and claims to the throne, and so much more.If you approach Crusader Kings II as Risk with an annoying thing about people that you need to deal with every so often, you might have some fun, but you're missing out on the real game: Eugenics and Murder Simulator II. The game is totally not for everyone. It is NOT a game that people pick up quickly. But once you get into it, it's the deepest and most rewarding RPG ever made. It's about guiding a family through history, through the sinners and the saints, through the great kings and the terrible ones, it's about surviving all the multitudes of things that can go tragically wrong, and it's about the joy of crushing your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.As you might guess, I'm a fan. It really isn't for everyone, but if you have the patience to get to the point where you can take control of your own destiny there's really no game like it.			",236,46,6,57,22,2,36

												So good it made me quit smokingIf you have a job don't play this, if you have a wife/girlfriend don't play this, if you have children or a person that is dependent on you don't play this. If you're a looser like me who has no responsibilities then this game will make you feel like a real winner. The learning curve is steap but once you understand it you will understand all you need to know, from victoria 2 to hearts of Iron. I bought this and all DLC and began to play. After i got the hang of it i kept playing. I played for three days straight, Sleeping for only 8 hours through the course of those 3 days. On the last day I was so determined to finish my campaign that i didn't eat for 9 hours, didn't drink anything for 6 hours, didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥for 7 hours. Because of all this Cigarettes were the last thing on my mind. This game actually pays itself off in the first 2 weeks because of all that money that would normally go to cigarettes. 10/10 Prevents Cancer			",79,7,0,12,21,0,17

												So I started my game in the Old Gods start as the Hroflings, they ruled a single county. I expanded and became the petty king of the Northern sea, I saw that my faith was dying so i converted to catholisism and married a french princess at 52, i know had 14 kids and 5 of whom were male. I then married them to countess's and duchess's around the world. By my second ruler i had built up a large army and joined a crusade for the holy land. I was crowned the King of Jerusalum and gave my 5th and 6th son vast amounts of land in that area while my heir got cyprus. At this point my wife had a satanic daughter and tried to kill my other children. I married her off to some fat 74 year old count in hungry, thats a form of punishment. After that a great jihad was declared and all my lands were taken from me, My 5th and 6th son converted to islam to save there skin. From here my next son married the queen of aragon and my grandson was crowned king. i was content to live out my days as a good king, but the Aztecs picked the wrong homosexual dwarf to f with, they tried to invade my lands and i called on my mass of relatives to defend me, which incledThe King of PolandThe King of England10 random dukes in the Holy Romand Empire 5 dukes in Byzantuimand of Course my kinsman the Sunni Caliph We trashed the Aztecs and on that day the pope and the Caliph fought together.10/10 would have Muslim relatives again..

With crusader kings II, you have the option to assassinate your enemies, secude your rivals wife(s), to having 15 kids, and gravelkind succession. There is absolutely no means to ending your ambition, and at times cruelty to rise to the top of the ladder, and conquer the world of Crusader Kings II.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One day in Iron Man mode I had a very successful game as the Byzantine Empire I managed to capture most of the Balkans and capture 4 of the holy city’s (Jerusalem, Rome, Constantinople, and Antioch. But then one day I had my best overall Emperor had the traits strong genius and quick and I had a great wife she was Fair, Kind, and Lustful (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). But then I made the fatal decision to sleep with a courtier. When she produced a child I didn’t want it to ruin my reputation so I decided to not recognize the child.  Then after around 17 years I died multiple times from children having various diseases but then it came down to my Youngest being 18 he was the best out the lot he had strong and fair traits of his parents I then married a courtier who was a Genius. We had a child who was male. BUT THEN I looked at little Timmy and I saw a trait Inbred… I couldn’t figure out what caused this then I remembered that courtier then it all came to me. I married the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ daughter I tried to launch multiple assassination attempts against my heir but I couldn’t kill him. Then I died from smallpox and played the inbred craven 12 year old. People began starting factions as they now hated me for various reasons and I wouldn’t die I kept stooping assassins and eventually my empire fell. little timmy grew up to rule a empire for only 22 years before he was imprisoned and executed by his uncle.10/10 Wear protection when banging women who you just meet.

												The only bad thing about this game is the spam of DLCS , i don't like when they do that with a game. Also , for a beginner it would be HELL to play this game without a proper tutorial and/or cheats for the first time. So many  things to do and to take care of , it might be overwhelming. But this game is not for puny peasants , but for true monarchs who would lead their nation to ultimate glory. After you've learned the game it won't feel that overwhelming no more now that you know what to do but it will still be hard , if you make a mistake now it's a possibility (depending on the mistake) that you will feel that in 50 years to come , and so on. It's like an advanced game of chess where you can marry the pieces , bribe , asassinate them , etc , etc. If you are a strategy fan or a medieval times fan (like me) you MUST take this game. And oh , the soundtrack ~ AMAZING.			",85,10,1,18,11,0,22

												I remember when I had a family, friends, and a youthful figure. This game took all of that away, and gave me something better. Every day after school I sprint home to resume my Crusader Kings 2 journey, forging my dynasty to make it the greatest in all of Europe. My teachers tell me I will have to repeat the 8th grade, that my grades are slipping, I tell them to meet on the hills of Normandy where my dynasty reigns with an iron fist. My family has tried everything, whether it be cutting my computer cords, stealing my monitor, or turning off the power in our house; I always find a way to return to my beloved Crusader Kings 2. The first 200 hours of this game are a warmup lap, after you complete the warmup lap you realize you need at least another 600 hours to get the complete experience... After 800 hours, you cannot stop, and you realize this game has consumed your life in every aspect, but do you care? Of course not, because deep down you know that your real life doesnt matter anymore, only the lives of your characters in-game matter. Once you come to this realization, you will be at peace. I must finish this review now, my Chancellor has notified me that my liege lord is waging war, I must gather my troops and prepare for impending conflict. Farewell all, and pray for me.

												Crusader Kings II involes complicated strategy: diplomatically and economically as well as in handling domestic affairs to prevent insurrections and dynastically to continue your family's rule. It is set in one of the most captivating and exciting periods in history, has a myriad of possibilities, and even shows complex webs of feudal relationships quite well. It is a game that may seem overwhelming at first -- but that initial overwhelmingness translates into much thought and variations later. As with Europa Universalis 4, I definitely recommend the game, but it needs its DLC, which can get quite expensive at times.			",29,5,0,11,5,1,16

Downsides, it doesn't have a very good tutorial (there's a LOT to learn about this game, I'm 20 hours in and I'm still not even close of discovering everything that you can do, but check youtube videos, there's tons of them helping) and, apart from some problems while loading saved games (sometimes they get corrupted for no reason) and some version problems for online multiplayer, it's a great game to be entertained for hours.If you like Game of Thrones and European history, you'll be in for an awesome time!

												Crusader Kings II involes complicated strategy: diplomatically and economically as well as in handling domestic affairs to prevent insurrections and dynastically to continue your family's rule. It is set in one of the most captivating and exciting periods in history, has a myriad of possibilities, and even shows complex webs of feudal relationships quite well. It is a game that may seem overwhelming at first -- but that initial overwhelmingness translates into much thought and variations later. As with Europa Universalis 4, I definitely recommend the game, but it needs its DLC, which can get quite expensive at times.			",29,5,0,11,5,1,16

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game.I mainly play the Game of Thrones mod and probably only have around 15 hours of the base game out of my entire 200+ hours. Even though they might have some of the worse forum policies I've seen so far, I still love the political intrigue that comes with the game. Dynasties rise and fall, nations conquered, etc. Shattered retreat has a mod that removes it from the game completely (which is good since I hate shattered retreat, mainly due to the fact that if an entire army is going to retreat they would be much less organized. Especially if 10-12,000 troops just died out of your 15,000. If anything the army would split and scatted randomly, not being much of an army anymore.)Although I do hope for an RPG with similar political intrigue in the future (hopefully Game of Thrones based with smarter AI) as that would be a game of dreams for me.Amazing stories can also be created in the game, and I love the changes in history (or the differences in the Game of Thrones storyline) that can be found throughout it all. It's all extremely satisfying and I hope for more great mods in the future.Although when Crusader Kings 3 comes out you'll probably feel like your playing the first Crusader Kings on initial release. PI has a thing for reverting to it's base stage and making you pay for all the cool and interesting upgrades from the previous games through semi-expensive DLC.At least it's not Train Simulator DLC.

												Crazy, crazy complex game. So much you can do and always adding new, exciting content with DLC. This is not a game for people with little patience; there's quite a steep learning curve to get the hang of things. But once you start successfully taking over the world, it's lots of fun, especially as your subjects convert to your religion and traditions. Best DLC pack so far is probably the Old Gods.

												The only bad thing about this game is the spam of DLCS , i don't like when they do that with a game. Also , for a beginner it would be HELL to play this game without a proper tutorial and/or cheats for the first time. So many  things to do and to take care of , it might be overwhelming. But this game is not for puny peasants , but for true monarchs who would lead their nation to ultimate glory. After you've learned the game it won't feel that overwhelming no more now that you know what to do but it will still be hard , if you make a mistake now it's a possibility (depending on the mistake) that you will feel that in 50 years to come , and so on. It's like an advanced game of chess where you can marry the pieces , bribe , asassinate them , etc , etc. If you are a strategy fan or a medieval times fan (like me) you MUST take this game. And oh , the soundtrack ~ AMAZING.			",85,10,1,18,11,0,22

												Ever dreamed of cutting off your neighbourghs balls because he screwed your wife? Ever dreamed of then executing your wife and all your children so you can marry that hot hungarian princess and produce children with CLAIMS? No? just me? Anyway, this is Crusader Kings 2.Crusader Kings 2 is a personal grand strategy game by Paradox Entertainment, taking place between 769 a.D and and 1453 a.D (assuming you got the dlc). In between, you will form a grand Dynasty, backstab enemies, fight wars, ♥♥♥♥ing go crusadin and♥♥♥♥♥♥and hopefully rule the world. Or you might just die childless to the 715th byzantine revolt in the last 30 years.Unlike most other grand strategy games, ck2 works on a ""personal"" base, instead of a ""national"" base. What that means is, you are not the country of poophill, you are duke kevin II of poophill. This mechanic leads to a very interesting gameplay, where personal rivalries and intrigues, as well as the capabilities of the different characters play a major role. As such, it is fundamentally different from other grand strategy games, which is always welcome in my mind.Due to this personal system, the game also offers great variety on who to play. Wanna play a great byzantine emperor and reinstate the roman empire? You do you, go ahead. Want to play as a pisspoor eunuch, whose only way of dynastial survival is being cucked by his wife? If you're into that kind of thing, feel free to. The game has near limitless possibilities on who and how to play, and it will keep you entertained for hundreds, if not thousands of hours.The biggest contra of this game, however, is it's insane amount of dlc. Of course, most of them are not mandatory for an enjoyable experience (I for one recommend: at least get legacy of rome and the old gods.), but they do add up to an insane amount of money for one game. As such, you should grab this game while it's on sale. Stuff on sale is cheaper. Cheaper is better. You can spend more money on food that way. Or on your weird fetishes, but hey, i don't know anything about you.To come to a conclusion, I can fully recommend CK2 to anyone who's interested in a different take on the grand-strategy genre, to medieval history nerds of all kinds and sizes and especially to psychopaths who like cutting off other peoples balls or blinding them, just because he won a tournament against you (that's what you get, Patreikos).Happy Crusading, Deus Vult!

												I cannot explain what is so fascinating about this game.  Is it the alternate history?  Is it the dopamine hit I get when I reach a goal, or survive one more year?  Whatever it is, I find myself thinking about the count of Udonen, or the king of Georgia or whatever dynasty I happen to be playing.  A lot.  Even better, it loads fast, and if you only have 15 minutes?  No problem.  It is great for short bursts.Drawbacks:  you can sometimes get stuck in a situation where you can do almost nothing, except max out your game speed and wait until your situation changes.  This can occasionally lead to boredom, but it is a small portion of the game.			",54,19,0,33,8,0,27

												I personally love CK2 and I can highly recommend it to anyone who loves strategy games. I enjoy it more than both the CIV and Total War franchises. The game is quite difficult to learn and can feel daunting for the first few hours but then it becomes a blast. Moreover, the Game of Thrones mod for this game is absolutely brilliant and is a must play for any ASOIAF fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Went from TotalWar and Creative Assembly to Paradox games and the difference is mind-blowing. Never had this much fun with a strategygame. Really challenging and fun. The depth and complexity with everything from politics and family is so, so far away from totalwars simple game it can't even be compared. I love this game from the bottom of my hearth.

												I bought the game 3 days ago and I have 45 hours in it so far.. This game is so addictive. I much prefer this game to similar games such as Europa Universalis IV, especially when you bundle it up with all of the DLC.I can't recommend this game enough, it is so complex and intricate while being exceptionally rewarding. Don't expect a military strategy in the vein of Total War, as Crusader Kings 2 goes beyond the scope of any Total War game. some people may find the combat lacking compared to games like Total War etc. However these are completely different types of games, which some people just don't get. Combat comes down to size of force, composition of units, commander abilities, terrain and other modifiers. You don't get direct control like you would in Total War etc.There are so many different mechanics at play all at once. You have the Feudal system, where you're trying to please your vassals and build relationships with them, while you're trying to protect and enhance your dynasty, all the while stopping plots on you or your family, you're trying build claims on land to justify an invasion and you're setting up an Anti-Pope because the Pope excommunicated your uncle... Seriously when it all comes together it is both mind-boggling and fantastic.If you've always wanted to Marry your mother and imprison your father while waging war on your illegitmate half-brother.. well now you can. And it's brilliant.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you've ever wanted to RP as a 63 year old queen of Ireland who goes on late night romps with a single guard through the muddy streets of her city looking to fight a pack of ruffians and (of course) winning the fist-fight all on her own, this is the game for you. Or if you've ever wanted to start a game, get bit by snakes a year in, and die without heirs, effectively ending the game, all of this being random and out of your control, this is the game for you. So much fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
