												An oldschool RTS focused on resource management, Stronghold is probably still one of THE most accurate castle simulations you'll find, as more focus is given to castle management than elemination of enemy units.The novice RTS users or those who generally lack patience need not apply, as a lack of steam overlay (patch supposedly in progress) and general resource management focus means plenty of focus being required to see to the incredible intricacies.All of this said, avoid Stronghold Legends since it ends up just NOT being Stronghold, and avoid Stronghold 2 since it ends up being about where the series falls apart due to hitting the polygonal 3D ceiling pretty hard.

""WE AWAIT YOUR ORDERS.""One of the most memorable, legendary and best medieval builder so far. Firefly Studios made childhood of most of us really sweet and awesome. I still remember that back in those times I didn't have computer myself, so in order to play this, and couple of other games I had to visit my cousin. Those golden times of CDs and paper gaming magazines. That nostalgia.Even the intro of Stronghold will give you sweet nostalgic chills, and define you how middle age really was. Green soup with flies in it. For 2001 it was serious and complex builder. You had to take care of your people, of your soldiers, feed them and make them happy. They are as important as most powerful soldiers. There's really nothing much else to say. I don't really want to go deep inside combat, complexity of the game, economy and so on. Yes, it's point of review but when it's about game like that, I'll skip that.Price is phenomenal. 3,99 euros full price, 1,99 sale. That is really bargain. Sandwich will cost you same amount so definitely grab it if you feel it. I don't really know how long will game lasts you. Somebody can do 5, somebody can do 15, somebody can do 30 with it and somebody can go above 100 so it's really personal and not dev related. Bonus Point: ChildhoodRating: 10/10 ",95,13,6,7,12,1,6

 OverviewAhh, Stronghold... A slice of nostalgia, and a damn fun game to boot. I'm going to go on a bit of a rant here, to be perfectly honest, so for anyone remotely interested in this game I'll give you a quick overview right now. Stronghold is a classic real time strategy game with a focus on replayability, base building/management and careful positioning over the micromanaging tactics that tend to dominate many RTS games today. If that sounds up your street, I'd buy it at full price. The game is WELL worth £3.50 and I must have sunk at least 40 hours into creating new and interesting siege maps and swapping them with my friends to challenge one another alone. 8/10Onto the more detailed rundown...  GraphicsUmmm... Yeah, this isn't why you should be playing this game. It was made back in the early 2000's, and it looks like it. This 'HD remake' does little to help it there. There's no reworking of the graphics or anything like that, and the opening cinematic still plays in a hilariously tiny box in the middle of a great big black void. Fortunately, in-game itself is treated very nicely indeed with the new resolutions... There's definitely a charm to the animations, and the little details like the cinematics that play out on your minimap when you select certain buildings or to mark events are welcome... But there's not much here to recommend beyond the rustic medieval design of the game's interface as a whole, which still stands up to some degree despite the game's age. I suppose one bonus of this is that you certainly won't have to worry about upgrading your rig to meet any requirements...3/10 StorySo we're talking about the campaign then! Honestly, the campaign isn't why I ever played this game... But it helps. Particularly on returning to it, I'm surprised at how good the campaign story gets once you get into later sections. This is a simple story of revenge and honour in a historically ambigious version of England. And yet the game does manage to go beyond a simple framework that leads your nameless character from point A to point B to fight Lord C because... Well because Daddy issues. No, it actually manages to create something that you can invest in to an odd degree. Mostly though it's use of larger than life, fun characters.     Your two main advisors are a fun pair of Lords that bounce off each other in a way that's mildly amusing, but it's primarily the villains of the game that get the best moments. The four lords, The Rat, The Snake, The Pig and The Wolf (going by their nicknames) are each clearly defined, given backgrounds and range from freaking hilarious to pathetic to loathsome. The game does a great job throughout of giving you great reason to want to crush these four villains both in and out of gameplay itself, with the dialogue not stopping once your in-game itself. (Apparently medieval Skype calls were a thing. Who knew?)     The voice acting for these parts is... Well, this is going to be the divisive bit. It works for me, in an odd way. But if you've got any kind of ear for actors, you're quickly going to pick up on the fact that there's basically one, maybe two (three at a push) guys voicing EVERYTHING IN THE GAME. And yes, I said guys quite intentionally, as this includes the women. The game, however, appears to be well aware of this deficiency and plays it up for all it's worth (Most notably in the case of the mother's wondering around your keep who let you know how lovely the morning is in their best Monty Python impersonation) with some success. It's a matter of taste, but I find it pretty entertaining, and within the campaign itself it does add a kind of charm to the whole proceedings in regards to the storytelling nature of it's plot. 7/10 (6/10 if you don't appreciate hilarious voice acting.) GameplayAh. Here we go. This is what it's all about. Simply put, Stronghold is a fantasticly fun RTS. There are a variety of units that serve basic purposes, but the game knows not to go too far with it. When the time of a siege is approaching fast and you only have limited moments to decide whether to split your resources between your economy, your castle walls or your military, it's important that you know exactly what every soldier is there to do. The game does an excellent job of setting up a simple, but useful roster of troops to choose from. Without going into extreme detail here, just be aware that this is one game where zerg swarming the weakest units isn't going to get you very far if you're trying to siege anything beyond a very basic wooden set-up... Not if the defender is at all smart with their pitch and engineer set up, that is...      There are counters to pretty much any unit type, and as of such this often becomes a game of out manouvering your opponent or careful planning rather than sudden quick decisions. The siege mode which is entirely focused on the combat and a single siege (obviously) is certainly more exciting in that sense, but even during battles the game is not a fast-paced affair. It is exciting primarily in the scale and degree of strategy you must deploy to break through seemingly impregnable sets of walls and defences, or ensure that those damn trebutchet don't get set up out of your archers and crossbowmen's range... And if they do, whether it's worth sacrificing your precious few knights in a charge to try and destroy them this early on. All in all, Stronghold is an oddly relaxing game inbetween battles. Every decision matters, but the game's soothing soundtrack and charming graphics, combined with the focus on placement and management over micromanaging and quick reflexes gives it a very laidback feeling compared to a lot of modern RTS installments. If you haven't played a game like this before, this may seem a bit 'off' to begin with, but give it some time and I think you'll soon grow to appreciate it. Unless, of course, you're a twitch gaming junkee that just needs his next fix, in which case why are you even looking at an RTS review? You weirdo. Sheesh.     Oh and I suppose we should talk about replayability. You want to talk about replayability? This game comes out, walks up to most games that talk about replayability and just slaps them across the face and then suplexes them into the corner, screaming like it's Hulk Hogan and the Ultimate Warrior's unholy love child. Stronghold's map creator is probably one of it's best features. The base maps themselves within the siege and invasion modes are already great fun, but the map creator allows you to basically do whatever you like, however. It's a standard other RTS games should look to achieve.    If I were to lay any complaints at the floor of Stronghold's gameplay, they would all come from dated limitations. It is possible to flatten the world and look at structure layout by pressing spacebar, which helps make sure that you haven't missed any gaps but camera positioning IS an issue. For the most part, it's fine, but I am now spoilt by modern games that give full use of a camera that allows seemless positioning and zooming. This game allows you to switch between looking at the map from four different directions when you hold down right click and select a compass. And yes, I know that I've been particularly fair on the game given it's age before this point, but this IS the game's one major failing. It's not a big one, honestly, but it's one that should be mentioned. All I can say is, thank god they thought to add in the spacebar option. 8/10Stronghold is a very good game. Have I said that yet? I think I have. Maybe I'll say it again? Yes. Stronghold is a very good game, any limitations it has mostly come down to the game's age, but with this HD remake it's greatest limitations (actually being able to play the damn thing on a modern computer screen) have been fixed. I would HEAVILY recommend it given it's reaonable to the point of criminal price.			",111,24,0,15,6,1,21

This is a long review, so if you just want a summary of why I recommend Stronghold HD then skip to the Results section and reading from there.Firefly Studios makes a brilliant castle simulator game, Stronghold. Then over ten years later they bring it back in HD, finally you can play this epic on modern machines. For those who never played a Stronghold game and for veterans alike this is a great game to get into. Story:This game is based on its campaign; a very interesting story involving you, a young man, bringing down the monstrous villains who murdered your father in cold blood. You embark on this quest with a small band of soldiers still loyal to your father to retake the kingdom. With a few allies along the way you vanquish the foes of the king one by one. In this epic campaign you meet series’ most notorious villains The Rat, The Snake, The Pig, and The Wolf; each one of these criminals crueler than the last. Gameplay:This game introduces basic elements of castle simulation, mostly focusing on combat. You construct a castle, manage taxes, harvest resources, and construct weapons. In order to bring about this balance you must maintain popularity and income within your castle. Villagers will move in until your houses are full and you've got to make sure you can support them. Campaign:Some of the missions are near impossible even on the easiest difficulty. On the other hand some missions are so mind-numbingly easy even on the hardest difficulty. There are no achievements for this game and cheating is always an option. In order to beat the Pigs Castle the second time I had to use cheats (the gold cheat) so I keep building new catapults with my Engineers. The map took me for ages to beat, but other than that one mission the rest of the game was rather simple.Hint:I would recommend shifting the game speed throughout missions. When you start each missions putting it at the lowest speed, 10. Then once you've got all your buildings in place raise the speed up to 30 or 40. When you know you have won the map move the speed up to 90 again in order to speed up the victory process. Results:If you like city builders, enjoy real time strategy combat, and prefer macro-managing to micromanaging then this is the game for you. I would recommend this game regardless of whether it is on sale or not, its a great game and you can easily get 12-hours out of the campaign alone. For an older generation game Stronghold is leaps and bounds beyond its competition.Pros:+You not only build a castle, but you also manage it politically.+Military units require villagers as well as weapons/armor in your armory. +The campaign offers a very riveting story that takes you across the Great Britain.+The combat is rather intense and can require the usage of multiple siege tools.+The market allows you to buy and sell goods in order to meet tough deadlines.Cons:-Sieging a castle can be near impossible unless you outnumber your enemy 100:1-Some missions basically require you to cheat in order to win.-Building an army quickly can be ridiculously hard because of the prerequisites (most missions I built a market and bought weapons rather than building them myself).-No skirmish mode-Poor unit mapping, many times units will spread out rather than clump causing enemy archers to shoot them (units hit by arrows will stand in position until they die rather than move themselves to avoid being hit).

												12 years later, and the beatiful pixel art castles, landscapes and characters of Stronghold 1 still amaze me. I was overjoyed to see a high resolution release at a reasonable price! The game's deep micro/macro management castle-building gameplay, tongue in cheek narration and hilarious (authentic) English regional accents all play key roles in SH1's lively and detailed medieval world.The military campaign is particularly well paced and challenging when played on Normal or higher, and there's even a level editor, freebuilding and multiplayer mode to explore... great replayability.At £3.50 there's really no reason not to buy this outstanding game.

Posted: June 15, 2016
												It's strange that there aren't more castle-builder games out there. It's the thing that literally everyone who goes to the beach or gets in the vicinity of building blocks does, after all. But even after 15 years, we really just have the Stronghold series to fall back on. I've been looking at a lot of classic builder games lately and many don't hold up well at all anymore, but I have to say that the original Stronghold managed to surprise me.As you've probably gathered, Stronghold puts you under the heavy brow of a king in command of a castle. Arranged much like an isometric real-time strategy game like Command & Conquer, most maps start you off on an undeveloped piece of land on which to place your keep and granary, and then fill in the buildings and walls from there. The maps are fake 3D, which is to say they're 2D tiles placed at elevations to give the illusion of 3D, but they work better than the imperceptible voxel messes of early Tropico games.The development of your castle is a pretty interesting balance of peasants and resources. You have a respect rating with your people, and as long as it's positive new peasants will come to your keep to work for you. They'll man the buildings you construct, from woodcutter sheds to apple orchards to blacksmith shops, and produce the raw materials you need to build and trade. As long as you keep up with their needs for food and shelter, your castle can continue to expand into a sort of walled town, complete with social edifices like churches and taverns and little decorations like flower beds.Your people also need security, which is what the walls and barracks and blacksmiths are for. Stronghold doesn't just look like an RTS, it plays like one too. Depending on the scenario you might have to fend off wolves or bandits on the regular, or you might be scrambling to build an impenetrable castle before a siege-ready army arrives. Fielding your army is as simple as producing their weapons and churning them out of the barracks, but commanding them can be a bit touchy as it often is in older games like this. The lack of detailed commands almost makes the game play like a tower defense, watching the enemies stream in from marked paths and positioning your own troops as effectively as possible on your towers and at your gates.There are two full campaigns to conquer, along with numerous single missions and an open-ended Siege mode. The military campaign features an entertainingly British story of betrayal and intrigue, and missions that have you both building castles to withstand sieges and besieging other castles. The economic campaign is much thinner on story and challenges you to produce certain goods under not exactly ideal circumstances. The HD upgrade the game got awhile back makes the visuals quite crisp and pleasing, and the sound design benefits from some excellent voice acting, detailed sound effects, and a terribly appropriate soundtrack. In the end it's not such a bad thing that there haven't been so many castle-builders in the last decade, because Stronghold still stands as an excellent execution of the concept.

Posted: January 20
												This game has been the part of my childhood since it first came out in 2001, and I was an 11-year-old boy.God, I still remember those countless days spent in my grandfather's lawyer office, filled with the scent of some dried out flowers coming from the neighboring room.The thing is - the 11-year-old me didn't really know how to play this game. I knew the basics, like which building is for hunters, which one is for woodcutters etc. But I didn't know nothing about warfare. How do you actually train archers and other soldiers in the game? No idea. When I tried playing the military campaign, I'd get stomped in the first mission and I wouldn't progress further.But that didn't stop me playing the mission-less Free Play mode. That is what I've been playing Stronghold with for most of the years, and I had a blast. And now, returning to the HD version as a 26-year-old, after so many years of playing strategy games, I can deliver a legit review of this fantastic game.ReviewFirefly really made something special with this game. It seems it took a heavy inspiration from The Settlers[en.wikipedia.org] series. Each economy and military building you construct requires specific resources and is linked to the previously constructed resource collecting buildings. All resources are stored in a single spot, and are collected from there from each of the employed citizens who work in buildings you constructed. The finished products are then re-delivered to the same spot or to a specific building. Everything is linked and feels so alive, just looking at all those people walking from one point to another. The graphics here don't really matter. What fascinates me is the gameplay itself.Technical Issues?I made a separate section for those people who wrote or have read about the issues other players were having while playing the game. Those mostly include the issues with the resolution.I'm not really sure how that is a problem, as they are simply not true. The game runs perfectly at 1920 x 1080 resolution. Some people reported that the game won't go above 800 x 600 or even 1024 x 768. That, in my case, simply is not true. Those reviews should be updated to year 2017 or above.And yes, one more thing - so many people complained how this game doesn't allow players to better see where they are building. For example, they had numerous issues with gaps in the walls. Well, my friends, that's what you have the Spacebar for! Hold that sucker to flatten everything to ground level, and you can construct walls with laser precision.VerdictNothing but best for this game! Definitely a recommendation for people who like sipping coffee, enjoying some wonderful, most relaxing and beautiful soundtrack and clicking with their mouse while constructing buildings with mutual dependencies.As soon as I beat the original Stronghold campaign, I will go and play the Crusaders expansion, as I haven't played it ever since it came out.

												Honestly, this game and Stronghold Crusader (HD) are some of the best, if not the best RTS games of their decade. There have been a few developers that have tried to replicate the success and capture the magic that these two games had, but none of them have succeeded. A must-play, and an excellent rock-solid RTS. I've spent many, many hours on these games and I still love them to bits.			",112,15,1,22,42,3,66

I love the fact that you have to balance your economy, military and population satisfaction in order to have a succesful town, which makes it way more interesting. I don't have any major problems with the game, although 'The Rat' (from the campaign) is annoying as hell.

												Stronghold 1 is love, Stronghold 1 is life.I love this game, from the age of ten all the way to now, I have loved every single second of it.The campaign is challenging and fun whilst keeping you thinking of new ways to take over that pesky Pigs' castle (Still haven't been able to get past that mission). I've played a few multiplayer games and it is quite polished. There is no lag, and if there is, it is either connection lag (99% of the time) or your computer is a potato (1% of the time).To this day, I say to myself, ""These graphics are perfect for this game"". I have absolutely no problem with these 2001 graphics, plus the HD remake makes it even better by adding bigger resolutions. The combat is also quite amusing. Woodcutter VS Cavalry? Sure, why not. Don't get me wrong, woodcutters are OP as ♥♥♥♥. I'm not joking, I've seen woodcutters take on cavalry and win. The unit pathing is also simple yet effective and is much, much better than Stronghold 3 and some other games that I have played. The Map Editor is also simple yet effective and has allowed me to create some pretty cool Free build maps, siege and invasion maps. It also allows you to choose what buildings can be built, how much resources you start with and events that happen throughout that particular game. Overall, if you are thinking of getting this game, stop thinking and spend the $6 it costs to buy it, because for $6, you can get hours and hours of enjoyment, just like I have, out of this game. 11/10 would build stone stairs up mountains again.*Edit* I wrote this like a year ago and saw that I spelt something wrong, (""allowes""), so I had to fix it.

												Stronghold is one of the series that got me started in the Strategy gaming genre. Its flawless vision of castle organisation, simulation-like style of building your fortress, training your army and pleasing the populace simultaneously gives the game (especially the original SH and Crusader) the perfect balance between strategy and tactics. Great game for those who want to delve into the history of RTSs.			",219,35,14,36,22,1,38

												Stronghold... I played it around 8 years ago and buyed it now on Steam and i still love it!It's old (14 years) but still very fun and gives me a nostalgic feeling.I don't know if the graphics were good at 2001 but i like them and now with the HD edition you can play the game in higher resolutions up to 2560x1600 which is very good.Also the game music is awesome and fits perfectly in this game.If you like to build castles you should definitely buy this game and also you should try Stronghold Crusader (not Stronghold Crusader 2) because its awesome too, if not the best of all Stronghold games!( ´・ω・`)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When this game first came out, I played it incessantly. It was clear from the beginning that the devs put a lot of nuance and original thought in this game. The campaign is really fun and brings a lighthearted story as you build your castle and prevent it from being overrun.The music is excellent and brings an authentic mood and flavour to this game, as does the voice acting. The graphics are dated but as a medieval castle sim they aren't a drawback. The HD rerelease adds very little to it, however.As I'm sure the publisher found out this game proved to be successful and they released a string of games in this series. Quite honestly the move to 3D didn't do much and actually took away from the authentic feeling that came with this game. I didn't find the 3D graphics that good in the 2nd stronghold. The crusader series was equally interesting and unique and the Crusader Extreme release was insanely frustrating and crazy what with the AI rushes.The only maddening thing about this game is that sometimes it is difficult to accurately gauge where to build stone for your castle wall. You sometimes need to draw down the wall option to allow you to see the ground, because I have spent hours building a castle only to have it overrun in seconds because the enemy AI ran through a small breach that was otherwise undetected. Other than that a very good game overall. Sad to see that the franchise has not improved over time... ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I find it most fun to manage my village without even going to war, there's always so much things to do!They really did a nice job making a HD version, but there's just one thing they should fix: being able to make ""Steam screenshots"" ingame (because the F12 hotkey for screenshots doesn't work).It has a steep learning curve for non-RTS players, but once you know what to do it's really fun, even for casual RTS-players like myself.

												Your stronghold awaits...The first Stronghold is by far the best game of the series.What makes this game unique compared to the other Stronghold games is that this game has charm. The pixel style graphics give the gameplay a unique visual experience that the later games lost. That being said the 3d character cutscenes are somewhat laughable but generally speaking this game creates a good immersive atmospheric experience. And the music is great!The challenge of designing your castle to work in sync with the lay of the land and natural resources is what makes this game standout in my opinion, especially if you're playing in invasion mode. Layer that on top of managing your popularity with the people and you have a great RTS which is in some respects quite unique from most other RTS that I've played (I don't claim to have played them all).Too bad Stronghold 2 and 3 couldn't keep the magic alive. Under no circumstances should you purchase those.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold is the game of my childhood. A little niche compared to others out there, but it brought together so many facets of components I enjoyed in other games together (RollerCoaster Tycoon, Caesar III, Age of Empires). It would take until I discovered the Total War series(and I was pretty late on that train) to find a game that surpassed it.The city planning, economic micromanagement, castle building and war making all in one delighful package. It's got some great classic British humour, with some very memorable adversaries in The Rat, The Snake, The Pig and The Wolf, and its amazing just how much playing against each of them corresponded to the impression their heraldry gave. What really sealed the deal for me, and why i kept coming back to this game, was its editor and the community that spawned from it. Extremely powerful and flexible, the sheer amount of incredible content kept me scrawling through dedicated forums for the game for years. It stands the test of time incredibly well, both aesthetically and from a gameplay perspective. If I'd had a steam tracker on it back in the day it would probably be my most played by a considerable margin.			",181,48,3,28,22,4,51

Posted: April 27, 2016
												I wanted to give a quick review for once, but I could not, so the first paragraph is for those who want it fast.To be quick & frank: I wanted to play this as a teenager when it came out, and I never got to. As the franchise developed over the years I quickly lost interest as reviews basically warded me off. Recently Stronghold HD came up as a flash sale on steam for some thing like $1.67, and remembering that I never had the chance in my youth I said ""why the ♥♥♥♥ not! It's only the cost of a coffee!"". I have not been dissapointed at all. As far as being an HD release, it's optimized, bugless (at least so far and I'm 8+ hours in), and seems to have all it's assets there (nothing seems to be cut from what I gather), it's about as good of an HD-Re-release as AoE 2 has been and I've had countless hours of nostalgic fun with that title.The rest of this review is simply trying to sell it to those who've never played it, or have experiances with similer games like AoE 2.Stronghold puts you in the position of a lord, you build your castle, and you essentially play 'wave defence' threwout the campaign protecting said lord unit, while that isn't the only mode the game offers an 'economic campaign', instant siege, freebuild, etc. It isn't quite the same RTS layout as much of the genre has created, but almost half of a city / supply management game combined with specific aspects of medieval combat and primitive RTS atributes, it isn't actually as simple as I'm making it out to sound, for example to build bow units, one must have a supply of wood, then have a fletcher, he will deposite units of bow into your armory, in which then you can subtract from your unemployed towns people and spend the gold to create the unit, in which the bow in your arsenel becomes used up, and same goes for some foods, ale is a two stage process and wheat is a three stage process, luckily the game diversifies with food types, as well as material types. You have many more resources then a general RTS, but they aren't very complicated and any one who gets a few concepts of the mideval ages shouldn't have any problem grasping the concepts.Combat & units: There is unit control, but there isn't worker control (You just have to build the woodcutters hut, not specifically tell a guy to go cut wood such as in AoE), you will have to shift your men around to defend your castle walls, and there is a plethora of objects to build, all with different functions. There is several different classes of units ranging from basic archers to knights. Siege units are also avialable from ballista to catapult. Unit control is primitive for its time but you can still patrol and move; to be honest and true to my word- the AI is generally very good especially for 2001, for example when you station spearmen on the wall and even tell them to patrol, as ladders raise and the enemy climbs, they automatically find the closest targets all along said wall and deal with and dispatch them however they best should at the time- FOR ONCE YOU REALLY DON'T NEED TO MICRO MANAGE YOUR MEN!!!!, in short: tell your units which towers and walls to cover, thats it. Ctrl Groups can be set (Ctrl + Num). Honestly theres still more defences in this game that I'm learning as I go, but the basics are all there, spike traps, hot oil. Missile units gain height advantage; especially in your towers! Walls actually deflect arrows and give your men HUGE survability bonuses. It's definetly not as quick feeling as a lot of other RTS games are, you generally have a lot of time to rethink things or shift men around if need be, the game speed can be adjusted in the options of course but the units don't quite feel as responsive/quick to move as other RTS's, but they aren't bad in any regards either especially after a few movements with a group has adjusted your perception of how quickly the games actually moving.Campaign: The game offers 2 as I'm aware of, one leaning heavy on combat and defence while the other economic based- though I haven't played it. It's a crude campaign, heavy in story and sequences, the voice acting really screams '2001 game from left field!' as some of the characters are more annoying then interesting, and most of it is how the characters overall present themselves, it could have been much better written, there really isn't anything poetic about the campaign or most of the cast. The first few missions as I mention somewhere else in the review, will 'hold your hand' and present little challange but to build a handful of resource or a dozen men to dispatch wolves. Very very quickly does the difficulty ramp up, it can be adjusted before every mission but you won't know what 'difficult' is until you're nearly completed a mission and suddenly lose it very quickly due to your arrangement of defences or how and what resources you managed first. Dated but still enjoyable campaign.Resource & worker mangmnt: is overall primitive but quick to grasp every concept as you discover which buildings work with what, the game also offers an in depth help psuedo-wiki with essential concepts of the game and general things to keep in mind while building defences and expanding yourself. There is also a trade building, it doesn't seem to have a persistant economy but really you won't want it with the ammount of gold you'll pull in, while you can make a lot, generally your living conditions will deter you less you have the food to fill the bellies or the aesthetics / fear factor built into your castle. Your peasents will have a general opinion of you, and there are buildings you can construct as well as decorations that will remind them of how nice or horrid of a ruler you are. Both concepts add two distinct and different aspects though, fear or 'bad things' will boost your workers effeciancy but lower your opionion while 'nice things' and being pleasent will only add to your overall opinion- but also cost gold and take up very limited space!The building some times does get quite constrictive, especially in the campaign for the first few missions (they almost seem like half a tutorial that presents 3 'gimmie' missions where you essentially don't really have to do anything but figure out how economy works), and there are certain areas of the map you cannot build in (reinforcement points / town limits). While I do say there is a bit of managment, it's almost minimal and it's quite simplified, the learning curve is very small.The last part I wanted to mention was the overall castle building. It is vast and while primitive and dated, allows for some very customized defences. Every crenulation you add to your walls as well as how thick you decide to build or extend them will add to your survival averages, as well as initial building placement and workflow. 2001 did not have very complex games overall, but this was definetly way ahead of it's time, especially in the defensive building style of RTS's. Another strong aspect of this game is the ability to 'hide' or 'lower' your walls for viewing / fine building purposes, you can either force the 3D terrain to become 'flat' or simply show everything as 2D tiles, this allows you to really fine tune / delete specific segments of wall and generally beautify the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your castle without too much frustration and fretting. Overall;, I would definetly recommend this title to any one who is even slightly a fan of castle / city builders, at full price of $7 CDN dollars, If you were a fan of the core concepts of AoE 2 you will definetly get your monies worth if not ending up loving it!Con: Biggest con worth mentioning is that since it's a game from a much older time, and I know it is because of coding of the original engine that it could not be enhanced/fixed is the map size is overall small for RTS's, 400x400 I believe is the largest you can have, which actually is fairly big in this game, it isn't quite the massive 10 player battle sized maps of AoE 2 or Empire Earth.

												This is a great game however it does not allow the skirmish mode which means you are only left with singleplayer and multiplayer and if you are like me then multiplayer is really not my thing for this type of game. This is a great game but there is little to no replay therefor the game only gets 6/10			",31,0,0,3,6,0,13

												I'm writing this review from a fresh prespective, I have not played or heard about this game untill 2015 so I don't have any nostalgia making me biased.I'm gonna start off by saying that I really love the game. Someone on here mentioned that it has a great economic chain and I second that. Yes, the graphics are a little dated, but you have to remember this game was made in 2001. i think it looks fine to be honest. The campaigns are fun and they ease you in to learning the game. If you like RTS games, I would highly recommend. if you like Medieval RTS games, this is a must have. I will post a full pros on cons when I get deep into the game(because I'm deffinately going to) ",53,1,0,9,7,0,5

												""10 more shopping days 'til christmas, M'Lord.""Firefly got the original design correct from the beginning just like  it's sequent release, Stronghold Crusader.Isometric 3D sprite animation, funny quotes, solid gameplay, and good strategy.The HD version improved matters immensely by allowing me to play at 2560x1440.I play this game mostly offline.It is unfortunate that the rest of the series has not held up as well.Don't change what is not broke!The rest of the games start to smell of the farming fertilizer and dung heaps by the peasants.Perhaps the Stronghold 2 HD version will improve matters, as this was my second favorite game due to intricate involvement of medieval life, not exclusively for the medieval combat.I have yet to play the new Stronghold Legends HD on Steam.

												For a 15 year old game it's aged OK. Playing fine in full HD with graphics which could kinda be considered retro now. At it's standard price of £3.50 it would have been a totally worth while £11p/hour for me, so even better from a Steam sale; a no-brainer for base builder fans scouring the back-catalogue. This original Stronghold version seemed to review far better than it's more expensive successors, and I can certainly believe that being justified.There's a collection of historical siege scenarios, set up for you to survive with only what's given, and multi-player too, in theory (I never tried). But the single player is all that's really needed: an ample 'military' campaign with a bite sized 'economic' chaser (of 5 missions with minimal/no combat but random problems thrown at you without warning). There's no need to play a tutorial, as the main campaign is nice and gentle with introducing it's mechanics, buildings and units. It's strung together with spoken dialogue interludes, with almost passable voice acting, that step through a caricatured Britain of 1000 years hence. The vast majority of missions are build up and/or defend against a few waves of different attacks. This was definitely the modest pace I was after. I only felt the need to YouTube help with one of these types of mission, just to expedite a solution after a couple of quick failures, and that still felt rewarding. A more major frustration was that controlling military units can be clumsy with the isometric attack ranges being tricky and unintuitive, for example. This was one aspect that made the three (or so) assault missions seem unreasonable brutal. Even after watching a couple of tutorials right through, I just couldn't pull it of, so had to switch down to the lowest 'easy' setting and save my progress at stages throughout. Still, was a good feeling to finally complete these, making you really work to finish the game, which I did, like brutal end boss sections. I can imagine some gamers actually enjoying these puzzles and wanting more, like a large scale, medieval Rainbow 6, or something.One important tip: some of the keyboard shortcuts seemed literally indispensable, so look those up (e.g. game speed adjustment, terrain flattening and view angle).

												This game has given me so many hours of fun, originally bought as a none HD version and on a DVD (remember them?) So I had to buy it to have in my collection as the DVD is gathering dust somewhere in my house. Such a beautiful game with a classic style of graphics and a great atmosphere. Just one of those games that will never be replicated by any amount of 3D visuals and modern effects that Firefly continue to create. It holds a certain charm all of its own and undoubtadly one of fireflys best crowning titles to date. They have tried to revise the formula but always end up falling short by a country mile. Which is a shame as this is such a unique game.Basically you build castles in order to protect your Lord from dying at the hands of other Lords. Depending which game mode you play but ultimately you will play the Campaign, the main core of the game. In order to do this you are required to support a community by sourcing building materials and food stocks. Different types of food are more quickly accessible but others have longevity but are more difficult to produce and require more input to get the supply lines off the ground. You also need to build weapons and weapons systems to aid you in Defence as well as attack. As once you establish a stable economy and food supply you will be required to move onto Vanquishing your Foe. Who vary from 'The Rat' 'The Pig' through to 'the Wolf', all who hold different tactics and means to plague you or even destroy you.You can also choose which way to rule, a caring ruler or a cruel ruler. Enforce taxes to increase your coffers..the heavier the tax obviously the more unhappy the people become. To the point they will just leave your settlement. You can sweetnen the deal though by laying gardens or placing entertainment to take the peoples mind off being fleeced of all their hard earned. A nice trick to really squeezing all you can from them is to get them hammered on booze, then crank up the taxes and watch the gold flow in to aid your war machine. Alteratively you can dot the odd gallows around the place or cages to remind the people what will happen if they do not comply. This has a negative effect though.The scribe feeds back on your orders and it is funny to lisen to him, 'Bit much these taxes' The voice acting is awesome, the best in the series...the artwork is superb too, all the little illustrations in the books etc. Really well done, it seems furture incarnations of the game have become diluted in this retrospect.Anyway it is a brilliant game, looking it's age now but like a fine wine holds it's own against the younger newer kids on the block. A true classic in every sense of the word.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												★★☆☆☆The original stronghold has aged well enough.  The biggest problem is clunky/lacking controls, expect to play entirely with the mouse.  Build and manage an actual castle town, instead of just facerolling lumps of troops into other lumps of troops, in the masked rock/paper/scissors that most RTS games provide.  + Music and voices+ Economy and army management+ Build walls, gatehouses, and towers+ Pre-rendered graphics held up well enough+ Grid based building, with an option to flatten visuals+- Can zoom out, but not in+- Most of the maps are so small that they barely fill the screen.  Maybe this is because of larger modern resolutions?- Steam doesn't work ingame- Can't build on uneven terrain- Without attack-move, combat is clunky- Can't change controls, no WASD to scroll the map.  Very few options in general.			",302,25,6,60,22,1,51

												An epic series which really **** up in stronghold crusader 2 and stronghold 3.-don't doubt my play time, ı had been playing it for years - If we get to the topic, this game is awesome. One of the best rts games i have seen my whole life. I won't count the cons and pros because there is not really much to say. But if you want to play a really long stronghold adventure, buy stronghold crusader. You will spend atleast 45 hours ending the whole campaign. Stronghold HD doesn't have skirmish, neither a big ""vs"" campaign. so it's whole gameplay is only 12 hours. My personal thought for this series: Stronghold Crusader > Stronghold 2 > Stronghold legends > Stronghold HD. The rest of the series is not really playable if you ask me			",79,20,0,18,12,0,17

												I never liked the term 'real-time strategy' (first associated with Dune 2), because usually there isn't much strategy involved in these types of games. All you need to do is producing more units than your enemies have and simply overpower them. Later on, many RTS titles implemented RPG elements into the game (Warcraft 3 for example) trying to add more possibilities, thus making the game look like a real strategy game. Of course if you've ever played games like Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat or Rome: Total War, you simply laugh at such attempts, because these games are that can truly be called STRATEGY games.Stronghold however can also earn the strategy title, even though it's more similar to Warcraft or Command & Conquer, than it is to Rome: Total War. We advance from one mission to another, collecting resources, training soldiers, there are no troops, but single, individual soldiers etc.. Still, the fact that we can design and build castles, makes this game very unique. From castle wall tiles to mighty towers with ballistas there are many variations. So basically it's better to define the game as a 'castle simulator', as the developers call it.According to the campaign, the game takes place in a fictionalized dark yet still funny version of early medieval England and we play as a young lord of a county. Our father had been killed by four villains (nicknamed after animals they best bear resemblance to) and now they are plotting to kill the absent king and take over the throne of England. Of course it'll be our job to stop them. The game can be played in a peaceful manner (just like Caesar 3), where we have to reach certain economic goals, or we can choose the military campaign that focuses on combat and castle sieges. (And since the game is a castle simulator, I think it's pretty obvious which one should be chosen by everyone :))As mentioned before we can build our own castle (most of the time we already have one though) according to our liking, carefully placing towers, gatehouses, moats around the castles and so on. At the beginning of the campaign we only have to protect our men from the attacks of wolf packs and bears, but later on the most powerful of the villains (called the Wolf) will throw everything at us he has at his disposal, including heavily armored units, battering rams, trebuchets and even tunnelers, who can dig under castle walls, causing them to collapse. Of course there are many ways to stop the besiegers by reinforcing castle walls, building more towers at critical points and placing ballistas on top of them (this requires engineers, who can also pour boiling oil on nearby attackers), placing war dog cages and traps and most importantly by using as many archers and crossbowmen as possible. Archers are quite weak and don't deal much damage, but moving them onto towers greatly increases their effectiveness. By placing braziers nearby, they'll be able to fire burning arrows which adds to their damage and with which they can ignite pitch ditches setting enemy units on fire.We will quickly learn how harder it is to besiege a castle than defending it. It requires a lot more men and careful planning: drawing enemy fire, filling up moats, taking out towers at critical points, avoiding pit traps and launching the final attack. The game gets more satisfying towards the end as we progress, it's a shame that the last mission turns out to be one of those unimaginative fixed army ones, instead of a great siege the game should have deserved,While besieging the castles of our opponents and defending our own, we also have to manage the village next to our castle (even if we didn't choose the economic path), similar to the classic Settlers game (just like there, we can't control our villagers directly here either, they do their job on their own). The economic chain is good and logical with some resources  being more useful than the others. Wood for example is needed for almost everything, stone is necessary only for building and repairing defensive structures. Food is required to keep villagers well fed and thus happy, so they will actually stay in our village, while gold is essential for recruiting soldiers. The more types of food the people eat, the happier they'll be and more tax can be collected from them. Not every resource is availabe at every mission though, some maps are lacking forests, some are lacking fertile soil. A good tactic in these missions can be the selling off food surplus at trade posts and buying the missing materials. Sometimes managing the village can be troublesome during sieges, but we'll usually have enough time to build up our economy beforehand. What's important is to place every manufacturer near our stockpile/warehouse and all food producing buildings in the vicinity of the granary and there shouldn't be any problems.There are many types of missions in the campaign: most of the time we only have to repel enemy attacks and successfully defend our castle, sometimes we have to besiege and take over enemy castles and kill enemy lords (we are also present at each mission, on top of the town hall, obviously if we die, it's game over), this can also have a time limit, or sometimes we'll have to produce and stockpile a certain amount of the aforementioned materials to complete a mission. At the beginning of the missions we'll be introduced a new unit, building or equipment thus becoming experts by the end of the game with all of them (even though the explanation of new things aren't always the best, the one about the use of boiling oil for example or how to dig or full up moats could have been described better in my opinion).The graphics is obviously outdated (the game first came out in 2001) and even though it's in 1080p, it only means that everything became smaller. On the other hand, it still has its charms and it's relaxing to watch and listen to the trees rustling, the villagers going about their business or watch as the siege equipments begin to work. The character animations are well made and the little 2d sprite models look detailed enough. The grim, yet still funny mood which radiates from the cutscenes is also a plus and they successfully connect the missions with each other. The music during the campaign is also very enjoyable and perfectly fitting. The fact that the character sounds originate from a single person (yes, the female villagers' too) further strengthens the joke side.The problem from the old version still remains though (actually it got worse due to everything becoming smaller): it's very hard to reach anything behind objects, especially inside the castle. It's unnecessary to explain how irritating it is not being able to repair some parts of the castle because they are obscured or blocked by something and can't be clicked on, no matter how we rotate the map or use other views. The lack of shortcut buttons is also one of the flaws, but at least it applies to everyone in multiplayer.Stronghold HD is a very good example of how a real-time strategy or castle simulator should be made. It provides fun, unique, complex gameplay and after all those years it still doesn't fail to entertain. And no, it's not just nostalgia, take a look at Warcraft 2 or Command & Conquer, they really didn't age well. To top it all off, during sale it costs less than a EUR or USD. Considering everything I would call this game a real retro experience and certainly a good one.PROS+ a unique castle simulator and also a village builder+ lots of variety to defend and besiege castles+ lovable graphics, music and cutscenes+ really low priceCONS- some objects can obscure others, making them unreachable- last mission is disappointingRATING8/10			",88,73,0,10,4,0,8

So it's also playable for people who don't always play games like this. Troops may be a bit buggy sometimes, but doens't really annoying. I played the campaign accompanied by my girlfriend, and she liked it.Basically it's an old school game  based on Medieval villages, wars and gaining power.It's easy and chill to play.I would recommend it to everyone.

												Unlike other RTS games there is a big focus on creating something cool. Everything is centred around the layout, walls and defences of your Stronghold. You can go major OCD about building the perfect castle, except, unlike other games stuff takes a few seconds to build as opposed to ♥♥♥♥ing forever. You could spend 3 days making castles this cool in minecraft or you could do it in 5 minutes here and actually have hundreds of dudes manning your walls, throwing boiling pots of oil on people and all that jazz. There isn't much economy micro. Villagers can't be controlled or assigned. You place a building and it is created instantly, then a villager is automatically assigned to it and goes and does their♥♥♥♥♥♥ keep them happy and more villagers will come,♥♥♥♥♥♥them off and they will leave, don't give them a job and they will just sit around eating your food. Everything is done in real time, make a wheat farm and a villager will grow wheat, cut it into bundles, physically take the bundles to your stockpile, people will come from a mill and take the bundles back with them, then take the flour they make back to the stockpile which bakers will pick up, take to a bakery then deliver bread to your granary. You can see the piles of bread in your granary building and watch as they get eaten.This compliments the whole theme of the game, layout is what's important. If your bakeries are far away from your granary then you won't get as much bread, same for most of the buildings in the game.It's also the perfect game for people who like to turtle like ♥♥♥♥ and amass hundreds of troops before even poking the enemy. Resulting in huge sieges. Defence is super strong so you need a lot of guys to take down a good castle.So it's an RTS for people who like to turtle and don't enjoy lots of micro. It's still super easy to get flustered though and if you play multiplayer then you probably still need to know build orders and all that stuff, LOTS of resource management, down to building individual weapons for your troops.AI is pretty wank. All in all it holds up well to someone who never played the game before it was HDified.No steamworks multiplayer though, or even steam overlay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your a person that cares about graphics or hate old games, leave immediately.StrongholdHD was the first game in the series taking place in medieval Europe. I highly reccomend you play this game before getting any other stronghold game. Its a strategy based castle building game released about 15 years ago back at 2001. Its really old, but that doesnt make it a bad game. AMAZING music and voice acting. You will also learn a thing or to from StrongholdHD This game was like smoking weed when I first got it. If your tolerant of old games, and like what I said above, I highly reccomend it for you. Its price is a bit too high for a old game at 7-8(UDS) on steam, but you can also wait for a sale, or go to a trustful website that sells games really cheap. They have really good prices, and it actaully works.(I got all my total war games with  for a cheap price, but you cant refund them)You basicly have 3 modes. Combat, Economic, and Map Editor. The other tab is basicly saves. Combat is basicly for people who want to get right on into battles, sieges, and campaign. Economic is more peacful as you fufill orders in a certain amount of time like making weapons, troops, food, ect. Map Editor you can create or own maps. Saves is self explanatory.In the military campaign, you take on a lord whose kingdom was beaten back by 3 forces, the rat, the snake, the pig, and the wolf.(Please correct me if im wrong, I haven't played this in a long time) You start to retake counties from the 3 enemies. All of this is taking place in the UK looking map I belive. So the game starts of from starting off small with pity archers and spear men with wood palisade walls to mace man, crossbowmen, with stone walls. As the game progresses, it teaches you slowly, rewards you with new buildings and troops. Really this is the reason why I reccomend to play this game first. Games like Stronghold Crusader dont tutor you like a newb. They think you know how to play the game. The only bad thing I find about this is that theres barely any siege for you, and if there is, its freaken huge for a beginner sieger.Then we have siege battles, premade castles for you to siege, or defend. Theres a ton of maps to choose from. I think almost all of them are historical and gives information about each siege. I actaully learned that the London tower was actaully a castle at first. Interesting.Invasion basicly invades more than a castle. So if you have villages or forts around your castle, its an invasion. Again, alot of maps and historically accurate for some.Economic is really simple and more peaceful, expect for wolves. You get orders to build troops, weapons, food in a limited amount of time. You will get obstacles like plague, theives, but its really not a big deal. I reccomend playing this after military.Map editor is a sandbox. You can free build your castle without any mace men tearing up your walls, OR, Build your map, make your levels. You can adjust the terrain, add trees, troops, oceans, rivers, rocks, resources, really in depth and nice. I belive you cant make your own 1000v1000 battles but I think you can do it in Stronghold Crusader.Saves. Well this is what pisses me off. You have to manually save your games. It's 100 percent my fault, but make sure you SAVE your game.AS far as multiplayer goes, you will need to have GameRanger and even if you have it, theres barely any games, but Stronghold CrusaderHD as a ton of multiplayer games.StrongholdHD is a game that requires tolerence in order to enjoy. If you like old classic medieval castle building games, this is for you. If your looking to get into other stronghold games, play this. I will make a review on Stronghold Crusader soon because thats considered the best game in the series.(If I made any grammar mistakes, did or say anything wrong, or dont agree with me, feel free to comment below.)

												It's a simulator of a castle, but as every lord you have to know that your people are as important as your walls. Thats why you can't neglect economics and provision becouse you wont have recruits and weapons. On the other hand you have to create reasonable castle and locate troops in key places to protect your structures. How simple is that? Incredibly simple, but can you do that under the pressure? Yeah, don't worry you can also have some fun and let your imagination work, becouse it's your castle!Advantages+ unique and simple mechanics...+ ...which lets you create self-perpetuating organism (like a castle or something :D)+ although it can drive a car in USA it still has great potential+ HD version makes it playable even for a newcomer+ very satisfying if you decide to play it fast and hard, very pleasant if you decide to go slow and easy+ really dynamic...Disadvantages- ...but sometimes I would like to take better care of my castle and enjoy it- story isn't very fascinating, but characters are ridiculous sometimes- I didn't enjoyed additional missions, at least not everyHonest recommendation, not only for those who are sentimental about this game!

												I'll keep this short and just get right the the point. I played alot of the older stronghold games when i was yunger and loved the combination of castle building/planning, military action, and having to balance your economy and flow of gold with the happiness of your peasants. And thats what i found  makes this stand out and a very fun Simulation/Strategy game. But the only problem i have with this game now is the fact its not easy to play online with your buds or randoms. I would still give it a 7/10 and definitely worth buying when it hits a sale.			",364,59,7,22,21,0,23

												A fairly good package, which hopefully with be even beter with the HD package, improving interest to the game. Generally the bugs of the 2'nd game have been disapointing for the audience, alongside the voice acting and somewhat difficult learning curve of the entire series. However it is worthwhile if you love the Middle Ages, castles and the simulation of that life of simple people in the land owned by the Lord - that is YOU!			",136,44,7,18,22,1,32

While it does kinda suck that the online servers are no longer supported, it's still a nice game to relax to. Just don't relax to much, the enemy have a habit of sending forces at you really early to destroy your economy and screw you over, but that just makes destroying them all the sweeter.

												I received the Stronghold CD as a gift in 2006 and never forgot the experience, so it was relatively logical to buy this game during the winter sale. Stronghold is a game where fighting and economic growth are interrelated and therefore when concentrating on one aspect, is easy to forget about the other. Nonetheless, Stronghold's missions are well-balanced, and after running through them, I could handle attacking, defending, and growing my castle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												4/5 A fun castle simulator. Hunt for meat, chop wood, acquire stone from quarries, all to build up your kingdom and become the ruler of the land. This game doesn't have much replayability, but I enjoyed the challenges it presented to me and I had fun overcoming the odds. The story also wasn't too bad and I enjoyed seeing my progress through the land, seeing how my power grew (and occasionally shrank). The ""boss fights"" (if you can call them that) when you defeat the one of the 4 rival kings is really fun and beating the levels is always satisfying, especially during some of those photo finishes which you're bound to experience. Every time someone asks me, ""Hey, do you know of any medieval simulation games where I can play as a king and simulate a siege on enemy territories and defeat the Wolf?"" I always point them to this game. A true classic.			",252,19,0,33,11,0,11

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR STRONGHOLD 2 (since it doesn't have its own page -_-)Singleplayer sucks i'll be honest but if you get multiplayer working (with gameranger i believe) it can be a blast. So long as you have several hours to play and a handfull of friends you're good to go. I like to put down some ""gentlemen's rules"" though as Knights are overpowererd so i limit them to 5 per player. I also only play on my own maps as a i feel most maps are inbalanced (typically due to an excess in stone supply). Overall a decent game but not for the solo experience.			",146,7,5,12,17,1,41

												This is one the best Castle building RTS games I have ever had the chance of playing. When it was released all the way to now in the present. It's always a challenege to setup your castles correctly and make sure happiness is at 100%. From Making sure your granny is well stocked with food too detaining criminals or fending off your neighbour who will most likely spam you with burning carts! EVEN SO. This game is full of stuff that never gets boring, the sense of challenege is everywhere and if you you don't want to battle online or via Kingmaker, you can go into free build and construct your dream castle! When Im bored I play this game because it's always a different experience I join an online match or a kingmaker or free build.I would 100% recommend this anyone who loves games that host both an econimic balance feature with great warfare and siege warfare! GO BUY IT. SERIOUSLY.  IT'S REAL GOOD.			",184,14,1,18,31,0,38

												""Oaf!""You were screamed at while walking slowly through your Stronghold. There were drunk people everywhere, mothers with their babies and a group of lumberjacks just crossed your path, muttering ""Greetings my lord"" while walking past you.You don't really know what happened, but you knew that whatever happened was something very fast. It seemed like all of the sudden, buildings appeared around you, following a certain pattern. A system of managing food was required and you ordered your people to start building farms and harvesting wheat, which then was crushed in mills just to be processed to good bread afterwards. It somehow worked. Even though you felt like it all happened in a matter of seconds, you of course knew that it was you ordering all of this. A stronghold had to be build, it was necessary to claim the land that god gave you and in order to succeed, you had to purge the infidels that inhabited this land like rats and pigs.You knew that there would be vengeance for your actions. You basically just stranded here on this island, taking as many men as you could and take as much land as you could before facing resistance. People looked up on you and envied your power, but uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.There was so much to do, so much to oversee and so few time to do so. You never had time for the fun aspects of the burden of being king, you never had the joy of talking to friends or not dealing with starving citizens for a moment or wondering if there is more wood needed.You went back to your castle. It was a small, but safe one. While walking upstairs you met a mother with her baby. She greeted you with respect and it may be the way she looked at you, but you smiled at her.Obviously stunned by that rare gesture of sympathy, you asked her to come to your room and after giving the baby to one of the other women in the castle, she quickly followed and wondered what your majesty had in mind for her lesser being.Once in your chamber, you looked at her closely. A young, attractive woman, mother of only five children and in the good age of 15. Your ambition was clear, you wanted her and you clearly didn't want to wait for that.After touching her breasts she whispered that she couldn't do this, as she was married, but you promised her to not tell god and pushed her on the pile of straw that resembled your bed. You slowly removed her clothes and started to let your tongue explore all of her young and fresh skin, which made her tremble. You told her that all would be well and you wouldn't hurt her too much, before you grabbed her derière and entered the sacred catacombs with your horse.The walls of the catacomb were relatively wet and surprisingly soft and your horse was satisfied with what it sensed below its fur. While exploring the deepest corners the horse felt the rising need to neigh intensively and clear the nose of all that is not wanted.It wouldn't be long until a scream travelled through the entire castle, a mix of a male and female voice combined in the spirit of joy. You quickly got up, took a deep breath and pushed the woman out of your bed. You told her that all is well now and that her service is no longer needed. Obviously shocked of your mercy and power, she ran out of the room, naked. Outside of your chamber behind the closed door you heard the sounds of crying women and words about too much horror happening way too often to all females in the stronghold, but you suddenly felt the intense need to both ignore the voices outside as well as take a deep and satisfying nap on your comfortable straw bed that by now had entered various holes of yours.You fell asleep and had that one dream again. Your kingdom, safe and prosper, surrounded by mighty walls and in it, a lot of happy female citizens, all here to please you and all grateful for the very opportunity to live in what you had build for them. No enemies to threaten your position, no problems in your borders that you had to deal with. It was better place, a peaceful place. It was your mission that you had to make reality one day.After a long and happy night of dreams, you got up to work again. Make those lazy farmers work and expand your kingdom. It's time to crush the rats under your power and create the kingdom that you dreamed of so often already.But this time you would have enough wood.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great mix of sim style and RTS gameplay. The atmosphere created via visual and musics will set you to a correct mindset. The economy chain is a lot fun to create and watch. I can explain what I mean by this with a quick example. You create a farm which yields wheat. Then your villagers takes that and proccess it in to flour which then taken by bakers and turn it in to bread for your granary. There are a lot of cooperational buildings that you can construct this way and each have different direct impact or indirect impact on your society. Building an economic balance between happiness/production and army is key to success in this game and there are a lot of different play styles which you can achieve it.I have already played and squeezed all the fun out of Stronghold way before I had a Steam account, but this is a gem that must sit on every gamer's library.

												If you're a fan of real-time strategy games like I am, you're going to love this.I bought this game back when it was new for my old computer and played itfor hours on end. It has a very beginner-friendly introductory to all of thegame's mechanics and techniques to play it and along the way you'll surelyforge your own strategies and methods to solve problems.Stronghold keeps the traditional way of gathering resources to build upan army to defeat your enemy, but it also adds a couple of new things tostir it up a bit. You have a whole variety of different kinds of resourcesand materials you can gather that all has a different impact on yourpeople and economy. You can create churches where people can marry,taverns for people to get drunk in, flowers and parks where people canhang-out but you can also place gruesome torture machines if you feela little.. 'mischevious'. You can even decide how many rations of foodyou allow your people to take aswell as bribing them or making thempay taxes so that you, in return, can buy certain things to further improvemilitary or your town's economy. I think all of this gives limitless possibilitiesin how to play the game and complete campaigns and levels and it's verysmart, in my opinion.Whilst the game's graphics may be somewhat dated by today's standardsit still holds up pretty well and the HD release on Steam makes it looka little better than it would if you'd have gotten it to work using theoriginal game CD.The game's soundtrack is filled with atmospheric sound and beautifulcompositions to really set the tone of whatever situation you're inand truly gives the game a medieval! Some of the game's trackswill have you feeling rather peaceful and relaxed as you improvethe lifestyle of your town and others will have you bravely strikingback against your foes to drive them away from your kingdom.As mentioned before the gameplay is smooth and still holds upgreat today and if you got a few bucks to spend and you got acouple hours to kill then i'd strongly recommend this game to anyonewho likes strategy games.

												I played this game about 10 years ago and picked it up again for nostalgia purposes. I didn't actually expect to still have so much fun with it, since most of the old games I tried to play were not able to engross me like all those years ago. It has a few flaws, for example some bugs here and there or my popularity among the community members dropping seemingly for no apparent reason, but those are just minor faults. All in all the game brings huge fun for me and probably for everyone fond of real-time strategy games. Definitely recommended!			",224,157,5,36,40,0,15

												For this price it is a really good game. It´s like an improved Age of Empire 2 Engine with focus on building a castle. You gather your resources, you spend it on building a big castle and then you defend it or vise versa. Also you can fire cows from catapults.			",84,5,2,3,11,0,12

												I played this game about 10 years ago and picked it up again for nostalgia purposes. I didn't actually expect to still have so much fun with it, since most of the old games I tried to play were not able to engross me like all those years ago. It has a few flaws, for example some bugs here and there or my popularity among the community members dropping seemingly for no apparent reason, but those are just minor faults. All in all the game brings huge fun for me and probably for everyone fond of real-time strategy games. Definitely recommended!			",224,157,5,36,40,0,15

												The original, beloved as a kid, feeling great having found on Steam. Manage your castle to a degree not found in AoE.Manage food production/expansion/composition (apple farms vs. dairy famrs vs. wheat farms vs hopp farms).Manage weapons production (iron for good armor/swords, leather (dairy farms) for mid-level crossbowman and macemen, wood for bows/crossbows, etc.).Manage popularity (beer-from hopps, taxes, liesure/torture devices (artifical buff/nerf to happiness, including negative), a well-balanced diet, etc.).Setup your castles defences (walls, gates, traps, towers (and types), engineers, and siege weapons).Assault rival castles (ladders, moat-filling, fire, siege weapons, how to best storm which positions first). This will happen fast, so plan beforehand, as you likely won't get backup (at least for awhile). Overall, a fun, complex, easy-to-learn castle sim. A must for any RTS/Castle-Sim player.

												After a decade of this game, Stronghold STILL is one of the most accurate and beautiful medieval castle management simulators out there. Even after like, what, 12 years from this game's release the graphics, gameplay and experience are still awesome for me. After a few years of not playing it, nostalgia kicks back in and thank goodness Steam has it when I decided to install Steam as one of my game hubs to base my games on. Even though it's has no flashy graphics like Starcraft: Wings of Liberty or Call of Duty, the graphics have most certainly endured. Even I don't know why. Maybe it's because the experience made up for it, or maybe the detail that goes to each building and terrain defies ravages of time. The gameplay, especially if you're into management and simulators like let's say Age of Empires and its similar counterparts like Warcraft, this will DEFINITELY be a breath of fresh air for you. I guarantee it!! After actually playing this game, I couldn't go back to Age of Empires II because as great as Age of Empires is, it simply became lackluster and it's like you had your fill of it and there's nothing new, you know? But Stronghold. It's amazing after a decade I still can replay a game and still feel like I've never played it. Maybe it's because the game as a whole actually FEELS REAL. You see little people, doing their merry little jobs, greeting you if you click on them, and every single one of the living creature has their own name. The logic in this game is absolutely fantastic; it gets you to think how content the people are, how fast the jobs' going to be done, how soon do you need to consider managing the food rations......It feels REAL.The campaigns are great with a good pace of difficulty, and one of the most amazing trait of this game that amuses me and still makes me smile to this day is how every single character with a voice seems to be voiced by the same guy - and all of them still sounds so different!! Of course they could have added more kinds of dialogues or add even more stuff to make the game more difficult and more real now that I've played it for so long. But then it'll be too hard for the starters, wouldn't it? This game may not be for everybody, but I strongly suggest anyone, especially ANYONE who's played Age of Empires, Starcraft, Warcraft; BUY THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. It will refresh your dull old expectations for a strategy game of that nature. The price on Steam is not bad either, even without the discounts. I usually just go pirated but it's an insult not to support Firefly Studios for this classic, so I bought it! Just try it out. You won't be disappointed!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buy this game, now.Stronghold series coming from a very long way, that deserves respect.This is my childhood game and probably I'm in love with Stronghold 1that I cant even imagine. PROS:-Stronghold HD better than COD:Ghosts-HD version adds many fix-Increased tree quality, wall and Food fields-Amazing medieval music that you will never get bored-Even more quick saves both in Map Editor and Game-Map Editor now more stable-You can play other player's maps in game(both siege,Invade)CONS:-No Steam Workshop supportIf you like old strategy games like this, you must buy this. Building entire fortress, resource control, funny AI enemies thatwill make you sit front of your PC and play this all day. Sadlythere's no skirmish match mod in this one, If you looking for thatyou should buy next game Stronghold CrusaderBy the way, do not buy Stronghold 2 its a badly made version.Also, there's Stronghold 3, I dont know about this one but probablya remake version of Stronghold 2.(well, seems likely)In short words, buy Stronghold HD or Stronghold Crusader HDif you looking good castle game.I WIN, YOU LOSE.(wolf)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like most people who bought this game, I too played alot of the first 'Stronghold' when I was younger. I decided to get this game in the hope that it was as good as I remembered it to be, but this time it would be in ""Stunning HD"". Well, it wasn't as good as I rememered it to be... It was even better! In my opinion, this is the best game out of the 'Stronghold' franchise. It has a great balance of building and economy with managing an army and castle.I look forward to playing more of this game and progressing through the campaigns!10/10 XD			",30,2,0,3,4,1,4

												Stronghold HD laid down alot of groundwork for the sequels to come.Years later I wonder why the newer games are terrible when compared to this? DO NOT BOTHER with any Stronghold games, BESIDES  Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader.I've played Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Crusader 2...... *sigh*........ I wish somebody would've have told them to just stick to what was working.I prefer Stronghold Crusader over Stronghold HD, my only reason being is that I loved the crusader trail, in Stronghold Crusader. Stronghold HD is much more campaign focused.  It does have skirmishes but it's not laid out in an increasingly difficult path.This is a great RTS game still worth picking up to this day, but I would recommended the first Stronghold Crusader over this one.

												Like most people who bought this game, I too played alot of the first 'Stronghold' when I was younger. I decided to get this game in the hope that it was as good as I remembered it to be, but this time it would be in ""Stunning HD"". Well, it wasn't as good as I rememered it to be... It was even better! In my opinion, this is the best game out of the 'Stronghold' franchise. It has a great balance of building and economy with managing an army and castle.I look forward to playing more of this game and progressing through the campaigns!10/10 XD			",30,2,0,3,4,1,4

												Only just in favour of this game.  The original was, at the time, playable and engrossing.  The only change here is that the screen resolution now goes up to HD spec.  The graphics themselves have not been updated or redrawn, which is a little misleading, and could have been developed for the re-release.  In an attempt to turn a retro game into a modern game the designers have missed the boat, and could easily have done an entire makeover, as is happening with many other ""revived"" titles.  This boils down to an attempt to make you buy the same game all over again.  Compared to modern games, even those small-budget indie releases that have pretty basic graphics, this is some way down the line, losing out to titles like Banished.If you've acquired this as part of the Stronghold bumper pack, then I'd suggest Stronghold 2 worth avoiding.  While it appears to have improved graphics, theres a sense of insolence aimed at users by the programmers, and it quickly becomes a pointless bit of nonsense with little connection to the ""castle age"" of our history.  It's a case of them putting the sim into simper.			",28,7,0,16,22,1,13

												I was only 5 years old, I loved Stronghold so much. I had all the merchandise and games. I pray to Stronghold everyday thanking it for the life i've been given. ""Stronghold is love"" I say ""Stronghold is life"". My dad hears me and says ""Total War is better"". I knew he was just jealous of my devotion for Stronghold. I called him a filthy peasant. He puts my granary on half rations and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now and my peasants are leaving. I lay in bed and its really cold. A warmth is moving towards me. I feel something touch me. Its the scribe, i'm so happy. He whispers in my ear ""A message m'lord"". He grabs me with his powerful scribe hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I open my gates for the scribe and he enters my castle. It hurts so much but I do it for the scribe. I can feel my castle tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force, I want to please the scribe. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my stockpile. My dad walks in. The scribe looks him straight in the eye and says ""The stockpile is full m'lord"". The scribe catapults out my window. ""Stronghold is Love, Stronghold is life""			",31,0,0,4,6,0,15

Pros:-Original, entertaining system-Deep economy mechanics-Wide variety of troops, each with strengths and weaknesses-Military campaign does a good job of slowly introducing new game mechanics-Over the top voice acting-Mulitple play modes-High replayability-Villager quotes are hilariousCons:-Over the top voice acting-Cheesy plot-Economy aspect of gameplay is slowOverall: Stronghold is one of those games I keep coming back to again and again over the years.  It's easy to pick up and start, and it's amazingly deep and entertaining.  They storyline is super cheesy, but fun.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a good thing.  The villains, while two dimensional and easy to hate, are also rewarding to fight.  Each one has their own personality and fighting style, and when you finally defeat them, it makes it all the sweeter.  The focus of this game isn't on the plot or the storyline, but the castle-building aspect.  As such, they give the villains just enough depth to make you want to kill them, and they give you just enough plot to make the ending desireable.  There's no plot twist or big surprise.  Just a long trek through the campaign with the reward of killing the big bad at the end.  And it's a sweet ending when you get there.The game has several modes.  The military campaign is the ""story"" mode, but there is also a much less linear but still entertaining economic campaign.  There are also a slew of one-off siege and castle defense scenarios, where you are given a set number of troops and a castle to either defend or conquer.  Finally, there is a free-build mode with highly customizable settings.  There is even a tutorial mode which is essentially free-build with easy objectives to help introduce the basics, but the military campaign does a good job of introducing new game mechanics at an easy-to-learn pace without making the campaign missions themselves boring.  The wide variety of modes focusing on all the different aspects of the game really help give it some replayability.The one downside to this game is the pacing.  There are frequently times where you could probably get up, leave your computer, and let the game run without you needing to supervise.  Waiting to hit 500 of a resource while your castle wall is literally filled to the brim with archers and crossbowmen basically means that you can endure any attack, you just have to wait until the economy finishes gathering the resource.  Essentially, once you hit a certain point, the game turns into a waiting game, as you know you've won the mission but the tedium of actually finishing the objective for the map hasn't been done yet.  This is a minor issue at best, and only relevant in the missions focusing heavily on economy, but it's common enough to bear mentioning.Later games change the system.  Crusader is probably the crown jewel of the Stronghold series, and Stronghold 2 is still fun.  But this is the game that started it all, and frankly, it's inspired.  Everything is original, and very little is done wrong.  It's rare for the first game in a series to do nearly everything correctly.  Don't expect a compelling plot or deep three dimensional characters.  This game comes with one purpose - to be fun to play, and to give you a thin reason to throw hordes of macemen at the enemy's castle just to see how far you get.Bottom Line: Absolutely worth it			",189,38,0,72,11,0,30

												There are so many things bad with this game.The graphics are a bit sub par.The Menu is lacking.The voiceovers are laughable.The over all feel of this game is cheap and rather dated.Why would I recommend this game then?Well its actaully very fun.I bought this game a while ago because it reminded me of an old classic game called Castles.I played it once and thought (waste of money), even with the help of the tutorial I couldn't figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. To be honest I'm still learning the mechanics.But after giving it a bit of time I was pleasently surprised.The game is entertainly challenging RTS and grows more complex as you play.For the price i've already gotten my moneys worth of entertainment.Gameplay:  8 of 10Graphics: 4 of 10 (almost laughable but thats a part of its charm)Sound/Music: 7 of 10Replay Value: 9 of 10Conclusion i'd say it's a fairly hard to learn game but rewarding to master.

												Strong Hold : HD (Hard Devil) is a third person melee combat game. You play as the title character, Hard Devil, and you must use your wits to adventure into the unknown to discover the true nature of the 'Strong Hold'. After you gain the power of the Strong Hold you begin your true quest, fighting colorful characters as you gain levels and new abilities for your skill. Rich story, very cut scene heavy but this is a plus when you take into account the 500+ volumes of manga behind the series. 10/10			",181,20,1,16,20,1,29

 ONE OF THE GREATEST GAME OUT THERE Stronghold is one of the classic RTS/Strategy game, where you build, manage, destroy a castle. This game allows you to challenge your skill's on ruling. The campaign has its finest gameplays, but for me the real deal here is the  Multiplayer Mode  where you compete with other players, i promise you, its such a mess. ~HAIL HYDRA  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely marvellous. I think its the best out of all the Stronghold games in the series. The other games are good but nowhere near as good as this one. You can do so many things in the game. I love the fact that you can choose between two different campaigns and create your own missions in the map editor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple yet intricate, Fun yet challenging. Stronghold. You'll be surprised how well the 2001 classic holds even in regard of our 2016 gameplay standards.It has something for every type of player. You want to break a siege and lead your own on an ennemy castle ? You can.You'd rather turn a barren land into a flourishing serfdom ? You can.You'd rather sit back, take your time and build the castle of your dreams, and then unleash hordes of enemies to test its defences ? You can too.Ilso it's truly a game for all ages. Started playing it at age 5, and I still find new things to do.			",73,44,2,9,15,0,14

 ONE OF THE GREATEST GAME OUT THERE Stronghold is one of the classic RTS/Strategy game, where you build, manage, destroy a castle. This game allows you to challenge your skill's on ruling. The campaign has its finest gameplays, but for me the real deal here is the  Multiplayer Mode  where you compete with other players, i promise you, its such a mess. ~HAIL HYDRA  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game for u who wants a little bit harder game play, the difference between stronghold 2 and other strongholds is that u need allot more things like guards to stop crime, rat catchers and garbage collectors. if u don't have these things the people will be unhappy and ""leave the castle"" well, I've played all strongholds/crusader that exist and this is one of my favorite! :) ",36,0,2,0,10,1,2

												The game that ive been playing for a very very very long time!!! <3 This game is fasinating and a game well done. Build castles, destroy ur enemies and have a blast doing so!!! There is litterally nothing wrong with the game, its old but you wont find anything of sort in here. From each class and type of person to the enviroment and all the animals. There is a strong main campain including many interesting characters, a secondary campain and loads of extra misions and of course free build. Theres so much you cant possibly get board. This game just did everything well done, its shown as the game is still played 16 years later and still has a rather strong multiplayer (done in a very old fashioned ip hosting manner) but thankfully thats what kept it alive, unlike Stronghod 2 and Legends :(I love this game (clearly obvious xD) so worth getting this and really the whole collection. Enjoy all of them!! ^^  There is trully nothing like this game, i still cant find something like it or just as good!!!!! Stronghold, Stronghold Crusader both, Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends are fantastic a must grab or at least just look and see for urself. 10/10 ^^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												NOTE: Don't let my time decieve you, I have played well over 10 hours already just playing Multiplayer on GameRanger (Which doesn't add to the Steam time which is odd)If any game has tought me the art of containing over-population, while astonishingly making me feel good for industrailzation then this game is it. PROS: +Fantastic maps; YES there are indeed a lot less then in Crusader, but the maps that are here are not only balanced but unlike Crusader I like playing all of them instead of there only being a few that I like to play. +Great music; this game and Crusader have indeed some of the most atmosphereic pieces of music in any game. From slow mandaline as you begin to create your kingdom, to the fan favorite Stcks and Stones which is a huge 10 minute battle melody that changes depending on how the battle is progressing!+Great graphics; You may be saying ""Is this guy joking"" well NO I am not. The graphical style is outdated by today's 3D graphics, but unlike today's 3D graphics the pixel based sprites look vibrant, crisp, and colorful. The green grass isn't blurry but is a nice pixel based style along with the units, buildings, and other things. This game's graphical style is in the same style as RCT1/2 and AOE2:HD.+Fun multiplayer; This is the ONLY WAY I play this game, the multiplayer is fantastic, with pretty snazy netcode and you can easily see your enemies castle to see how they are doing or if they are about the launch a full fledged attack on you. And holy crap, seeing your castle go from just a small camp to becoming a military power house with industrailzation and over population of people and having to build hundreds of farms just to get enough food is insane to watch.CONS:+No Skirmish; Crusader fixes this problem but there is no way to play the game against AI so if you want to play a Skirmish type mode you are forced to play Multiplayer.+Unintuative menu; The menu just looks bad as not only does the background blend in with the buttons on the menu to click but it also includes bad organazation. For example, the multiplayer option is in the Combat Games section which makes sense, but I would just rather have the Muitiplayer option on the front of the screen. Other then that it gets the job done.+The FPS halves when you attempt to zoom all the way out (Also in Crusader) which is odd and very noticable)OVERALL:This game is absolutley fantastic, with the multiplayer being the icing on that cake. The music is charming and catchy, and the graphics while basic are crisp and clean. Overall I recomend it even with its problems, and the price is fair with these problems.			",174,25,4,10,16,1,18

Each game can last 20 minutes to literal days depending on the amount of people and their' strategies. Its a little confusing at first but really easy to get into.

												Ive tried every stronghold game that has come out to date- except the recently released (2014) Crusader 2- Stronghold Legends is my favorite in the series as of now. 3d graphics with the same feel as the 2d game, improvements to some buildings (barracks) and many new units (especially magical ones and heroes like merlin). The game has crashed 2 times in 10 hours of playing, so thats sort of an issue- other than that, this is a great stronghold game.			",36,13,2,9,10,0,4

												Stronghold HD is a RST ""simulation"" game considered a classic. However the game aged a lot, and only nostalgics can truly enjoy it (this is what reviews show actually), it suffers from to many flaws unacceptable by nowadays standarts.Let's do a list :- Graphics : the ""HD"" part is nonexistent. This is just some kind of zoom to adapt to the screen size. However the game is perfectly playable, this is not smth which should stop you play the game. - The UI is also not efficient, but again, we can forgive the game since it's old. Ok here come the real issues.- The tutorial is nonexistant. It gives you the basics of the basics, and forgets (easily) 90% of the important informations. Fortunaly today we have Internet. Still it's a bother. - You must place a stock pile next to another one. Why ? Because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why. This is a mere square of stones, so obviously it can't be placed freely. Results, sometimes you can't because you put your castle on a hill (the stockpile being put at the same time next to it) and the ground must be perfectly flat. This is also completely inefficient since workers must travel long distance to dispose of their ressources. There is a trick to build a long line of stockpiles then destroy the ones in the middle. It's long, tedious and not always possible, but whatever...- Once a stockpile is full, you can't empty it, you must build to spend ressources.- The granary works the same that the stockpile.- The land is cursed. In one minute I managed to get fire which destroyed all my plantations, wolves and bandits (at least wolves and bandifs fought each other).- The objective of every mission is gathering said amount of ressources (stone, bread, maces...) and sometimes smth like complete the castle. But the difficulty remains the same whatever the level of difficulty you choose. The only thing changing is how much ressources you must gather.- This game feels like a try and die. You must repeat the same mission again and again to understand every mechanics and do a perfect game. The issue ? A mission can last several hours each time. Of course you can save, but it's hard to know beforehand if your game is already ♥♥♥♥ed or not. - When you manage to play well enough to reach the goal before the end of the time (because of course it's time limited), the game adds difficulty to prevent you to (such as bandits onslaught). - Building must run on coal or oil (including farms and plantations) because they're subject of spontaneous combustion. Actually to prevent fire you must build a well by building. Of course when the guy from the well (yes because there's one guy by well, other people don't try to stop the fire, it's not their job after all) come back drawning water, he goes to HIS well, even if it's at the other side of the map, not the one just next to him. - The game is supposed to be a ""simulation"", still bandits can destroy (stone) building by hitting it with maces in a AoE way. And they do a lot of dammages. - Bandits have better gear than your own troops (except the most powerful ones). - Workers are the most courageous people you could meet. They fear nothing. That's why they take the shortest route to their destination. So if there is a fire or bandits on the way, YOLO, what could happen ? Results you lose tons of workers because they're too stupid to understand that fire burns and bandits kill (they don't run away either if bandits come to their workplace, children in the game are programed to do it, workers should do the same). - Ranged troops (archers, crossbowmen) don't move if they're too far of a target, they just say they can't reach it. You must move them to a point then ask them to fight. Incredibly tedious, especially when the target is moving itself. Also, if they start fire to the target and this one becomes out of reach, they simply stop shooting.- Sometimes troops stop doing a taks you gave them, because, well, because. Killing the wolves eating all my friends ? Nah I didn't like them anyway. Killing the army of rabbits eating every crops ? Nah I'm strictly carnivorous. Must be smth like that. Reminder : the game was released two years after Age of Empire II, so several issues with the game (such as range units not going to the target themselves) are unacceptable, even for a game that old. I'm stating facts, so only a fanboy blinded by nolstagia could accept such flaws. Still despite all of that, I give a positive review. Why ? Because the game remains enjoyable despite being an encyclopedia of flaws. If you're the kind of player who hates losing, you will feel the urge to beat it. However I advice it only for a very low price, I paid it 0,66€ and it shouldn't cost more.			",310,48,9,54,21,0,44

Why did they call it Stronghold HD???As an old gamer, I use to love Stronghold... graphics were ok but the silulation was really good and the gameplay fantastic. When I saw a HD version available on Steam, I jump on it, so happy to have this old game again but this time running on my new laptop with HD definition as well as wider point of view... At leat that's what I thought it would be...Well, it is Stronghold, the original, but it is not HD, not even close to a decent high resolution: 2 zooms levels, very wide, and everything is too small to play or close-up and you still have no details (looks like the original definition in the orifinal game). 100% dissapointed!So, here is the verdict: Don't waiste your money on a lie! Get the original Stronghold and you basically have the HD version after you spend 20 minutes figuring out the video output :( :( :(When they come out with a proper HD , I will change my review, until then...

												Fun game and nice ideas but the difficulty spike just kills it. I keep retyring to beat the last two or three counties of Rat but it was too hard. I seriously tried all day so don't think I haven't tried. The other issue I have with this game is that is a hassle to put down walls. A couple of times the oppoising were able to go around my wall by sneakily go in that one square of broken wall or missed spot covered by trees, other walls, or the mountains. It is frustrating not being able to fix it or get a warning and watch my village get destroyed. Yes, I know about the limitation of 2d iometric.It will take you some time to learn and the hud is messy but I bared it. The game has some fun to it at first.For $5, you can easily try this game but you will get confused very easily.Again, the thing I am most unhappy about is the difficulty, I dont mind the other things.

												Remember when you had the original copy of Stronghold, and you played it for hundreds of hours in your spare time? Remember how it consumed any life you had before? Well, that's gone. Let me explain.I want to disclose that I got this game for free by buying one of the other games in the series, I forgot which.It's not really the game itself that's the problem, it's the ""HD"" """"""""""revision."""""""""""" Notice the exagerated quotes, because about all this did is make the cutscences and menu puny and added some filling textures in a few menus. It didn't fix a lot of inherent problems in the game nor did it make it more streamlined. If you want a game that works as you might expect, without a lot of odd, annoying quarks, I heartily reccomend Stronghold Crusader 2. Please, just get it. It costs more money, but at the quality of this game, they might as well charge a cent for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Punishing and frustrating The game starts well enough, but you'll quickly become frustrated with the clunky wall building mechanics and the relentless and overwhelming amount of attacks. So while you're busy deleting walls because the camera fooled you into thinking you filled that gap, and while you're trying to repair the damage from the last attack, you'll be about halfway done when the next attack comes. The game becomes a game of frantically plugging holes in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ while the AI is frantically making more holes, all while you're trying to juggle the convoluted economy system. I cannot recommend this game, unless you enjoy heart attacks.  ",22,8,0,23,7,0,14

Stronghold HDOne of those games that I bet are really nice to play with the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia, but for a new player in 2016 it feels just way too aged.The good:+ Passable graphics+ Nice music+ Okay voice actingThe bad:- Very lacking tutorial, barely anything is explained before the player is expected to know how everything works.- Oldschool UI, meaning everything is represented by icons without any label or tooltips, so good luck memorising what each of them means. The camera controls are also limited and clunky.- Partly due to the above two points - especially the lacking tutorial - the game is quite more difficult (even on easy mode) than I would feel reasonable. Overall it's just a frustrating experience.Verdict:If you haven't played it before, you don't lose much.			",53,357,2,100,57,1,89

												It is my own fault for not doing enough research but I was highly disappointed with this game. Unlike Stronghold Crusader this game does not have the free selection of NPCs to fight against. You only get prebuild castles, fights and armies.And I dunno what in the world this Ranger installion to make this work is all about, it seems iffy to ask us instal such things.Either way, if I had to recommend you a game on this series, go with the Crusader one.

												I really wanted to like this game, seriously. The thought of playing a castle builder / siege laying / medieval RTS game made me excited, but probably a bit too much excited.While the game itself is fine, I felt like it kinda aged. Not too badly, but still not too well.The main campaign is divided into 2 parts, one ""combat"" part and another ""economical"" part. I only played through a quarter of the combat based campaign, took me around 1 hour to get there but... it felt quite dulling. You're only granted archers for quite a long time while the enemy got pikemen, archers, ladder carriers and catapults. It doesn't means it's difficult to beat them, in fact it's quite easy since you're in a defensive position. And that's where it's dulling.I only managed to almost lose one time during this playthrough. The game isn't difficult and after a bit of tweaking you get a winning strategy quite quickly. While the game is kinda quick paced, you just have to pick up the pace and that's it. The lack of diversity in the units given out makes it even more boring for those first parts of the campaign since... well you only have one single strategy to apply.Out of boredom, I switched to a free play to discover in one go everything the game had to offer. While it's a good thing to keep stuff simple, the game oversimplifies things a lot. Building construction mainly requires wood and stone (for fortification mainly), you only have 4 type of food (and you can just focus on one since having diversity is cool but really unnecessary) and special other resources are mainly for army building (iron, leather and horses). Buildings are constructed instantly (and so are military units) which is great for impatient people but at the same time making it unrewarding. I basically built every single building and military units under 30 minutes in freeplay.There’s a lot of other stuff that the game oversimplify that made me go meh but I’m gonna keep it “short” and stop there.This lack of diversity (and ultimately of strategy) got me bored in less than 3 hours of gameplay. This game might have been great at its time, but, as of now, other games that were released in them mean time might’ve made me too demanding for this one.4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll jump right in by saying the video that promotes the game is mis-leading. All action occuring within seconds, and you practically have to go and learn the game all on your own. AI is poor, Graphics are poor, overall a bad game in my opinion. The ""Missions"" are next to impossible giving you archers to take down 500 men and 10 battering rams. I give this mixed reviews however as I did find it quite entertaining to watch all the infantry get simotainously mowed down by archer fire. I would not reccomend this to first comers or people not firmiliar with strategy games.			",35,8,0,2,6,0,9

												Stronghold HD is, for the most part, lacking. I went into this with my rose tinted glasess firmly placed onto my face but the sluggish animations, flawed campaign mode and a severe lack of updated controls had them removed rather swiftly. What you might think is a remake of the original title with some new additions and tweaks is actually just an addition of higher resolutions. I can't hate the game, as I used to have so much fun with it, but the truth is we have moved on and stronghold HD has not. If you can grab it cheap, and you used to be a fan of the original than i'm sure you will get your moneys worth. Otherwise, head to one of the new Strongholds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Whatever nostalgia people revel in in this game, it doesn't make up for the horrible way this game seems to play.  Even the peaceful, introductory mission is difficult to acclimate oneself to.  Can't recommend.  There are better ways to get a Medieval, RTS, or simulation fix.EDIT: All you fanboys out there disliking this review, please enlighten me.  Just tried to play the game again and can't surpass the second economic level.  Wolves and bears in the early game reduce my Lord's health to near zero, things stabilize, Bandits drop in and wipe half my apple orchards, they do so a second time wiping my Archers, and another pack of wolves finishes off my Lord.This is an ""Economic"" mission.The second one.On Easy.And don't get me started on the horrendously spotty building placement: ""too close to an enemy,"" ""too close to a signpost,"" ""NPCs are scurrying in that boxed location.""And what tutorial?  I feel more left in the dark than a family in North Korea.There's something wrong with the game you rabidly defend.  Down-thumbing ""Not Recommended"" reviews doesn't help your cause.  I've seen others that are more well-thought-out than mine with similar ""0 out of XX found this helpful"" stats.EDIT 2: So I found the tutorial, and I learned that free-build is a lot more fun than the campaign.  I stand by my earlier statement that there are better games for an RTS, Medieval, or simulation fix.			",226,9,2,21,11,0,33

												What?! Nooo! Such awful graphics and gameplay, would have probably been slightly more positive about this game in the year of its original release, but refuse to waste any time on this at this day and age. Sigh.. Will stick to SimCity 4 among builder games forever obviously.Not that i wouldn't like to see a totally revised version of this game though with some anti-alias, zooming, rotation and overall better user interface and graphics, not to mention less awkward feel altogether. A good game for me can be recognised from how it guides a new player in the enter and grows from there to an overwhelming, engaging experience, thus game makers should never assume the level of a gamer but to build every game for a total novice at the start ,I hate to start a game guessing ""well, what the heck i'm going to need to do here anywayto play?!"".This game had potential that just didn't live through and if the actual later versions are the same with just updated visuals, it's a no deal for me, sorry. Maybe will take a look at the sequels or not, time will tell.. Bought this games and its two peers for almost nothing, but even that feels wasted.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry not able to give the thumbs up here.Sure the game is old, sure it used to be good, but in my opinion the game has failed to stand the test of time.Very very dated, with some annoying control features and interfaces. Stick to stronghold 2 (Still a good game) but avoid stronghold HDSave your £3.49 and go and get yourself a chippy tea ...Ven			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Because of the lack of ability to play in windowed mode, I cannot enjot this game. I do not recommend this title. Seriously, no windowed mode ruins the entire game for me. Get it together, seriosuly. Other than that, the game is fine.Lack of windowed mode, to me, makes this game unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So yeah I bought this game because I was watching Totalbiscuit play Citidels and he mention strongholds crusades wich I have not try yet. So this review is just for Strongholds 2 only. My thoughts?Complicated and tool tips where kind of hidden. I do not like how the tool tips are not realy all that helpfule. I still can't figure out how to fill my armory with weapons before the AI is ready to kill me. Speaking of AI it somehow found its way around my STONE WALL. I have no idea how that happen since the only way was throught it. AI is also kind of dumb. I tell my army to go attack another and what do they do just walk on by the enemy and to the spot I told them to attack them at. -_-' So to Quote Phoebe Kalinowski ...... ""So yeah.... thats a thing now."" Just forget that they will chase you and kill your men, they haft to get to that spot. Oh and the courthouse is completely *&^%ing usless. It is supost to stop crime so you get to torture poeple. Well thats a interesting concept if it work. Oh and for those who are new at RTS or never played strong holds but play others. Pesants are always AI controlled wich is like Blizzard coming in and saying You no long controll your drones we do. Here drone have a candy bar now go play in the corner. Mean while your setting there going where are my resoucres as the drone is spining in circles like a dog chassing its tial. This concept is stupid why would you do this? Oh and you can't go take over estates via military no you haft to buy them. With Honor... In real life or other games I would normaly just go over to site B and say mine. Anyone who disagree would be dead already since brut force has a much more enjoyible feeling I think. I think this why I choose to play Starcraft more then other RTS. Also I was realy tire when I wrote this so please forgive any spelling errores that I might have forgotten after editing this.			",22,0,0,7,7,0,4

I love RTS games and this castle sim builder really impressed me in middle school and i am thrilled they came out with an HD version. Firefly also came out with a midde eastern game called Stronghold Crusaders which is great as well, the other sequals, not so much. This is again one of my favorite games and is very addictive.

												One of the best Collections you can buy on Steam. By far my favourite games in the series are Stronghold( original) and Stronghold Crusader. The game is a castle building sim so you have to gather resources including stone to build up your castle and defences. The game is incredibly fun to play . The objective is to gather resources to feed the people and create blacksmiths,fletchers and armourys to create knights,archers etc. Although being around 10 years old, the game is excellent and can provide many hours of enjoyment and tactics. 90%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very addicting. The atmosphere and gameplay is superb even in nowadays's standards. System: It is like AOE franchise with resource management more complex, combat simpler. It emphasize more on ""building defense (your castle)"" rather than ""building army.""Graphics: Classic 2D but very neat. It is not the eye candy but it gets by.Gameplay: Very engaging campaign. It has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay. You have combat oriented campaign and oconomic oriented ones. Also free build mode to build your perfect castle. The level design is good so you'll be kept on the toe, by throwing some accidents at you. So it can be excited when the aim is gathering only food.User Interface: the only con. interface need to be refreshed. You don't have hot keys to build certain buildings, instead, you have to scroll down to choose one. It sounds bad, but in the game the tempo of Stronghold is much slower, so you don't have to be ""flash hands"" to control your units. To sum up, strongly recommend Stronghold for people with time and patience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great castle building and strategy simulation.  I'm glad to see this in an HD remake for modern systems.  I just really enjoy this game a lot and it i definitely one that I keep coming back to several years after its initial publish.The game plays a lot like any other ""simulation"" game in that you don't have direct control over the minions you have available.  Rather, you make buildings that provide jobs for your minions.  This creates chains of industry.  For example, you spot a woodworker's hut to gather wood.  Then spot a Fletcher's workshop to create bows.  Supplement this with a cow farm/tanner's facility to provide leather armor and now your fletcher can begin making crossbows (or it could be iron...haven't played in a while!).  Strategy comes in laying out your castle defenses or siege equipment, depending on the mission.  Sighting walls, towers, and gates can provide almost god-like advantages in holding off massive sieges.  On the other side, deciding where to send your tunnelers and siege equipment while covering them with archers can open holes in the most vulnerable of positions.If you're looking for the latest graphics, or expecting something visually spectacular, pass up this game for something else.  Stronghold HD is just a resolution update for a game that came out in 2001.  Also, the AI can be downright predictable as it tends to want to assemble in the same place and wait for a while before beginning its siege phase.  This makes some missions laughably easy as you're able to set up traps in this assembly area and slaughter the AI army long before they begin to make their first moves.Altogether, though, it's a fun game.  Definitely a must-play if you're a thinking type person who likes a bare minimum of city planning.			",117,16,0,32,13,0,15

												A true classic! One of my favorite RTS games of all time. It offers great strategy in terms of building your economy, castle, army, and seige options. Not to mention the great civilian and soldier micro-managing (and hilarious voice acting), two fun campagin stories, amazing music, and practically endless army and castle options that make this game a unique and deeply enjoyable experience. The HD update makes your castle and the battlefield feel even more epic and engaging. Well worth the price, this game will keep you busy for days!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Preface: As someone who never actually played Stronghold ""back in the day"" I'm hoping that this review might be of help for others like me. That is, folks for whom this game pulls no nostalgic heartstrings but might still be interested in playing it. A Review: After the last season of Game of Thrones ended, I began looking for a game that would satisfy my Medieval itch, but wouldn't be as complicated as something like Crusader Kings. Stronghold HD is the game I settled on checking out and I couldn't be more satisfied with it (though there is a severe lack of assassins for my taste, maybe I'll check out Stronghold Crusader). The basic premise of most of the game's levels is classic Rampart from the NES days: either build from scratch or take over a castle, then defend it from waves of invaders with breaks in between to rebuild and refortify your defenses and replenish your troops until you clear the level. There are plenty of variations to this premise as the game's campaign goes on, and you're ever so slowly advanced up the tech tree, but that's generally the gist for most of the game as far as I can tell (I'm not quite finished with the main campaign yet, but I'm doubting a big turnaround at this point).There's a lot of Age of Empires 2 in not only the controls, but the game's graphical and audio stylings, but that really isn't a bad thing, as well designed pre-rendered 3D as seen here turns out to be quite timeless, and even the most amateurish British voice over sounds pretty classy. So yeah, it's a High Medieval RTS/City Builder/Castle Builder with a lot of elements of what would eventually be tower defense in it for good measure . . . that's the game, and there really isn't more to it than that. Fairly uncomplicated really, and that's a good thing, as it leads to a very polished and enjoyable experience for when you're in the mood to put on your Lordly crown, and order some peasants to toil in the fields or add more mortar to the walls. Oh and since it is a classic retro game, there's a LOT of content. I mean, the multiple campaigns (There's an economic mode I haven't even tried yet) have a ton of levels (replete with a silly little story and characters) and that's on top of a map editor and an MP mode! Seriously, on content alone you're going to get your money's worth. Still, if you're more into leading an army rather than manning the walls, this isn't going to be the game for you. For that, I'll say to check out Medieval Total War (1 or 2, both are good). And if you want to focus more on the city building, Banished will probably be more to your tastes. And if you want a mix of both but a still more offensive based game, there's always Age of Empires. But if you're like me, and just want a game that: A) Stays in the Middle Ages rather than hopping around timeB) Let's you boss a bunch of peasants around while you sit at your computer drinking red wine from your goblet, and C) Lets you focus on designing your dream castle in intricate detail . . . then this is the game for you milord!

												It started when I was playing along the peaceful economic single-player campaign having a tranquil time completing my little castle. I was supposed to make a bunch of bread and weapons, so I knew that I would have to create an efficient castle to be able to complete my task in the time limit. I first tried building a solid base of wood and food production to allow the construction of an array of weapon/bread facilities. But I slightly miscalculated causing starvation to the point everyone abandoned my city and before I could recover fires broke out in the farms and destroyed any hope of repopulating in time. So I restarted, and this time made sure that I would have ample production of food early on. However when I built my iron mines I didn't accompany them with enough hauler oxen so my miners were carrying each ingot back to my stockpile individually. So I restarted, and this time I was going to get it right. I built an efficient layout of early game farms, with a proper number of accompanying lumberjacks. I expanded to iron production and wheat farms early enough to get plenty of resources for weapon production. I even laid out a grid of wells to quench any fires that would start and fought off the occasional bandit raid without harm coming to my people. Soon I had a bustling little burb, but upon creating a few new buildings the scribe informed me that I had no new workers available and I needed to build a new hut. While I was building a few new houses, the scribe again popped up telling me that a fire had started in the baker's quarter. I had no worries since there were wells everywhere...until I realized that I hadn't put wells around my new baker shoppes. In a panic I watched as the new baker shoppes caught fire while the bakers were trying in vain to escape the flames. Soon my firemen were on top of things throwing pails of water on the problem, but the fire was spreading and jumping from building to building faster then the pails could be delivered. It took a long time before the firemen from the farms arrived to lend a hand dousing the final flames. I looked around my smoking castle and realized I had not lost a single building. Not one. My firemen had put out every building before it burned down. Then it dawned on me, none of my buildings were being worked. The fire had lasted so long that all of my workers had burned to death, and all my farmers, and all my miners, and anyone not carrying a bucket of water. But hope remained! I had a small remnant of food left in my granary to get going and maybe I could get my castle running again. And then a theif stole most of what was left.So now I am restarting.I love this game.

												The games advertises as ""the original castle sim,"" however, it might be streching that claim. Interplay omce had a game called Castles (and the expansion called the Castles: Northern Conquests). That game was more about the political affairs and actual mechanics and financing of building a castle. Stronghold is a bit better, but the politics are a bit linear, as per the story. But not only do you build a castle, but you laos need to manage other things, like pesant happiness, or the Wolf will be more than happy to run amok in your deserted castle and slay the lord.With two different campaigns and multiplayer, there;s many things to do in this game.

												Dear Nostalgia,       Welcome back, old friend.                                    -Old School GamerThis game is set as ""Old School Favorites"" in my gaming list. It is by far one of the best games if you're interested in playing online and battling against other players but your computer isn't up to spec for Dota 2 or Stronghold 3.It has all the same features as the original game (since it's a clone) but the resolutions and quality make it as seamless as some high-dollar pantyhose. It's price, at the time of this writing, has been reduced to only five dollars and ninety-nine cents.  A very fair price for a game that was so dear to my heart as a child.IN SUMMARY:The price is right but not all will enjoy this game. If you played Stronghold back in the day you'll enjoy replaying for kicks and building maps for online play once again.If you've never played Stronghold but can't run Stronghold 3 on your system this is a good substitute.If you only way to play a game that's strictly detail-oriented and gorgeous to look at, go ahead and buy Stronghold 3.

												It's an amazing game. First ever GOOD castle simulation to be released. If there's any other, this one beats them. It can be extremely hard at times, almost impossible, it will drive you crazy, one atempt after the other, but eventually you'll find the best strategy to win a map.It did take me a couple of days to beat some of the hardest sieges in the campaign, but it was worth it, very exciting.And whatever you do, don't cheat before finishing the game at least once on normal. ^.^			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Can't place that there milord!Wood stocks are too low sire!Ah, good times. True to its word this is a castle sim and not really a RTS or at least not a traditional one.For one thing you see everything on the map right when you start so you don't explore it at all. The size of the map is fairly small too usually.The focus is on just you actually. If you're defending you want to muster up as many troops as you can to repel enemy invasions or if you're attacking it's about using your army well so you don't take needless losses.And making an army from scratch isn't easy either. You not only need a free peasant but also any weapons or armor that the particular unit needs. For more basic units this is just the weapon but you'll also need to make the armor for more powerful units. Getting resources isn't a quick process. A hunter has to shoot a deer, bring it back to his area, cut it up and bring that to your castle's granary. If you want to make your peasants eat bread, you need to make the wheat, turn that into flour and turn that into bread, so that's 3 different peasants you'll need right there.Your peasants need to be fed of course, Otherwise they become very unhappy and will likely leave your castle before long so making them happy is a good idea. It's pretty easy to manipulate it though with how much food you give them and how much tax you want out of them. But as your population rises so too does the rate at which your food depletes.What's interesting is that you can make buildings instantly, including the walls so you don't have to spend time worrying too much about that aside from some buildings that need to be placed on certain places.The military campaign is where the main story is. There's a economic campagin but it's not nearly as long or interesting. The voice acting in it is cheesy in a good way. It can be pretty difficult though. The game looks about the same as I remember it but being able to play in 1920x1080 is nice. At the price it's asking for I'd say it's worth it. I play it on a Windows 7 machine and I don't have any issue running the game.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The HD version solved this I can now replay one of the best strategy games available and the graphics are fine. This game can become very addictive and should entertain for hours. I would recommend that you buy the Stronghold collectionas you get not just this but a great selection of similar games which are guaranteed to entertain you for weeks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've finished Stronghold's campaign before in the non-steam version of the game. I really like the HD patch for the game. Because before, you can only play with a max resolution of 1024x768 and compatible with the newer OS. The economy system is a little complex, but once you get the hang of it, it's really simple. The campaign is really challenging. The free build mode is nice too, so you can build your castle peacefully. The graphic is beautiful for a 2001 game. I love the soundtrack for this game. The voice acting is quite bad, but it fits with the game's somehow. The Steam Cloud feature for Stonghold is really handy, because you won't lose your progress and save which is one of the reasons why I bought the Steam version.There isn't much that I don't like about Stronghold. The lack of skirmish mode like in Stronghold Crusader is one. And also some AI units are annoying because sometimes they will block your buildings. And the lack of Steam overlay is also a big downside. You can't take screenshots of the game via Steam.In summary, for a 14 year old game, Stronghold has truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold is an RTS classic. I would really recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

(My hours are low bcoz at the time I didn't have the steam version of the game and only got it today because I won a giveaway by SergiuHellDragoon).So yeah,this game is a must have for those who have crappy systems and/or are strategy game fans.Graphics are pretty good even now (guess that's how sprites work :]) plus its HD so you can enjoy the game in 1080p or whatever you like!

												One of my favorite RTS games. While this game definitely has some glitches (especially with walls in relation to terrain) in some ways I like this RTS better than Age of Empires (any of them) and that's probably my all time favorite RTS. The thing that seems to set this game apart is not only the typical RTS acts of fortifying, aquiring resources, and researching newer technologies-- but they added the component of keeping your citizens happy. You're forced to choose between being a tyrant on taxes (to increase gold), but by keeping your people from leaving your castle by either giving them more rations and varieties of food, making them beer, etc., OR, you can scare them into staying! haha			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""The people... Loathe you sire...""This was the first strategy game I ever played. I was like eight years old at the time. I loved it then, I love it now. I still play the game after so many years. The economic system is one of the best Ive ever seen in a RTS, the soundtrack is some of the best middle ages music Ive ever heard, the story is fun and the combat is done well and very strategic. I will reccomend this to everyone. If you want an even better game though, buy Stronghold Crusader, it is a masterpiece.WARNING: Dont buy Stronghold 3 or Stronghold Crusader 2. They are nothing compared to these older versions. Stronghold 2 is ok, but nothing too special.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've finished Stronghold's campaign before in the non-steam version of the game. I really like the HD patch for the game. Because before, you can only play with a max resolution of 1024x768 and compatible with the newer OS. The economy system is a little complex, but once you get the hang of it, it's really simple. The campaign is really challenging. The free build mode is nice too, so you can build your castle peacefully. The graphic is beautiful for a 2001 game. I love the soundtrack for this game. The voice acting is quite bad, but it fits with the game's somehow. The Steam Cloud feature for Stonghold is really handy, because you won't lose your progress and save which is one of the reasons why I bought the Steam version.There isn't much that I don't like about Stronghold. The lack of skirmish mode like in Stronghold Crusader is one. And also some AI units are annoying because sometimes they will block your buildings. And the lack of Steam overlay is also a big downside. You can't take screenshots of the game via Steam.In summary, for a 14 year old game, Stronghold has truly withstood the test of time. Stronghold is an RTS classic. I would really recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Stronghold Crusader was one of the first serious computer games I ever played as a child, and I was absolutely ecstatic to see it available on Steam. These games are old as dirt, but are so much fun to play. The interface is simple, and you'll get the hang of gameplay in no time. If you aren't picky about graphics, and especially if you love history, strategy, or command and conquer games, the Stronghold collection will prove to be worth much more than you pay for it.

												Ignore the bad reviews... they are moronic.You begin by placing a Townhall, of various size which attracts peasants. You then place a Granary. The rest is up to you. Build homes to increase your population cap. Build woodcutters to harvest wood from (renewable) forest. Build farms, mills, bakeries, make beer, build taverns. Build chapels, churches, cathedrals. Place gardens, statues, and other good things to increase happiness. Build gibbet, stretching rack, stocks, and other horrible things to increase work efficiency.Tax! Good things increase happiness, so does full and extra food rations; bad things lower the effect of good things and decrease happiness - but are vital. With a market you can sell excess supplies, and buy needed ones; including weapons. You may also build worksites to craft weapons, armor, etc that fill your armory; even stables can be built for mounted knights. That's right, you create an army.To build weapons you must harvest resources such as wood, stone, iron, even pitch for fire-pits; and wood for spike-pits. Stone allows you to build castle walls. With wood alone you may build basic fortifications that don't hold up well to assault. You can build moats, or towers and place siege engines atop them. If you're invading, you can build siege equipment and even tunnelers to take out fortifications or take over castle walls with your own troops.Check the number of hours I've played... and ignore the bad reviews.

												One of the best Collections you can buy on Steam. By far my favourite games in the series are Stronghold( original) and Stronghold Crusader. The game is a castle building sim so you have to gather resources including stone to build up your castle and defences. The game is incredibly fun to play . The objective is to gather resources to feed the people and create blacksmiths,fletchers and armourys to create knights,archers etc. Although being around 10 years old, the game is excellent and can provide many hours of enjoyment and tactics. 90%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's amazing. I love making castles! Similar to the first one, a lot more freedom in this and you can really edit maps properly in this one, and make some stunning castles! Also larger variety of buildings and upgraded graphics from the first, but still the same old stronghold fun I used to have as a youngling :) I'd give it an 8/10 as the tutorial is a bit uninformative and I had to teach myself how to use the advanced mapmaking tools and set up a proper game. Also, the inability to build multiple cathedrals/churches annoys me a bit. Still good though :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A Preface: As someone who never actually played Stronghold ""back in the day"" I'm hoping that this review might be of help for others like me. That is, folks for whom this game pulls no nostalgic heartstrings but might still be interested in playing it. A Review: After the last season of Game of Thrones ended, I began looking for a game that would satisfy my Medieval itch, but wouldn't be as complicated as something like Crusader Kings. Stronghold HD is the game I settled on checking out and I couldn't be more satisfied with it (though there is a severe lack of assassins for my taste, maybe I'll check out Stronghold Crusader). The basic premise of most of the game's levels is classic Rampart from the NES days: either build from scratch or take over a castle, then defend it from waves of invaders with breaks in between to rebuild and refortify your defenses and replenish your troops until you clear the level. There are plenty of variations to this premise as the game's campaign goes on, and you're ever so slowly advanced up the tech tree, but that's generally the gist for most of the game as far as I can tell (I'm not quite finished with the main campaign yet, but I'm doubting a big turnaround at this point).There's a lot of Age of Empires 2 in not only the controls, but the game's graphical and audio stylings, but that really isn't a bad thing, as well designed pre-rendered 3D as seen here turns out to be quite timeless, and even the most amateurish British voice over sounds pretty classy. So yeah, it's a High Medieval RTS/City Builder/Castle Builder with a lot of elements of what would eventually be tower defense in it for good measure . . . that's the game, and there really isn't more to it than that. Fairly uncomplicated really, and that's a good thing, as it leads to a very polished and enjoyable experience for when you're in the mood to put on your Lordly crown, and order some peasants to toil in the fields or add more mortar to the walls. Oh and since it is a classic retro game, there's a LOT of content. I mean, the multiple campaigns (There's an economic mode I haven't even tried yet) have a ton of levels (replete with a silly little story and characters) and that's on top of a map editor and an MP mode! Seriously, on content alone you're going to get your money's worth. Still, if you're more into leading an army rather than manning the walls, this isn't going to be the game for you. For that, I'll say to check out Medieval Total War (1 or 2, both are good). And if you want to focus more on the city building, Banished will probably be more to your tastes. And if you want a mix of both but a still more offensive based game, there's always Age of Empires. But if you're like me, and just want a game that: A) Stays in the Middle Ages rather than hopping around timeB) Let's you boss a bunch of peasants around while you sit at your computer drinking red wine from your goblet, and C) Lets you focus on designing your dream castle in intricate detail . . . then this is the game for you milord!

												Easily the greatest Castle Building Simulator of all time. A fun and interesting campaign with fun and unique charaters each with their own styles of combat and ways of attacking and defeating you. You can choose from a selection of military missions or peaceful economic missions. There's endless replay value and no two missions feel the same. It's well written and has some great tongue in cheek humour. Buy this game now. You will not regret it. Do it. Now. Go. Go on. Now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great castle building and strategy simulation.  I'm glad to see this in an HD remake for modern systems.  I just really enjoy this game a lot and it i definitely one that I keep coming back to several years after its initial publish.The game plays a lot like any other ""simulation"" game in that you don't have direct control over the minions you have available.  Rather, you make buildings that provide jobs for your minions.  This creates chains of industry.  For example, you spot a woodworker's hut to gather wood.  Then spot a Fletcher's workshop to create bows.  Supplement this with a cow farm/tanner's facility to provide leather armor and now your fletcher can begin making crossbows (or it could be iron...haven't played in a while!).  Strategy comes in laying out your castle defenses or siege equipment, depending on the mission.  Sighting walls, towers, and gates can provide almost god-like advantages in holding off massive sieges.  On the other side, deciding where to send your tunnelers and siege equipment while covering them with archers can open holes in the most vulnerable of positions.If you're looking for the latest graphics, or expecting something visually spectacular, pass up this game for something else.  Stronghold HD is just a resolution update for a game that came out in 2001.  Also, the AI can be downright predictable as it tends to want to assemble in the same place and wait for a while before beginning its siege phase.  This makes some missions laughably easy as you're able to set up traps in this assembly area and slaughter the AI army long before they begin to make their first moves.Altogether, though, it's a fun game.  Definitely a must-play if you're a thinking type person who likes a bare minimum of city planning.			",117,16,0,32,13,0,15

												A true classic! One of my favorite RTS games of all time. It offers great strategy in terms of building your economy, castle, army, and seige options. Not to mention the great civilian and soldier micro-managing (and hilarious voice acting), two fun campagin stories, amazing music, and practically endless army and castle options that make this game a unique and deeply enjoyable experience. The HD update makes your castle and the battlefield feel even more epic and engaging. Well worth the price, this game will keep you busy for days!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very addicting. The atmosphere and gameplay is superb even in nowadays's standards. System: It is like AOE franchise with resource management more complex, combat simpler. It emphasize more on ""building defense (your castle)"" rather than ""building army.""Graphics: Classic 2D but very neat. It is not the eye candy but it gets by.Gameplay: Very engaging campaign. It has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay. You have combat oriented campaign and oconomic oriented ones. Also free build mode to build your perfect castle. The level design is good so you'll be kept on the toe, by throwing some accidents at you. So it can be excited when the aim is gathering only food.User Interface: the only con. interface need to be refreshed. You don't have hot keys to build certain buildings, instead, you have to scroll down to choose one. It sounds bad, but in the game the tempo of Stronghold is much slower, so you don't have to be ""flash hands"" to control your units. To sum up, strongly recommend Stronghold for people with time and patience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short review:Great castle management game despite it's age! I've sunk many, many hours into it as I've had it before and only recently bought it on steam.Long, nostalgia infected, review:One of the best castle management games I've ever played. I've beat it twice before, ages ago, and once again when I got it on steam.The game holds up very well despite it's age. The maps come to life with wildlife like wolfs, rabbits, deer, bears and birds like eagles and seaguls. Trees move in the wind and water flows in the river. The sound effects are also really good and differs depending on what you focus your screen on. Scroll over the forrest an you'll hear the wind in the trees, over rivers you'll hear the water flow and over the ocean you'll hear the waves and the seagulls. If you scroll over buildings you'll hear the sound of work going on inside. Building walls and roofs also becomes transparent when work is going on, showing animations of workers/weapon makers (and in the case of inn's: drunkards) inside.All of the inhabitants in your castle deliver some simple dialogue when selected, reflecting what they think of the imminent situation and about you as their lord. When attacked women and children scream as they run for their homes to take cover.All of this makes the landscape and the castle come to life. Everything is littered with small details adding to the visual and audible appeal.As for gameplay there's a main military campaign with 21 separate missions, as well as a shorter Economic Campaign. In the military campaing focus lies on training units and defeating your enemy or successfully defend against enemy attack, while the economic campaign focus on gathering specific supplies.There are also stand alone missions like historically inspired sieges feauturing game renderings of real life castles.You don't control your peasants but only your military units. Peasants moves to your castle if you have housing for them and provide them with food. You'll have to balance the amount of food you hand out and your tax rate to keep people happy. If they are unhappy they will leave your castle.You can also manage your peasants by placing ""good"" or ""bad"" things. Placing ponds and gardens increase happiness and gives your soldiers bonuses in a fight, but your peasants will work slower strolling in the park now and then. Placing chopping blocks or skulls on spikes will do the opposite. It will lower happiness and give soldiers penalties in battles but increase output from your buildings.The crafting tree is pretty complicated in Stronghold. To make bread you first need a wheat farm, then a wind mill and last a bakery. All goods go through the stockpile beside your Keep/Stronghold, except bread that goes to the granary. If either the granary or the stockpile gets full they will need to be expanded or production will halt. Have this in mind when placing buildings.Weapons follow the same rules: you need wood to make bows, crossbows and spears, iron to make platemale, swords and maces, and leather to make leather armour. To get wood you need woodchoppers, to get iron you need mines and to get leather you need a farm and a tanner.Many production lines cross, and you'll have to plan what to build based on the land available (apples and wheat don't grow in any soil, and cows need to grace) and the threat you are facing. You have to protect your lord or you will be immediatly defeated, but leave your farms unprotected and they will likely all be destroyed in the event of an attack.There is also a freebuild mode where you build and manage your castle on a map of your choice without intervention. Build the castle of your dreams!A map editor is available where you can edit the terrain of your map and build castles and place buildings. Make your own scenario, stand alone mission or freebuild map.The editor is also very fun to play around in. No buildings will function in this mode but you don't need resources as everything is placed for free. You can build castles, place units from different factions and have them fight eachother.One negative aspect of the game is that the isometric view sometimes makes it hard to tell the elevation of different points on the map, and it's possible for characters to get stuck on terrain. Another problem is the path tracing. The enemy will always, immediatly find a hole in your wall but if your wall is intact they seem to attack the part closest to them. They do this even if that part is made up of 5 layers of stone wall and another section is made of fragile wooden wall.This makes it quite easy to lure the enemie through deathtraps like making them run back an forth through a maze of stone walls with archers on them. You don't have to exploit it ofcourse but it can be hard to resist :pIn conclusion, it's a solid game and I've had a hard time finding anything with the same feel as Stronghold. The HD edition makes much more playable on modern screens as you can zoom out and see almost the entire map at once. I defenitly recommend this to anyone interested in strategy games. It will run on practically any computer and offer hours of fun, and I haven't even tried the multiplayer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being one of the gems of my childhood, you can imagine how surprised and excited I was to see this series pop up in the steam store. For those unfarmiliar, Stronghold is a sort of economy based midevail RTS. Esentially, you are given a set of different scenarios in which you have to use the resources in the varying enviorments you are given. Sometimes, these enviornments will help you get an advantage to your enemy - you may be located close to trees, which will allow you to get a quick start on building many essential things, such as food and weapon producing buildings. Otherwise, you may be given a disadvantage at times and being able to make do with what you have can make victory all the more satisfying. In Stronghold, you need to think carefully about how you spend your resources. On one hand, it will be important to build a barracks so you can hold a strong and ready militia to defend against your enemy's forces. On the other hand, in order to raise a decent army, you need to keep your peasants happy and in your castle. This requires keeping your grainary stocked with food, being able to have enough industrial buildings to build farms to keep peasants fed, and other mechanics. To be victorious, you have to carefully plan out your divison of resources - it is equally important to keep your peasants populous and happy and to have a strong defence to wane off enemy attacks, as one good strike can land a once prosperous land in ruins, and you very vulnerable to further attacks. All in all, I would strongly recommend Stronghold to anybody new to the RTS genre. RTS veterans would probably enjoy playing this one, too. There's nothing quite as satisfying as surviving a seige and being able to crush your enemy in a few swift blows.			",134,8,0,5,9,0,1

												It's amazing. I love making castles! Similar to the first one, a lot more freedom in this and you can really edit maps properly in this one, and make some stunning castles! Also larger variety of buildings and upgraded graphics from the first, but still the same old stronghold fun I used to have as a youngling :) I'd give it an 8/10 as the tutorial is a bit uninformative and I had to teach myself how to use the advanced mapmaking tools and set up a proper game. Also, the inability to build multiple cathedrals/churches annoys me a bit. Still good though :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game from my childhood and one of the best RTS games I've ever played. Even if you don't like the genre / aren't familiar with it, you should like STronghold and Stronghold Crusader. It's simple to understand, yet fun and challenging. It is one of the best RTS games I have ever played and im not a huge rts fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dear Nostalgia,       Welcome back, old friend.                                    -Old School GamerThis game is set as ""Old School Favorites"" in my gaming list. It is by far one of the best games if you're interested in playing online and battling against other players but your computer isn't up to spec for Dota 2 or Stronghold 3.It has all the same features as the original game (since it's a clone) but the resolutions and quality make it as seamless as some high-dollar pantyhose. It's price, at the time of this writing, has been reduced to only five dollars and ninety-nine cents.  A very fair price for a game that was so dear to my heart as a child.IN SUMMARY:The price is right but not all will enjoy this game. If you played Stronghold back in the day you'll enjoy replaying for kicks and building maps for online play once again.If you've never played Stronghold but can't run Stronghold 3 on your system this is a good substitute.If you only way to play a game that's strictly detail-oriented and gorgeous to look at, go ahead and buy Stronghold 3.

												A true classic! One of my favorite RTS games of all time. It offers great strategy in terms of building your economy, castle, army, and seige options. Not to mention the great civilian and soldier micro-managing (and hilarious voice acting), two fun campagin stories, amazing music, and practically endless army and castle options that make this game a unique and deeply enjoyable experience. The HD update makes your castle and the battlefield feel even more epic and engaging. Well worth the price, this game will keep you busy for days!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Easily the greatest Castle Building Simulator of all time. A fun and interesting campaign with fun and unique charaters each with their own styles of combat and ways of attacking and defeating you. You can choose from a selection of military missions or peaceful economic missions. There's endless replay value and no two missions feel the same. It's well written and has some great tongue in cheek humour. Buy this game now. You will not regret it. Do it. Now. Go. Go on. Now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you like RTS or simulation games with a medieval feel you seriously need to own this! Can't wait to get the next ones in the series...bring on the crusades! :3  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A nice return to the slightly less flashy ways of playing RTS games, where being a ruler is more important than just spamming up units to surge on the enemy stronghold. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but honestly there is something about this game that just feels right. Stronghold HD is worth it's low cost and really is a must have for gamers.

												Amazing game, I remember playing Stronghold 3 as a kid. I read a lot of reviews recently and by the looks of it Stronghold 3 wasn't as good as I remember it, I was like 6 or 7 years old so I couldn't really understand most of the game like how to run an economy, didn't even know there was an economy system until I bought Stronghold HD. Anyways I highly recommend this game, it's rewarding watching your economy and stronghold grow and then being able to tear down others!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
