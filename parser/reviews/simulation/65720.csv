												This is probably the best DLC for Arma 2, with the only real immersive campaign. It was thrilling to become a virtual PMC operator and having to deal with the hardships of doing nearly anything for a good pay. I was playing the campaign with my mate, and we sure as hell enjoyed it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Arma 2: Private Military Company (PMC) is a first person shooter simulation game developed and published by Bohemia Interactive and released in December 2010. PMC follows the events in British Armed Forces (BAF) following the success of Operation Crimson Lance and the gradual withdrawal of British and American forces from Takistan. In this DLC, Ion Incorporated have won a contract to protect United Nations nuclear weapon inspectors as they investigate the abandoned Takistani Nuclear Programme.  Campaign  In PMC's Operation Black Gauntlet, you play as Brian Frost. In BAF, Frost came across as an appealing individual that was cheerful, driven, and was very caring towards the safety of his squad mates. In PMC, Frost gradually develops post-traumatic stress disorder and evolves into a mentally unstable individual because of circumstances in the campaign. Bohemia manages to deliver a story that showcases the change in mindset of Frost from BAF and PMC. The storytelling allowed me to clearly comprehend the issues he was in, the struggle of the overall operation, and how it all affected him. Furthermore, the game includes choices that have consequences and alter the story of the game, which also provides some replayability.PMC features eleven missions. These missions include mediocre cutscenes, a first in the Arma 2 series, which help tell the story and lengthen the game. Furthermore, I completed the campaign in seven hours. Overall, PMC's campaign is fairly standard and for the first half, I was bored. For instance, I waited twenty minutes for the inspectors to complete the objective in mission three. Following mission five, the game did pick up in action and in intensity because it felt like something was finally happen, not just in a waiting pattern.  Issues  I noticed a variety of issues that affect the campaign. For instance, in mission two I was tasked to defend an airport with others. As a side task, I had to kill a sniper in a tower. Following completion, I checked the map, the squad ditched the airport and ran north towards the Nato base, allowing insurgents to occupy the airport. So, bugs like this were very frequent throughout the campaign and I noticed them more in the early portions of the campaign rather than the latter stages.  Conclusion  Private Military Company is an above-average DLC. The highlight of it is in the characterisation of Frost and how he changed from BAF to PMC. The campaign has eleven missions and the first five missions were fairly boring, but needed to provide background towards the operation, while the second half was much better as it picked up in intensity. There are issues that affect the game, affecting my experience of it. I recommend this on sale. It's fun and it provides a story, even if not a good one. If you have to choose between Arma 2 DLC, I would recommend British Armed Forces, then this, then the Czech Republic DLC.  Rating  5.75/10  Pros  - Characterisation of Brian Frost.- Insight into contractors and the severity of their operations.- Choices matter.  Cons  - Annoying bugs that significantly affect certain missions.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I recommend this DLC, if you really want more ArmA 2.  Compared to ALL the other campaigns, this one is the most lacking.  You're better off playing any of the other campaigns first.  But given its frequently discounted price, I think it's well worth it.ProsMore ArmaActually has a story, unlike Arma 2: Army of the Czech RepublicConsThe story, IMO, feels like something DICE (Battlefield developer) would come up with.  Just doesn't seem very realistic.Along the same lines, the characters are so odd.  Sometimes they are clueless and other times they are decisive.Since when can 5 sniper shots blow up a tank?  Pretty dumb.  Again, it feels like DICE came up with this stuff.  Some of the missions are bugged, this isn't new to ArmA and generally things do work out. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												### UPDATE. IMPORTANT EDIT: I'm downrating this one due to endless bugs that cripple the gameplay. When you spend 1 hour trying to figure out how to end a mission that has been haunted by a severe bug, it means you are not playing the game any more. I am seriously tired of how annoying this game is. Intriguing? Yes. Playable? Nah.So here I am, defending an airport. Except there is this guy leading the team who keeps setting waypoints some 798 m away from where action is... possibly following an enemy that the system respawned where it shouldn't have. Every AI is running around like an idiot trying to make sense of a map that is simply too big for the mission at end (in this mission, you use only 10% of the entire map for meaningful purposes. The rest is but a barren wasteland where occasional respawns make it impossible to complete the mission).But that's not all! So here I am. I climbed the ladder and I am facing a sniper. Yeah, a sniper wearing a headscarf. I look at him. He looks at me. Why isn't he shooting me? I mean, I'm even playing Veteran here, but this guy does not seem willing to end my life. He simply stares at me! That's nothing short of incredible....And why am I staring at him? Suprise: I ran out of bullets and have just realized this game has no control to hit him in the face. Man, I cannot even push you down the building, hoping the fall would kill you. It's a stall.Of course I can go back and fetch some ammo, but the sheer idea of facing this scripted thing that stares back at me and doesn't shoot... paired with my inability to fight back with my bare hands... I mean, not even COD touched the bottom of the barrel. PMC did!### OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS ###ArmA 2: PMC builds on Operation Arrowhead, but from a different viewpoint -- i.e. that of private contractors who work in war zones.Some interesting things:- The plot is intriguing;- Scenarios are a pleasure for the eye;- Somewhat challenging;- It crashes way less than all the other arma games;- Easier controls.However, be warned that it is not your traditional ArmA 2 game, because it downgrades a lot of aspects that made ArmA 2 famous. I do not take an issue with that: it is a matter of choices, but just do expect something a bit more like COD and a bit less like ArmA.Some things to consider:- Differently form other ArmA games, here you spend most of your time on the field as a single individual. Most of this game takes away all the ""troop management thing"" that was typical of ArmA;- The world is not open-ended. Scenarios are broad and fully explorable, yet they contain very little beyond the mission's limited scope. I remember running around, searching houses... but, in the end, that's just a tour of the gaming world, but it does not add to its background and story; at best, you'll end up in a nicely designed empty shelled building;- Most mission and plots are mono-rail: you have to do A, B, C, and D in line to get to the end. It feels like a rollercoaster most of the time. Nothing against this, yet, again, this is not the open-ended world but rather a glorified version of the good old Call of Duty series. Just stay on track and do what you are told;- Some other reviewers noticed that sometimes realism is sacrificed to the sake of the storyline. I think the issue is a bit deeper than that: there is a mission in which you have to take down a series of vehicles one by one with an anti-materiel rifle. It is not that the mission isn't challenging per se... however, with some grain of salt you will keep asking yourself: don't the people on the vehicles communicate with each other? Do they keep standing there or following the same scripted path just for you to drop in and take a shot? Basically, at some stage this game will make you feel like the AI could have done better;- Game-breaking situations, in which a mission is extremely difficult if you play as the gunner, but it gets piece of cake if you set yourself on the driver's seat...- Longevity is not very good: the time you see next to my name (28 hrs) is what it takes for you to get to the mission before the last one, assuming you will go through some missions more than once to maximize your results. This means that the entire campaign is much shorter if you consider the actual game time required to finish the game....and so on.Final assessment: game is recommended if you want a different kind of experience with the ArmA engine. Possibly a more affordable and easy one... and if you are intrigued by Middle-Eastern scenarios. But that's about it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Private Military Company opens up ArmA 2 to a new independent faction, the PMCs. The campaign, unlike BAF, is cooperative and the pack adds in Proving Ground, new units, weapons, and vehicles. However, I feel this is the weakest of the DLCs. The new vehicles are pretty boring, which comes with the nature of PMCs and the campaign is fairly weak. It feels like the designers were trying to add more flair and emotional involvement to the campaign, and while it didn't work out well, it was appreciated. I still recommend it, but if you're only getting two DLC packs, this one should be the one you exclude.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the record It mounts onto Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead thus the low play time on it individually.Unlike Arma 2 this expansion has a terrible singleplayer which should not be played. Thankfully thats not all this brings. This version of the admittedly terrible Take On Helicopter Engine adds decent color corection to the engine and GREATLY improves the texture quality. People who only wan't it for DayZ Mod will certainly see a huge diffrence. Setting texture quality to Very High once this is installed will actually improve the texture quality of world textures in Arma 2 OA and It's a must have if you play DayZ as the default ""Survivor"",""Hero"" and ""Bandit"" player models are actually just one of the many PMC models which otherwise will look blurry. This is a must buy if your characters have nasty smeared textures that wouldn't look out of place in a PSP game. It also adds more weapons and will increase the variety of weapons AND adds more loot to be found in DayZ mod			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I Bought this for 2 Reasons One is because its a Campain Addon that Shows the life of PMC's Almost Everyday lives during the time period its filled with adventure and who knows what awaits you in the next mission 2nd Reason is for Days Mainly due to the weapons in ARMA II Private Military Company Adding several guns to the game including one of my favorites the AA-12 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright. In my opinion this was worst than ACR. And ACR Wasn't a bad dlc at all! Just BIS Being lazy over the installer & maps. So.... PMC DLC, WHERE DO I BLOODY START?Well. The campaign makes me want to kill myself. IT WAS GOD FORGIVINGLY DREADFUL. I did enjoy some aspects of the campaign, but its was awful, down right terrible.Scenarios in the DLC, Are alright. I enhoyed them. But content (Weapons + Vehicle wise) was just bulls***. Lack of content in this dlc is quite poor. Comming back to the campgin, in the 5th mission you have to lead a car, to follow you. I TOOK ME 1 HOUR TO GET TO MY DESTINATION Which was, idk 300 meters AWAY?It was also nice to see that the proving grounds map was being used aswell, which no arma mission HAD Proving grounds as their map.Overall, i got to give this a negative review. Installer is fine (Unlike ACR). But get it if you want to feel the pain. I know people will disagree with this. But it is my opinionn and my dignity.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game to play Dayz, and I have to say it's impressive. The amount of detail put into the Dayz mods make this game something that I enjoy coming back to over and over again. With dozens of additional mods like Epoch and Panthera where you can not only try to survive but build your own houses, and PVP against other players it makes the game different each time you turn it on.

												Be advised! DISAPPOINTING EXPANSION PACK to our DISMAY, DANGEROUSLY CLOSE to Call of Duty!This game is everything ArmA and more: Armored minigun-SUV rail shooting, boss fights with helicopters in said SUV, blowing up tanks by shooting them in the gas tank, smoking out randomly spawning civvies (much more humane than shooting in the air!), a shotgun that shoots rockets, and fairly decent voice acting.

												 It is as difficult to learn the controls as most entry level positions. A week or two of training with the Bill Lumberg from Office Space and a few days at a supermarket watching someone ring cash register would be more bearable than 15 minutes of this game. It has been out six years and I cant suggest it as playable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you have to choose between PMC and British Armed Forces, pick BAF. The new assault rifles in the PMCDLCDLC are not as veritable or cool as the L85s in the BAFDLCDLC (or BAFEPDLC if you want to get technical). The PMCEPDLC's (oh Jesus someone stop me) main campaign features awful voice acting with far too much swearing to not be silly but the missions themselves are very fun. Also, there's an Irish guy named Tanny who speaks in completely ridiculous Irish-stereotype jargon weirdness. His weird verbal mannerisms ARE worth mentioning in a review, because they are so outlandish (or highlandish *rimshot*) that the in game subtitles actually change what he says into understandable English, almost like he's speaking another language. There's more ""lads"" and ""wee"" sized things per sentence than in Pixar's Brave. Anyway, enough about Haggis McHaggis. The AA12 automatic shotgun is pretty sweet, but YOU BEST NOT BE FIRIN'IT IF YE GOT WEE SIZED STONES, LADDY OWN'N REAL GROW-ED UP MEN CAN FIR'IT			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
