												SPORE™ Creepy & Cute Parts Pack... for all of your creative needsSPORE™ Creepy & Cute Parts Pack adds new parts, colors, and animations to the Creature Creator feature of SPORE™. This is quite an expensive expansion with a twenty dollar price tag, on top of you being required to pay the twenty for SPORE™, even though this is not a DLC, but a standalone game. This game has a total of 84 new creature parts which is 24 parts more than advertised, 48 new colors, 24 new animations, and 2 new testing area backgrounds. New parts:12 heads 12 eyes 12 arms 12 legs12 hands12 feet12 detailsNew Colors:12 completed styles36 partial styles (6 in each coat, detail, and base)New Actions:6 actions in every categoryNew test run area backgrounds:one goodone badA total of 158 extras, so they each cost about 13 cents. There's nothing added to the main core of this game, just the parts, which add some, but not a lot of extra creating time. BUT, the parts are pretty cool and let you finally build those adorable alien rabbits and killer crocodile flying space creatures you've always wanted to build. Get this if it’s on sale, you use creator heavily, or if you absolutely just love the SPORE™ franchise.Anything done in SPORE™ Creepy & Cute Parts Pack will show up in your copy of SPORE™Curator page:http://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/ ",715,131,12,51,75,5,104

												Before reading please note, THIS REVIEW IS OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME. Now that that's out of the way...Okay, here's the deal. I love Spore. Like, a LOT. So, when it went on sale a while back, I decided to re-buy it (I owned the disc version, but lost the code, so I basically didn't own it). DLC was only like, $5, and I played Galactic Adventures (I loved it, but that's a review for ANOTHER day). Honestly, it was hardly worth the $5.So if you don't know, the Creepy & Cute pack adds some new creature parts and patterns, but that's it. The arms and legs are literally all bug parts, so nothing I want to use there, some cool new other bits, though. For patterns, some feel ""Creepy"" like one pattern that looks kind of like muscles, and not so much cute (though it does add a feather pattern, sort of, which is awesome because I love building birds in this game). It doesn't really add too many parts, and quite a few of them feel like they should be part of the game already.The other problem is that it only adds CREATURE parts. No new clothes, no building, no new anything. Also, the new animations are only in the test drive mode. They're cool to watch, but would be even cooler to see in game. Oh, and another thing that bothers me (But isn't a deal breaker by any means) is the fact that because of how the expansions worked pre-steam, Steam tracks my hours while playing Creepy & Cute, but not the actual game, which means I have to play without my extra parts if I want steam trading cards.Overall, don't waste $20 on this expansion. If you have $20 burning a hole in your wallet, and you already own Spore, try out Galactic Adventures. It's pretty awesome, if I do say so myself (owned the Expansion for Disc, so yeah. I plan on getting it on a sale or something).TL;DR: Doesn't really add a whole lot. Not worth $20, though might be worth it if it's on sale.Don't forget, THIS IS REVIEW OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME. I love Spore, man!EDIT: Changed emphasis from ""only"" to ""creatures"" from ""only adds CREATURE parts."" ",50,3,0,9,3,0,1

												Hello there, another review here! This one is going to short and simple. This expansion pack for Spore has very unique and interesting new parts and skin designs. Adding more creativity to the game. Sadly, that is all this expansion has to offer, I do think they could of added more. Considering the price, it's a rip off, do not waste $20 on this.

												This seemed like just a DLC for the original SPORE game, but it seems like this pack is another game in itself. You need the SPORE base content to launch it, but it is counted as it's own game you can launch, and not technically a DLC.The SPORE: Creepy & Cute Parts Pack has a bit of extra content that makes the game creepy & cute, and SPORE franchise fans would enjoy the small but unique addition this pack gives to the game. It's not a whole lot, but it's good in it's own right. I would recommend getting the SPORE: Creepy & Cute Parts Pack on sale when the SPORE games are bundled for a fraction of their regular price. Since the three SPORE games on Steam are so similar to each other, getting the bundled discount when they are on sale is the best way to save your money and get all your money's worth too at the same time.

												I would definately reccomend this expansion, however I find that the price is a little too high for what you get from it. You get a few extra pages of creepy and cute features for your creations but that is it. I would recommend waiting until it goes on sale before buying it. But as a huge SPORE fan I would really recommend this as it adds lots more replayability. On another note, for some odd reason, you can launch the game through this, I don't know why you wouldn't just launch it through SPORE.Anyway, definately recommended!			",132,14,1,7,19,1,13

												Great addition to the core game if you are already a fan and just want more parts to be able to play with to create more unique and bizzare creations.Ive been playing Spore on Disk since it came out and probably have around 300-400 hours of total play time between then and now. Spore is a neat little game, but it does get rather repetitive once you reach the final stage and complete the core quests. But all the early stages are really where the fun and amusement of the game are.With the addition of all the parts and pieces, you really do get a nice run for those of us on the more creative side. I do recommend waiting for a sale though, as this is just a cosmetic pack. It does not alter the in-game play at all otherwise. Also, if you are trying to keep your hours from the core pack, you have to remember that launching this pack does not add time to the core game, but rather to its own slot. And the trading cards are solely for the core game run, not this pack.TL;DR:Nice Addition for Artsy People. Purely Cosmetic. Get It On Sale. Runs Seperate of Core Game (but keeps your data files from saves).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would like to know what this expansion is like, but the parts simply don't appear in the game and neither EA's nor Steam's customer support gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about my support tickets on this matter.After 5 months of no reply from EA's support, I reposted my ticket, and they sent me over to Steam's support. This was 2 months ago, and I got no response for my Steam ticket so far. Customer Service 1/10 for both companies...Update after another 2 months of trying to fix the game without any help from customer support:Steam ended up sending me back to EA support, which remained uncontactable.Following a user guide I finally managed to fix the game. The parts are finally working, yay. Was it worth all the effort? Not really, but oh well, finally I get the value what I paid for.If you can get it hassle-free, go for it. Or wait, for £10, holy♥♥♥♥♥♥nope, get it on a steep sale or in a bundle. The pack literally only contains some extra parts for your creatures.			",53,357,2,100,57,1,89

												Very repetitive after a few play throughs, but still fun. I spent tons of hours in creation mode and I am planning on spending more time in it. Space stage gets annoying because your character is consistantly having to save others from attacks, bio-disasters, and raids. 7/10 is my current score for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spore is spore, its a good game, and whilst people give it♥♥♥♥♥♥for its later stages. The sense of creating something amazing like a single cell, and watch it evolve into your very own 5 footed abomination is immense. There are several stages to the game and they all play very differently, and much like many other people, I hate the last two stages. However, I have to give this game a positive recommdation simply due to how amazing the creature creator, and the early game stages are!This was my fave game when I was 10, and when im feeling down, or frustrated with TF2 or Farcry, I sit down, open this game and destroy ecosystems....I mean create beautiful creatures. Its calming, its fun, but don't play it in large doses or you might get bored of it. This is my inbetween games game, it has been since I was 10, and it will be until I either die, or get a roomate meaning I can no longer embaress myself playing with giant creatures I created that look like the male reproductive organs. Don't let my playtime fool you, I only just got this on the steam summer 2016 sale because I lost my disc version when I wiped my hardrive a month or two ago, in reality i've probably sunk hundreds of hours into this. I love it to death. So do us both a favour and buy this game, get the creepy and cute parts pack too, the extra parts are worth it.			",99,11,0,14,13,2,20

												See my review of Spore (main game) for the full review. Other than that, the Creepy and Cute Parts Pack (C&C going forward) adds over 100 new parts for your creatures, buildings, and vehicles, including your soaceship in the space stage. Is it worth it, though? Well, if you want more variety than the already vast offerings of the original Spore, than this might be for you. In my opinion though, wait until it goes on sale as a bundle with either Spore and C&C, or if you own the original, wait until the dlc goes on sale. As of writing this, Spore and C&C are on sale as a bundle for $30, and the C&C's normal price is $20. In this case it is not worth it in my opinion, wait on a better sale. Don't get me wrong, Spore and C&C are wicked fun, but all this adds is another level of customization, and as previously stated, there is already an incredible amount built into Spore itself.

												This DLC adds several extra parts to the creature creator. That's all it does. The parts on their own are quite nice; each has their own unique traits which fulfills the DLC's name: Creepy and Cute.However, it is horribly overpriced at $20 and obsviously the cost is enough to discourage anyone from buying this DLC. This DLC, which only adds a few, A FEW, extra parts costs as much as most indie games these days. Your money is better spent elsewhere.Get it on a sale, or a bundle. Or else, you'll be spending your money on extra content that you'll probably only use once.Great job EA.			",104,40,2,18,12,2,5

												This is definitely my favourite version of the Spore game.  I did not like Galactic Adventures because of the way it was pasted over the original and did not seem to be the same game.  This is the best version as it allows many more creative variation for those who crave that and at the same time does not affect the original feel of the game, and its immerion, in fact this improves it.

So im going to tell you straight i couldn't go a day without this game in my library or i would die...not really. But still GET THIS GAME NOW it's...impossible to put it into words from me...and it will NOT be updated ever after they left spore for darkspore, they left it where it was and darkspore failed so thats when the spore franchise died in the void...but you can still see the cracks edges and beauty behind the distractions...so please get this game it will change your life for the good...if your not a stubborn brat.

												Should you buy this game?: No.Will you?: Probably.This game's awfulness really must be experienced to understand it. By watching game play or hearing about it, it seems not that bad and overly scorned. I held out against it for 7 years, but finally bought it on sale. The game is just boring. You will be excited each new stage, master the mechanics within 5 minutes, have fun for another 5, and then wonder when the next new thing is coming. A creature can be taken from cell to galaxy within 4-5 hours, and after that there's no point. Every stage has the same 1 or 2 repetitive mechanics, with the creature variation nothing more than aesthetics. The only way to play the game is aggressively, and it doesn't matter if you choose carnivore or herbivore. Diplomacy is slower and less eventful than destroying rivals. Not to mention in the civilization stage you are required to nuke the planet of all other civilizations, including those you were allied with. In the galaxy stage if you are friendly with everyone then nothing happens, and you eventually♥♥♥♥♥♥of an allied race just for something to do.The creature creator is fun, but very limited. I bought the creepy+scary pack and even then felt very skimped. You'll make a few creatures, then get bored. The vehicle and building creators are pointless, as anything you make will have pretty much behave exactly the same there are stats, but they don't matter. The one with the most ships wins. I found myself just making blobs with guns to hurry through it and get to the gameplay.I'm glad I only speny $8 on this game, I can't imagine spending $50+ for only half a days worth of fun. The response in 2008 was well warranted. Truly one of the biggest letdowns in gaming history.			",24,2,0,2,8,1,1

												Really, it's terrible. These parts should have been in the game in the first place, but nooo! EA had to be ♥♥♥♥ing money hogs and have this as an ""expansion"". Because of this waste of money, I uninstalled the base game as well. Also, I wish I could get my money back, but since it's EA, that's an impossibility.			",102,12,1,20,31,0,37

												I don't recommend buying this. There are... only a small amount of parts that are actually cool. I dislike every single other part. I'm talking about the ones you put on your creatures, of course. I just dont like them. theres creepy, and theres... not cute or cool at all, theres weird. I just don't know why anyone would like the other non-creepy parts... they're bad. I'd still use this for the other parts i like (not many at all) since I've now wasted my money on this... But really, don't buy it. I'm only using the creepy & cute parts pack because i now have it. Definitely not worth the 5 dollars. Plus thats it on sale, when its not on sale, its 20 dollars! I dont think its worth it just for 5! This was a complete disappointment.			",35,4,0,1,4,0,1

												EDIT:I do NOT recommend this DLC to anyone with twenty bucks in pocketBut really, I remember buying this DLC 3 times, and 1/3 times, it actually worked.For example, when you try to share anything with a CaC part attatched to it, it will not work, but its really just a random chance weather your going to get it to work or not.Really the only purpose for this DLC is for looking at other peoples creations with this...So remember that, it only worked for me 1/3 of the time			",51,7,0,3,16,1,10

												Worthwhile if you buy this on sale, it adds a couple dozen new parts in all, plus plenty of exoskeleton arms and legs. Nothing gamebreaking or gamebalancing, it just looks different.

												This addition to the main Spore game is fun and addictive, particularly if you use it to create your own characters into a 3D form. While it is not in the same capacity as to something like Sculptris, it still has a charm to it that can suffice for most creations. Keyword: Most, it has served me well in bringing my creations to life and to even help me get a better understanding of how to draw them in different views. While the merging of parts to the body or limbs are not perfect, they are still smooth enough to hardly be noticed. And, if you are a real master to the 3D rendering then you are likely to figure out ways to hide 'blots' or 'stuck-on' appearances. The new animations are entertaining as well and can procure interesting little movies if one is talented in that department as well. Ultimately, if you are not serious in 3D Modeling but are curious in it and want a bit of an open hero type creation game then this is for you.			",5,0,0,2,6,0,2
