												After the failure of JA: Flashback, I came back to Crossfire to assure myself that not all JA after JA:2 were bad.And no, they were not. Crossfire (and it's predecessor) are good games.It maybe takes some time to get used to the new system (space stops time to let you plan your actions), but it works very well all in all.+ Combat is challenging+ a variety of weapons with different ammunition tomake the gun enthusiasts happy+ the graphic is quite okay for the time and the genre- the character portraits are awful, really awful- VoiceOvers are horrible (I could kill Fox over and over for that)I liked it back then and I still like it now, it is a new take on the JA franchise and it is not a bad one.

												I loved JA 1 and 2, so i bought JA:BIA.It grew up on me, ok. Not much like JA, but it's an ok game. But what really made me play the game for over 300 hours was not the difficulty.It was the bugs. An awful lot of them. And i don't mean cockroaches in boxes.Crossfire, is an expansion to that. A whole new lot of bugs, but a lot shorter campaign. And i mean a LOT shorter. I finished it in about half a dozen hours, with everyone hired, and every side quest finished.The rest of the play time was basically restarting missions or even the whole game because of... you guessed it.. bugs...And I didn't even get the bloody achievements, for some reason. From items that don't appear anywhere ( like the ring for two of the side missions ), gunshots that go through solid rock walls, guys that can head-shot my mercs from across the map , and my all time favourite: when telling my mercs to team up somewhere while crawlinga dn guard there, they decide to just keep on doing the horizontal mambo with each other. ""that's my spot"", ""no that's mine"".... Eternally. well, at least until they all get shot.Without all the bugs... it's still a really short game. A lot shorter than original jagged alliance: BIA.If they could only fix this, and make it decent in linux...			",318,81,29,49,37,2,96

												Next BitComposer game on the same engine they used in the Back In Action. You can check my review on it there (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/57740), if you are wondering how Back in Action connect with the previous titles, especially with the most praised and decorated Jagged Alliance 2.JA Crossfire is not taking us to Arulco. New country, now somewhere in Africa, but the drill remains the same – you are a leader of a mercs group, and you were hired to win a little domestic war, bring peace to the land… Well, but the sounding remained the same as well. For instance, if you hire a merc, he's saying something like ""see you in Arulco"". The devs certainly not overpaid for transferring parts of Jagged Alliance 2 into their games!The map of Arulco in the JA Back in Action was smaller than in the original. The map in JA Crossfire is only half of that we had in the JA BiA… Now you may finish the game on the 2-3 day of the game time, with all towns conquered (reads “liberated” in the western military slang).If you take that game as an add-on to Back in Action, in the bundle with “shades of red” and “point blank” DLCs, and with the price under 10 euros (75% discount) – only then it may count as somewhat fair deal. It is a new campaign, alright! Not the JA 3, but a new approach, so long-time-awaited! Still, I set the thumbs down, even agreeing that it’s a decent short game in the rather rare genre. What makes me so upset? Well, the bugs, of course! The moment when developers fix achievements (40% unobtainable now) and make quests in the game just a slightly more logically connected and polished – if that moment will ever comes, I’ll rewrite my review into praising one.Now, I just can say it is playable, but you don’t need to pay for this beta-release. Arrgh, hate those half-baked-offcuts on Steam, pretending, that they are complete games!Mark 5.5/10			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												If you enjoyed ""Back in action"" you'll enjoy this more. if you thought back in action had afew too many problems, this is basically the same game but with alot of the issues patched. i also reccomend starting with only blood as your squad, he honestly works best alone and if you will level quickly like that, this should give you an easier start if you know how to sneak (The pistol isnt too loud even unsilenced, and you can ambush the enemies. just dont aim for the head, just the torso.) if you do that, the start should be fairly easy and you should be able to enjoy the game. if you go for a large squad of rookies that dont know what they're doing, you will find yourself screaming at the screen as your 5 guys get killed by one enemy, and the game will seem horribly unbalanced. so really, how you experience the game determines on who you start out with. blood was personally my top merc in BIA and crossfire, if you leave him as a solo squad, he is very versitile and levels quickly, and you can cap towns with him while hiring more mercs for permanent defense duty. after you do that, the game should go fairly well, once you figure out the mechanics. its a hard game to learn at first, think of it as the chess of the virtual world, easy to lose and misunderstand at first, but you love it and get better every hour you put into it. also, dont be afraid to restart the game, how you start determines your entire run, and losing a merc if you use a solo merc as your main rather than a full squad can be game-ending. that said, its a very under-rated game that can bring alot of fun to a patient man, and alot of pain to the players of modernday generic shooters. if you dont maind waiting an enemy out for afew minutes, this will be fine. if you're too impatient and need constant action, id suggest you pass on the whole JA series.

												Forewarning: this game has been abandoned by the developer, who is no longer in business.I bought it anyway because I thought it would be a decent expansion to Back in Action (BIA). Unfortunately it isn't. For the most part, the engine is the same, gameplay is more or less the same, but there are a few differences. Here's a list of points that I think are worth mentioning:1. The map is much smaller. In terms of sectors, it's maybe half or less than half of the sectors in BIA. 2. There are a few more mercs. The rival group M.E.R.C. merged with A.I.M. so there you get to choose from a few more but this doesn't really add much to the game. Although initially, you are so broke that some of the cheaper MERC soldiers can be useful. 3. Don't expect much, weapons-wise. 4. Money is hard to come by, early in the game. I had to take several sectors with just 2 mercs in my squad. As long as you have at least one medic and several first aid packs, you can heal after (or during) the battle.5. Travel everywhere is still on foot. This is so damned annoying, you just can't imagine. What I love about JA was the ability to move around by various means, not just by walking (which is stupid, not to mention slow). 6. There's often only one way to do things. e.g. if you have mines in front of you, you have to trigger them or defuse them, you can't blow them up (again, kind of stupid).7. My biggest peeve is, after you kill the head villain and take all the sectors, they make you start all over again (if you trigger the final quest) when ""reinforcements"" retake the harbor. SERIOUSLY?! And because you're halfway across the country, these reinforcements overrun several sectors before you can get into position -- meaning you have to plod through those sectors and re-take them ALL OVER AGAIN. Now this is just not how games or expansions should be designed. If you want breadth and depth, you make it a decent (larger) campaign with perhaps more side quests instead of getting the player to REPEAT what they've already done, just to increase replayability. That's just downright lazy.If you still don't mind all of this, I'd strongly suggest waiting till this game is dirt cheap before even thinking of buying it (think $2-$3). To me, Crossfire is a disappointing end to a lukewarm attempt at trying to recreate what was an outstanding game and franchise, Jagged Alliance.4.5/10			",11,11,1,22,8,0,17

												What the hell is Jagged Alliance: Crossfire?Well, it's a turn based action, tactical game, similar to Commandos, Desperados, X-Com Series.... Once more you are in control of a Mercenary Organisation Killers for Hire :D, select your mercs carefully amongst many available to you, some will work well together others dispite each other so pick them accordingly. You mission (Campaign) if you accept it, is to liberate a country (somewhere in the Middle East) from a tyranic Warlord (terrorist, dictator, a threat to freedom...bla bla bla ), the country is divided into small regions which you have to free successively in order to gain access to the next region. Once liberated, the region will provide you with a monthly income to help you in your war effort...nothing is free...even freedom. You can then hire the local mob to protect the freshly liberated region, equiping them with guns, armors and training so they can eventualy repel attacks from the Warlord, in an attempt to recapture it.The concept looks interesting, but the implementations is terrible, game interface not intuitive at all, jerky characters, clunky movements, irresponsive commands (death guaranty during gunfights), dodgy enemy AI they see you coming from miles away even when you don't make any noises, some characters skills have apparently have absolutly no effects, enemies shoot at you from crazy angles in which you can't shoot back and many other annoying things like no way to accelerate time if not in World Map, team lose postions when you tab out of world map, 100 reloads because the game decided to save at stupid time, usualy just before i get crippled with enemy bullets.I finished the Game in over 30 hours, completing 90% of the side quests too short and too much frustrations to ever play it again. Shame really cose i kinda liked the concept.The game could have been so much better if devs have taken more care, no patch to fix many bugs.Also many achievements don't work.Overall, if you have Jagged Alliance 2 then stick with it, because JA crossfire isn't worth your time.

												I loved Jagged Alliance: Back in Action (as I did the old Jagged Alliance 2). The key is that you should not compare JA:BiA and JA:C to JA2 at all.The game is challenging. I played it at the highest difficulty with tactical mode on. I tend to save a lot (and reload a lot :P). Some people found the game extremely hard. Knowing what you do and frequent (separate) saves help this. Or you can play normal mode with tactical turned off.The game indeed has some flows (sometimes path findings is clunky or obstacles in your line of fire can be very disturbing), but all-in-all the game experience for me is great.If you like tactical games, and you're not afraid of a challenge this game is for you. Be warned, you better play JA:BiA first to learn the game mechanics (though it has /the same/ tutorial), as I really think this game is harder than the original one. For me it was a welcomed plus. :)There are new maps, new mercenaries (others have changes stats), new weapons (other weapons are missing). Now all the mercs are willing to work for you when the game starts, which is also a nice twist. People are complaining that they don't get some achievements. I am afraid that this is true, as I've checked, and I don't have the ""Bloody Snow"" achievement, though I've retrieved the suitcase full of money (about $40k) Others have been awarded. It is a bit sad as many of the achievements are linked with completion of quests. It would be really just notifying Steam about the achievement completion at the same time as they register the quest competed (which they do all right).Oh, and if you can get the game in a bundle, then don't miss out on it!

												First thing which get me into Jagged Alliance series when I tried it, and it was Jagged Alliance 2, was voice acting (Steroid - obvious inspiration and mocking of Arnold Schwartzenegger and roid guys, big, strong, stupid, you know), Dr. Q (stereotypical accent and B movie wise Chinese with proverbs), Ivan (stereotypical Russian accent, Communist, Steroid don't like Communists), Meltdown (remember George Constanza's bad date from Seinfeld or Howard's mom from TBBT?), Grizzly, Barry (stereotypical German accent), Fox (seductive voice), Grunty (look Barry, but funny) to name a few) which was incredible (example for anyone how should be done voice-over), beside somewhat complex gameplay (game is hard even on easy difficulty, at least for me), humourous, SF B-movie grade story to choose if you want it,  RPGish elements and interactions between different NPCs, immersive, it's like tactical Fallout 1 and 2.Sir-Tech knew their stuff.When I stumbled upon affordable box (about 13€ cheaper than on Steam) in store of JA ""remake"" or ""reboot"" of series, I was excited to see one of my favourite games with renewed graphics, how naive from me, because I was shocked by sterile, terrible voice acting, not to mention all those known mercenaries from previous series with lousy voice over. Yes, I read some reviews, looked up some gameplay, but it was more like skimming than detailed examination.This is a good game in its own right but it does not deserve carrying a name of legendary Jagged Alliance series.Jagged Alliance died with ""Unfinished Business"".I could recommend this game but not for fans of Jagged Alliance series made by Sir-Tech, if they expect gameplay and other little and subtle things mentioned above, which made those series classic and legendary.

												Jagged Alliance features a broken interface and that was enough to get me to stop playing. Good luck trying to figure out where you're being fired at from, good luck trying to figure out if all of your troops are doing as they're told (hint: they often don't and have no sense of self-preservation.) and good luck feeling immersed. Rarely have I seen an AI this unbelievably stupid, for some reason the AI does not seem to think it a priority to help out other AI when you're systematically murdering the lot. On top of that, the game drops you smack-down in the middle of a combat zone without you having a single clue as to what is going on. And why on earth can I not climb up buildings? I am fairly certain I was able to in Jagged Alliance 2.The whole experience just feels stunted. ",218,36,2,41,25,1,75

												Almost 130 hours spent on two back-to-back playthroughs says everything you need to know about this brilliant, maddening, flawed gem of a game.There is a trick to enjoying Crossfire. And that is trying very hard not to grumble throughout like some crazed octogenarian that ""it isn't Jagged Alliance 2"". Judge this game on its own merits. Try hypnosis, try alcohol, try beating yourself about the head, try anything to forget JA2 ever existed.Jagged Alliance 2? Never heard of it. There.The key combat mechanic - pausing the real time action to issue detailed orders - is spellbinding fun.Sure, the camera angles can be a pain, inventory management is clunky, and the cheating psychopath that passes for AI will produce regular howls of outrage.But none of this matters when you get to choreograph righteous carnage down to tenths of a second.Reminds me a bit of another game I liked...can't remember the name...

												An old one I had sitting in my library. Not the greatest of the Jagged Alliance series. Completed it back in 2012. Thought I'd go back and finish off the achievements. Ba Bow!The achievements are broken, whatever happened between now and 2012 has now made all the achievements, unachievable.From some of the forums I've found there are supposedly 9 that don't work, but I have found that none are now working.Also to note, in the game play you can zoom in and out but can't pan around. A total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if some goodies are under a walkway. You can see them but can't get them.Serve myself right I guess for going back on an achievement hunt.Although I didn't mind this game, I'm going to give it the thumbs down for the two reasons above.

												I could have looked past so many flaws in this game, even the terrible pathing problems (which are a big deal considering the plan and go combat system ) I really tried to like it, to justify spending actual money on it. No dice, uninstalled. The  game forces you into micromanaging every move, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, until you realize they've given you the ABSOLUTE WORST, MOST UNRESPONSIVE USER INTERFACE KNOWN TO MAN. If you tell me a right click will move my merc, I shouldn't have to click ten times to issue a command. If spacebar pauses, it should pause all, not most, of the time.

												Edit: I think I should mention that: I never finished the game. At the point, where my savegame was stuck on a map where the bots would insta snipe my mercs through walls, I knew I was doomed. It was a bug that would not go away, no matter how often I re-load up the game again. And my last save was like hours ago. So, that bug did not break the game for me, it ended it for me.This game ... where should I start? I would love to recommend it, because under the flawed, bugged, miserable game lies a decent strategy game that can be really great to play. I had great moments in my 13 hours of game time. Its a great feeling to plan every details of your assault and then watch it happen and - if you are lucky - succeed.But the bright side was just a small part of the game. The major part was frustration, reloading maps and correcting where the A.I. reaches its limits. There are so many downsides to this game that I decided to let it rest. I could overcome the missing merc creation feature. I could overcome the missing depth in the mercs characters. I could overcome the annoying UI. BUT I am sick of reloading a map that I cannot win, due to the fact that the enemy is simply broken. While I need to hit an enemy a dozen times, they tend to one-shot my mercs. They shoot my mercs through massive walls, cars, objects of your choice. They see my mercs through objects.. They shoot mercs they cannot see. One enemy killed my merc by hitting him with his riflestock through a wall. My mercs get killed because they cannot find a way to avoid colliding. If they collide during a firefight, they are goners. They will not find new waypoints to break free. Training milita is annoying, because all you can do is give them weapons you find. The list of flaws feels endless.Its annoying, nearly every part of this game is broken and annoying. Its like playing versus a bunch of hackers, while your mouse is broken and only half of your keys work. And then, beneath this pile of bugs, cheats, flaws, crap, lies a game that could have been awesome. A gorgeous little gem, massively covered in dirt.			",290,100,5,79,60,0,68

												When I saw this on sale I went crazy and had to buy it. Since playing the early versions of jagged alliance I remember many hours of fun and enjoyment. I was similar at first with this game but the game is really really hard to beat. Its not simple and your opponents seem to somehow be much faster or better than you despite the fact you bought the most expensive weapons and armour. And even the best mercs tend to be almost impossible to hire early or middle of the game. I eventually had to forget about it since I was literally stuck and either that or start over. However, after awhile I went online and found out how to actually play this game. I then proceeded to replay the game and I actually started to make money and advance. The key is to use the pause and to direct fire to the enemies torso. Also is the importance of your characters stance. I finnally beat the game and was quite impressed. Also, I realized that there is a previous game to this one called ""back in action"" which I need to play.			",67,16,0,52,8,0,48

												One of my favourite Strategy, Shooter games!!!I have spent many hours on Jagged Alliance Back in Action and Jagged Alliance Crossfire simply because they have the same engine, interface and are pretty much the same graphics. Crossfire is a standalone expansion that I have had a lot of issues with the main one being that when I leave the game (Alt and Tab or just going to the desktop using Windows Key and D) to do something and then go back to the game the screen is black and only the Cursor is showing.This problem is causing me to lose progress and take me away from the immersion of the game which is not very nice when your deep in a Strategy game trying to think of tactics to turn the battle in your favor.KIMBOF1's Score = 4/5Great game but could do with some bugs fixing !!

												Maybe Unfortunately one of the best RPG's of its kind that can be played with windows 7. Definately the best Jagged Alliance that, once again can be played with windows 7 and once again 'sadly'. Tactics are farely simple but more advanced than most, one stratergy pretty well wins the game. Besides that quite fun, and dissapointing the game creaters never made one better.

												First I'd like to state that I'm not very familiar with the orginal JA series. My experiance JA started with Back In Action and as I understand it, it differs from the originals greatly. That being said, I really did enjoy Back in Action. JA: Crossfire plays exactly the same as the Back in Action era. It's all about taking over strategic points one at a time, managing resource, hiring militia and etc. There is a fair amount of bugginess to the game such as character response or shots that just don't make sense, but nothing that truely renders the game unplayable. At the time of this review I'm 30+ hours in and I got to say I've enjoyed it. I can't say I think the replay value is high, but it's personally not a game I'll forget about once I'm done with it. The biggest issues for me is the price and broken achivements. If you're thinking of playing this, pick it up on sale. The current 20 dollar price tag just isn't worth it. It's a fun game, but I'd only be willing to drop 5-8 bucks on it. The achievements being broken isn't a super big deal to me, but may be the deal breaker for many. I've had one or two unlocked so far, when I should have had far more by now. I've read that some others have had this problem as well.So overall, great game if you're into the newer JA series, but be prepared for some bugs here and there.			",511,106,11,72,14,3,65

												First of all, let me say that I am a huge fan of the serie, back to JA1.What the developers did for JA:BA and JA:Crossfire is amazing, the engine and the basis for the gamepla are outstanding. There is a lot of depth in these games, a big variety of weapons and each weapon has its utility. It's up to you to see how you are going to organize yourself.Gameplay is AMAZING for people who like planning and are getting frustrated by the turn-based combat system of X-Com for example.The only problem I see is that apart from gameplay, there are not a lot of things. No character development, not a good narration, the lack of character creation (which is not a ""big matter"" to me but still.).I kinda regret the lack of depth in the scenario. The game is there, it's fun, but...you kinda more or less do :""let's push everything on the map, kill everyone and win"".I wish there were some choices to make, more personnality in your team. Anyway, I enjoyed my time on this one. It's worth its price yet I would recommend to wait a sales :).			",242,92,1,52,49,2,64

												Formally JA Crossfire is a stand alone game, but in real it is a kind of a DLC to JA Back in Action. You have a new story and a few added mercs on ten new maps.As a single game it is not worth buying it, but as part in the JA complete edition or at sales action it's ok.JA Crossfire uses the same engine like JA Back in Action.Not only it has the well known flaws from JA Back in Action, it's even worse. After problems with the achievements, the devs disabled them for all (but they don't mention it in the shop).The developers stopped the support, but there are good mods from fans to improve the game.My Guide:
