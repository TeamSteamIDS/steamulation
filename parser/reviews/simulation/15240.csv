												Silent hunter 4 is a truly epic simulation game. You can make things as realistic or as arcady as you want, with extensive options for just about every aspect you could imagine. If you have ever wanted to get into a sub sim, man this is a great place to start. Silent hunter 4 is not that difficult to learn, and if you want to get into it quickly just go look up some game play videos online. I learnt the arcade and pro controls in just a few days, and after that I want and learnt the basics of how to use the in game editor. And that is probably my favorite part of Silent hunter 4, the editor. Included in SH4 is one of the best editors I have ever had the pleasure of using. I have no understanding of programming what so ever so I really dive into titles with comprehensive editing tools. With just a little research you can create your own missions and patrols for SH4, adding a nearly infinite replay value. And the amazing thing is the editor does not just feature the pacific, it feature a global map! Why they did this I have no idea, but its freaking awesome! So I can make missions in Hudson's bay or off the coast of Newfoundland if I want to. Its just pure awesome. Anyways, if you have ever wanted to experiment with a sub sim, this is your game. Its fun, challenging, and offers up a lot of replayability. I am amazed they packaged so much stuff in one game.			",124,15,1,15,30,2,39

												A must for people who enjoyed Silent Hunter 4. This opens up the game to a rarely touched on theatre of operations from the Second World war; a huge plus. It's nice to see that such a popular setting is getting away from Normandy and Stalingrad, which have been played to death.On the downside, the crews speak distinctly American English. You couldn't get some german voice actors to do the work, guys? That's a bit lazy. HUGE CAVEAT: DO NOT INSTALL THIS IF YOU INTEND TO PLAY SILENT HUNTER: WOLVES OF THE PACIFIC WHILE IT IS DOWNLOADING. THE EXPANSION DELETES PREVIOUS EXE FILES AND CREATES NEW ONES IN UNIFIED INSTALL			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												First, let me say this is NOT a first person shooter. This is a detailed, ""all the widgets are under your control"" submarine simulation. The learning curve on this game can be prohibitively steep but there are some great tutorials and let's play videos on you-tube that can get you up and running. The game is actively supported by the folks over at subsim.com and there are more MODS than you'll ever need. The game can be manageable but enjoyable if you go for auto-targeting but the manual targeting option is a bit daunting.  I wish that it were more granular. For instance, I could see separating the task of ship recognition from the trigonometry of torpedo aiming. One word of warning... even at its most difficult setting (called 100% realism in the game) it's NOT really challenging enough for many serious submariners. There are a number of mods that make it tougher.			",5,0,0,8,22,0,18

Product received for free
												A very good submarine sim, you can play german and american uboats(both in pacific). You can also download mods from subsim to play Ships and also update with new sounds,skins and textures for a better immersion/experience. If you want to recreate a battle of Atlantic/Midway and so on, you can jump into the sh4 editor and do so, tutorials on the editor can be found on the channler (DangerDeadpan) as he explains the editor very good. (He also did the american campaign if you want to se a bit of gameplay before buying this game.			",33,1,0,0,4,0,3

												This is the best in the Silent Hunter series! The lack of German voices is a problem that can be solved easily. Use this link to get the patches http://patches.ubi.com/silent_hunter_4/ and you are set to go! I played this almost 10 years ago when it was released and I still play it. SH5 is not as good.Update: If the sound files do not work from the above then you can work around it bij simply buy SH3, go to the sound folder: Steam\steamapps\common\Silent Hunter 3\data\Sound\Speech and copy al nine folders in the same destination folder of SH4. Delete the nine folders in SH4 speech to make sure that nothing stays behind before copying SH3 speech files. Then you have your German speaking U-boat crew!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Patience is a virtue! Hunting the convoys, positioning your U-boat for an optimum firing position. Laying in wait before unleashing hell on the unsuspecting enemy. An epic game which requires practice to master. Definitely recommended.			",2,0,0,0,2,0,5

												I think this is my favorite entry in the silent hunter series. You should sample them however, and find out where on the scale of realistic simulator and arcadey strategy torpedo blaster you prefer. Earlier in the series is more realistic/historical/sim, later in the series is more streamlined gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do LOVE it, but I'd also like to have the Japanese career and the British career as well, and for Germany I'd like some missions to do, like Americans have got it. Speaking of it, it has a fantastic gameplay mechanic, and the torpedoes, they are awesome! My current favorite class of subs is the Tambor/Gar-class. I as well am editing this review after I reinstalled this, and I haven't played this for MONTHS. I really would like some new freighters and battleships, e.g. Queen Elizabeth-class, Nelson-class, Revenge or Royal Soverign-class, etc.			",2,4,1,0,15,0,0
