												Garry's mod is one of the best sandbox/community driven games on PC and possible in Gaming.If you are going to buy this, you should buy CS:S with it since many game modes use those textures in it.Sandbox mode is nice, you can do many things in that but many people also love to play on game modes, I would recommend TTT as a nice game mode if you find a good server but the sky is the limit in Gmod gamemodes(actaully it is the engine but eh).There are so many things to be said about this game and this review would go on for pages if you were to explain every single custom gamemode that is on garry's mod and you will get you 10/5/2.5 euro or whatever the price is out of it since there is constantly new content developed on servers.A great game with a good community if you know where to look.

												Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.""Where do I start?"" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm..._The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more._Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore._Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds._Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want._My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 7/10Story: N/ASound: 8/10Replayability: 10/10Overall 8.5Even though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy...

												I teach high school physics. I feel this activity would be incredibly good for my students and will be recommending it to all of them in class tomorrow. The way the ""Physics"" (HA!) gun moves stuff around allows me to teach average velocity/ acceleration due to gravity as things are dropped on the map. Well worth the money out of my teaching budget. Highly recommend for all teachers who don't believe in teaching through the textbook. That's right. The building exceeds wind speed! Hooray....for...Garry's Mod!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garry's mod...Aah, what can we say about this little gem? This beautiful not-really-a-game-game gives you some of the most open Sandbox software ever. Not only does it give you the power to change physics and spawn gazillion NPCs at the same time, it has spawned a few of the most brilliant gamemodes, such as Trouble In Terrorist Town (TTT) and Prop Hunt. Both are absolutely hilarious, these fairly small items already make it an EPIC piece of software. Then there's Sledding, Gmod Tower and countless others that make it even more amazing. G'mod's a gem, don't even hesitate to get this one!			",193,41,7,32,38,3,34

												Despite its release date, this is still one of the best games out there, where only your imagination is the limit to what you can do.The base game is sandbox with Half-Life 2 weapons and it supports models from most Source engine games such as Counterstrike Source, Team Fortress 2 and Left for Dead 2.New features aswell as modifying exisiting ones can be done through modding, and the language used in the mods is lua, which is very easy to pick up on and learn.

												What can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with it's own workshop and fanbase? Well, for starters. this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors, you want to blow things up? Go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it. Want to watch youtube videos in a theatre? Go to a Gmod theatre server. Want to live a life in a game? Go to a RP server. Want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits? Go to a dayz server or another end-of-the-world server. Want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent? Or be said traitor? Find a TTT server. My point is, you want something? there's probably a mod for that. If you have a friend that can play with you on a LAN server or just a private server, get creative in sandbox. you could make something, you could create scenarios, you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots, or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards. The choice is yours!Overall, this game gets an 8 out of ten from meThe mod is the limit in this game, but unless you have friends. The servers can be hostile. (especially the TTT and DarkRP servers, you can get pretty paranoid in TTT )And singleplayer is only so much fun, you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer.I'm a bit on the un-creative side so give the game a try yourself, just make sure to bring a friend.

												One day I bought this because it was on sale for about $2.50. I didn't think much of it but then I started playing. I couldn't believe how addicting it was. I started losing sleep and skipping meals. It started to show on my physical health. My family started bugging me about it and even considered putting me into a rehabilitation center. Let's just say they won't be bugging me anymore. But now I dont have the funds to maintain an internet connection. I've sold everything I have just to play. I can't even go to starbucks and use their wifi because I sold my clothes and apparently they dont accept nudity. So basically I'm writing this review from my phone on top of a bridge. My life isn't worth it without this game. Yet it seems to have ruined my life. Goodbye world. **10/10 buy** Great gift for kids!(EDIT March 29, 2014)Your comments make me lol. I might as well make a legit review.Yes I bought this game for only $2.50 but if you ask me, It is so much more worth it. It may not be the most graphical intensive game but I've never had so much fun. It is packed with hundreds of hours of pure laughter and randomness. You never know what you will find in this game. Keep this in mind though, this is a MOD and it is mostly just community made content so it may have it's bugs. But what game doesn't? Only thing I can complain about is the ability of making a joinable server. I never could make one. Oh well, I reccomend this game to anyone and everyone. A true **10/10** game.P.S. you should probably buy CS:S (Counter Strike: Source) while you're at it. Many of the servers require it. Have fun! Build responsibly.			",93,15,10,8,9,2,12

												In all of my grand stupor, I realized I have continually overlooked something without so much as a passing notice: I have never once added this game to any of my favorite games lists.  I'm honestly not sure why I haven't; As of the date of this review, I've put in over one-thousand hours on this account, and over four times as much on my old account (that account weighs in at roughly 4500 hours thusfar).  Maybe it's the fact that, for whatever reason, I've never really thought of it as a game in its own right.  I put countless hours into it in Garry's Mod 9 when it truly still was a modification and purchased Garry's Mod on release on my old account.  I've met so many people through this ""game""; I could go so far as to say my life would be incredibly different if it wasn't for my countless hours in this.  I've drifted from community to community, spending literal years of my life among different cultures in what amounts to an open book full of tools for a game I've barely clocked even a few hundred hours in at most.  My friends, almost all of them, can be attributed, directly or indirectly, to me playing this ""game"".  My current and past relationships all were a result from me meeting people or spending time in communities that I had come across while playing this ""game"".  My past insecurities, my current strengths, and my place in life can almost all have their roots traced back to me browsing the internet and finding the comic ""Concerned"" and picking up the modification used to make that comic.  So, what prevents me from calling this a ""game""?  Why is it that, for all of what this creation has offered me, can I still not think of this as a ""game""?  Perhaps it is the fact that it truly was never really a game to me.  It was a blank slate; it was a whiteboard on which I myself and many others could express themselves creatively and make whatever they could dream of, engine limits notwithstanding.  This, this ""game"", this modification, this thing has been such a life-altering experience for me.  While this may sound ridiculous and childish for most people, I can't express how much gratitude I have for this stupid little free-turned-$10 mod to exist.  It gave me better insight into how some things are constructed, it encouraged me to learn how to code and how to script, it started me on the road to server management and website administration, and most of all, it helped fill the void for the years I spent as a teenager upset with my life and brought me some of the closest friends I will ever have.  I love this mod, I love this ""game"", and I love this stupid simple little broken mess that I still find myself playing for countless hours day after day.  In hindsight, I feel as if I was right about never calling it a game and never listing it on my favorite games list, because for the longest time, it was not a game to me; it was the only thing that kept me going.

												One of the best games I have ever played. I bought it on a whim, years ago, so I could try my hand at building things. That purchase is the best I have made. After 2.5k hours, I can say you will not get bored of this game. Not only do you have the base gamemode of sandbox, allowing you to spawn NPCS, build, and do pretty much anything you want, you also have tons of multiplayer servers and workshop addons to choose from.Feel like playing a World War 2 Role Playing game? Gmod has a server running it.Want to be a clone trooper in the Star Wars universe, and earn ranks and combat ability? Gmod has a server running it.Perhaps you want to play a RTS? Maybe a murder mystery game? Hide and seek? Racing? Yup, Gmod has it all.Gmod is thousands of games for the price of one, and it is worth it 100%Trust me, you will NOT get bored of this game.

So really, you can not even call this creature the game, because it does not have any plot. Actually, this sandbox giving people great opportunities, and it is the players that make the Gmod playable and want to play it.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

 Garrys Mod	The most enjoyable and mod filled game on steam, Garrys Mod. Garrys Mod is an amazing game with a good amount of gamemodes and lovely servers. You may want to play Sandbox and smack around batman or play TTT and rage because you were rdmed. Gameplay 	 Garrys mod does not have a specific type of gameplay ranging from Prop Hunt to Stop It Slender. However your gameplay can be significantly improved by using the steam workshop and adding items. Mods 	Garrys mod is a game focused upon the premise of random and fun addons. I personally enjoy being a watermelon and firing pizzas from a bazooka. Garrys mod has an amazing amount of mods including characters and items. This is a game focused around its modding community. TTT (Trouble In Terrorist Town)	TTT is the most famous gamemode in Garrys Mod. The premise of the game is simple. At the begining you are assigned a role, you are either an innocent bystander, a detective, or a traitor. However do not worry if you are innocent for this is trouble in terrorist town meaning everybody had guns. The innocent and the detectives try to find out who the traitors are while the traitors try to kill them all off. The gamemode is fun and server usually will have cool player models or gun. The main downside with TTT is rdmer's. RDM stand for Random Death Match and an rdmer is someone who out of the blue will try to kill you. This means an inno/detective randomly kills an inno/detective or a traitor kills an traitor or an inno just randomly kills someone who is a T. This really spoil's the gamemode making it unenjoyable at times but usually admins or mods will be on to help you or they will have an option to directly report it to kick/ban the person.  Sandbox 	Sandbox is where creativity and stupidity flourish. Sandbox is where you can get all your downloaded mods and just have fun. Sandbox is just fooling around and having fun. It is one of Garrys Mod most hilarious game modes (if you play with the right people). Singleplayer/Muliplayer	So if your planning on playing Sandbox I would recommend playing singleplayer or creating a hamachi or another program to play with a select group of friends,If you plan to play other gamemodes I suggest playing multiplayer and trying to find a nice server which you can enjoy. Rating	 Pros	+ fun alone or with friends+ many gamemodes to enjoy+ massive amount of creative and fun mods+ overall great community+ highly enjoyable  Cons	- rdmers- will end up overloading computer with mods Final Thoughts	Garrys Mod is a must buy with its countless possibilities. It may take you a while to find a nice server or the gamemode that is for you but when you find it good times will be waiting. The mods are just so amazing that I salute all the mod makers for their effort and allowing me to become a watermelon with a portal gun.			",150,25,2,25,27,2,12

												A game with a almost infinite lifetime, thanks to addons. The perfect exemple of a ""sandbox"" game, the only limit is your imagination. More than that, Garry's mod (or Gmod for intimates) is a game that hosts games named ""gamemodes"" (wich adds fun).One inconvenience : models and textures. Those from Counter-strike: Source are indispensable.Except this disadvantage, I strongly recommend this game. Its price is low for what the game can gives you.			",52,2,0,1,1,0,2

												After hundreds of hours (and screenshots) in GMod, I think it's time I gave this a more proper review. This is a sandbox game in which anything goes. Want to make a vehicle covered in guns? You can do that. Want to make a goofy screenshot (or screenshots)? You can do that. Want to mow down scientists with an AK-47? You can do that. Want to use hundreds of add-ons that add lots of weapons, ragdolls, tools, etc.? You can do that. Want to sit down and watch a YouTube video in a movie theater (with the right maps and add-ons)? You can do that. Want to pose Kevin Spacey? You can do that. Want to play on a roleplay server and get banned for killing people? You can do that. Want to go to the forums and see a lot of people complaining about FNAF? You could do that... but I would avoid that.Bottom line: If you want a game where you can just do whatever you want, this is the game for you.			",666,79,28,52,37,0,71

												Used to love this game.+Extremely large amount of gamemodes and servers to play.+Huge amount of things to do.+Large variety of ways to build.+Workshop support.-Community is toxic.-Majority of the decent servers are down.-Roleplay is next to non existant at this point.-Most servers are full of corruption and you will be banned for simply annoying an admin.-Requires other games for you to see the textures on most servers.-I feel the need to say it again: The community is extremely toxic.

												Garrys Mod.The game where you can literally play a game within in a game while playing that game while playing on a game.Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT)TTT is a roleplay-based game where you are either the Innocent, Detective or Traitor:Traitors must find weapons around the map, sneakily take down detectives and innocents and win the game for the Traitors. If a traitor is found out, all players may call a ""KOS"" on that person. They have a bar they can open up by pressing ""B"" which allows them to buy special Traitor weapons using ""Traitor points"" they earn by killing people. If a traitor is killed and still has traitor points on them, another traitor, or detective, may come along and take those points, helping them along the way. If a Traitor is found using a weapon only Traitors can use, they would get killed, unless they get killed themselves. Traitors also have a special chat where they can discuss things that they could do to win over the game.Innocents are completely useless unless they know who is a Traitor, or have made it into the Traitor room by mistake. They must walk around like dorks and be cautious of everyone and everybody except the Detective, who they will then follow for the next ten minutes trying to survive with. They do not have a special chat and do not have a special bar to talk to Innocents to, because they don't know who is an Innocent themselves.Detectives have amazing abilities, depending on what the server allows. They can scan bodies and collect data on people who have recently killed them using the DNA. They also have their own bar to buy special weapons. Innocents will often follow them, but the Detectives could think of them as Traitors trying to knife them or shoot them quickly to death.Prop HuntProp Hunt is perhaps the funniest gamemode out there in my opinion. The game itself is pretty intense as a prop and if you're trying to find the props, then good luck.Props:Being a prop in Prop Hunt means you need to turn into something either out in the open and not look suspicious at all, or something really really small behind the bathroom stall, like a can or a doll. When you start out, you need to find a good hiding spot, all while not knocking over props, giving away your position.Hunters:Being a hunter and trying to find some ♥♥♥♥ing veteran prop is pretty hard. Most people as props would hide as a doll or can and hide in a bush until somebody sees their red name and nuke them. Hunters are the people who, obviously, hunt the props down and kill them with unique weapons and possibly PTW donator weapons.Hide and Seek: Hide and Seek is a pretty fun gamemode if you have mates to play with, that actually enjoy the gameplay. Hiding in a plant as a small character or crouching behind walls are the most fun in my opinion, especially when you can taunt your friends by dancing while everybody is spectating you and theres one hunter looking around going, ""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? WHERE IS HE?"" and everyone's just laughing. It's a fun gamemode, but you can only get so much enjoyment out of it. You start as a hunter or a hider and you need to either hunt the hider down or hide from the seeker using special abilities that may have been given to you, like the Decoy, Sudoku or Energy Bomb, for example.Sandbox:Aah, classic Sandbox. Not a worry in the world. You can spawn in your world, throw a nuke down and enjoy the nice weather. You can spawn NPCs to kill you, build a house, work with some mechanical♥♥♥♥♥♥ kill your mates in the wild on a singleplayer world, make your own RP, write a review while listening to the music you just downloaded as an addon, or just ♥♥♥♥ around in general. Sandbox is probably the most chill and lay back mode that stands out from the rest as it gives the player some imagination and freedom, unlike the others where you have to RP as a: Pirate, Slave, Police Officer, Medieval Knight, Star Wars Clone, Jedi, Drug Addict, Child, Woody, Chuck Norris, BooBoo Fett (I'm Boba's Cousin!), Shrek, Shrek 2, Shrek the Musical, Cohtch Taylor, Skim Dilk, Melba Toast, B00B-5, Macaroni ♥♥♥♥club?, Volvar Smeggum, Pikachu, FLOOOOPS, Vimpy Fanto and finally, Darth Vader. Darth Vader. Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me? Your name is actually DARTH. ♥♥♥♥ING. VADER!?Dark RP:I left this one for the last because people would probably most likely want to see my thoughts on this one most of all. Dark RP is a roleplaying type system, which is the most popular gamemode on Garrys Mod, in which you must either sell drugs, fight crime, help the crime, sell guns, drive cars, ♥♥♥♥ with the admins, or just have a fun time with the mates you'll be friends with until you die in game. The game evolves around crime and crime fighters.			",10,4,0,5,1,0,1

												After putting 1000+ hours into this game, I should share my thoughts about it. This game is old, but it isn't bad. Its also uses the same format as Half Life 2 I guess. :DThe game consists of many gamemodes that people play on. Popular ones like DarkRP and Trouble in Terrorist Town are filled with people on most servers, and there are many more gamemodes that are filled too!I mainly started playing this game in early 2014 digging through certain gamemodes that I liked, and the one that interested me was DarkRP. I joined a community that was filled with a whole bunch of fantastic people! Yea there were some people who were rude and mean, but others were caring and nice. During that year, I eventually met people who would soon become my friends. That made Gmod worth playing and so I put 2 summers into it. I would defenitely recommend this game to people because of how much fun it is. The downside is that you need Counter Strike Source to fix the missing textures. But hey, overall the game is pretty enjoyable. Its on sale for the Steam Summer Sale so why not give it a try, right? Thanks for reading!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Are you not sure about buying Garry's Mod?Ask yourself these questions.1. Do you like playing with people ages 6-12 on every server?2. Do you like constantly having DDoS Threats from 9 year olds with booters?3. Do you like having constant fun on a game that never gets old?4. Want to waste your life?I do too!!

Garry's ModOr has been known the game called GModWhat is Garry's Mod?Well, it's a game, yes, but it's a very unique one. It's a huge Sandbox based game that tests your creativity, making you build on what you want to do! Or even yet, make any Chaos to what your heart desires.What do you do?You do whatever your heart desires with this game. Imagine this game as a  Mod Simulator 2017 . Basically, you do whatever you wish based off the Half-Life 2 engine that's included within this game. All you have to do is go into the Steam Steam Workshop and download anything that pleases you! You can get NPC Mods, Map Mods, Game Modes, Car Mods, ect ect.Note: Some games will be needed to be downloaded for certain Maps and Mod's to work. I would highly reccomend getting CounterStrike: Source as most Mod's are needed for that game. The Episodes from the Half-Life would be a wise choice also.Multiplayer Included?Oh, certainly. Although I don't play Multiplayer all that much, but once you get a group of friends to play, you'll be spending your time that's well worth it.Final VirdictIf you want a game that has endless fun, good multiplayer, if you are feeling bored or in need to blow some steam, I would highly reccomend this game. There are endless Mod's for you to pick from!I would simply give this game a 11/10 simply because it's just one of those great Sandbox games! ",196,10,24,7,31,0,11

												This is Garry's Mod, a video game developed towards those with a creative edge. You are able to use a wide variety of tools to construct intricate structures with which you can kill other people for 'lulz.' If building isn't your thing, you can join screaming children and their feeble attempts to carry out a decent roleplay on the DarkRP servers. If getting stomped by minges such as myself isn't for you either, you can always try Singleplayer.Overall, I recommend this game as a result of its unique abstraction. However (queue adhominem), Garry Newman is one of the least intelligent game developers I have ever come to know of (the least intelligent of all time being PHIL_FISH.) On top of this, facepunch.com (the game's website) is run almost entirely by tea drinking monkeys each wearing a tuxedo and holding a glass of fine '67 Chateau Latour. It is indeed possible to get banned for absolutely anything, but here is a short list of my favourite reasons.- Using internet memes- Inquiring as to why another user has been banned- Posting a joke.If you do buy Garry's Mod, do not sign up to Facepunch.

 Aperture Testing Facility 00171 - Codename: Garry's Mod Welcome to the Aperture Science testing facility known as it's nickname 'Garry's Mod'. This is one of Aperture's most advanced testing grounds, complete with flying objects, weapons, and even movies! Yes, we'll let you watch a movie while we clean the hazard liquid off your portal gun, because testing must go on. Enough of that though, without further ado, let us begin explaining the testing grounds of this facility.Testing Chamber 001 - SandboxSandbox is the most basic of these testing chambers. We will monitor you as you explore the environment and well, do whatever you please. We will request you to build objects with a list of items we've given you, and also throw around some of those objects at high velocities to get the full effect of this test. On top of that, we would like you to not only build, but also INVENT... FOR SCIENCE! Invent the best flying machine you can possibly think of! Wait one moment... *Can they invent 'flying machines' with tires?! ...Ok ok sheesh.* YES, THE BEST FLYING MACHINE YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF... AND MORE! PLEASE NOTE: - Multiple zombies and other living organisms may be hurt in the making of this test. -Testing Chamber 002 - Trouble in Terrorist TownIn this test chamber, we will be modifying your brain waves so you and many others will have the same thought processes. You will all run around and try to have normal social interaction.The twist to this test is every once in awhile your brain waves will have slight fluctuations, changing your thought process. Maybe you'll be a bloodthirsty killer, or a detective?! WHO KNOWS?! Don't worry, no harm will come with this test... it's just a test! Maybe even a trust test...Testing Chamber 003 - Prop HuntFor this next test, you will be trying one of Aperture's new inventions, The Hand-Held Possession Gun. It may sound alot like the Portal gun, but rest assured it is much different! We will fill the test facility with items and trash such as cans, papers, old buckets, a book, etc. etc. etc. As the test subject, you will use your Possession Gun to take over these items and hide. Hide, you ask? We will be searching for you in the name of... Science. We must see how sell the gun works after all! Don't worry if you wear screams and spontaneous explosions! It's for the name of SCIENCE!Testing Chamber 004 - Death Run Just like our previous test facilities, this test chamber you must find your way to the other side to continue into the next chamber. However, you must run for your life! We will have many of Aperture's best inventions in this test, maybe even throw in some propulsion gel for extra speed, since you're running for your life and all. Watch out for those traps GLaDOS set up, actually in this test chamber, GLaDOS likes to be called death.Testing Chamber 005 - Cinema This is the final test chamber we will be explaining, don't want to give out to many spoilers! Here we will use our fluorescent calcium to monitor neuronal activity... and while we do so you can sit with your friends and watch some movies, on the house! We even have popcorn included, oh wait... popcorn acts up with the fluorescent calcium. Maybe you should skip the popcorn today...ANYWAYS! Those are the only test chambers we will be explaining today. Don't worry, there are at least 29 more chambers to check out! Wait... this just in... *What? THESE AREN'T CHAMBERS? ... THESE ARE GAMEMODES ON A VIDEO GAME? No... that's okay. We can still use this for testing... FOR SCIENCE!* It's okay everyone! We will now be playing a video game today, Garry's Mod! It has many gamemodes and will definitely help your brain and benefit science!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE FINAL VERDICT: Garry's Mod is a very fun game that is one of my favorites. It has many gamemodes (I've counted 29!) and because of that, it never gets old. It also has very nice workshop items, and some of those many workshop items include Portal, so you really can have your very own testing chambers! As I said, there is a very wide variety of things to do in this game, with all of its gamemodes and workshop items. The only complaint I have about Garry's Mod is some of the community members can be really big jerks, but there is also really nice people so I don't judge it on that. I give Garry's Mod 9/10 bagels, and if you don't like bagels, make it tacos. Yes... 9/10!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. You have a wide variety of props from various Source games (depending on which you own), and multiple tools at your disposal. With these, you can build different contraptions, make vehicles, construct buildings, etc. As well as all the content included in the game, you can find a ton of mods online via the game's website or Steam Workshop. You can also make/script your own. But the fun doesn't stop there. Multiplayer is a totally different thing entirely. You can find sandbox servers and build with up to hundreds of other players, or you could dive into one of the many user created game modes. From Hide and Seek to Role Playing, there is a huge variety of unique modes to play. A few I would recommend are: Trouble in Terrorist Town. A group of 'innocent' terrorists must work with the detective(s) to discover who the traitors are and kill them. The traitors must take out the innocents, preferably without alerting anyone else. No one knows who is innocent and who is not, making for a sometimes tense experience. Morbus. A group of humans must hold out for a certain amount of time against aliens, or kill them all. There are two types of aliens: Brood aliens, and Swarm aliens. The Brood aliens get upgrades, and can transform into humans. Allowing them to get into groups and pick off people one by one. The Swarm aliens are what players spawn as when they die (assuming they were killed by another Swarm alien, or human). These have a melee and ranged attack, but no upgrades. Their role is to weaken the humans, and try to kill them. The humans have needs. Every now and then you will have to either sleep, eat, shower, or pee. You cannot move during this time, so must be wary of those around you, in case they are brood aliens. Overall one of the best game modes. A ton of fun, especially with friends. DarkRP.DarkRP is one of the more casual RP modes in Gmod. You spawn into the map as a citizen, and can choose a job to play as. From drug dealers to civil protection, there is a wide variety of roles to pick. You can go around earning money, commit crimes, buy and furnish your own house, etc. Great if you find the more serious RP servers to be boring. If you plan to buy the game, be sure you own Counter-Strike: Source too. A lot of maps use textures from CS:S, and if you do not own it you will see purple and black squares everywhere. I spent about 350 hours experiencing this, and I would not recommend it. Overall the game is absolutely brilliant. One of the very few that I can keep going back to and not get bored. I purchased the game around 4 years ago for £5.99, and have since put almost 600 hours into it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.			",480,88,10,76,69,2,83

												Garry's Mod is the kind of game that you just can't explain and can't quite even put into any catagory but its own. I have been playing Garry's Mod for 5 years now and with the current hours I have now, it shows I put 1 hour and 45 minutes into the game everyday for the past 5 years. It feels like you can do anything. One day you can be a counter-terrorist in the midst of a town of ""innocent"" terrorists and find sadistic ways to kill them all secretly. The next you can be a mob boss in a group of your friends as you try to take over the city from the government in a dark roleplay gamemode. After that you can imserse yourself in the essence of a glass bottle trying to flee from the hunters who wish only to break you. Or be in a remenant of humanity defending yourself from a hoard of zombies in a fight for survival. This doesnt even cover half of what you can do in the game as I havent even mentioned all the diffrent forms of roleplay from being a clone in The Grand Army of the Republic or a occupying member of The Heer in 1942. And this still isnt even the end of it and I havent even meantioned all the great people you will meet from playing the game and all the friends and bonds you'll make. There is no possible way to ""beat"" Garry's Mod. The only beating you will do is beating yourself up for not buying it sooner. To put it simply, theres something for everyone in Garry's Mod, and its one of the greatest games ever made.			",49,0,0,6,2,0,9

Posted: June 16, 2016
												I'm going to give an introduction to people who have no idea what Garry's mod is and why it's one o the most popular games available on steam. Garry's Mod isn't necessarily a game, it's a tool, it's a tool that the steam community have been able to turnaround and make into a game with servers, game modes, weapons and armour. I personally don't think Face punch are the developers of this game, they gave the community a basis to form their own game. If you get Garry's mod and nothing else, you are probably going to be confused why people like it this much. However, if u get around 10 mods off of the steam workshop, you will see why.One of the main reasons people love Garry's Mod this much is due to the community mods, it's not the game necessarily but the mods made by the community. Garry's Mod was originally released in 2004 as a mod for Half-Life 2 and escalated in popularity when it was brought onto Steam. A game that was released in 2004 still has 1000s of players going on each day, I have tons of friends that just play Garry's Mod an nothing else on their steam profile, because of the variety this game has.There's a sandbox mode which is what it is. You can do whatever the hell you want. You can make a zombie apocalypse happen, you can make NPCs into a happy family or you can shoot an NPC in the face. There are online servers dedicated to each of the Garry's Mod game modes so you can play multiplayer in sandbox which furthers the possibilities of what you can do. You can role-play, you can have a death match with your friends there are endless possibilities.There's Trouble in Terrorist Town which is best to be played with at least 4 players and is not possible to be played with 1 player. There are a group of players in a server, all of them are innocent except for one (depending on how many people are in the server there can be two terrorists and there can also be one detective who can examine a corpse and determine information about him) the terrorists' goal is to kill all the innocent without being suspected and not to be killed by the innocent. The innocents' goal is to stay alive for 5 minutes and find the terrorist and kill them. I personally don't play much of TTT mainly due to neither me or my friends having a mic but if you have a group of friends with a mic, this game is perfect.My personal favourite game mode is Prop Hunt. There are two teams, Hunters and Props. The Props are given 30 seconds to disguise themselves as props and hide in the map. After 30 seconds, the Hunters are released and they are given 4 minutes and 30 seconds to find all of the props. There's something about Prop Hunt which I find addicting. I always find achieved and feel like I outsmarted someone when I'm on either of the team. If you feel like you aren't accomplishing anything in life, give Prop Hunt a try.Another game mode that I've spent a lot of time on is death run. There are two teams (again), the Deaths and the Runners.The runners are unleashed upon a map and their goal is to get to the end. However there are traps hidden around the map which the Deaths need to activate to prevent the Runners from reaching the end. I found this game to probably be the most frustrating out of all of the game modes as I kept on dying half the time because of my own stupidity and not because of the traps. I only recommend that you play death run if you're experienced at Garry's m=Mod as there are a few things in death run that inexperienced players won't understand how to do.There's also Hide and Seek which is self explanatory. There are two teams, the hiders and the seekers, the hiders need to hide in the environment and the seekers have a certain amount of time to find all of the hiders. This is a bit like prop hunt but it's harder, when in prop hunt the ""Hiders"" could disguise themselves as props and blend in with the environment and the ""seekers"" had a full arsenal of weapons, in Hide and Seek, the Hiders won't be able to blend in with the environment and the Seekers don't have any weapons to kill the hiders with, they need to chase them and catch up with them. I only recommend this if you're finding Prop Hunt either boring, tedious or you're sick of winning each time as if you are still enjoying Prop Hunt there isn't much else here, it's only for the players that want a bit more of a challenge.The next game mode is Murder. Murder is basically like TTT but harder. In Murder there are two teams, Bystanders and the Murderer. The Murderer is given a knife and they need to kill everyone with it and the bystanders are defenceless except for one of them that has a Magnum revolver. Their goal is to figure out who is the murderer and the person who has the gun needs to shoot and kill the murderer. Similar to Hide and Seek, I only recommend this to people who are getting sick of TTT or are finding it too easy as if you're enjoying TTT there won't be anything here for you.The last game mode that I'm going to talk about is Jailbreak. This is basically like the Minecraft mod Cops and Robbers, There are two teams, the Prisoners and the Officers and one of the officers is the Warden. The prisoners' goal is to escape the prison, which will take about 10 minutes or to kill all of the officers. The officers goal is to keep the prisoners in check and stop them from leaving the prison and they win if all of the prisoners are all either dead or if they're still in the prison after the time limit has expired. This one is a breath of fresh air as this one has cooperation involve with it, it isn't necessarily every man for himself, the prisoners have to work together in order to escape the prison and the officers have to work together to keep the prisoners in check. I recommend this game mode to anyone getting GMod or anyone who has gotten it.I've just scraped the tip of the iceberg as there are tons of other game modes in GMod I haven't talked about like, Base Wars (a game where you defend your own base) and Zombie Survival (a game where you need to survive a zombie apocalypse.) If I have not convinced you to pick up GMod then I fail at being a reviewer. Just get GMod and enjoy it for what it is along with 1000s of other players.Pros+ Good graphics+ Tons of fun to be had+ Replay value even 10 years after it's original release+ Addicitng+ Something for nearly everyoneConsFinal verdict: 9/10My steam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews ",314,89,2,34,26,3,20

												Amazing game, but remember, it's only as good as the addons you put into it. The very basic singleplayer itself is fun, but lacking in parts as a sandbox game. However, this can be fixed by a quick visit to the workshop, where you will be able to find virtually any addon you wish. Do you want to parachute out of a Black Hawk while quickscoping Osama bin Laden in the head? You can do that. Do you want to nuke a base made completely out of couches, during a slow mo sequence? That is also possible. There are also many multiplayer servers, ranging from sandbox, to Roleplay, to TDM, or to Trouble in Terrorist Town. Virtually every sort of multiplayer experience possible is in this game. The multiplayer games have themes like Zombie survival, or military life, and arcade deathmatch. However, it should also be noted, there are MANY bugs. While these bugs are virtually non existant in vanilla singleplayer, you WILL encounter them once you download some addons. Having many addons will slow down the game load speed, if you're on a low-end computer. 9/10.			",72,9,0,9,5,0,6

 About Garry's Mod	Garry's Mod is a nice first person sandbox, combining addicting gameplay to ever-growing content availability. However, if your interest is more on visual art, try Source Filmmaker. It's somewhat more complex to use but the control over scene building is definitely superior.Singleplayer ModeThis game has as one of its main factors the single-player experience. While Garry's Mod might commonly be mistaken for a first person shooter due to its wide range of weaponry to chose from stock rifles to user-generated what-have-you-launchers, players with larger foresight will be focusing on the tools and models that the game and community content offer.Multiplayer ModeMultiplayer is a differentiated, varied experience depending on the player's choice. From fighting zombie hordes to the classic ""Trouble In Terrorist Town"" and some sorts of RP modes, players can play a variety of game modes. Racing, shooting, survival, and of course, aimless multiplayer sandbox. GraphicsThe graphical experience of the game is heavily dependant on your computer rig and your investment into addons. While it doesn't require a heavy rig to run smoothly at high graphical configurations, it will require progressively more potent graphical processing power as user-content improvements and overhauls to visuals are installed. Visual results vary, though here is one of my personal favourite pictures from my gallery.All in All Garry's Mod is a really nice Game :-)10/10 From MeSweep ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

												This is a must have game! 10/10! It is really fun to play with your friends as it is if you don't have any. You can really get creative too, there are all kinds of things to do and all kinds of servers to play on. The only bad thing I can find is that there is alot of 12 yo kids and they can sometimes ruin the fun.Horror, Action, Roleplay, Hide & Seek, Prop Hunt, Guess Who, Deathrun, Deathmatch, Zombie Survival, Sandbox,...Star wars, Auswitch rp and all kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up♥♥♥♥♥♥There you have it all! Buy it and have fun, I got it for 2,5€ on sale but it is worth every cent even if you pay the full price. The only problem you can have is geting all the textures and stuf but for that just google how to get it and download it.Hit me up if you want to play.			",101,7,3,4,3,0,3

												Garry's Mod must be the best sandbox game I've ever played. Nearly all of my steam friends I've met through this game and this games possibilities are endless, your imagination is your limit. You can basically create whatever you'd like. There are a lot of different gamemodes which provide different experiences for each server. No server is the same, different type of community, staff and scripts. This is the game I've wasted most of my PC hours on, 6300h+ and still going! You can also create tons of different type of scripts through GLua. This is literally 10000 games packaged into one! And it's available for only 10€ (+CSS/HL2 if you don't own them). The game is from 2007 and it's still being updated every now and then with new features. Thumbs up for Facepunch and keep up the good work!			",529,130,14,59,68,7,113

												This game? Okay, where to start? This game is a truly amazing game that has given me many hours of enjoyment. In a nutshell, this game is the big kids version of ROBLOX. You've got many minigames including Murder (One person is a murderer, one person is a bystander with a secret weapon, and all of the other people are bystanders. Try to survive as long as you can, or kill the murderer to win.), Zombie Survival (One person is a zombie, and they must infect other people, and it goes until time runs out or everyone is a zombie. Basically like infection tag. Sometimes Zombie Survival is also a whole bunch of players teaming up against computer controlled zombies as well.), Prop Hunt (A few seekers are chosen, and the rest of the players are disguised as props and must find strategic places to hide in order to avoid being caught. Seekers win by finding all props, Props win by successfully staying hidden until time runs out.), and many other epic minigames. Not to mention, this game is really good for creating animations and learning anatomy of the body. Unfortunately, the community of this game is AIDS, but hey, everything else is cool, so that basically evens this game out to a positive review. Good day. :)			",101,28,2,11,28,4,21

												10/10 would crash again.After 6,000+ hours it's safe to say I've gotten my fair share of experience with this game.Long story short, it has flaws. Lots of them.Workshop, its trash. So many of the same dupes like ""fnaf sits on chair"", or sh*tposts, essentially.It crashes, a lot. To be expected, yes. But you'd figure after 6+ years the creators would've switched to either a better platform, developed a less buggy more refined version of the current game, or started from scratch. As far as i know, none of the three options have been in use. Maybe once source 2 comes out as an official game engine, Garry will set his team upon re-making gmod with a much prettier, less buggy, and more optimised user experience. Plus, 500 Km^2 maps would be glorious... :) However! Don't let that phase you. This game has so much diversity its not even funny. So many different game modes, addons, and just genuine new and unique experiences that make the game one of a kind. The list of workshop creations is about to hit 1,000,000 if it hasn't already, if that gives you a clue. Personally, I play normal sandbox. I like to program with gmod using e2 and lua. But if that isn't your cup of tea, theres prop hunt, jailbreak, and dozens more different modes that you can choose from! And the media coverate *aka youtubers playing the game* is huge! If you can't figure out what you like, theres sure to be one of your favorite content creators enjoying the game, so why not watch them to find what makes you click :D Again seriously though, this game crashes a lot. Multiple times per day for me.It has serious flaws but its given me a ton of knowlege and good times over the last 5 years i've owned it. Overall, probably the best $10 ive ever spent. In the future, i hope to see a sleek, new version of this game, but it probably wont ever happen. And that's okay. I'll still be happy with what i've got.Games ability to not crash 0.1/10Fun Factor 10*E+100000000/10Ease of use 8/10Community *depending on where you look* 7/10Overall, 10/10 game for me.

												Garry's mod. Where to start-With a decent amount of hours in this game I can say I am able to write a fair review.-When some people see garry's mod they only think about the sand box aspect of the game and nothing else. Well they do not know garry's mod. Garry's mod has 100's of amazingly built gamemodes into one game. Yeah sure sandbox is fun and it's a great starting point for a newbie to Garry's mod but there is just so much more to offer-GAMEMODES-SANDBOX-Sandbox is great. You get to build whatever you want and upload it so people all across the globe can use it. It gets a bit repetitive over time, I just wish they added more tools such as precision and stacker to it without having to download a whole entire mod. But mods. Oh that changes sandbox. You can be spiderman in a Delorean that travels through time (From BTTF) whilst running over a bunch of Halo Elites and your friend trying to gun you down with a epic sax guy saxaphone that explodes anything in sight.-TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN-Trouble in terrorist town is a great gamemode that is fan made. I have not played much TTT but the parts I have it was really fun. Yeah it's fun playing online with random people at times besides when people scream "" RDM "" "" HOWD YOU KNOW I WAS A TERRORIST?! ?! "" "" BANNED BY OPERATOR "". Playing with a bunch of friends can be a blast, all join a Teamspeak server or a giant Skype call and you will have a bunch of fun.-JAILBREAK-Jailbreak.. Where do I start... Jailbreak is basically a gamemode where a bunch of prisoners have to either listen and do what the gaurds say and play a bunch of ""FUN"" games to be the last prisoner alive. Or you can be a sneaky prisoner and rebell, you could sneak out of your cell and sneak into the armory where all the guns are kept, then you start a REVOLUTION to kill all the gaurds and win the round. Jailbreak does get a bit sketchy when you join a server and people arent playing right, or there is always that gaurd that runs around killing all the prisoners (RDM), Random death match) and people saying "" recorded "" "" getting admin "" But when it's played right it's a blast.-DARK RP-Oh god. I have played a bunch of RP and it really depends on the server, You get to choose your job, you can buy a house and do whatever you want. My friend and I made a drug empire and became loaded, we got every car and it was just fun. Then we had enough of that so we made a gang called The Bloods to fight against our rivals the Crips. We recruited a bunch of people and had a gang war and to be honest, it was one of my greatest times in Garry's mod. Dark RP is a pain when you have to explain your self to an admin every two seconds on how you didnt RDM this citizen or how you didnt mean to go back to the place you died, but if it runs smooth it is just fun.--I hope you enjoyed this reveiw, it took about 20 minutes to think up and write so it would be appreaciated if you thumbs up this review :) thankkkkkks <3-My rate - 9.5/10			",86,1,0,3,5,0,0

												Dam.. 1394 hours.. time for a review!No but on point, Garry's Mod is fun, it really is, most of my time in Gmod have been spent with my friends when we screwed around in sandbox, I can't really say much other things about this game other then it's not for everyone, but hey, if you like sandbox games, why not buy Garry's Mod?

												If you're a kid wanting to see reviews for this game: Oh who am I kidding you don't care about the reviews.If you're an adult wanting to see reviews for this game: Honestly the only fun you can have now and days is by miraculously finding a server hosted and managed by another adult, which is seemingly impossible now and days since kids following that mass of their honestly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ youtubers have utterly swarmed this game. You either miraculously find a good one, or you say ""♥♥♥♥ it, I'll host my own."", and then end up banning almost 2-3 kids daily because for some reason all they want to do is minge around, try to crash your server, or in general be an annoying little twatwaffle. If you don't feel like putting up with this, then enjoy all the servers owned by a seven-year-old's mother's credit card with his bunch of 6-9 year old admins who don't even enforce their own rules.Oh also, never play RP. All it leads to is internet drama.Side-note, MORBUS is probably the most enjoyable side-gamemode but nobody ever plays it.TTT is full of trolls, there's only one server that is the exception to this, but hey coincidence much; I admin for it.Sandbox is where you will question the IQ of 99% of players you see on a server.

												Horror, Action, Comedy, Parody, Roleplay, Hide & Seek, Prop Hunt, Guess Who, Deathrun, Deathmatch, Zombie Survival, Sandbox, Freeze Tag... and sooo much more. I'm sorry, GTA but you don't deserve it.. for me Garry's Mod is the true ""Game Within a Game""!Trust me when I say that I have a lot more hours into the game than what you see right now! I've loved Gmod for quite a while now and used to play it on my friends' PCs like crazy until a few years ago when I bought it myself!Will you make a bad choice buying it? Not really, you can always get back to it even if you get bored for a while.The more, the merrier, right? Make sure you invite your friends! This game shows its true colours and glint when you have a company to share it with! I hope you won't be disappointed, I know for sure that I'm not!Have Fun :) ",63,15,2,4,7,2,3

												Garry's mod, a sandbox game where there's no true objective, we just experiment with stuff or play for fun.Do you want a house that doesn't care about gravity? Go ahead!A car that can go at lightning-speed and crash against a wall in a split second? Of course!What about a roller coaster? heh, that too!We give you the tools, and you build whatever you want! Or you can just screw around throwing things in the air and kill NPCs in single-player.Gmod also benefits from a rich amount of content made by the community!There's a HUGE amount of addons made by the community, a huge array of stuff to play with.A variety of gamemodes to play with friends, tons of maps to explore and screw around with, props that you can use for a scene of yours, weapons to shoot with, hell even tools that can make your life easier in sandbox!Multi-player is where the true madness lies at, TTT being a game of deception, HnS a game about outsmarting your friends while avoiding them, Sandbox where you can show off your building skills.No way to win but no way to lose; Gmod is a sandbox game where you can pretty much do anything you desire.

												It's Gmod, how much more do I need to say?Every single PC gamer, everyone on Steam knows what it is already and knows how fun it is.It's IMPORTANT that you buy Counter Strike: Source with this game because this game uses it's textures and without it, everything looks ugly pink and black.An amazing game if you want fun multiplayer in amazing gamemodes in great maps.Download the mods from the workshop and the gamemodes/maps and you'll have an amazing Multiplayer game that you will spend hours with.Also, remember when you get this game to play Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT), it's amazing fun.If you haven't heard of it, which I seriously doubt, basicalul there are Traitors and the rest are Innocent Traitors (Also Detectives), Traitors try to kill, everyone else tries to stop/kill them. Everything else it's best to figure out on your own.Every PC Gamer should own this, I give it a rating of 10/10, the Multiplayer section of this game is Massively Populated and you just can't afford to miss this out in your life.

												A world with your creativity at your disposal. The game is one of the greatest open sandbox games probably in history, and I say that cus it's inspired so much creativity, both through the youtube gmod community (which I am part of) and through the world of artwork and just general fun and gaming. However I say this based on what gmod has always been, now however there are times it barely even works, thats thanks to the dreaded ""13"" update. It's getting back on its tracks though and can still be used rather well for what ever your purpose or desire. Worth the buy and worth the time, hours of fun with this beauty.			",117,21,1,4,16,2,1

												It's a mod. Made by a man named Garry. Garry was no ordinary man. He made a mod. That mod was called Garry's Mod. You see? Pretty clever right? Since this game is in fact a mod, and that mod is made by Garry, he named it Garry's Mod. Garry's Mod is therefor obviously made by a man named Garry. But what if this game called Garry's Mod is not in fact made by a man named Garry?! Then what would that mean??! That he is a man who likes to lie about his name? Or perhaps he just wants to conceil his identity? That might be the answer. Identity theft is a common thing you know. If that is his reasoning behind calling Garry's Mod then that is indeed pretty clever. You can never be too careful these days. It's like that time when Garry bought a teddy bear, which he wouldn't confess was meant for himself and said that it was a gift for his niece in Spain. Although he thought to himself that it was a pretty clever lie, it really wasn't. You're most likely asking yourself, how did we end up in this situation? Well young man, that answer is not one you'll be hearing about any time soon. See you next year.			",132,24,2,3,14,2,12

Years before, this land was only ruled by abusive teenage admins and crying children, we all lived happily with our houses and fireworks and sadistic addons. But then THEY came. THEY TOOK OUR WORKSHOP! THEY TOOK OUR LIVES!.But then the war of the Midst Fourteenth arrived... and it was terrible at first glance...Our beloved workshop filled with gun addons, and pixel art of pure beauty.. all got turned into horrible..disgusting and disgraceful, Spam...It quickly filled with ""mlg fredi xxx foxye bloawjeb secks"" And ""bonni blewjub in car"" and more ridiculous names full of sex and male animatronics with titaes.Blowout soon fellow stalkers.

My mind about Garry's Mod...- Friendship mostly starts here~- Its not a game its just a tool.- Some server can cause some cancer.- If you buy this game for playing but not making something well, have fun with random ppl on random available server~- All the emotional events...

												Hello Fellow Modders,I must recommend Garry's Mod! I mean, sure, I don't play it anymore as the community has most certainly driven me mad, but it is an incredible game filled with incredible opportunities! I will forever hold a special place in my heart for Garry's Mod, and that is why I must recommend it. I love creating things in Sandbox, playing endless hours of Trouble in Terrorist Town, and even those thousands of hours on DarkRP. The game has thousands of mini-games within it, and hundreds, if not thousands, of servers per mini-game. Each mini-game brings a whole new aspect of Garry's Mod to the table and it really is a whole lot of fun. I find it most fun when I'm with friends, because, other than that, you are typically stuck with dealing with some♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags. I loved this game, and for the price that it is, I strongly recommend it. I've owned several servers on here, none of them worked out, but it really got me thinking about game creation, which is the career that I'm now looking into. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be able to completely credit Garry's Mod for getting me into coding! Definitely worth it, go and join this crazy community!-Kyle James			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Honestly probably the game that got me into most of what I like to do. Computers, Pc gaming, just almost anything. Without this I probably wouldn't be a PC player at all. The game is overall perfect, you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits (and that of your computers hardware) and has a very strong player base. Anything from hide and seek, to Role playing in a deserted world. This game more or less has it all. With mods a plenty, customizing what your character looks like from almost any game, movie, tv show ect (as long as you or someone modeled it). Its great fun with friends and just random people. Overall if you haven't even touched this game or tried it, I HIGHLY recommend you get it, because its jack of all trades game, and it may help you discover yourself.overall 11/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic mod once you know what you are doing.Despite how old this game can get to some people, I think it's perfect for playing in short bursts.Although many players may (will) have absolutely no idea what their doing, once you figure out the problems everything plays like a charm.But that is only one of the game modes.Because the game is such an open ended sandbox, people have created game modes for the game.So at least if you don't like trying to figure out advanced controls for placing props and making rag dolls move around, you can still play the more linear stuff.Want to play a multiplayer death match like half life? got that.Want to play a hide and seek game? got that.Want to play a murder mystery in which you don't know who to trust? we have two game modes like that.This game is so open ended from modding that it's crazy.If you haven't played it before I recommend getting all of half life 2 and counter strike source so it runs better.Once you get the game working, trust me you'll have a blast with your friends.

												           The ""game"" known as ""Garry's Mod"", is not a game, it is actually a highly effective time travel program which was secretly stolen from the U.S government by the infamous hacker Garry Newman. The exact purpose of the game is uknown but most agree that by running the program you will be teleported anywhere from 2 hours to 3 days into the future.         Because the program, which is known as ""Garry's Mod"" was stolen while it was still unfinished: Leading to the biggest problem in the program: It may randomly crash at any moment. The U.S secretely gave Garry amnesty for his crime in return for not telling VALVe that they had not reimbursed them for using the Source engine in the development of the project.     I advise you to avoid Garry's Mod entirely because playing it often results in these side effects: Withdrawl after play, Major Obsession, Self-Neglect, Self-Mutilation (typically when the game crashes), Emotianally Distant, and sever Cravings.Do not let what happened to me happen to you. Do not play this game.			",47,3,0,10,9,0,6

Posted: May 17, 2016
												I'm going to recount my entire GMod experience onto this.In the beginning of GMod, Gmod 12, I always played with this thing called the Toybox. We always used it, and it was basically the dupes and addons combined, where they downloaded while you played, and spawned them in.Fast forward a little to where I played the first version of Extreme Football Throwdown, where we still used the legacy browser, and I'll just say it was a BLAST.Fast forward to the GMod 13 update, they removed the Toybox. This meant that we had to start new, and clean. There was absolutely no mods on the workshop, and everyone played vanilla GMod. We still had fun, though.Eventually, I was hooked onto HL2RP, a serious Roleplaying Gamemode.Do. Not. Try it. It is addictive. I've played nothing but GMod for 2 years because of it, and my cousins that were new to steam saved me from it. Read below if you want to know my entire HL2RP Experience. I had played this gamemode for quite a while, with no friends to have understood. Eventually, I found a server named something like Cracked Reality or something like that. I had made friends with the server creator named Kingo. Eventually, this guy named Horse had played on the server too, coding for Kingo and all that jazz. Kingo did not pay him, one day, and Horse had gotten so outraged, that he made his own RP server. I basically got stuck between the two, having to play with the two that are now enemies, even though Kingo had no beef with him. I was made the DvL of the CPs in HL2RP of Kingo's slightly populated server. This forced me to play more with kingo, as I had more of a responsibility. I made a crap load of friends and eventually each server I went to on HL2RP, someone knew me. Now, I had gone to Horse's server, who now named himself Jeremy. Jeremy had a friend named Chubbger, who I quickly became friends with. With the help of Chubbger, and my Cousins, I had left the HL2RP Insanity. Seeing that Jeremy was still in it, he repeatedly invited me to several spinoffs of HL2RP, such as Star Wars Nutscript RP, along with the CW counterparts. At last, the last thing he became, before he left me, and dissipeared from my friends list was, he started up a discord server, yeah? Well, he started one, which was in fact, warframe rp. If that wasn't low enough, he downgraded his steam name to be Rule 34 Warframe, and had warframe porn for his profile pic	In short, basically that gamemode is more addictive than krokodil, and only your friends can save you. GMod is a good game, take it in healthy doses, and hopefully you don't get addicted like I did. If your addicted, try getting someone into steam, by getting them a starter game like TF2 or CSGO. That'll force you into playing with them to keep them interested. GMod is dangerous, I'm lucky that most of my friends left HL2RP.Thank you for taking the time to reading this review, have a good day.			",51,3,0,1,4,0,0

Product received for free
												By far one of the most enjoyable games I've seen and played, you can metal gear your way across a map or wiggle on the ground like a worm or you can just build. Keep in mind that there is a lot of stuff that can make you go ''Oh my god....why?'' when looking into the dupes, saves and workshop itself, but you can ignore this unwated stuff and still play, it's not the end of the world if you see a horid FNaF model or just some bad dupe that can crash your game in seconds if you do something wrong. Like I said you can wiggle on the ground like a worm you can metal gear your way through a map you can create art from such a silly mod and yes Gmod if fact is a mod from Half Life 2 (for all you people who don't know that) as I was saying you can be stupidly tactical you could mess around with a few buddys and just have a good time. To me the game is can't really be played the right way because there is so much creative stuff that changes the game for the good and for the worse but most of the time it'll be for the good. I'll also give this the ''Just Five More Minutes'' award for it's way of pulling you back into the game.			",34,0,0,0,2,0,0

												Easily the BEST game you can get for anyone, for any reason. Heck, to even call it a game in it of itself isn't exactly doing it justice. Garry's Mod IS a game, sure, and if you really want to review it based on what the game is straight off, all it is is a sandbox game, one where you can spawn in anything from whatever source games you happen to have, you can build, create battle scenarios, or create your own battle mechs, among other things. But the main appeal to Garry's Mod is NOT the sandbox, at least, not the base game's sandbox. No, the game thrives on modders, and the MASSIVE community of content creators that put in so much to make this game as beautiful as possible.Talking about the sandbox specifically, there's literally thousands of mods that you can acquire for just about whatever you want. If you want new, fully scripted enemies, new weapons, new props, new buildings, new maps, even new mechanics, there's literally a mod for everything imaginable, and you can let your creativity flow in just about every way possible!If you want to go into the other gamemodes, then you'll have hundreds to choose from. If you want some classic PVP, there's a ton of different Deathmatches, some as simplistic as deathmatch can be, and some that have a little extra twist, like pirate ship wars. If you want something not quite as straightforward, pvp with a bit more than just ""shoot everything that moves"", Trouble in Terrorist Town and Murder have your back. If you want something more laid back to have fun on, without stress, there's Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek. If you want something tense, something to keep you on your toes, there's Zombie Survival, Deathrun, etc. You get my point, there's games among games to be played here. I didn't get my 2000+ hours on this game playing just Sandbox, you know!There's tons of gamemodes, and with that, comes TONS of communities. It's easy to find a server/community you like and can consider your place to go when you're feeling bored. Heck, I, alongside most of my friends, have become a big part of some communities, and it gave us some of the best times of our lives. It's impossible to say that the community or the player base for this game is bad, or even good, because of the sheer amount of groups. If you have an issue with one community, then you don't have to stay there. You can join a different community on the same gamemode, and find your place. That being said, a majority of my experiences with other people in this game are positive. There are a ton of bad eggs, sure, but a LOT of people just want to have fun, much like me, much like anyone reading this review.This game, at $10, at $2.50, or at whatever price point it should happen to be in, is incredibly worth your while. There is just too much to go over in the small amount of space that I have writing this thing, and youtube videos are only capable of showing so much, you'd be stuck for hours watching all of what this game has to offer. There is an absolute guarantee that this game has something for everyone.			",939,228,42,113,85,10,84

												Yes, Garry's Mod itself is a great game. You can do almost anything you like and the workshop always meets your neverending demands. It's also tremendously fun to play with friends. What more can you ask?The community is a major part of this game and it is ruined by immature prepubescents. I am perfectly aware that almost every game has a dominant community of minors and I am not saying that all of them are bad; however, in this particular game, the majority are. The servers these kids run are unecessary, modeled after what they want and not what is best for the server. It's clear that they just want to be ""hot stuff"". There are tons of gameplay elements limited to admins only, a bunch of poorly coded addons(e.g. M9K), and just a lot of unnecessary things clogging up loading time. Admins who are mostly friends of the owner are extremely biased and abuse often, and although it may seem like it, this review is not coming from me raging over a couple of servers. I have spent many hours in this game and from experience, I can say that roughly 80% (mainly DarkRP and TTT) of servers are like this.Remember, I am not saying that the game is bad; I am only saying that the community is bad. If you want to play with friends on your own little servers or even create your own addons, then go ahead and buy this game! If you are planning on buying this game solely for playing on multiplayer servers, I highly advise you not to do so.TL;DR awesome game, trash community			",29,1,0,1,1,0,1

												Garry's Mod is a sandbox game. No objectives, no goals, it just provides you with the tools and allows you do whatever please. However it's beyond that, since there's the Steam Workshop..which is likely what your fun will come out of the most. Maps, models, more tools, gamemodes, etc.GMod also comes with ""Trouble in Terrorist Town"", or TTT for short. Basically you either hunt down all the Terrorists or kill all the civilians, and etc depending on your role.As for me, I mainly play on ""Ultimate Chimera Hunt"", which is a ""Hide and Seek"" gamemode based off of the game Mother 3.There are two things to watch out for: you'll need to have the resource files for both Team Fortress 2 and Counter Strike: Source in order to fully enjoy the game and not have missing textures on most maps, which means two long game downloads and 20$ down the drain for a ""dead"" game and some resources.There are also the achievements, which are very time consuming. ""Very"" can hardly describe how long these achievements can take.Regardless, I find the 10$ price tag worth it if you look at how much you can get out of it and the fun shenanigans that can be pulled with friends.

												Ooh, what does THAT do? - Curiosity Core, Portal 2THE GOODThere are so many gamemodes and way to play the you won't be bored in the gamemode department.  The problem with this however, is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn't Trboule in Terrorist Town/TTT (Murder mystery), DarkRP (Roleplay) or Sandbox (Sandbox) then the best of luck finding a local server. Also, with the 198,000+ items in the workshop to date, it makes it the second biggest workshop on Steam. If you're looking for a particular thing, such as charcter models/skins, then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want.THE GREATThe Gmod community is huge, approaching the likes of L4D2, Portal 2, or even getting to the stage of Team Fortress 2 (At least if it weren't FtP). This means new servers, new addons, new workshop creations, all new each day. It is never the same game twice, unless you choose it to be of course.  It is possible to mount games on Gmod, so long as they run on the Source engine. Even so, this means your content from The Half Life games (Source), Portal and L4D series, Team Fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go. And, arguably the best thing about Gmod, is the fact that you can do ANYTHING. Not like most 'realistic' first person shooters which say ""Hop on your bike. You can go anywhere you like! (So long as it's in this general direction.)"" No. If you can think of it, then it can be made. And yes, there are some pretty crazy things out there, but that makes it all the more fun.THE UGLYIf you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure, then there won't be very many people playing it, if you can even connect to the servers. Also, the amount of rubbish in the Steam workshop is appauling. To be clear, they do no give a proper description of their item, they make it unoriginal and generally trolly. This raises another problem, some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this.But those are just nitpicks. The WORST thing about this (In my opinion) is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game. You will need Couter Strike: Source for TTT, Half Life 2 + Episodes for DarkRP, and so on.  It feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it, and the devs make you pay for the patch. You can feel cheated, and your wallet will feel lighter.THE VERDICTGmod by itself is about $10 US. The pack that includes CS:S is about $25 US. If you would prefer not to have all the errors, play TTT, use player models from CS:S then I would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it. However, if you are willing to save X amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that, that will work as well but it will take up more of your time. SIMILAR GAMES-Think of a game. Any game. It's most likely been covered in Garry's Mod. That's how expansive this is.For more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview ",231,49,0,8,8,3,16

												This is the game you literally cannot be bored of. At least I know I can't. Other games are good and all, and might have some good mechanics and maybe even a brilliantly crafted story. But Garry's Mod takes the cake in my opinion. Garry's Mod doesn't need any of that fancy stuff, because it already HAS it. You can literally do ANYTHING. From nuking your entire  map, to taking in game selfies with your friends, Gmod is capable of anything. The countless mods, the countless maps and weapons and NPCS all make the game what it is. It is just such an incredible game. I know what you're thinking, ""why is this guy going on and on about this sandbox game?"" Well, my answer is, because I simply, truly, absolutely, love this game. It is the ""do whatever the hell you want game"", it is awesome. So, if you have $10 on steam, don't get undertale, get Gmod :)(yes I do realize the graphics aren't the best, but it's still great)			",36,13,0,1,6,0,2

												I really like this game. Like, a lot. I mean, seriously. I have 3000+ hours in it. I really, REALLY like this game.The reason why I don't recommend it is because of the community. If you like playing public multiplayer, don't bother. 90% of the community is made up of kids from the age of 5-14. Not even joking. It's rare to find a 15+ year old on this game, and even more rare to find a mature one. You could always play singleplayer, but the problem is that singleplayer gets  boring quite quickly. Actually, it's pretty hard to find someone who is truely mature in this game and doesn't have anger issues or has a voice which can break a wine glass.Of course, if you don't mind little kiddies, or you are one yourself, go right ahead and buy this game. I'm sure you'll have fun with it, I know I did. But if you want a mature, respectable community? Don't bother.If the community was better, I would totally recommend this game.			",131,17,2,13,23,2,6

												A game that allows you to freely exploit your imagination. Here are some categories that the game can supply:Single player -  It allows you to build, create, & explore all of your desires with the immense amount of addons from the workshop that is consistently being filled with even more addons.Want to share your projects and builds? You can share it via workshop to spread your creativity for others to enjoy.With the games ragdolls and custom built programs by users, it allows you to create and animate to make your own scene or movie.Multiplayer -The Garry's Mod community is giant. There are plenty of servers out there to find and have fun on, meet some friends, & explore the avast amount of servers and game types that there is to explore.A variety of game modes to have fun on and different servers to find that will suit one's taste.If you are wanting more, you can also host your own server. Though, this would be for someone a little more experienced, there are plenty of tutorials out there to help you set up your own server. Invite your friends and play together on your own private server.Although, everything has it's limits, the experiences you'll have will be forever.			",50,1,0,0,4,0,3

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 The average session in Garry's Mod - Start up GMOD- Looks at low ping servers- All servers empty- Find reliable server with plenty of people on- Plenty of people fill the server up plenty. Reliable server is full- Joins high ping server- Missing textures- Missing textures everywhere- Tries to move- Lags beyond the wall of reality- Sound glitches out and the 12 year olds microphone starts repeating - Leaves server due to loss of eardrums- Sees that reliable server is open- Joins reliable server- Low ping isn't an improvement due to the mass of lamp posts and baloons placed- Asks admin if he can do a server cleanup- Gets called a whiny♥♥♥♥♥♥and I should join another server- Retaliates- Admin gets a little steamy- Gets muted- Instant the mute timer ends, says that it was unreasonable - Admin gets a little more than steamy- Gets kicked for 1 hour- Eats food for 1 hour- Joins reliable server. Again- Admin is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I returned after my temporary ban ended- Gets perma-banned for returning to serverNot sure what direction the game is heading in, but give it a whizz. Its pretty decent ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Garry's Mod  This is a great sandbox where barrier becomes a our imagination. Game created for fooling around with friends, create different machines through various tools and many other things to do. In addition, thanks to the Steam Workshop, players can create and post on the site various modifications by which we can change the player model, add new NPC's, maps, weapons and vehicles to the game, or entirely new gamemodes. As for the modes there is a large amount of it. I spent many hours playing this production and no regrets because I had a lot of fun. For the game to function properly, we must have purchased and installed another title on the Source engine. So I would recommend purchasing the package Conter Strike: Source + Garry's Mod as CSS contains the greatest resources used by modders. ",442,96,20,45,31,7,33

												I used to play way too much back in high school. I can't believe darkrp TTT and sandbox are all the same game. I used to play on a TTT server where everyone just ♥♥♥♥ed around mostly propkilled. The goal of darkrp is to ♥♥♥♥ with people who take it seriously, and sandbox is ridiculous. But I eventually halted at around 3,200 hours and started playing the game in moderation. (About 20 mins/day average)Recently I purchased a TTT server now I'm ♥♥♥♥ed. I got up to 4K hours and it continues to count.			",98,6,0,7,6,0,8

												If you're looking for a game but don't know what you want, Gmod is what you need. It has everything in it you can imagine, FPS Servers, Role Playing, Zombies, Prop Hunt, There is even a freaking DayZ Mod. Oh yea also all the mods will give you more script and texture errors than you could possibly imagine! Pink and black Checkerboards FTW!!! And lets not forget those 13 year old squeeky trolls that'll join your game and nuke everyone!! It's got everything! So if you're looking to waste hours of your life on something that will probably crash before you can save it, or be kicked from servers by childish admin, Then don't pass this one up!  GG Garry, GG....11/10  It will crash again.			",512,91,20,25,40,5,26

												Oh Garry's Mod 13, why did you have to ruin EVERYTHING?Gmod used to be a great sandbox game with a few bugs here and there, but then that dreaded day where Gmod 13 came out changed everything. The game only went downhill by that point. For some reason they decided that removing half of the props was a good idea. Those really cool and useful tools that you use all the time? Nah, we're just going to remove them for you. Got some pesky bugs in your single player map? We don't care since Gmod is played Multiplayer more than Singleplayer. You used to be able to build pretty much everything imaginable with the old addons and possible extra addons that you could download from e.g. garrysmod.org, but sadly that is now no longer possible.Obvioulsy you can still have lots of fun with all these new online gamemodes, but Singleplayer just ain't what it used to be anymore.

												The Story of How Garry Ruined My Life!You know your life is sad when you've spent 7000hrs+ to get an achievment of playing with Garry... what have I done with my life? Why am I here? Why is anyone of us on this planet? WHY GARRY, WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS!I decided to kill Garry in the server for all he's done, ruining my life as he has. I began by taking my AK74 spraying him down whilst I yelled ""YOU DID THIS TO ME, YOU DID THIS TO ME YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!"" as I emptied all my ammo into his poor corpse I had a bunch of 12 year olds yelling at me for killing the man who ruined my life and made me who I am today, I made this game my life, my family, my friend and gave it my trust and hope.. now I do not know what to do with myself as I've grown insane whilst playing on a serious roleplay server for the other 4000 hours I have.. why Garry, why are you punishing me for loving your masterpiece? Why are you torturing me for giving you my love? Is this the way you repay me? Is this all I deserve? WHAT HAVE I DONE TO WRONG YOU MASTER GARRY? I thought our love was unbreakable.. I-... I thought we had something.. Why? Just why cant I stop giving you my love? But then I realise I am but a slave to you, but a man that cant be released from your SS soldiers or your concentration camps. This game is but a prison which I cannot escape, a prison where I cannot love, hate nor feel anymore. Why am I punishing myself with this over and over again, crying myself to sleep every night I come online because I cannot give myself time in the real world but-.. but what is the real world? Garry's Mod or Earth? I cannot see clear anymore.. I cannot do this.. I'm disapearing like ash, like dust, like the-.. wind I am nothing anymore... This is Garry's Mod for you, if you want to have your soul taken then this, this WORLD IS FOR YOU! AND ONLY YOU!			",112,7,0,16,1,0,7

												Garry's Mod is not an ordinary game.It's a sandbox game.You have multiple game modes in it,which are very fun.Some of them are Prop Hunt,Trouble In Terrorist Town (my favourite),there is even a mod where you can be Slender Man.You can spawn items,characters,make some cool stuff,drive over some spies...You get many good achievements.The game doesn't really have goal,wait it does...HAVE FUN WHILE PLAYING! I recommend it to every player on this planet!			",85,9,0,5,7,2,2

												This was the first game I bought when I first downloaded Steam, at the time I would've given it a thousand thumbs up, mature community with a steep learning curve.My opinion quickly changed as soon as the game got it's last major update and loud and irritating YouTubers like PewDiePie got their hands on it and so did their awful audiences. The entire game got simplified and so did the players.Sandbox servers don't exist anymore. They're labelled as sandbox but they all have no clip disabled, friendly fire enabled, blacklisted props, and use gm_construct which is a tiny map for sandbox. It's like they don't even want you to build.If you want to listen to mediocre dance music and awful dubstep that sounds like it was made on Fruity Loops by a 12 year old every time you join a server, purchase this game.If you want to play with screaming children who found their way to Garry's Mod via Roblox, purchase this game.If you want to play on servers run by children who let their friends get away with mass RDM over and over but ban you the instant you self supply for protection, purchase this game.1/10 would watch a fantastic game and community turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥again.

												Can you believe that two of my friends actually don't own this game? In summary this game has a lot of FNAF, Weaboos and furries. Then there is the serious rp communities which is filled with all the 'fun' you can think of, if you find a non elitest/trash server. Dark Rp is also a pretty big cancer to the gmod community, and now with all the youtubers doing ""Gmod Hide and Seek, Gmod Prop Hunt, Gmod TTT"" it brings all the new little kids that are just like ""OH MAI GAWD I WANT TO BE LIKE PEWDIES PIE SEANANNERS VANOSS GAMING ORGINAL TOO!"" and then they fill the servers with all the cancer you can think of. Then you have those people that are like ""Pfft Im better then you, I play serious rp all day and am not a minge like those dark rp players"" when in reality they are 30 year old men typing furiously in their moms basement, that or they a 12 year old little kid that stole their mommies credit card to get ahead in communities or bought a super cool edgy server. If you don't have this game then you are probably not human that or you play Call of Duty and Battlefield all day, in which case you aren't human. Overall I give it a: Bad/10			",178,18,4,13,14,0,23

												Honestly a really good game, it lets you create anything you want, providing you have the knowlage for it. At the start all of the mechanics of the game for example the Hydrolics and such can be daunting; But after a while it becomes fun, especially with friends.One thing I don't like about this game is the fact that its extremly difficult to play a private game with your friend. To do this I had to open up the command menu and type stuff in, then my friend had to do the same, aswell as having to download Log me in Hamache for it to work.Honestly a decent enough game, worth the money 7/10			",46,3,1,7,3,0,1

												Now... You may find it interesting that I have so many hours invested into this game. You may also find it interesting that I continue to play a game many would view as limited. I would certainly say that I have studied this game more than most men would study a new natural element. Now, this is where you ask for my in-depth analysis on such a game. A thesis on everything I have learned from my experience. Yet I only have a short few words...This game has robbed me of my soul. Robbed me of my life. It has shown me that my life is an empty shell that I fill with fake memories in the form of online gaming, and more specifically, this game. I, and all that participate in online gaming as well as Garry's Mod are currently doing this. Building fake memories with fake people that are hidden behind a fake setting. Nameless people behind faceless screens. Ever changing, never moving.But the game was okay. 8/10			",154,20,0,16,20,2,19

Posted: February 21, 2015
												Introduction:Garry's mod, or Gmod for short as many know it, is a game that doesn't have any boundaries that hinder creativity. You don't play to win, you play to have fun. It's pretty difficult to review Gmod due to its unique nature and everyone's playstyle is different to which I am not excluded from. Unlike my other reviews, I made this concise to make it easier to read but preserving the important details.Things to do in Gmod: You can spawn props, ragdolls, etc to make a scene which can be funny or depicts art, download add-ons from the workshop to fire new weapons, explore a map, or enhance graphics, and even make action scenes by setting off chain explosives or start a firefight among NPCs. Upon being bored with singleplayer, you can join an online server and do roleplay, survive in a zombie apocalypse, and compete with other players. There are also tools created by others to help with whatever actions one partakes in Gmod. Improved photo-taking management, better face-posing, the list goes on.Problems:Some major issues I encountered was it's not easy to play co-op (and what I mean by that is you only want to play with a couple of friends in an isolated server). You have to use Evolve to do that or some other method. Downloading too many add-ons, like I did, can make the game sluggish to load and it may take a while for it to load a map. Moreover, if an add-on conflicts with another, it will crash the game.Gmod doesn't include all the materials and resources from other Valve/Source games, thus they must be purchased to enjoy the game fully. If not, errors can occur and they are most abhorred. Conclusion:Gmod is a game that everyone must play. It is adjustable to anyone's preferred method of enjoyment and  it's hard to not have fun.

												Garys Mod and How I got CancerSo I'd like to start off this review with a fact: Garys Mod is incredibly fun. The graphics are more than dated, but Prop Hunt and Trouble in Terroist Town are deff some fun game modes to play to pass some time.With that being said, however, the sheer unfun of Microphones and headsets will leave you exhausted.I picked up Garys Mod in July of 2016, and, upon joining my first server, was met with helpful players. Terrific, I thought. The game still has a supportive player base who are willing to help new comers. After learning the very simple rules and how to play, I ventured onward to a more populated server.That was the first and last time I would find even remotely supportive players and I wish them luck in getting out of the hell hole they are stuck in.You'll be very lucky to find anyone over the age of 14-16 who isn't a complete waste over the mic. In a game like this, I prefer to use my headset and talk to others, whether it's during prop hunt or TTT, and it has just been riddiled with children, mic spammers, and the such.Now children are not inherently bad, there's nothing wrong with kids. I have a kid and one day I will put her on the PC to join me in glorious pc gaming. But I'll also be monitoring her, as I was when I was young. These kids are not being monitored by their parent (I assume their father or mother left them at an early age due to some of the things that comes out of these kids mouths) They will spew profanity over the mic and it just sounds wrong. It hits the ear wrong. Hearing a nine year old tell me my mother is a ♥♥♥♥♥ and he ♥♥♥♥ed her with his 12 inch♥♥♥♥♥♥just sounds wrong. Hearing it from a grown adult, alright, I can deal with it. But this is something I haven't had the pleasure of hearing over a mic often enough apparently.You also run the risk of joining a server that has a female on it. Now, as I stated, my little girl will be playing games one day. There is nothing wrong with being a female gamer, and if you are one, props to you and all that jazz. BUT, adults, children, and everything in between loses their ♥♥♥♥ing minds when it comes to an online girl. In every game. But Garrys Mod is certainly the absolute worst case I have ever seen.Every server I join, the girl (abtly named GirlGamer69HeHe) Will say one word over the mic, and the whole server literally lags out with applause. The server will comment on how hillarious she is, and continue to talk over each other for twenty minutes trying to have a conversation with this one person. Again, some instances it isn't her fault. Some obviously love the attention and continue grappling for it, but some are just gamers who want to game. It's the other people who don't have a grip and lose their♥♥♥♥♥♥I just got done playing on a server with twenty people on it. This one female who was brittish started telling people she would smother them with her breasts. She was an admin on this server. She had the ability to kick, mute, ban and etc.No admin jobs are not 'jobs', but I would like to think the people in charge of these servers woul hold a litlte bit of respect.With all that stated, and this rant pretty much over, I'd like to just state that if you have friends that play this with you, this could possibly be a lot of fun as Youtubers have shown. But if you go in it, alone, expect what I've laid out before you. This is not a Garry's Mod is garbage review. Garry's Mod is extremely fun. It's the community that makes it unplayable for me.

												It's hard to say anything more than what's been said thousands of other times, but this game is worth your money, and it'll certainly take up your time! From Sandbox mode, to cinema where you can watch youtube videos with your friends, to Prop Hunt where you either become a prop or hide from the hunters, to Stop it, Slender, where you play ""Slender"" but with others...and one person IS Slenderman, to many other modes and maps, silly weapons, and so forth.Even at the full price of $9.99, this is a bargain for what you get as everything else is free to download overall. Some things require Half-Life Episodes 1-2, CS:Source or Team Fortress 2 to be mounted onto the game, but get them on sale, and it's still not bad. Absolutely get this game, get some friends and have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm pretty late but who cares, this game is a master piece. Theres so many things to do... trust me there is.Example1. Multiplayer. (There are plenty minigames available, Hide & Seek, RP etc etc...) ""Me personally don't play multiplayer""2. Singple player. (Now heres ALOT of stuff you can do in Singleplayer, you can spawn charatchers from a game you've bought or installed example Half - Life 2, also you can download stuff from something called ""Workshop"" theres alot of addons there, example models / weapons and more, you can also download addons from websites example ""Facepunch, GMOD.Org"" You can do scenes which i do alot on my profile, a scene is that you have some people walking or doing anything you want, and then you use ""Camera"" which can be found in you're weapons list or in the tools menu. Add lights and have some fun.)3. Random. (You can simply do everything you wish to do, you can create own cars and use some tools to build maybe a house and spawn some NPCs and do whatever you want.)This game is of course 10/10, because you can do ALOT of things, and it-self is good! Great game, reccommended by me. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first started to play this game a year ago..(Via different account)... I was like cool. I played on single player screwing around now t knowing there was multiplayer or add ons. So one day I got on normally and started to play. I went to the bathroom and came back. After I came back I decided to switch maps. But my game crashed because the power went out. The next day I got on and noticed multiplayer. I got curious and clicked on it. A whole bunch of things popped up. So I clicked on DARK RP. I found it fun, so I played multiplayer for a while. Until one day I was like let's try something different. I clicked on the Combine-Control server and found it fun... I continued playing for a year. Until now. This is truly a wonderful game and really I recommend this to anybody from young to old.			",9,2,0,1,3,0,2

												Garry's Mod. A game that is way too addictive. I did not know that buying this game would will my life with hours of repeated gameplay. An amazing sandbox, filled with addons and awesome gamemodes along with SWEPs, STOOLs, SENTts, SNPcs, maps, playermodels, textures and addons! You will find yourself spending countless hours filled with physics and 1 rule. You are god, well, only on sandbox. My favorite game, this is like first person little big planet. I'm not lieing when I say, you can LITERALLY do anything you desire in this game from cars, to zombie survivals, to roleplay, to parkour, to slender, to making addons! Please buy this, I promise, you won't regret it. I have yet to find a person who does not enjoy this amazing gameplay.10/10 stars~ErrolLiamP			",180,14,2,6,8,3,5

2,128 hrs on record.I think this may say quite a bit about this game. If it doesn't, well, here's a review, now gluten bias free and better than ever.TL:DR:Garry's Mod is a nice first person sandbox, combining addicting gameplay to ever-growing content availability. However, if your interest is more on visual art, try Source Filmmaker. It's somewhat more complex to use but the control over scene building is definitely superior.OverviewGarry's Mod is, if anything, the definition of the sandbox genre at its core. Exactly what it says on the tin, you don't have a preset objective other than finding something to do with your game. Whether you are looking to make NPC battles among zombies and soldiers, building a robot out of everyday objects and mechanical constraints, passing time with creative imagery making or creating mods for no less than a mod at its core, it is up to you.Of course, you can make it all at the same time as well. Or, not. I'm not telling you what to do.Singleplayer ModeThis game has as one of its main factors the single-player experience. While Garry's Mod might commonly be mistaken for a first person shooter due to its wide range of weaponry to chose from stock rifles to user-generated what-have-you-launchers, players with larger foresight will be focusing on the tools and models that the game and community content offer. Even if the player isn't interested in the persaying artistic section of the game that range from simple character portraits to full-fledged animation videos, one can very well perform physics experiments with contraptions and machinery and mess around, having some fun with constructions and stress-testing their machine's physics processing capability.--NOTE--Most of the time I spent in GMod was in singleplayer, with rarely if ever a few occasions with multiplayer. It should be kept in mind that if your interest is mainly creating scenes and visual artwork then Garry's Mod may be a stepping stone for you, whereas Source Filmmaker is a much more powerful and precise tool for visual artwork.Multiplayer ModeMultiplayer is a differentiated, varied experience depending on the player's choice. From fighting zombie hordes to the classic ""Trouble In Terrorist Town"" and some sorts of RP modes, players can play a variety of game modes. Racing, shooting, survival, and of course, aimless multiplayer sandbox. Be mindful of the following, though: most game servers and addons used in multiplayer require at least one of the Source Engine games installed and 'mounted' content into Garry's Mod itself, meaning content that you don't have will appear as errors; however, servers have been recently using more of their custom content, that don't require many of Source games mounted. Check requirements for each addon and server for further instructions.GameplayGameplay in Garry's Mod is a matter of specialization for each kind of game mode, though it is mostly no more than expanding possibilities upon the core:Sandbox: Create things and scenes, make pictures, contraptions, or physics experiments.Zombie Survival: Exactly what it says on the tin.Trouble in Terrorist Town: Slightly similar to the 'Mafia' party game; Uncover concealed hostile players among innocents before the end of the round.DarkRP/RP: Generally, roleplaying, taking place mostly in cities.Cinema: Virtual movie theater.There's obviously more game modes. A quick look around the Workshop should help.GraphicsThe graphical experience of the game is heavily dependant on your computer rig and your investment into addons. While it doesn't require a heavy rig to run smoothly at high graphical configurations, it will require progressively more potent graphical processing power as user-content improvements and overhauls to visuals are installed. Visual results vary, though here is one of my personal favourite pictures from my gallery. Note that this literally isn't the final form as even better graphical results can be achieved with special configurations to the game. It is in no way comparable to Source Filmmaker, but it is still nice to the eyes.SoundThe sound system to the game is familiar to players of other Source games, with few audible glitches and issues. Improvement packs are widely available for higher quality and custom sounds for anything since player death sounds to general sound overhauls.There is no native music in the game, though I believe some servers have background music and music player addons.Content CreationWhile not a factor to the game itself, content creation is not a simple process. Being in the Source Engine, there's some barriers around content creation. Likewise, many of the changes done to the engine itself rendered a few of the official creation tools inoperable, though new ones are developed to replace them. It's not an easy task, but it is likely the reader of the review is mostly interested on just downloading content and exploring possibilities before trying to create their own content.ConclusionEither if you're looking for a sandbox experience to enjoy, or feel like playing around with friends in a multiplayer gamemode server, or even something entirely different, GMod is cheap to pickup and pretty versatile in how it can be played.

												Games like this make me truly wonder if aliens are aware of our existence but don't want anything to do with us, so they remain out of contact.Welcome to Garry's Mod. A horrifying chimera of internet culture, pink checkerboard textures, and preteen administration. God help us all.Garry's Mod is less a game, and more a platform for further modification. There are hundreds, if not thousands of gametypes across servers both paid for by mum's allowance, and desperately needing to be reset. In case you're wondering why I'm so quick to jump on this ""kids run this game lol"" schtick, you need to understand that every single server you play on will be moderated by someone who hasn't nut yet.There's really no point in me getting into the visuals or sound design for Garry's Mod. Chances are if you're interested in this game at all, you aren't exactly concerned with either- considering that most of this game's base assets are over a decade old. The only thing cutting-edge here would be the polygonal geometry. That aside, Garry's mod is home to a ton of great times you can have, whether you're playing by the rules or not. The average player is gonna spend about 99.8% of their time in multiplayer, with that remaining .2% being where you mess around in sandbox mode after your initial purchase. Get a couple friends together and buckle up because you're in for one Wesley Willis-tier hellride. Once you and your crew's decided to move onto the bulk of the game, you've got a number of modes to choose from. Popular ones include DarkRP, Deathrun, Cinema, and of course, Trouble in Terrorist Town. That's... about it. I mean this is all I can really say about the base game itself. So you may be saying to yourself ""hrunghfhfhguaa?? this is a positive review?? this is telling me that i should probably devour an entire cask of lead before i touch this??"" Well, make no mistake- the best part about Garry's Mod is the Mods within it. Let's cover a few of them, shall we?TROUBLE IN TERRORIST TOWN - Generally considered the magnum opus of the game modes, TTT drops players in the middle of a 3-way standoff. The detectives, the innocent, and the traitors are all chosen at random. This is a great party game with friends, as well as a brilliant attraction for trolling. There's a ""karma"" system implemented to prevent that, but it's basically the equivalent of putting layers of grip tape on a knife blade. It's functional, it's fun, and i definitely recommend at least trying it. DARKRP - Ever wonder what it would be like being a cop? Would it include smacking civvies in the street, chasing people carrying money printers to benny hill, and cybering with a hobo? Why would you expect it any other way? DarkRP is something that allows you to escape real life by imitating real life with the added bonus of crippling depression, if you haven't already gotten that covered. Be a radio DJ, be a shopkeeper, be a cop, be a criminal, be whatever! You're among friends! Just like the ones in your head! DEATHRUN - Disguised as a game mode, this method of torture was previously used in Nazi Germany as a way of escapism- breaking their captives to ease the pain and strife knowing that they were not going to progress any further through the Russian tundra, and that their own corpses were now the ones piling up in Stalingrad. This twisted take on the famous children's game ""press the button and live""(™ Milton Bradley) is taken to the extreme, and allows you to murder both friends and strangers alike in new and exciting ways. And if they're trying hard, they can murder you too!! Wow!!CINEMA - You watch videos with your friends in a virtual theater. This is as exciting as it sounds. Now that I'm finished completely alienating you from this game, hopefully you can see why I recommend this game. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, except you're a passenger on said train, and xXxGUNtheHEDGEHOGxXx is still trying to get you banned before the impact. Wouldn't have it any other way. God Bless.			",143,19,5,5,9,1,13

												I dont typically do reviews for games, but with a game such as this it is quite ""worth"" as i have heard these children saying. I decided i needed to keep this review ""hip"" with some catchy ""lingo"" to ""spice up"" things. so ""brb"" ""inb4"" ""10/10 IGN - Best game of 2016"".

												Amazing! This started out as simple mod for Half-Life 2 in 2004 and transformed into a fully modifiable sandbox creation! Started with only a physics gun, balloon gun, wheel gun, and entity / prop spawner then became much MUCH more as the years went by. A true testiment to the powers of community created mods for retail games. A show of reason why developers should always allow communities to create more upon their masterpieces. Bravo VALVe for allowing Garry to do as he pleased with Half-Life 2 and the source engine.			",78,0,0,2,1,0,0

												Pesonally my favorite game I own. You can probably tell this because it says: 21.7 hrs last two weeks / 413.3 hrs on record Garry's Mod is a first person sandbox game, that has almost no limitations due the to workshop community.Because of the amount of game-modes, it is almost impossible to get bored of.DarkRP, Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, G-Mod Racer, Gun Gaym (Yes it is spelled like that), Apoc, Melon Runner,Just to name a few. But do keep in mind, if you do not have really fast internet speed, or major patients, you may not like this game.Generally when joining servers, it takes a while to download all the workshop item, skins, and textures.Also, to play most game-modes such as DarkRP, or Apoc, the game requires other games such as CS:S or HL2 to play, but the textures needed can be downloaded off the internet.Personally, I give this game a 10/10. Do I think it is worth the price? Hell yes. I would be willing to pay around $40 for this game.I would reccomend buying this with keys from a game dealer on steam, or buying it during the Steam Summer Sale, just because it has dropped all the way down to $2.50 before.As I said erlier, this is my favorite game, and definantly worth the price.

												Garry's Mod is a really, great game for people of all ages; even the autistic children can figure out how to get Lua errors within 2 seconds of launching it.Pro's with the game.-Brings out the inner artist.-Easy to learn (even a child with aspies can learn how to uninstall it).-Educates the Gaming community on who ♥♥♥♥ed your mother.-Easy to read Lua Errors.-Pretty simplistic hud and menu.-Promotes the ""Rustling of Jimmies"".-Some Admins aren't stupid.-Workshop is great and user friendly.-Kill Slick gets mad easily.-Seth ain't dead.Cons-Promotes terrorism.-Other Admins are 12 year children.-No Seth Hacks available.-Mingebags .-Gayry Newman.-Replaced Toybox with Dupes.-FNAF.-Kill Slick.-Ritzplays.-Change the name of the game to Willox's Mod because Garry Newman doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game -Seth Nolan is in prisonIn conclusion, I rate this game 9/11. Mainly because I can suicide bomb in most Trouble in Terrorist Town servers. Aloha Snackbar.			",105,3,3,4,6,0,1

												After spending over 2500 hours on GMod I've came to the conclusion.....This game is good.Very good.Very good FPS and I never have any issues with lag/memory usage etc.. Smooth gameplay overall.I've been apart of multiple communities and currently run my own, the sense of community inside each server is brilliant, the amount of addons and customisation you can get is amazing and the whole game is fun. Regardless of game mode.I recommend this game to anyone looking for a game that is fun to play with friends or solo.			",125,16,2,7,9,0,15

												Everything about this game is glorious.Not only does it give players the freedom to do whatever they want from both creative and objective standpoints, but it encourages people to be interested in programming and game development. It is easy to see how hugely it succeeds in this aspect, as its community creates an unfathomably massive amount of custom content, including entirely new gamemodes (Prop Hunt is my personal favorite).The potential this game has to inspire people to be imaginative is huge; there is nothing you can't do in it. I have spent countless hours building insane things with my friends and I think that has furthered my career in programming thanks to how fun it is to make your own mods. Thanks to Garry's Mod, I have made countless friends, and become a better developer.This is the best $10 you'll ever spend. Trust me.			",25,3,0,3,3,0,0

												Actually this game is very famous so a review is not that important.Garry's Mods real sense is to simulate physics and to be a sandbox game. When you play it like it this I agree that it can be fun but it's more fun if you play other gamemodes.First of all, there is Trouble in Terrorist Town.In this gamemode you have to uncover traitors or as a traitor you have to kill the innocents. That's a really short describtion but it's basically it. TTT is a great gamemode to play for several hours at a time. Secondly, there is Prophunt.In Prophunt you have whether to hide as a prop or to find the fake props. This gamemode makes a lot of fun as well as TTT. Last example is Deathrun.Like the name says, this gamemode is about to run away from the death or actually to run and avoid the death. Deathrun is a bit more difficult sometimes and has a decent rate of despair often. Nevertheless, it's fun!Of course all of these gamemodes require friends to play with.So if you want to play funny games with your friends and only buy one game then get Garry's Mod			",111,18,3,19,8,1,17

In a large mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg for 20 seconds. Create a well in center of mixture then set aside.To a separate medium mixing bowl add egg whites and cream of tartar, then using an electric hand mixer set on high speed, whip until soft peaks form, then add 2 Tbsp of the granulated sugar and whip until medium-stiff peaks form.In a separate medium mixing bowl whisk together milk, buttermilk, canola oil, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, egg yolks and remaining 3 Tbsp granulated sugar. While whisking, slowly pour milk mixture into flour mixture and mix just until combined (batter will be slightly lumpy), then fold egg whites into batter. Spray waffle iron lighlty and evenly with cooking spray then pour necessary amount (whatever fills your waffle iron, mine was a scant cup) into waffle iron and cook according to manufactures directions. Keep warm in preheated oven and repeat process with remaining batter. Serve warm with syrup of choice.Oh Gmod is a pretty good game though, you should get it.			",61,3,0,8,4,0,3

												A great game with basically unlimited amount of different gamemodes, workshop filled with all kinds of content and a wide range of servers for all the gamemodes. You can do anything from basic building to programming your own stuff and creating electronic circuits with wiremod and such, or you can go on a DarkRP server if role-playing is your thing. Listing all the different things you can do in this game would fill up a book, so I'll keep this short. With all the different fun you can do, comes a price. You have to learn how to use the tools (which are fairly simple) and how the game works.The only bad thing about this game for me would be the outdatedness of source engine, which limits a lot of the potential this game has, and sometimes causes some issues.5/5, definitely worth the money!

												What keeps this game alive is its user created content, limitless possibilites and an amazing variety of gamemodes and content. If the base game wasn't enough you should go check out the Workshop with millions of mods like props, weapons, models, vehicles etc. You name it! This game treats you like a god (if you're the admin of course), and lets you play the game however you want it. You could go create a zombie apocalypse or even recreate a school shooting (but if you do, you're phycotic), heck you could even create a rocket that could go to space! But the skybox will block you anyway.And that's only the singleplayer part.The multiplayer part consist of a huge selection of gamemodes all spread to different servers for all over the world. Gamemodes could be sandbox, murder, sled racing, rp etc etc. The funniest gamemode being TTT (Trouble in Terrorist Town). Though, it would feel alot more satisfying if the server list wasn't so lazy developed. Server list only updates once you start the game up and the legacy server finds all random gamemodes that you won't play. Limitless possibilites and user friendly godlike status in both singleplayer and multiplayer (only when admin). Hours and hours of content, still expanding by the help of Workshop and user created content.			",410,126,15,77,52,5,66

												I think my hours put into this game speaks the loudest. It's fun, addicting, and I've made almost all of my friends on it. You can spend hours at a time or minutes on it and it fits pretty much anyone's busy schedule. High replay value and definitely worth the ""iffy"" price. The community has a huge influence on the game and although the graphics are terrible, who really plays a game for the graphics? Some of the best games I've ever played have had awful graphics but that doesn't mean they are trash games. The creative can flourish here with more gamemodes than you can shake a stick at with endless scenarios and possibilities.			",43,9,0,2,9,1,1

												Garry's Mod is a mod where you can mess around with models, maps, and can create almost anything. Sandbox is where you can explore maps from Valve games like Team Fortress 2 or some fan made ones found within the Workshop on Steam. I usualy play around in this mod a lot and brainstorming ideas to make Gmod Videos, which are very common on Youtube or on the fourms. Gmod videos are very similar to stop motion videos such as Nightmare Before Christmas, with a lot of practice, work, and a HUGE amount of patience, you can create smooth animation, which is what I have yet to accomplish. Tools are very handy for videos such as Easy Bodygroup which changes the different colors or styles of a model, Bone Merger is useful for TF2 items to properly weld things together, Face and Finger poser is what they are for, posing the facial expressions and finger gestures. Or if you get tired of single player, there is a lot of Multiplayer with tons of different mods. Deathrun is where you survive a series of traps, Murder is where the buystanders have to kill the murderer by collecting clues, Flood is more for advancd players where they build a boat out of junk, and have to take down other peoples boats in a flooded room, then you have the classic Prop Hunt where a group of people disguise themselves as props and the other team has to track them down. I have experienced some issues with Gmod, some of the textures still maintain that purple and black checkered color and some maps have errors and issues. You'll need to have Half Life 2, TF2, and Counter Strike: Source to have th maps and props appear, but sometimes that's not enough. I also have no idea if you can favorite random servers cause I have played some fun servers and the completely forgotten what they were. Managing the addons from downloading content from the Workshop can be a real hassle, it would be easy if you were ableto create folders to orginize your modles and props, like say I made a folder to stash all of my Sonic Modles into 1 folder. Another downside would have to be their website where most of the props and other things originated, nowadays they're all out dated and impossible to load into Gmod with all of this complicated file dragging and all this other stuff. But other than that, Gmod is fun to play around with and create random snapshots of characters and props. If they can make TF2, and Left 4 Dead 2 free to play, why not do the same for this one? Well than again there is some gory stuff and some sexual stuff that can be thrown into Gmod. So in other words, is it worth a buy? Yes it is, as long as you have most of the content that requires you to be able to play this properly.			",74,16,1,2,3,2,1

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",53,7,0,4,5,0,2

												From TTT to DarkRP, Garry's Mod is the one game that you can really do anything with (sort of) realistic graphics. Want to play a Zombie Survival Gamemode? Done. Want to do a survival gamemode(like minecraft and Rust, but just smaller)? Done. The point I'm trying to get across is that when you buy this game, you can technically call it buying a bunch of games. To me, this is just the kick-off point of the game. Games like Murder and Slender are fairly new gamemode.Oh and dont forget the Workshop! The community is great. Which, is actually where you install some of the game modes. Also, the classic sandbox mode is a great way to get used to the game. From the workshop, I can spawn in a dubstep gun in sandbox mode and spawn in a few NPC's to test it on. So, anyhow, if you are looking for a game with a wide choice of playing, choose this game. You won't regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You want to make cars, planes, trains, and rollercoasters? You can do that. You want to play in elaborate roleplaying servers? You can do that. It's also a good tool for making videos, as Youtube can show you. All in all, it's up to you to decide how much fun you have and how you use the game. Good luck in all your endeavors!

												As seen by the many hours spent in this game it can be said there is a lot of fun to be had with Garry's Mod. The possibilities are pretty much endless.Whatever you can think of, there is one way or another to make it happen in GMod. The replay value of this game is great. Even with the base game only. And it's even better with all the available addons in the steam workshop.Only downsides are:-Lots of random useless dupes in the workshop which clutter up all the fun and usefull (I use this term loosely doe XD) addons.-The necessity of having CS:S textures to play most maps/gamemodes.However besides that: GMod? Tons of fun!			",58,4,1,1,4,1,0

												Welcome to Garry's mod! a place full of joy and wonder! There are a countless amount of things you can do in Garrys mod. Want to interact with other people and play mini-games? Gmod-Tower is the perfect place for you. want to survive the zombie apocolaypse in an epic fashion? or do you want to eat the brains of the survivors and rub it in their faces? Zombie panic is perfect for you. You can also create tons of inventions ir mess around with the ragdolls if you like. One of those smart guys that figured out how to code Source? Get this! With the right people involved you can even create your OWN gamemode! Crazy right? There's just no end to the possibilities that this gem has to offer... heck even some people make animations with the ragdolls (preferably tf2 ragdolls) and make videos. There is just no end to the possibilities, and that's what makes Garry's mod a true sandbox game.			",69,1,0,0,6,0,1

												Garry's Mod is one of those games that you have too much fun on, and that is not at all a bad thing. Single player or multiplayer, there is always a way to entertain yourself; whether it’s just playing a sandbox game with your friends and making all kinds of kooky contraptions, playing on your own a building a scene for a comic, screenshot, or animation, or even getting the pants scared off of you by playing some of the custom horror maps the workshop has to offer. Not to mention all the fun game modes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, Prop Hunt, and many more. So yes, Garry’s Mod is a must play for any gamer who still knows what a game is supposed to be about; Pure unadulterated fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game that just never gets old...Garry's Mod is amazing, even on it's own and even after years of running a outdated engine it's still an incredibly popular game with many modifications to expand the fun for ever and ever.There's soo many addons in the Steam workshop to ensure this is the game you'll NEVER get bored of, it doesn't need a good computer runs smoothly even on a Intel HD 4000.Although being an outdated game it can't use up all of the cores on a modern computer making single player quite choppy during intense calculations.It also is heavily dependent on a good ping to ensure that online gaming is fun, your ping is a important number, you need it to be as low as possible for some gamemodes but for some even around 300 is fine.Garry's Mod can be funny and entertaining, you can do whatever you want and forever; if you have the skills you can build ANYTHING you want and then share it with the duplicator to the Steam workshop for all your friends and people of the internet to download and spawn in their game.I'd highly recommend this to a friend and already have 10/10			",89,8,3,8,8,0,8

												With over 1000+ Hours (1418 as of this review [I even got the 1337 hour mark! :D]), I ""HIGHLY"" recommend this game, tons of replayability, games for days, communities to be in; Overall its an amazing purchase for what its worth.However a game like this does have its downsides, Its all minigames. Unless you want an immersive game to delve into, half of the time its in minigames. Sometimes also, communities are gone in a week. You join an amazing server and the next thing you know, its gone. But! This is only 30% of the whole game, I have spent many an hour to play various gamemodes which pop up frequently, if not everyday and each offer hundreds upon hundreds of fun, even more with a friend! You can even have a Roleplay server aka you roleplaying in Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R, Fallout, and even more!Again, this game is a must have, its spectacular in everyway, even if there are some bad apples, but its a good game.NOTE : Do buy this as a bundle with CounterStrike: Source, it saves you a bunch of money. Also Half-Life 2, both episodes preferably.			",63,6,0,3,3,0,4

												You would not be able to imagine the wide variety of emotions I feel while playing this game. In Garry's Mod, the tale starts out with you, Margaret, waking up in a strange city, not remembering what has happened in the past. The city seems quite empty and quiet despite the constant screams of pain coming from all corners of that area of torture, doom, and loneliness. Along the way, you help a man, Garry, who seems to be suffering. You agree to take him along with you, although you're unsure of what to do next. You both share a mutual agreement to leave the city. Along the way, you may get jumped by some thugs. Garry and Margaret share about themselves, in spite of Margaret not knowing much. Once Garry has been informed of her lost memories, he says he'll help her. Margaret slowly remembers as they venture parts of the game, inside and out of the city. She begins to wonder if she wants to remember anymore. The game has many fantastic twists. It'll make you feel very genuine emotions. The story and gameplay is spectacular. Nothing is too predictable, and nothing is too over-the-top ridiculous. Everything is so moving, and it portrays the growth of Garry and Margaret's relationship perfectly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HONEST REVIEW-----------------Pros:1. Its limitless, you can do whatever you want, its amazing.2. Fun to play with friends.3. So many gamemodes to try out.4. Addicting.5. Steam Workshop. Can make your own mods or try out others in sandbox or such.----------------Cons:1. Okay, here is my biggest issue with the game... The community, everyone is screaming at eachother and majority of the people are kids. Lots of racist and homophobic people honestly. I'm not even gay yet I think that there is nothing wrong with someone being gay.2. This is basically part of the community aswell, but the admins. Lots of admins of the servers are either abusing power, or being lazy and not helping anyone out. I been in lots of servers with good admins, but also alot with lots of corrupt people.----------------Rating: I rate 3 out of 5. I love everything about the game but the community takes the fun out of it, so either play solo or don't play. I am no longer gonna be playing this game. I would recommend the game, but still watch out from the community...			",126,10,2,15,5,0,1

												Garry's Mod is a game where if you took 10 people and asked them about their experience on it you would get 10 different answers.The community, addons, workshop and gamemode you choose to play will determine your experience not to mention the ability to create your own gamemodes, addons and community... It allows control to finally rest with the player as long as they are willing to learn LUA, scripting and other forms of basic programming.Rarely does a game teach me new skills while also imporving old ones and giving me the freedom to do whatever I feel.  Despite the trolls, I wouldn't trade being able to run my own server and custom gamemode for anything.  The schema's for roleplay such as ClockWork and NutScript as well are impressive and a well run RP server is the last forefront of serious roleplay on the internet.Thank you Garry for setting the sky as the limit and to Valve for allowing us to have all the Source Engine as our playground.

												What do I say when I look into this game? Endless, rediculous fun. I spent 5 dollars on this game. I got it on a sale. I assembled 200 hours into this game and it was a fun ride. And the funny thing is, it still is going! Every once in a while, my friends and I get on to duke it out with guns or massive bridges or swordfight with lawn chairs or even sherman tanks. If you're looking for a sandbox game with endless-and I'm not even able to express how endless it is-endless possibilities, you can truly let your imagination out, give it steroids, and not get banned.I have to give this a 9/10. Thanks for the great ride Facepunch; I'm excited to continue riding with you.UPDATE: My ride with Garry's Mod continues! I've discovered a new gamemode called GMod Tower, and its a GREAT server! I've had so much fun and not only has it gotten me back into Gmod again, but I also have put about 30 or so more hours into this great game. Seriously though, buy it.			",201,16,2,28,17,0,13

												Garry's Mod is a game where if you took 10 people and asked them about their experience on it you would get 10 different answers.The community, addons, workshop and gamemode you choose to play will determine your experience not to mention the ability to create your own gamemodes, addons and community... It allows control to finally rest with the player as long as they are willing to learn LUA, scripting and other forms of basic programming.Rarely does a game teach me new skills while also imporving old ones and giving me the freedom to do whatever I feel.  Despite the trolls, I wouldn't trade being able to run my own server and custom gamemode for anything.  The schema's for roleplay such as ClockWork and NutScript as well are impressive and a well run RP server is the last forefront of serious roleplay on the internet.Thank you Garry for setting the sky as the limit and to Valve for allowing us to have all the Source Engine as our playground.

												There is so much fun to be had, however it requires friends to play it, otherwise you find yourself wandering around in and out of servers with strangers who don't care about you and will kill you.The game itself is extremely versatile, with so much scope for adaptation and expansion. A more simpler easier-to-navigate interface would have been prefered, but that's my own opinion as a mature gamer. For instance, there is a LOT you have to learn before you can even figure out what you 'have to do' to play this game.My advice is find a friend who knows how to play the game or the basics at least, and take it from there. Remember, you have to own and have installed any game with the source engine, be it Halflife2 Counter strike source etc (there is a bundle on offer at the moment for CS Source + Gary's Mod.I would recommend this game to everyone who is into round-based, team deathmatches and the like. A headset and mic is very advantageous.			",72,7,0,13,14,0,7

												Went on a Dark RP server to find a hobo running in the street throwing bugbait everywhere screaming ""The world is coming to an end"" and then people driving around in cars running people over. This game most definitely ruined my life.			",221,30,7,40,17,2,39

												For a game that will only run you $9.99, Garry's Mod is one of the most popular Steam games, and the best sandbox game, ever to be created in my opinion. The game has sold millions of copies, and trust me, I wouldn't think any game that's so cheap, money-wise, would sell that many.The main point of Garry's Mod is to build contraptions and make them work. These can range from cars to boats to trains to helicopters and a countless amount of things you can do. To build these you use props, simple models that were taken from existing games. Speaking of existing games, the other main idea is that you collect as many Valve games as you can so that you can use it's resources in the game. To start you off, you get quite a lot of stuff from Half Life 2, such as NPC's, weapons, models from the game and ragdolls. My personal favourite category is the HL2 Vehicles section, where you can spawn usually wrecked car bodies and try and bring them to life with the wheel tool and two thrusters on one side. Garry's Mod also has it's own range of pre-made models, such as jet planes, railways, trains, rollercoasters, and even has it's own mascot: G-Man. Sometimes building can be easy, other times it needs a little bit of perfecting. For example, to make sure a train doesn't go flying off a track you have to decrease the force of the thruster that makes it go forwards or backwards. If you're making a helicopter you might have to resort to using hoverballs, which can go ape if you're not careful. You would think that building a car is as simple as placing four wheels on a box and making sure the wheels turn the right way when you press a key on your numpad. Wrong. You have to add thrusters on both sides of the car if you want it to turn and not have too much force if you don't want it to drift. But it's fairly easy once you know how to do it.Besides Sandbox, there are also a plethora of other gamemodes. One or two of them have you live in a city, get a job, eat food etc. or it could be a simple deathmatch. Obviously I can't list every single gamemode that exists, so lets skip to the next part of this review.The graphics are amazing. The lighting is up to perfection and everything is just so detailed. The water deserves a real praise, it is absolutely beautiful.The player models are also perfectly detailed and everything is just perfect in general. Well done Garry, well done.The game was completely made to be multiplayer, but you can also go single-player if you want to. The community obviously varies depending on what gamemode you're playing. For example, sandbox players can be helpful and can make pretty cool stuff. DarkRP players can be a little out of order, otherwise they're generally ok. Overall, the online is A-OK.The game has completely realistic audio. All of the props have their own material, so for example wooden crates obviously sound like wood when they collide with something, or when they get hit. Glass props will shatter like glass, metal clangs when it collides. If you die, you hear a heart-monitor sound that decreases to a long beep. If you get killed by an explosive, you hear a high-pitched sound as if your hearing got damaged. When you're underwater, the sound is modified to fit exactly that. Even the voices of other players are changed. NPC's get voices too, though all of the HL2 humans call you Gordon since they think you're Dr. Freeman. I love how the zombies sound like, especially the Fast Zombie and the Manhacks. The audio is again up to perfection.The controls are really easy to handle. You can walk, run, sprint, crouch and jump. You can also fly around using the V key. This is called ""noclip"" and it makes you able to go through almost anything. Though strangely, bullets can still hit you so watch out. When you have a contraption going, such as a helicopter or car, you can control it like an RC toy with your numpad. Or you can hop in (if you added a seat) and can drive it. The handling of your own contraption depends on what you added and how you modified it. Other than that, everything is great.Being a game that can be expanded by the many Valve games out there, it obviously takes every resource from any Valve game you have in your Steam Library and allows you to use it to your taste. If you have Team Fortress 2, you can pose a Scout ragdoll in any way you want. Though some of Garry's Mod is original, such as having it's own models, otherwise it's a real resource user.With all the game-modes, maps, add-ons and various other stuff you can add to the game, this game shall never end up being defined with the word ""old"". Though sometimes you can end up not knowing what to build, but that's a different story entirely. It's guaranteed that you can play this game forever.Garry's Mod is the best sandbox ever created, as I said earlier. Most of it's features are tuned up to perfection and the game never gets old. I'm still quite new to this game and already I've joined communities about certain servers on the game. It's definitely a great game in all it's might.If you're a PC gamer, you have to at least try this game. Especially if you're on Steam. It's one of the most popular Steam games, and I would completely recommend it to every gamer I meet. I love this game so much. I can't see who wouldn't.			",173,28,3,16,18,0,12

												Garry's Mod is Garry's Mod. How can you compare this to any other game... not too sure.It's a first person sandbox game, completely filled with (especially with the addition of workshop content and dupes) almost literally any prop you could think of or require for any whacky project. The use of Half Life 2 character models, along with other titles like TF2 and CS:S, allow for tonnes of hilarious Machinima animations to be created with *relative* ease.Only gripe is that, with time and added content, the prop menu can become a hell hole to navigate. However, this could possibly be an inevitability of such a complex system without a complex overhaul.Seriously, get it. With the amount of additional game-modes that are now being packaged with the game, you cannot go wrong with getting this classic title. Amazing fun with friends!9.5/10			",230,16,3,8,16,0,33

												Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox game from Valve.Garry's Mod is a complete sandbox game. There are no objectives, storylines, goal or something like those. You're a free to do anything, you can mess around in it, make something, build something, make funny of something and much more everything from Valve best titles. You can pose some ragdolls from any Source games such as Half-Life 2 or Counter-Strike: Source, creating your own battles or just play any game modes that available on this game. Make a funny screenshots, blowing everything you create, making a war or battlefield, all of this you can do with your friends or the public. The best part is the Workshop, you can download even more user created content, game modes, anything or even create your own stuff and share it with everyone.Garry's Mod using the same Source Engine used in Half-Life 2 series, Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source with the same content from those game. It's not a copycat game, but rather something to play around with stuff from those games. With the same physics effects you can throw stuff or body around, or you can even construct something from your mind.Garry's Mod is good when you just want to mess around, especially with friends. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												A really fun game if you have a creative mind. You can create and build to your hearts content. There is a lot of content and option in the game to play around with so that you will never get board. The combinations to what you can build and play with are endless. The game uses physics which is entertaining when playing with friends and killing the AI that you spawn in the game. The graphics are crisp and great to look at. People can get addicted to this game rather quickly when you get the hang of everything this game has to offer. The online portion of this game is very active and fun to play around with friends. There is a single player mode were you can get used to building so that you don't look weird when playing with friends online. This game is highly recommended for the great gameplay and endless possibilities to use your mind and creative side. Build, create, and enjoy the mind for its imagination.

												Garry's Mod has a ton of items, mostly from Half Life 2. There are only 2 maps in the game for you to mess around in, but they are large and have various things like flat surfaces, hills, and water. There are tons of items to spawn in such as NPC's (Humans, Zombies, Etc.), Props and Vehicles. You also have a bunch of ""tools"" at your disposal. These range from Balloons where you can edit the shape, color and force, from a weld tool that you can use to connect 2 items together. These are only a few of the items and tools in the game. While you can have fun with just this, the game really shines with the community. Players across the globe have made LOADS of stuff. From game-modes to weapons to vehicles to NPC's to maps. This game has it all. The only con with this as you must obviously download the content, which can use up bandwidth. This can be a problem for some, however, most downloads are small and it shouldn't be an issue if you have a high GB capacity. Famous game-modes are Trouble In Terrorist Town and Prop Hunt with hundreds more. The controls in G-Mod are responsive, just like all Valve games. The game is pretty much everything you want from a video game. Garry's Mod has something for everyone to enjoy.The sound effects in this game are hilarious. Various game modes will play different music and sound effects. A ton of the audio is meant to be crazy, hilarious or downright stupid, so do not expect anything mind-blowing or extremely serious. The only thing that can be problematic is a server with loads of people who are all using voice chat at once. It can block the in-game sounds and can be very annoying at times. Thankfully, Valve put a mute button in the main menu to avoid this issue.Overall, G-Mod has an infinite amount of replay value. The amount of content is extremely high and many more things are being made as I write this review. The game is fun with friends and is hilarious most of the time. For $10 ($30 with textures; still an amazing price), this game is a must-buy and is well worth your time.			",314,125,14,79,58,9,69

												This game is simply amazing. Sure, it has great gameplay and many different gamemodes for players of all kinds. But it's even more than that. The community is simply amazing. The people who play this game are as varied as its gamemodes. Compared to triple A games, where everyone ""parties up"" and plays competitively, this game puts a whole new spin on the concept of gaming with others. Imagine you are in a room with three other players in game. You all have guns. In any other game, you would instantly shoot each other. Some people would rage quit; others would cuss and scream into the mic. This is not so with Garry's Mod. In this game, the people would talk to each other (either via text or mics) and create their own scenario that has nothing to do with the way the game is meant to be played. They would mess around, have some laughs, and make friends. It is no longer simply about the game objectives. It is COMMUNITY. It is about FRIENDSHIP. If nothing more, it is about LAUGHS. No matter what you look for in a game, this game has it all. If you want to be competitive, you can be (though I don't recommend it). If you want to laugh and make friends, this game is the absolute best in the industry. Garry's Mod, simply put, is COMMUNITY.			",140,30,7,5,5,0,1

												Garry's Mod; my single most played game for many reasons. For one, I'm a creative person myself, and Garry's Mod is where you can most certainly show your creativity to the public, or share ideas with the crowd. Garry's Mod is for the creative, thoughtful, and the open-minded. It give you total freedom in anything you want to do, and you have no practical limits. It is entirely up to you on what you create and share, and in the end, you'll simple hone in your creative skills, and get known in the community.At first, Gmod may seem rather difficult to understand, it does have a learning curve, but once you've mastered the basics, you can start moving onto the more advanced fields, and slowly enhance your skills in whatever it is you like to do.Garry's Mod is about Building, Coding, Talking with friends, and just plain having fun with others. If you don't own Garry's Mod, then I highly suggest it to you, no matter who you are. You've got a large, friendly, and creative playerbase waiting to greet you in this world of infinite creativity.So what are you waiting for, come see Garry's Mod for yourself!			",50,9,0,5,3,0,2

												Garry's Mod, a game where you kill water melons and bananas. Pretend to be friendly, and then shoot somebody in a face. You may think thats boring, thats only one game mode. This thing has game modes coming out every year or so, it's crazy I could log 1000 hours into this by a year If i wished to. It is addicting you start you can't stop, some game modes get repetetive you don't know anything about this game. Even the people with 1,000+ hours probably haven't explored all the games full possibilites. Also this gives you a new code LUA! MMM Gets annoying at times but you can learn it and be a master of creating servers adding items to your server.Theres DarkRP The 2nd most popular game mode, RolePlay were you can do anything you want in a very urban enviorment.11/10 Chased somebody around a fruit stall with a knife.

												My review of Garry's Mod (Singleplayer only):What do I know about Garry's mod... well, it's a tool for posing, making screenshots and showing off screenshots which look to be processed through movie filters. Often, if using the right graphics card, a picture can look crisp, clean and even outperform Source Film Maker in terms of quality.However, there is one massive downfall that Garry's mod regularly faces, this downfall is its addons, not that the content is bad, a large majority is awesome to say the least. But, the real downfall is that there seems to be NO MEANS of accessing any content you have subscribed to on the workshop sometimes. That's what really makes it fall down MASSIVELY.As an example, you might be biding your time casually playing around in a different game when suddenly, WHAM! A bolt of pure inspiration hits you, you happen to have the skill and the addons to make your wildest dreams come true! But then, you load up Garry's Mod and check to see if all your mods are there......You see that it says ""NO MODS FOUND!"" it is more common to find your game unmodded due to errors regarding either the workshop or the game itself,  and it's rather dull without the mods, as you have very limited resources to play with, even if it's a sandbox game. Truth is, the game is still confined to all the items within the Source engine, these mods allow you to completely bypass this reliance as long as you have the neccessary Source textures. So you're probably wondering... why the hell would someone buy a game that's so plain, boring and buggy?Well, let me give you an answer, the community.There are literally BILLIONS of mods for Garry's mod that exist as of this current moment in time, there is also a random peice of information that I happen to know and it's the following:At least one thing is submitted to the Garry's mod workshop every 0.5 seconds at least.This means that the workshop is still growing, even now whilst you are reading this. But that's not all that's on offer, you have the whole internet at your fingertips (trust me, google is your friend). If you are ready and willing to sift through all the bad stuff and find the huge goldmine of good stuff, it'll be incredibly enticing to buy Garry's mod.Overall, I'd say YES to reccommending this game, but I'd attempt to get it at a discounted price from somewhere... it's not bad, but it's not exactly value for money either.

When I did I saw that there were other game types and I tried a few.Finding TTT was the worst thing that could have happened.  I have sunk so many damn hours in to the game having a blast at the same time.....then I started to run my own server.  Now I want to die.  Please kill me.  End me and kill Mythtown.

												Garry's Mod is just straight up fun. Garry's Mod takes everything from the great Half-Life franchise and gives you the power to do whatever you want with it. Wish to run over a lot of Headcrabs and Zombies with a jeep that have balloons attached to it? Done! Want to set up Ragdolls and props, then destory it all with all the weapons in your inventory? Sure! This game has no limits, and with the new Gmod 13 update, there is plenty of gamemodes to choose from to play in multiplayer, such as Trouble in Terriost Town, Prophunt, Zombie survival, DarkRP, HL2RP and of course the classic Sandbox gamemode, with plenty more!With new content being constantly released on the Steam Workshop made by users for Garry's Mod, it becomes endlessly fun with every click and turn of the mouse. Definetely a fun game for anyone interested to make some good memories, but remember to play the Half Life series first for maxium enjoyment!			",63,5,0,5,2,0,0

												I just love it. So many game modes, so many mods, so many friends that I made with that game. Of course there are rude little sh*ts out there playing this game but still great game x3 Besides the fact that this game is actually turning 10 years old this year there are still people outthere, making those new game modes, keeping things updated and all that its just amazing and im thankful for that!There are a ton of servers out there to play on but by now I found my favourite ones for specific game modes like Prop Hunt, BHop, Cinema, Guess Who and so on. If there are regulars on the servers you also might find one or two lennys in the chat. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Okay I lied there its gonna be full with lennys  But let me give you some advice.... Some of the servers that are not from specific Groups or something like that can be made by little immature kids (and now dont get triggered if you're one of those lel) but if you realize its one of those... You might not have fun there since you have to play how they want you to or you get kicked or even... BANNED *insert fake gasp here* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)And I think you can tell that I spend a lot of time in there already but yeah I'm up for more x3  ♥			",86,30,0,16,10,1,4

												What is everyone's favorite Source Sandbox game? While Garry's Mod of course! As the name suggests, Garry's Mod was orignially a mod, and still is - in some regards. The mod was originally created by Garry Newman with not much more help than the Source SDK. Once the mod reached a certain point of interest among the players, so did it over att Valve. Being that Valve is very good at taking mod-makers under their wings and helping them to reach it's full potential - for a cut of the cake of course. Therefore Valve naturally became the publisher of Garry's Mod, and the game could remain the rights and to accumulate profit. Profit!Unlike some other not-originally-valve-projects (Such as Counter-Strike, Portal and Left 4 Dead), Garry's Mod actually got to remain an indie game. Somewhere around here, Garry founded Facepunch Studios and released an actual game - Garry's Mod 10. This time they could charge money for the ""mod"", as valve was getting a share of the sales income. The game has always been pretty cheap and has been on steam sales at least a billion times. So everyone and their cats have this game, rightfully so. If you have other source games on your Steam account, you can link them and add some of it's content into Garry's Mod, giving even more stuff to balls around with. Garry's Mod is the perfect game if you want to kind of pretend to be a game designer and just PLAY around with the Source engine, which is an awesome engine for this I might add. Build your dream doll-house featuring all your favorite source characters, Tank, Gordon Freeman, Terrorist, Demoman, G-Man etc. Then blow them into pieces.  Garry's Mod 11, a recent free update added even more stuff to the game.  You can do endless stuff in this game, you might want to look up som tutorials or guides on how to use all the different tools and such.I never got too deep into Garry's Mod, I dipped my toes in the water and tried the basic stuff. Everything from just flooding the place with NPC, to building airborne vehicles. I am always amazed about the sheer amount you can do in this game, but I will probably never get there myself. I am hoping that this game will move on, live to see Source 2 and to get more stuff ported over to it. Everyone likes Sandbox games.You already have this game, so why are you still reading? Go play!

												A game that many people adore and love due to the many possibilites you can do, you can build with your friends, you can try to stop traitors from stoping terrorists, you can watch a movie, you can chase storms, you can build a sled and race it, and many many more. The game does require some games to work properly, like Counter-Strike: Source, but that is mostly for Trouble in Terrorist Town. The game is ever more expanded by add-ons or Mods. All in all I rate this game 10/10 Would Garry's Mod Again.			",150,19,1,15,9,3,3

												This is a great and very fun game. It allows you to build what you want, without goals or achievements, by your self or with a group of friends in sandbox. I mainly play Trouble in Terrorist town, where one or more players are selected as traitors to hunt down the innocents and detectives, who are try to hunt them down.But there are many more game modes you will enjoy, like Murder, Prop Hunt, Zombie Survival and many more.Garry's Mod is definitely worth your money and time, so go get it now.Score - 9/10			",12,0,0,0,2,1,1

												Sometimes life in the ghetto can be sad for me and my doggies. Sometime the bullies at school call me names like 'f@gg0t' and 'd1ck l1ck' and I say, ""Why do you talk in 1337?"". Then they throw me onto a puddle and they walk over me as if I was a carpet, or a really small bridge. But then I get to my home after almost getting mugged and go to my PC which was the only thing I got for Christmas from ages 5 to 11. And I like making the characters thin they look like cardboard it look nice.			",40,6,0,5,4,0,3

You can create pretty much anything you could possibly imagine, pose ragdolls, and.. well.. there's just so much!There are thousands upon thousands of addons available on the Workshop to customize your experience in the game, from ragdolls to models to weapons to multiplayer mods, and even more addons that may not be in the Workshop.Most of the time I've invested into this game was from making screenshots, which I enjoy doing, and continue to do. Others may do the same, or build contraptions, play multiplayer, or just plain messing around.Get this game, download whatever you desire, and let your imagination roam free. Highly recommended.

												What is Garry's Mod?It'd be better to ask; what isn't Garry's Mod.What it isSandboxGarry's Mod was originally designed to be a sandbox game, where you could mess around with different constructions and constraints; but made a huge boom with the release of Garry's Mod 10 and its revamped addon system, which allowed for even deeper access to the Source Engine using only GLua, and for even weirder addons.EverythingAs I see it now, Garry's Mod is basically every thing, from sandbox, to Trouble in Terrorist Town, to bomberman clones, everything is possible, especially to the eager lua developer.It's great fun with, and even without friends, as making new ones in the -mostly- kind GMod community is a chore that does itself.I'm not saying that GMod makes a good 'engine' for every type of game; it's for example certainly not suitable for competitive gameplay at a professional level.Some gamemodesTrouble in Terrorist Town (TTT)You play as either the Innocent, Traitor or Detective.Long story short: Traitors kill everyone but traitors; Innocents and Detectives have to find out who the traitors are without blatantly shooting people in the face, where the Detective has items benefitial to this task.- Great fun with friends- Great fun even with random people, as long as you know where to lookSandboxSandbox, a builder's delight, a programmers delight, a delight for anyone with a creative mind;Not every Sandbox server might suit you, as the communities behind them are usually quite focused to certain subjects, and thus their server will not have a boatload of addons for you to fiddle about with; but rather more narrowed down selection specific to their preferences.Anything is possible in Sandbox, with enough time and dedication you could probably remake Trouble in Terrorist Town in the Expression 2 programming language (part of the Wire addon); Or rebuild your favourite Volkswagen, Bugatti, Tesla or whatever.- Great fun, endless possibilities- Takes some time to get the hang of; depending on the subject it might also take much longer- Finding the 'perfect' server is insanely difficult- Not for everyoneMelonbomberA fun to play bomberman clone, except the bombs are melons.If you haven't ever played a bomberman-like or bomberman series game, then what have you been doing.Tips & Tricks- Don't be a doofus, this goes for any gamemode.- You might need Counter-Strike: Source to fully enjoy the game; as most gamemodes/server use its content.- If you can, get this and CSS on sale, it'll be about the same price as GMod out-of-sale, but it'll be worthwhile.My thoughtsGreat game, great fun; bugs can be annoying from time to time, game maintenance could be better but it's nothing major (compared to other triple-A titles).

												Loads of dumb fun. I don't even know how to make many things in sandbox, but have great fun anyway. Learning to build anything offers a feeling of satisfaction, and with friends, this game is much better. Alone this is still fun, but not as fun. There are multiplayer mods such as Trouble in Terrorist Town (requires certain textures from Counter Strike: Source) as well. These are also fun. I recommend getting this game if your intention is to play with friends. I would also try out the multiplayer mods.			",176,33,0,24,22,4,22

												This is the best game I have ever played, possibly the best game in the world. You can do absolultely everything you have ever dreamed of! Garry's Mod can sometimes help you with other games, something not many other games can do. Steam Workshop has many wonderful addons to enhance Garry's Mod, making it simply amazing. Busy multiplayer servers, great singleplayer, it's a must have for anyone, whether you wish to play seriously, or just have some fun messing around. I cannot recommend it enough, it's absolutely fantastic, simple to learn, impossible to master.10/10			",178,7,0,8,14,1,1

												Garry's Mod is the best sandbox game ever. You can do anything in it, from building in sandbox to messing around in other gamemodes made by the community. Garry's Mod itself can be boring but it will never get boring with the all of the addons made by the community. You can do anything you can imagine, you can download a roller coaster save in a map & have fun in it with friends, you can survive zombie hordes in zombie survival gamemodes, you can watch videos with your friends in Cinema gamemode. It's so addicting & fun, Garry's Mod will never get boring as long as the workshop of it is alive. This game is pretty fun & funny with friends. It's fun while playing solo too. A must play for any gamer.Note - You'll most likely face a lot of texture errors (pink & black) & error signs in multiplayer because most servers use Counter-Strike: Source content. So it's recommended to buy the CS:S+GMod package/bundle. But if you don't have money, you can download the content for free.Recommended source games for the best experience in multiplayer :1. Counter-Strike: Source2. Half-Life 23. Half-Life 2 episode 1 & 2Rating - 10/10.			",39,5,4,1,4,0,2

												Garry's Mod is a spectacularly fun game.A sandbox game derived off of a mod of Half-Life 2, it lets you express your inner silliness and creativity.That point stands out even more so with all the varied workshop content available, ranging from various weapons and tools to props and ragdolls of characters from cartoons and tv shows and the such.Overall, Gmod is a fantastic outlet for the creative mind, and it's definitely worth your time if you like to waste time doing silly things.

												Created by Garry Jewman and his team of technologically-impaired slaves, this completely bug-free ragdoll poser offers much more than just that - providing the user with the ability to also change the ragdolls' facial expressions and manipulate them in sexually suggestive ways using the limitless library of tools. This mod also features a large variety of wonderful third-party gamemodes such as DarkRP, and is known for having a kind, loving and mature fanbase that will greet you with open arms and respect you no matter how old you are.Insanely overpriced and absolute garbage; 10/10.

												This is literally the ultimate game, especially at the price tag. With the incredibly large modding and player communities, I don't think there is an end to what can be done with this. There are fairly consistent updates, fixing code issues every few months, and I've been playing amongst others since the mid 2000's. I've racked up over 14k hours ingame, and I am most likely going to continue going from there. Pick up a copy for yourself and a friend and goof around for a little, I've never met a person who couldn't enjoy this game in one way or another.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've just been sitting here alone in my underwear in the dark. FOR 4000 HOURS.I used to be like you. I had friends and family, hobbies and interest. I used to cook for myself and clean my apartment once in a while. I used to have house plants for god's sake!I thought becoming the best would take a week or two of gaming sessions at most. I WAS WRONG. please, if there's anything you value in life, don't buy this game.			",25,2,0,2,4,0,1

												There are so many game types people have created in Garry's Mod that it's impossible to not find something you like. There are 3 game modes I currently play, and those are Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, and Murder. Keep in mind there are tons more, but those are the ones I have tried. So, when someone first got me this game, I thought it was a boring sandbox game until this same friend of mine told me that the sandbox is just one little feature. There are mods within the mod. Let me explain Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT) because it is an incredibly popular mode. In TTT, you've got three types of people you can be per round randomly chosen. Innocent, traitor, or detective. As an innocent you walk around the map with chosen gun that you can pick up from the ground. When you spawn there are all kinds of weapons. Your goal is to not die. And find the traitors. You cannot kill people randomly without proof that they have done something wrong. You can shoot them if they start shooting at you, for example, or you catch them in the act of shooting someone else. It's a very social game, so you would announce to the lobby to kill this person on sight, as they are shooting at me. Also known as a KOS on their player name. They are also a traitor if you see them using an item or weapon that regular innocents do not have access to, like knives, c4, silenced awp, silenced pistol and automatic, among other things. If you kill a traitor (you would know if you identified the body of the person you shot- which you should always do as an innocent if you came across a dead body), you can then say you are proven. See, the rest of the lobby doesn't know you are innocent. You are just as suspiscious as anyone else. So, on to traitors. Long story short, kill everyone except fellow traitors. You can buy special weapons and items like radar to help you, using in game credits achieved from killing innocents. Don't get caught, or else the whole lobby is out to get you and that makes winning quite hard on your part. Sniping helps, disguises help, and planting c4 explosives when noone is around gives you an advantage. Being a traitor involves being sly. Don't be too quiet in game... people may think you're a traitor. Try to change the story. A silver tongue will help you. Ok. Detectives. You are an innocent with more power...you can get DNA off dead bodies to find traitors, you can buy health stations, radar, ammo, silenced awp, and the like. Your job is to track the traitors down. And that's about it! Different servers have different things for their TTT, but that's just one of the amazing things about this game.			",20,1,0,7,2,0,0

												What is Garry's Mod?Garry's Mod is a sandbox game where one can spawn and interact with every object and being from the Valve games, and not to mention the hundreds of thousands of props, mods, worlds, weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes uploaded by the community.  Theres no story to this game, just spawn whatever you want, wherever you want, and whenever you want.Pros-Literally endless playtime-More props, mods, worlds, weapons, vehicles, and gamemodes than I will ever be able to play in 5 lifetimes-Sandbox, play around with physics such as launching Gordan Freeman into the sky and hitting him with a chair-Whatever you're a fan of, it's in this game.  Every genre, movie, cartoon, lore, idea, fictional person, or book has some shape or form in the mods in this game-You can fly on toiletsCons-Someone can crash your entire PC by detonating a nuke in-gameOverall: Flying toilets/10			",92,5,1,6,4,0,2

												Garry's mod, one of the most fun games I have ever played.Playing alone, Garry's mod is a good game as you can meet many people across a variety of different servers and gametypes that want to just mess around and have fun. However, Garry's mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a Garry's mod server, it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time. I mean, creating a Hoboville in a Role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate; who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist - is pretty memorable.Role playing servers are not the only servers though, no, there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general. So you just need to play a little of each, see what you like, and get some friends on. Garry's mod gametypes, such as prophunt and murder, are very popular on Youtube at the moment, so there is likely to be an influx in players buying Garry's mod in sales - where it can drop down to as cheap as £1.49. (~$2.44 )Overall Garry's mod is the ultimate 'screw around' game, and if you don't pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu.			",129,8,0,15,13,1,19

Gary's mod provides countless hours of gameplay and fun so what are you waiting for? Go buy this game now especially if its on sale.One of my personal most played games on steam.			",87,10,0,7,4,1,3

												Great game that brings your creativity out into the open. A sandbox game developed for teen and mature players. However, there seem to be a lot of kids in this game and some people may find this annoying. If you're into sandbox games, roleplaying, etc, then you'll like this game. This game has many gamemodes that keep growing everyday. You can write your own gamemodes if you wanted to, but that would take quite a while. There are many fun gamemodes out there like DarkRP, TTT and Jailbreak. Get this game and you won't regret buying it, it's quite a cheap price too with the current summer sale going on! You might want to get CS:S along with this, because there is a lot of content that uses CS:S. HL2:EP1, HL2:Ep2 are also great games that go along with this.			",91,4,1,5,8,0,2

												Garry's Mod takes all the characters, effects and props out of all your favorite Source Engine games (such as Counter Strike, Half Life, Portal and many more) , and gives you the tools you may need to make whatever you want.You can weld, rope, pulley, attach a turret and a few thrusters to a chair and fly around shooting at the world aimlessly, with a downloaded Iron Man sNPC shooting you with a pistol.If you think your current games' content isn't enough, you have over 200,000 addons to choose from in the Steam Workshop, adding new tools, weapons, characters, maps and gamemodes.Garry's Mod isn't just a game, it's a strong base for you to build on. Anything you can dream becomes possible in Garry's Mod. Whether that dream is a nightmare is up to youIncredible. Recommended 10/10			",181,28,3,21,15,1,15

Do you become a CP and fight crime?  Or do you Rebel and try to escape the City you live in?  Or do you go about your daily business?  (NOTE: CW: HL2 RP is a serious Roleplay gamemode!  It is usually suggested you read the rules before playing, or you can be accused of a lot of things).Cinema - Go to a virtual movie theater and watch YouTube videos with other players.Trouble In Terrorist Town- In this gamemode, you are all terrorists, however hidden amongst you are one or more traitors. Who can you trust? Kill the traitors before they kill you!Prop Hunt - In this gamemode you can take control of either the Hunters or the Props, and try to see who can survive the longest.

Build nice buildings, raid other tribes, drink water, and much more! Just be sure you don't run out of Health, Hunger, Thirst, and Fatigue.

												This is the longest review I have written but no other game deservers it.Garrys Mod is probably the best game I have ever played. It has so many possibilities and things to do and you could even spend hours in the single player sandbox due to the awesome modding community this game has. Not only does it have an epic mod community it also has a great multiplayer community aside from all the squeekers, hackers and abusive mods. There are just so many gamemodes and mods that you could spend hundreds to thousands of hours in it. With thousands of mods and plenty new ones every day this game is hard to get bored of. I have also made many friends on servers such as TTT, Murder and DarkRP. It is also very fun to play private servers with friends and doing your own thing. All you need is hamachi which is free. This game is only 10 dollars but also requires CS: Source so get the bundle.You can do so many things in this such as roleplay a swat sniper, become a watermelon, have hovercar races and my favourite; get tellitubbies to fight a t-rex. Just get the game if you dont have it already.TLDR: Greatest game I have played that you can spend countless hours in and wont get bored. Just get it.			",137,10,2,7,14,0,3

												Great game that brings your creativity out into the open. A sandbox game developed for teen and mature players. However, there seem to be a lot of kids in this game and some people may find this annoying. If you're into sandbox games, roleplaying, etc, then you'll like this game. This game has many gamemodes that keep growing everyday. You can write your own gamemodes if you wanted to, but that would take quite a while. There are many fun gamemodes out there like DarkRP, TTT and Jailbreak. Get this game and you won't regret buying it, it's quite a cheap price too with the current summer sale going on! You might want to get CS:S along with this, because there is a lot of content that uses CS:S. HL2:EP1, HL2:Ep2 are also great games that go along with this.			",91,4,1,5,8,0,2

												Garry's mod, one of the most fun games I have ever played.Playing alone, Garry's mod is a good game as you can meet many people across a variety of different servers and gametypes that want to just mess around and have fun. However, Garry's mod is designed to be played with friends and when you have a group of friends together on a Garry's mod server, it makes for some memorable moments that will stick with you for quite some time. I mean, creating a Hoboville in a Role playing server and starting a revolution as a gang of hobos who have ascended to a full crime syndicate; who take over the city and rule under a stinky bugbait fist - is pretty memorable.Role playing servers are not the only servers though, no, there are hundreds of gamemodes to choose from on the easy to use server browser and interface in general. So you just need to play a little of each, see what you like, and get some friends on. Garry's mod gametypes, such as prophunt and murder, are very popular on Youtube at the moment, so there is likely to be an influx in players buying Garry's mod in sales - where it can drop down to as cheap as £1.49. (~$2.44 )Overall Garry's mod is the ultimate 'screw around' game, and if you don't pick it up in a sale you should be sentenced to death by snu snu.			",129,8,0,15,13,1,19

												This game, or rather this software is a PURE GEM!!! This sort of gaming creation framework lets your imagination run wild! And for people whose primary skills aren't design/conception, many (I mean, REALLY MANY) excellents crafts made by community build original, audacious and generally addictively fun multiplayer gamemodes. There are probably more than a 100 mods. All are not equal, but you're sure to find at least half a dozen mods that will entertain you for dozen hours. Among my personal favourites: Prop Hunt (1 team incarnate daily-life objects, other team has to find and destroy them), Trouble in Terrorist Town (x terrorists, >1 traitor, many possibilities), Melon Bomber (exhilarating Bomberman clone), Bomber Barrel (1 explosive barrel hidden among many, infinite spawn, has to kill all humans in imparted time -killed humains become barrels too), Deathrun (try to run to exit while avoiding traps), Stranded (like Rust or DayZ), Stalker (one powerful alien against marines team) etc...Some gamemodes even propose some ""serious"" (aka time-investing) roleplay. All of this juicy, thrilling, exciting and foremost unique experience for a mere few bucks. And it's Linux-compatible to boot. Really, what are you waiting for? Join us in the fun already!!

You'd expect a game like this to cost atleast $20, but its $10 dollars, and thats assuming it isn't on sale, which is usually $2.49.			",48,2,0,5,3,1,2

												This game is really fun if you're into the Sandbox/Roleplay type games. It has a very friendly community (most of the time) And I also seriously recommend it to people with an open mind or a good imagination. I have over 4,200 hours played on this game, which is kinda sad; but it's just so fun! Give it a try for only $10.00 USD, or you can wait for a Summer Sale, Spring Break, or the sale at Christmas where you can buy the game for only a few dollars. Rating: 9.5/10			",44,5,0,2,3,0,0

												Garry's Mod takes all the characters, effects and props out of all your favorite Source Engine games (such as Counter Strike, Half Life, Portal and many more) , and gives you the tools you may need to make whatever you want.You can weld, rope, pulley, attach a turret and a few thrusters to a chair and fly around shooting at the world aimlessly, with a downloaded Iron Man sNPC shooting you with a pistol.If you think your current games' content isn't enough, you have over 200,000 addons to choose from in the Steam Workshop, adding new tools, weapons, characters, maps and gamemodes.Garry's Mod isn't just a game, it's a strong base for you to build on. Anything you can dream becomes possible in Garry's Mod. Whether that dream is a nightmare is up to youIncredible. Recommended 10/10			",181,28,3,21,15,1,15

												Very fun sandbox game, with even more than that gamemode, examples are DarkRP or something like that. Yes that. But the addons, you can add a lot of things. It's one of the best parts. The best part is that you can mess with the ragdoll's faces.			",24,9,1,4,3,1,2

From things like Trouble in terrorist town, Murder and Prophunt and to something more crazy like The Elevator Mod. This game is great if you play with friends and whilst it differs from person to person what they enjoy you can find lots of different gamemodes always coming out and it will make sure you'll never get bored.

												Gmod is a sandbox game sorta like Terraria Minecraft TF2 and HL2 mixed in one. The controls are the same as HL2 but some changes since it was realesed 2 years after HL2 but its good. The physics are like the ones in TF2 and Terraria when your player falls. The newbies and mingebags are the real problems there having a hard time getting used to it so teach em! Garry's Mod creator is really hard to play with him because he normal spends time in singleplayer or whitelisted servers so ""Yes im the real Garry"" acheivment is sort of impossible to get so dont bother trying to get it. The Rating is over all of a 9/10 to me and removing toybox was a bad idea, we all knew a month ago the addon menu got messed up and i lost my addons too so shut up about it its fine now! So the physics are meh but creation of gmod was the first start of an animation carrer. BUY DIS GAME OR BE LEFT OUT OF ALL THE FUN!			",31,1,3,0,4,2,2

												its gmod. stop being a little ♥♥♥♥♥ and get it already.I'm just kidding. but in all seriousness. you can't go wrong with this game. there is anything and everything to do on it. and its absolutely fun to join RP (roleplaying) servers. only 4,000 people think this game is bad. and they don't even have valid reasons. Just take this for example. What other game can make you overwhelmed with joy by surviving the zombie apocalypse and making forts throughout the map with your friends and raiding other people for their money and supplies. UNDER $10!!??Answer. Only Gmod. And keep in mind... that was only ONE gamemode. out of the thousands you could do. So grab your parents wallet. grab the credit card. spend $10. and blame me for making you buy it with all my decent reasons. Hope you guys enjoy, and see you on Gmod.			",87,5,0,6,11,1,4

												TL;DR: It's a great game, while its not for everybody. it is fun and amazing. but if you dont like sandbox games, simply dont buy it.So, Gmod has been out for a while, and i've made stuff for this here and there. But i was reading reviews and noticed there isn't really a completely indepth review that never talks about making addons for gmod. With all of that out the way, Here we go! (also i know this isn't the best of reviews but its my first real review) The game by itself (No other source games and addons) It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ its just half-life 2 with a few tools and no objective at all. Ha just kidding; the game comes with a gamemode called trouble in terrorist to- o right you need CS:S for that to work properly :/ Community and online interactions The Community is ehh... ok i gues???? theres a lot of nice people here and there but theres ocasionally the little kid that always gets his chode wet over FNAF/Sonic. Theres also some fun Gamemodes like DarkRP and Smash; but beware, if your pc is slow joining server may crash you. The workshop however is a great place, which brings me to my next thing and what i really wanna talk about in this review THE WORKSHOP!	The workshop is where you get all the addons and stuff, it's a great way of sharing things too IMO. things you can find in the workshop are:Custom models & SoundsPlayer modelsCustom weaponsCustom NPCSAnd much much more...(theres also no NSFW content there)There are however some limitations to the things you can get there. And not everything will be perfect and compatible to eachother. The thing that gets me the most however are animations; you can't make custom playermodel animations. And no, it's not a engine limitation. its a fault on Garry's part. You see, view model hands are a great example; they contain no animations and can adapt to other animations made by the creator of whatever addon. Garry, if you ever read this. ♥♥♥♥ing fix that NOW Errors on the community's fault Skip this part if you are not planning to make addons yourself Theres 2 things that bother me the most, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dupes and saves along with recolors, and the lack of documentation. While the dupes and saves things is self explanatory; the documentation is not. To put it simple it took me 5 months to figure out how to ♥♥♥♥ing port. while there is multiple sources. you can never find what you are looking for directly, i never found a guide how to make a playermodel, or how to make a prop or anything like that. you're best off decompiling a model and reverse engineering that♥♥♥♥♥♥  Gameplay with Addons & CS:S	Pretty much one of the funnest things you will ever do, just look through the workshop and think of stuff you could do. Overall review i'll give it a 8.5/10 while it is fun; most of this game is made up by the Community, which while good; its not the best. if you don't like sandboxy games, and games where everything looks cheap and not fancy with amazing graphics; please stay away. And if you like to make stuff for use in a game, This is a great thing to start with. While it is hard to figure out how to do things. It really is worth it.			",57,4,0,2,3,0,1

												Probably the best sandbox physics game I've played, and it has an extremely active community so you can expect constant (and fun) mods to play around with. My favorite mods as of current has to be the Trouble in Terrorist Town mod and the Firearms: Source 2.0 mod. I also enjoy Prophunt and messing around with NPCs. The only downfall to the game is that not only do the mods take up a lot of valuable harddrive space, but playing singleplayer gets lonely very fast.I would recommend this to all my friends, it's a really nice game.8/10			",101,14,3,11,17,2,16

												So I was looking at my list of games most played and it turns out Garry's Mod is snuggled up there in #2nd place, nestled between Team Conga Simulator 2 and Civilization Vee. My old review was so cringe inducing that your face had a high probability of warping inside of itself to avoid reading the♥♥♥♥♥♥linen words. Christ, why was it so cringy? What went through my mind that ultimately led to me vomitting on my keyboard and hitting enter? Man, that's crazy. I don't even remember cleaning vomit off of my keyboard. Maybe that never even happened. Could I be making all this up? Was there ever even a keyboard? How do we know keyboards even exist? What am I typing on? A Keyboard? Oh, okay, I guess they do exist then. It'd be pretty crazy if they didn't though. It'd be as crazy as a mouse not existing. Imagine, a world without mice. Shows like Tom and Jerry would just be called Tom and himself. Or maybe just Tom. Or it could be called ""A Descent Into Madness: The Tomcat Tale."" Oh. I get it. That's why his name is Tom, because of the word ""Tomcat."" But then why is Jerry's name Jerry? Because it rhymes with berry, and it's small like a berry? Or maybe he was named after Jerry Seinfeld? The resemblance is uncanny.Oh, Garry's Mod? Yeah, it's alright.			",264,72,4,31,17,2,23

												So eh... yeah this game is good, there's some  mods (If you whant to call them that) that I can recommendCity Rp is good, Allthough the PD are OP jerkoffs, and you wont trust anyone. Zombie survival is good, allthought beeing the first zombie or beeing the first to die is pretty boring,1942 Rp  is good, ppl will lt you do your think unless you walks in to a KoS restricted area.Dark Rp, Havet figured out why I cant make Casino machines even though Im a casino ownereeh..lets see...oh yes!The vietnam war,  Pretty nice (same damn map all the time as far as I know)Zworld Afterlife is good, reminds most of DayZ where you have to salvage and and craft your stuff. (be wary of players)Im forgeting something... *snaps fingers* (x3)stopitslender is good  dont play it very much.  *(Ey, I run head first with a assault rifle in City Rp running from the cops, so dont call me a coward)*Jailbreak is fun to some extense, but the kid warrans are make or break.I hope you ""like"" this recommendation and gives all mentions above a try.Hey, I had to put up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ music from next door while doing this, So i deserve some credits.*hint*  The list above is not ranked after my favorite list.

												Probably the best sandbox physics game I've played, and it has an extremely active community so you can expect constant (and fun) mods to play around with. My favorite mods as of current has to be the Trouble in Terrorist Town mod and the Firearms: Source 2.0 mod. I also enjoy Prophunt and messing around with NPCs. The only downfall to the game is that not only do the mods take up a lot of valuable harddrive space, but playing singleplayer gets lonely very fast.I would recommend this to all my friends, it's a really nice game.8/10			",101,14,3,11,17,2,16

												So I was looking at my list of games most played and it turns out Garry's Mod is snuggled up there in #2nd place, nestled between Team Conga Simulator 2 and Civilization Vee. My old review was so cringe inducing that your face had a high probability of warping inside of itself to avoid reading the♥♥♥♥♥♥linen words. Christ, why was it so cringy? What went through my mind that ultimately led to me vomitting on my keyboard and hitting enter? Man, that's crazy. I don't even remember cleaning vomit off of my keyboard. Maybe that never even happened. Could I be making all this up? Was there ever even a keyboard? How do we know keyboards even exist? What am I typing on? A Keyboard? Oh, okay, I guess they do exist then. It'd be pretty crazy if they didn't though. It'd be as crazy as a mouse not existing. Imagine, a world without mice. Shows like Tom and Jerry would just be called Tom and himself. Or maybe just Tom. Or it could be called ""A Descent Into Madness: The Tomcat Tale."" Oh. I get it. That's why his name is Tom, because of the word ""Tomcat."" But then why is Jerry's name Jerry? Because it rhymes with berry, and it's small like a berry? Or maybe he was named after Jerry Seinfeld? The resemblance is uncanny.Oh, Garry's Mod? Yeah, it's alright.			",264,72,4,31,17,2,23

												Garry Garry Garry!This is after I hated the game and then got it for my wife and actually loved the game! Graphics: This is a Valve game, what type of graphics do you want from this? Hey are the same as every other Valve game and offer nothing special or amazing, heck these would probably run on a mobile device they are so basic!Audio: The same as above, the audio is the same as all the other Valve games and probably a copy and paste from them... It would not surprise me!Controls: The controls again are the same as above, nothing special but certainly easy to get used too, with the console to bind certain things. Very easy to pickup and play instantly. Game: This is where the game changes from anything else around!It all depends what you want to do in the game because the online has tons of mods from prop hunt (which is everyone's favourite, where you had as a prop like a banana while players hunters you) or death run (basically tomb raider running through an obstacle course trying to survive while another player sets of traps to kill you), GTA, murder, who am I etc etc etc, seriously the list is huge with what game contains and is created... Also the awesome thing is you do not need to download these mods a website, it's all If you do not like any of the above and want to create your own stuff you can, the game is basically a sandbox version of mine craft where you take anything and create anything with a mega tool box built in and you can do and create anything. It's insane!The only problem with the game is texture packs which Steam basically tries to force you to buy all their games, install them and use their textures, but thankfully there is a free workaround allowing you them, drop in file and no errors or problems at all... Google for an answer or read below for how to get around this:Basically go here: {LINK REMOVED}http://kajar9.wix.com/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥2#!downloads/chgdOnce here, press the RED MEGA button for ""GAME CONTENT""Once they are downloaded, extract them and you will get a folder.. Make sure it is not a folder within a folder and then the content... Example ""TF2>TF2>Content"" which is wrong, it should be ""TF2>Content"" then it is correct.  Cut the folder and go to your Steam folder>Steamapps> Common> Garry's Mod> Garry's Mod> Addons (If the folder is not then then create it) and just paste in there.  Do the same for EVERY Game Content that allows you to download, just place, load Garry's Mod and look at the bottom right the Spanner about games and they will show an X but do not worry, load a lobby and you will have perfect textures with no pink and black squares anymore :)You could also do this for the maps folder and place in here, aswell as extract EACH file out and place in the maps folder as one giant load.  Not sure which works best but I did both!Would I recommend this game? Of course, it is a fantastic game offering tons of hours of enjoyment and a huge replay ability.			",868,187,72,84,117,12,187

												Gmod isn't like most games, theres no goal to achieve or a quest to follow, it consist of complete fun, if you and your good friends get together on a server, then you could spend hours playing non-stop and have fun the whole time, it is completly mod-friendly and you can do just about anything. You'd expect a game like this to cost atleast $20, but its $10 dollars, and thats assuming it isn't on sale, which is usually $2.49.			",48,2,0,5,3,1,2

												This game is probably the best way to spend your money, as it offers countless mods to play with. Most of them are well known anyway, thanks to all the youtubers who played them. Trouble in terrorist hunt, prop hunt, hide and seek, deathrun, deathball, all the lifesim game modes, etc. You can download an incredible amount of mods from the worksop too, including items, weapons, wehicles, enemies, etc, and have fun with them with your friends.

												After spending so many hours into this game , I realized many things. Online slowly filled itself with Thousands of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DarkRP servers , aswell as poorly made Sandbox and the list goes on. The online of this game became or completely unfunny or boring (which is pretty much the same when I think about it). Many people might tell me that I'm wrong though.I can't blame too much the graphics since it's on the Source Engine , it's old but not bad. Although what I can really blame is the updates. The game isn't updated enough so you sometimes stay with poor glitches that are almost never fixed. Addons also have their part , since no support is given to them (which I completely understand) , your game can crash for no reason. And once you have one broken addon , good luck fixing the problem especially if you have more than 30. Talking about crashes , the game can corrupt files , I am not joking , sometimes Garry's Mod can corrupt files from many games such as Half Life 2 or Left 4 Dead and other games. Fixing this can take a while and is annoying , sometimes forcing you to uninstall the game completely. Rare corruption will sometimes crash your Steam , and then ...... It'll be the turn of your PC. No joke that happened to me more than 5 times.I don't want to write a book about what's wrong or what's right so I'll end it there. Buy this game if you want to play with friends or on Solo , but multiplayer is not a fun place to go , you have my word on that.			",72,5,0,1,3,1,20

												If freedom is your thing, this is probably your best bet.If newbie friendly is your thing... Run.Garry's Mod is possibly #1 in endless content. (If you know what you're doing.)However, it's very buggy. And this game will crash on you more often than you can say banana.And this game is very user content heavy, and a mod of Half-Life 2. In which it NEEDS a 17+ player base. But 3/4ths the players you will meet will be little children screaming into the mics and trying to wreck everything you do.Basically; Buy it. Just don't expect anything to work, and don't expect to have a good time.(But you never know, you might find a place to be in this game.)			",128,7,5,19,26,3,29

Garry's Mod game reviewAbout the gameGarry's Mod (GMod) is a singleplayer and multiplayer sandbox physics game by Garry Newman.Many mods, custom content, many games and modes. Good buy. The community generated content is great and the amount of creativity within the game itself is absolutely amazing. There are custom game types, skins, buildings, models, textures, maps, softwares and a whole lot more.Pros:Availability of mapsAmount of contentMinigame and RPG serversCreativity levelCons:Can take some time joining another user's server (downloading custom content)Sometimes see ""Error"" signs instead of the actual object (if there is custom content)Restrictions on some items in certain serversFPS problems if there are to many objects on screen			",200,68,7,22,11,2,22

												So I looked in my reviews section and I had seen I didn't write a review for Garry's Mod. I thought to myself ""Holy crap, how have I not made one for Gmod yet?"", hence the reason why you are seeing this review now.Garry's Mod is, as the description portrays, a physics sandbox. They give you the tools and the rest is up to you. It's a very simple concept, but it goes a long way. In Gmod, literally anything is possible. You can play a first-person version of Clue, plant explosive melons on people, kill NPCs with props, and so much more. Possibilites are only limited to your imagination, and with the help of its great workshop base, you can spend countless hours trying out new addons.The reason I like Gmod is because of all these, but also because it isn't just a game. To me, Garry's Mod is more of a tool. When used correctly, you can create stunning works of art with ragdolls and post-processing effects. My digital art skills have been improved (and more or less acquired) through the use of Gmod. All of my current profile pictures were created in Gmod, regardless of whether they have been modified in SAI or not. Take into consideration also, the hundreds of Gmod artists that create a range of artworks, from simple screenshots to SFM-quality posters. Gmod's potential as a tool is what draws me the most to it, and I think that for this reason artists as well as players can pick it up and play it.I rate Gmod a 9/10. It's quite honestly better than any art creation program possible, since you can do everything right within the game itself. ",69,8,0,3,3,0,2

 Introduction Garry's Mod. A fun, sandbox-style, do-what-you-want kind of game. At least, that's what it's advertised as, and what people say about it. Garry's Mod, is, however, very unique. The base game is one gamemode and 2 maps, with HL2 content such as weapons and props. That's about it. What provides the magnitude of content is the community itself. Since it's release, there has been a plethora of content added and created for this quite simple mod. So why would I, someone with over 2000 hours of this game, not recommend this game? There's a ton of reasons for this, and I could legitimately write a book about it, but I'm going to boil it down to a set of main ideas. Gamemodes Gamemodes are, strictly speaking, the heart of Garry's Mod. There are a range of gamemodes available, each with their own interesting rules and gameplay. Or, at least there would be, if it wasn't for the fact that literally only about 5 of these gamemodes are played, and have oversaturated the server browser. These are; Trouble in Terrorist Town, Murder, DarkRP (Or any very mildly modified varient, they all count), Prop Hunt, and Deathrun. I'm leaving Sandbox out of it, because it's Sandbox. Let's boil these down to what they should be, and what they actually are:1. Trouble in Terrorist TownTrouble in Terrorist Town, or TTT for short, is a gamemode where you're meant to find out which of your comrades are Traitors, and eliminate them, or kill everyone else if you're the Traitors yourself. On the face of it, it's quite intriguing. You do this by investigating bodies, and determine which of your fellow terrorists are not what they seem, based on location at time of death, weapon, and if they were seen committing the deed. However, what it really is is an oversaturation of addons that do not work together, dropping framerates and killing any sense of mystery (Because they wear ♥♥♥♥ing cosmetics!), overly abusive admins who usually are 12 and paid for it using Mum's credit card, trigger-happy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who thought sniffing the air around them was construed as an attempt on their life, and then yell ""RDM"" at the top of their lungs to every available admin, who will then ban at request without investigating claims. It takes about 50 hours of  pulling your hair out  searching through all servers to find an actual decent one.2. MurderOh, boy, did you expect a paragraph? Well, you're out of luck, this gamemode has literally been made for YouTubers, and it is a dumbed-down version of TTT, except there are NO good servers. At all. Next.3. DarkRPDarkRP. A place where dreams go to die and people pretend to be someone else. Which is odd, because on the face of it, it looks like people could be extremely creative and have fun. ON THE FACE OF IT. The idea is you can get various ""Jobs"" in city life, or make your own if you're just a basic citizen. The only real rules that are universal is the fact that you don't kill people without reason, and if you die you don't get to remember your previous life. But, in reality, very few jobs are actually played, usually as a result of server rules preventing you from doing anything actually fun. As well as this, server owners again oversaturate the server with about 50000 different addons and have a 60-slot server, which then results in 200 ping and laggy-as-♥♥♥♥ gameplay even if the server is shoved right up your♥♥♥♥♥ 4. Prop HuntProp Hunt is as it is. You hide as a variety of props, and hide from the Hunters, and the Hunters look for props. I actually don't have an issue with this mode, except for the universal oversaturated addons list and laggy servers as a result. Some server are vanilla Prop Hunt, and not much can then go wrong. 5. DeathrunDeathrun is Deathrun. Runners try to avoid traps set off by Death, and you are eliminated on death. Runners try to survive and then kill Death, and Death kills all runners with traps. Sounds simple. HOWEVER, because of the nature of this mode, which is no element of mystery, server owners fill it with pointshop loot that you sometimes have to pay REAL MONEY for to get, as well as 187562 different large-as mods and voice lines which clog the server up and renders the game unplayable, due to lag. And as a side-effect, the players get 200 ping at about 12 players on the server, even if you again, for some reason, decide to put the server box right up your ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥ Addons Addons are what adds to the experience of Sandbox, by adding numerous vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, NPC's, models, props, and effects. Now, this sounds fine, if it weren't for the way the main distribution platform worked. Oh boy, strap yourselves in, it's going to be a bumpy ride!1. The Steam Workshop, Garrysmod.org, Toybox, and youNow, you may be thinking, ""What are those two latter distribution platforms?"". Well, as of nowadays, they're a graveyard. But before Gmod 13, these were the main sources of addons. This had its disadvantages and advantages, because it meant going directly into your Gmod folders and manually placing addons, and actually going onto these websites directly in the case of Garrysmod.org, or downloading an addon which you had to access in a menu on Gmod, but this then meant it wasn't always there clogging your addons list, in the case of Toybox. This difficulty to install and upload was a godsend, because this meant you usually only found high-quality, good content that people had made. The Steam Workshop, however, is an easy distribution platform which allows content creators to develop and share their work with the players of Garry's Mod. Well that does work to an extent like that. BUT! Because saves and dupes can also be uploaded, as well as the ignorable bad addons, you get a wide selection of 7 year olds making bad poses, machines, prop constructions, and overly used memes, you're best not looking for them. And they usually aren't popular. But they are if they involve one thing.2. The Cancer of Five Nights at Freddy's""OH, GOODY, I'M GOING TO MADE FOXY ♥♥♥♥ FREDDY IN HIS GAPING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥""- Every ♥♥♥♥ing FNaF fan ever.These guys. These walking tumours are usually too afraid to play the actual games themselves, but buy them to support their shrine for Scott Cawthon, download all the FNaF addons that Gmod has to offer, which are uploaded by 7 year olds with talent, and make really terribly posed ragdolls, usually beg for 5 stars, and then because of the amount of kids on Gmod because of an issue I haven't brought up, they make it to the front page of the Steam Workshop! Like, how even is that possible? And to add insult to injury, they also do it on the FNaF maps, but the ones with no events, because they're so ♥♥♥♥ing scared of the actual game. And then they ACTUALLY GET 5 STARS. A FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S SAVE MAKES IT TO THE FRONT PAGE AND PUSHES DESERVING ADDONS DOWN INTO THE CESSPIT OF HELL. The Community Now, as I'm sure you know, the game is filled to the brim with 10 year olds. This wasn't so prevalent back in the day, before the  Resonance Cascade  the introduction of a certain set of people.The YouTube Influx of 2013This basically ruined Gmod of today. The popular YouTubers brought in a wave of ♥♥♥♥ing fanboys who flocked to the servers running the gamemodes they were playing. People who actually played the more alternate gamemodes lost people, and then the servers running them died, transforming Garry's Mod into a lifeless husk of its former self, filled with kids and cancer. Conclusion Gmod is a game I simply cannot recommend based on these reasons, if you're wanting to play it for the extreme variety of gamemodes. If you want it to play with your friends, and ONLY your friends, it's a very fun game (This is literally the only reason I still play it.) But for any other reason, steer clear. This game is not what it once was.			",62,3,3,0,1,0,1

Whether it be a horror (morbus) a survival-simulation (stranded) all the way to being a drug-dealing hobo, (DarkRP) you can be it or play in in Garry's Mod.As you can see by my play hours, I would definitely reccomend it.

												This game is quite fun and can be very enjoyable though it has numerous problems.This game is extremely un-user friendly. Missing textures, missing maps, 1 hour load times for servers. I would say 20% of my Gmod play time has been loading screens. That is not an exaggeration. A positive of the game is that it is essentially an engine where many other games can exist, so while I have played this game the most out of any other game I have ever owned in my Steam library, it is really a game with many smaller games inside of it so it never gets ""old"". For it's price it is an amazing game which you will play for years to come but after playing this game for over 1000 hours I can begin to see it's faults. If your friends have this game and you don't...well then you better go buy it and join in on the fun!			",88,12,2,10,7,0,9

												Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you.

												Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game. I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.			",83,9,0,7,10,1,0

												Come on, how can you not like this game, if you somehow never heard of it, then hopefully this will persuade you to consider getting it. In short you can do practically anything. Roleplay, building, murduring your friends with guns. Also, say you don't want to go to a pre-built world, you want to make things your way, you can go to multiple different sandboxes to do lots of things. Drive cars, kill NPC's from multiple games such as half-life and team fortress 2 or build your own city. AND don't forget the workshop where you can get even more weapons, props, NPC's (such as hitler and master cheif) vehicles, or basically anything you can think of. I highly recommend this game for if you are ever bored or just looking to have fun doing anything you want, this game is for you.			",91,12,1,3,4,1,3

												Gmod is a great game. It's got hours of fun and you can really do anything you can think of. The best part about it is that when you seem to have ran out of stuff to do, just go to the workshop. They usually have some really fun stuff for anybody. I also really like the multiplayer. I met a lot of good people and most of my friends on multiplayer. There is a lot of good game modes too from the mystery of murder or Trouble in Terrorrist Town (TTT) to the suspense of The Stalker (a Gmod version of The Hidden) and Prop Hunt. You can also play a game mode called DarkRP (Role Play) where you can pretend to be part of a society and you have a job and stuff like that. However if you just feel like building or fooling around with your friends then Sandbox is the game mode for you. Overall I really recommend this game to anybody. It's really awesome and definitely one of my favorite games. One thing you might want to be warned about though is that you might want Counter Strike Source when you get it because without it sometimes it has some issues with textures and stuff like that but that's pretty much it. I hope this review helped you and have fun! :D			",35,0,0,3,3,0,0

												A truly wonderful game which has almost unlimited possibilities. Sure, there are the FPS-style modes like TTT, but if you just want to play at a much slower pace there are modes such as Cinema and SledBuild. Also, if you want to dedicate a lot of time into it, you can pose character models from, say, TF2, and create a stop-motion video. Garry's Mod satisfies a large variety of gamers with its different modes, and that makes it something special.			",83,7,11,0,14,1,4

												Garry's mod is wonderfully made, and is a staple for any Steam owner. The many gamemodes allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing. Don't like TTT? Try Dark RP. Don't like Dark RP? Try elevator source. There's so many, it's literally impossible to get bored with this game. Not to mention many, many laughs had in multiplayer. I would reccomend the multiplayer more than the singleplayer, just because it's that much more fun with other people. When you start out, though, just mess around in single player to figure out the controls and such. If you get bored with the regular content, there are thousands upon thousands of mods to download! This is a great game, and is getting better all the time.			",19,3,0,4,2,0,1

												Gmod is basically your 5 year old nephew describing the last episode of transformers in a video game. It's random, insane but awesome at the same time. There are tons of gamemodes to try (My favorite is murder) and in sandbox mode you can basically do anything. The one downside is placing things in sandbox can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥but otherwise it's great. It is a mod, so if I should recommend any one game to go with it it would be Counter Strike: Source. Gmod gets a 8.5 out of 10.			",143,48,3,25,17,5,19

												I don't think I've ever played a game longer than Garry's Mod. Ever since gmod 9 I have been building various interests of the mind and playing so many different gamemodes that this game should be considered multiple games in one. Although the community isn't as strong today as it was, there is no better place to make a server with friends and build random creations to the hearts content. (or until one of your ""friends"" blows your♥♥♥♥♥♥up) I should also mention the better part of the online community now is made up of rp'ers or people playing trouble in terrorist town.

												Probably the most fun game I ever played. It's limitless, you can do whatever you want in it, and it has many different gamemodes like Trouble in Terrorist Town, Prop Hunt, Murder, Melonbomber, Elevator: Source, Zombie Survival and many more which are just awesome! :DYou can create things, make them explode, make and kill zombies, kill people and so many other things. It's a sandbox game that is one of the best of all!Update (April, 2016): The multiplayer part of this game is absolute cancer. ANY server you find will have an absolute trash community and will be infested with annoying kids and other idiots. As well as constant updates to the game that end up breaking it. This game is not what it used to be anymore. ",409,145,18,53,59,4,69

												Garry's Mod is a must buy for anyone, not just certain people I think everyone will get a good slice out of this game.  As of now I've put in about 384 hours into this game and let me tell you every hour was filled with fun with friends and creativity.  This game is not only really cheap but there are so many things you can do prefering to your tastes. If you're more of a singleplayer person you can go into singleplayer sandbox and just build creations with the amazing tools this game gives you to create things.  Want to make a rocket bathtub? Just add some thrusters and your dreams come true.  Garry's Mod also has a wide selection of multiplayer gametypes also; Some famous ones are TTT, Murder, Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek and many others.  All in all this game is definitley reccomended and has a great workshop community. 10/10			",157,7,1,14,10,1,2

												The best 10$ I have ever spent. This game is the best thing I have. If you don't know already, it is a game that is based off of mods and random things. Like for an example, Darkrp is a mod for Gay's Mod, it's suppose to be real life role play but filled with little kids. Then there is another called HL2RP. Very serious role play and fun if done correctly. If your not into role playing, then go to sand box and create random anything. Cars, mess with ragdolls, fly around, make props fly, ect. It's loaded with randomness random of fun			",56,2,0,4,4,0,3

And if you have the time, skill and tools, you can even make whatever you want to use in it. (Or even use the game itself as a tool.)Let your creativity or stupidity flourish, and your boredom vanish.-It's basically the best ten dollars you'll ever spend.			",82,11,16,3,4,0,9

												This game is amazing. you can do anything. You can download mods. You can get hats. you can blow up Wallace Breen over and over again. Need i say more? This game is so expansive. there is always so much to do. Sure, it can lag and crash, and you need quite a few things to get it perfect, but in the end, it is amazing. i play it on a sub-par pc with craploads of addons to make the game run smoothly, and it works. Overall, if you have a brain cell or two, you would get this game. Also, have you SEEN the workshop for this game. FREAKING HUGE. so much cool stuff. so yea, get this game, idiot. get it and be amazed.			",73,1,0,6,2,0,2

												Hmm, garry's mod to start off is a unique game. Like a game that doesnt need even a bit of mods, like why do u need mods if the whole game is like a huge mod xD.It is alot of fun just to play sandbox alone spawning tons of zombies then droping a 10x10 concrete block on them .And especially playing something like prop hunt with friends via skype, the laughs and giggles xD , priceless...The only bad thing is the downloading, every server requires some specific file to be downloaded , but if u chose like 2,3 servers for your favourite game moods , u can play them later without downloading all the stuff again !9/10 from me :D			",119,22,5,10,16,2,21

												Amazing game. Garry's Mod gives you the most hours of fun of any game, because there is so much to do. I personally like the Gamemodes more than Sandbox, but Sandbox can be quite fun with friends too. When you are done messing around with planes, tanks, Gordon Freeman and a refridgerator in Sandbox, you can play Trouble in Terrorist Town. When you are done with that, you can go and do Prop Hunt with some friends. After that you can do Zombie Survival, some Roleplay (which is one of the worst gamemodes in my opinion, but who am I?) or another gamemode of the many you can choose out. And afterwards, you can repeat the process! I definitely find Trouble in Terrorist Town with +/- 20 players the most fun of Garry's Mod, but pretty much anything on this game is fun! Highly recommended, this will give you a high playcount. 255 hours for me so far, many more to come. 9/10.			",272,58,32,25,57,3,42

Only bad part is that you need Counter Strike Source to not have errors in most gamemodes. This game is DEFINATELY worth the $25 you spend on it. Get it. Try it. If you dont like a gamemode, go play a different. I found some I play for hours upon hours. None get boring. BUY THIS GAME			",291,73,3,38,27,5,35

												You will straight away blown away by how much content has been packed into this game and how brilliant the community is. It was a genius idea to make a sandbox using the Source engine, and just the fact that you can have the Heavy and G-Man high-five eachother is awesome. Some people may not like the bugs, but luckily they're more funny than game-breaking. Plus this game never runs out of things to do, since it supports modding and online multiplayer. 9/10.

												A truly wonderful game which has almost unlimited possibilities. Sure, there are the FPS-style modes like TTT, but if you just want to play at a much slower pace there are modes such as Cinema and SledBuild. Also, if you want to dedicate a lot of time into it, you can pose character models from, say, TF2, and create a stop-motion video. Garry's Mod satisfies a large variety of gamers with its different modes, and that makes it something special.			",83,7,11,0,14,1,4

It's a sandbox game that is one of the best of all!Update (April, 2016): The multiplayer part of this game is absolute cancer. ANY server you find will have an absolute trash community and will be infested with annoying kids and other idiots. As well as constant updates to the game that end up breaking it.

												Garry's mod is wonderfully made, and is a staple for any Steam owner. The many gamemodes allow you to figure out what you enjoy doing. Don't like TTT? Try Dark RP. Don't like Dark RP? Try elevator source. There's so many, it's literally impossible to get bored with this game. Not to mention many, many laughs had in multiplayer. I would reccomend the multiplayer more than the singleplayer, just because it's that much more fun with other people. When you start out, though, just mess around in single player to figure out the controls and such. If you get bored with the regular content, there are thousands upon thousands of mods to download! This is a great game, and is getting better all the time.			",19,3,0,4,2,0,1

												Amazing game. Garry's Mod gives you the most hours of fun of any game, because there is so much to do. I personally like the Gamemodes more than Sandbox, but Sandbox can be quite fun with friends too. When you are done messing around with planes, tanks, Gordon Freeman and a refridgerator in Sandbox, you can play Trouble in Terrorist Town. When you are done with that, you can go and do Prop Hunt with some friends. After that you can do Zombie Survival, some Roleplay (which is one of the worst gamemodes in my opinion, but who am I?) or another gamemode of the many you can choose out. And afterwards, you can repeat the process! I definitely find Trouble in Terrorist Town with +/- 20 players the most fun of Garry's Mod, but pretty much anything on this game is fun! Highly recommended, this will give you a high playcount. 255 hours for me so far, many more to come. 9/10.			",272,58,32,25,57,3,42

												WHAT on EARTH isn't there to like about this game? (Or mod, should I say.)You can do literally ANYTHING with it. -It's like a sandbox but without the messy sand that gets all in your sandals and annoys you the rest of the day.If you want anything you can think of in the game, you can most likely download it from garrysmod.org. And if you have the time, skill and tools, you can even make whatever you want to use in it. (Or even use the game itself as a tool.)Let your creativity or stupidity flourish, and your boredom vanish.-It's basically the best ten dollars you'll ever spend.			",82,11,16,3,4,0,9

 Garry's Mod To review ""Garry's Mod"" is really not that easy...Then people ask what im doing when playing Gmod i always say ""What i want!"" because you can literally do what you want, there is so many game mods and they never look the same, its like playing a new game everytime you try out a new game mode.There's so many ways to describe this game... but i still cannot do it, you have to play to understand.It is really a ""must have"" on steam! 10/10  ",150,52,5,18,34,5,26

												Garry's Mod (GMod) Developed by Garry Newman in his Facepunch Studios, is a Source engine powered sandbox game that is unbelievably funny.Released it 2004 (same year when Source engine was released) and it wasn't been forgotten since.1,000+ funny and useful addons to download in the Steam Workshop.You can do literally anything with the .lua and Source engine combined such as modelling and scripting.The not-so recent 13 update broke almost every addon that existed. But also added ALOT of new features. Such as Kinect controlling.Garry's Mod is an unforgettable game that made internet so funny with G-Man and TF2 classes.Main objective of this game is having fun and wasting time with friends or doing posters/videos.

												This game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games, the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell. The wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. The funnest game modes for me were TTT, Basewars and Minigames, which is where I spent the majority of my Garry's Mod time. There are also servers that you can relax on, such as the Cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. If you have yet to play/buy this game, I would really recommend you get this as I would describe it as a necessity for any PC Gamer.9.5/10			",335,51,7,31,31,5,40

												Garry's Mod is a must buy for anyone, not just certain people I think everyone will get a good slice out of this game.  As of now I've put in about 384 hours into this game and let me tell you every hour was filled with fun with friends and creativity.  This game is not only really cheap but there are so many things you can do prefering to your tastes. If you're more of a singleplayer person you can go into singleplayer sandbox and just build creations with the amazing tools this game gives you to create things.  Want to make a rocket bathtub? Just add some thrusters and your dreams come true.  Garry's Mod also has a wide selection of multiplayer gametypes also; Some famous ones are TTT, Murder, Prop Hunt, Hide and Seek and many others.  All in all this game is definitley reccomended and has a great workshop community. 10/10			",157,7,1,14,10,1,2

												I have played garry's mod for a very long time.  Warning right now if you are going to get the game you will NEED counter strike soruce unless you want to play only singleplayer.  You can still play multiplayer without css but you will have no textures and you can't even see where you are.  This game combinds a lot of the soruce made games like half life series along with counterstrike soruce with some portal.  This can be fun for doing endless asortment of things on sandbox like screwing around with the charecters the physics like changing the gravity to installing addons or gamemodes that have a huge effect on the game.  This reminds me of minecraft in a way because minecraft once you get board of it you can just mod it to turn it more interesting.  Game still has not gotten old to me and I personaly think it is the best game I have ever played so far.  I highly recomend this game the only downside I can think of is when you are going on servers with a lot of addons like darkRP sometimes how they interact with your client/game can make it glitchy and cause problems.  This is easy to fix usauly just some lua errors.Deffinitly have to buy this game if you are considering it.  I have somewhere around 558 hours on the game.			",68,3,0,4,2,0,2

IT'S ENDLESS...And i love it. You even get Tf2 ragdolls/props/maps. if you have tf2 and G-mod And THATS NOT ALL FOLKS... it comes with halflife/Counterstrike ragdolls to (With the game!) (And maps and props come with the game as well!)though the only down side lets say you DONT have counterstrike and lets say download... The Fnaf map. It will mostly be missing textures/errors-_-Yes i know ive may of went to far with the stuff in this game but it's true. I truly recommend this game for you  people who dont have it already			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garry's Mod is a modification for a Source Engine which gets you ability to create, destroy, build, connect, guide, fight, pose, construct, and mess around. You can do crearly ANYTHING.GameplayOn a spawn, you've got a set of standard weapons for HL2 (crowbar, gravity gun, pistol, 357, smg, ar2, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, grenade) and a special Physics Gun, which makes you able to manipulate props, people and whatever. You can spawn content from all (installed) Source Games and even download custom models/maps/sounds/saves/weapons/etc from a Steam Workshop. Playing multiplayer is as fun as playing alone. Crazy addons makes it even more fun!MultiplayerWell, its more fun than singleplayer - I just lied to you, sorry. In multiplayer you can't only build with people.. you can play random gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town or Cinema! You can be a prop and hide from everyone; you can be a terrorist and act like a innocent man; you can watch YouTube videos with everyone... there are even gamemodes for racing and talking in public!WorkshopIt gives you very big ability to download and share your creations with others. Like I said: files/maps/models/textures/sounds/npcs/vehicles/helicopters/weapons and much much more makes you spend 15hours a day in a freakin Gmod.So...GMod is one of the most creative games I've ever played. Nothing more to say - this game is worth its price.9.5/10			",82,15,5,8,6,0,12

												Pros :+ TONS of fun community-created games+ Lots of cool mods that will help you in sandbox mode+ You're free to make anything.It's really fun.Cons :- Very hard to learn how to have fun in sandbox mode.Spent hours watching YouTube for Garry's Mod tutorials.- Yes,I understand they are trying to keep the classics.But don't you think it's better to make another version of Garry's Mod with improved graphics ?- Had a really hard time finding server with good pings and full of people.I guess no asians play this game.For those people who don't know what game is this,this game's main goal is to give you the power to make your own game.That's why I keep saying sandbox mode in Pros and Cons.There is a sandbox mode where you are completely free to do anything and to build anything.This is not a classic shooting game.But of course,there are a lot of completed games available for you to play.

												Absolutely a wonderfull game. I recommend it to everyone who did not try it yet. You'll find something you will like, here you can build, kill, play role games and do any other things which you can only imagine. Potential of this game has no bounds, there are tones of servers with differend gamemodes running, hundreds of thousands players playing, pile of content from steam workshop and other source engine games like CS:GO or Portal 2. If you like using your imagination and having lots of fun - this game is what you're looking for!			",31,0,0,3,1,0,1

												Garry's Mod is an amazing game. No matter how long you play, you can always find something new on the workshop to mess around with. Many mods to try out and game modes. Furthermore you can use the props and tools to make basically anything. There isn't many games where you can place down a portal in front of you and behind you and throw a brick in to the portal. The brick then hits you causing you to ragdoll and fly throw the portals continuously. 10/10 would throw brick in to the portal again. ",199,59,5,9,11,3,8

												best building game ever! you can do sandbox or ttt (the game's games).what can you play that is NOT the game's game,that is what is called,gamemodes.the most played gamemode i think is darkrp.you can modufiy sandbox with addons.the most cilcked addon is wires mod.some peaple make gmod movies but more peaple jest do photo shop instead.alot of gamemodes need two or more player to start like zombie survival,in zombie survival one player playes as a zombie and 1 other player playes as a person.the person go hiding,blocking or attacking.the zombie,attack.if you are thinking that ""i sot you sed this is a building game NOT a game/game/game/game!"". the building part of the game is in sandbox and that is the game's mane and the first gamemode for my that makes it a building game.i sey you shoed play this game so you know all the stuff that comes out of this game.(p.s all my friend have garry's mod XD).

												This game was pretty much the basis of me becoming more interested in games, the same goes for alot of other gamers aswell. The wide variety of game modes and addons bring more hours of fun to the game. The funnest game modes for me were Stranded, Deathrun and Dark rp which is where I spent the majority of my Garry's Mod time. There are also servers that you can relax on, such as the Cinema servers, and watch what you and those around you are interested in. If you have yet to play/buy this game, I would really recommend you get this as I would describe it as a necessity for any PC Gamer			",49,3,0,7,3,1,5

												Pros :+ TONS of fun community-created games+ Lots of cool mods that will help you in sandbox mode+ You're free to make anything.It's really fun.Cons :- Very hard to learn how to have fun in sandbox mode.Spent hours watching YouTube for Garry's Mod tutorials.- Yes,I understand they are trying to keep the classics.But don't you think it's better to make another version of Garry's Mod with improved graphics ?- Had a really hard time finding server with good pings and full of people.I guess no asians play this game.For those people who don't know what game is this,this game's main goal is to give you the power to make your own game.That's why I keep saying sandbox mode in Pros and Cons.There is a sandbox mode where you are completely free to do anything and to build anything.This is not a classic shooting game.But of course,there are a lot of completed games available for you to play.

												Here's an idea1) Gather 7-8 people2) Go to a roleplaying server3) Become the weapons dealer4) Get guns and sell them for a low price to your friends5) Ridicule amount for everyone else6) If they complain, find out where they are on the map and demolish them and anyone around7) Do it until the people leave or you get kicked8) If you get kicked, join another server9) Repeat steps 1-8Love this game.

												Garry's Mod is an amazing game. No matter how long you play, you can always find something new on the workshop to mess around with. Many mods to try out and game modes. Furthermore you can use the props and tools to make basically anything. There isn't many games where you can place down a portal in front of you and behind you and throw a brick in to the portal. The brick then hits you causing you to ragdoll and fly throw the portals continuously. 10/10 would throw brick in to the portal again. ",199,59,5,9,11,3,8

												Garry's Mod is a modification for a Source Engine which gets you ability to create, destroy, build, connect, guide, fight, pose, construct, and mess around. You can do crearly ANYTHING.GameplayOn a spawn, you've got a set of standard weapons for HL2 (crowbar, gravity gun, pistol, 357, smg, ar2, shotgun, crossbow, rpg, grenade) and a special Physics Gun, which makes you able to manipulate props, people and whatever. You can spawn content from all (installed) Source Games and even download custom models/maps/sounds/saves/weapons/etc from a Steam Workshop. Playing multiplayer is as fun as playing alone. Crazy addons makes it even more fun!MultiplayerWell, its more fun than singleplayer - I just lied to you, sorry. In multiplayer you can't only build with people.. you can play random gamemodes like Prop Hunt, Trouble in Terrorist Town or Cinema! You can be a prop and hide from everyone; you can be a terrorist and act like a innocent man; you can watch YouTube videos with everyone... there are even gamemodes for racing and talking in public!WorkshopIt gives you very big ability to download and share your creations with others. Like I said: files/maps/models/textures/sounds/npcs/vehicles/helicopters/weapons and much much more makes you spend 15hours a day in a freakin Gmod.So...GMod is one of the most creative games I've ever played.

From Murderer to Prophunt, Gmod has it all!Dont worry about getting bored, that wont happen for anytime soon,  i played this for about 11.5hours already, and i loved it all.

												This game wasn't the best before the update, but thanks a lot garry, you ♥♥♥♥ed over garry's mod and all your former fans. Propkilling is filled with gays, autistic kids, and general bonehead shitcunts. Builders are filled with 8-12 year olds, DarkRP is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, and you invited wannabe gamer ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like pewdiepie into the game, and they act as if they've known gmod and played it since the beginning. Overall, before update, 8/10, after update, 1/50. I hate to say I hate the new gmod and everyone in it. All the gmod Veterans are gone, and all that's left are autistic wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trolls, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like mikethanh (AKA Kelvin Evan). The game actually just infuriates me when I play it, I've never seen such a paradise be destroyed except during the great hurricane of chile, and the islands around it.  You ruined the game garry, you ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it.The community is ruined too, nobody with an IQ over 10 plays the ♥♥♥♥ing game anymore! It's an autistic child's paradise, and it ♥♥♥♥ing pisses me off, I officially quit playing codependently with anybody on this ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			",86,5,0,3,6,0,2

												best building game ever! you can do sandbox or ttt (the game's games).what can you play that is NOT the game's game,that is what is called,gamemodes.the most played gamemode i think is darkrp.you can modufiy sandbox with addons.the most cilcked addon is wires mod.some peaple make gmod movies but more peaple jest do photo shop instead.alot of gamemodes need two or more player to start like zombie survival,in zombie survival one player playes as a zombie and 1 other player playes as a person.the person go hiding,blocking or attacking.the zombie,attack.if you are thinking that ""i sot you sed this is a building game NOT a game/game/game/game!"". the building part of the game is in sandbox and that is the game's mane and the first gamemode for my that makes it a building game.i sey you shoed play this game so you know all the stuff that comes out of this game.(p.s all my friend have garry's mod XD).

												If you're into Minecraft and expect much more, then Garry's Mod is for you! It has alot more features and is kind of a step up. Garry's Mod has a ton of workshop items to play around with. Wether you like to make animations or just have fun, you can have addons galore with this game. I totally recomend it. Played Garry's Mod for 678 Hours, Totally worth it!10/10 Would play again.3/23/2015 Edit: Well this game is life, over 2000 hours now. Totally worth it.			",82,4,0,8,3,0,2

												This game wasn't the best before the update, but thanks a lot garry, you ♥♥♥♥ed over garry's mod and all your former fans. Propkilling is filled with gays, autistic kids, and general bonehead shitcunts. Builders are filled with 8-12 year olds, DarkRP is just ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, and you invited wannabe gamer ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s like pewdiepie into the game, and they act as if they've known gmod and played it since the beginning. Overall, before update, 8/10, after update, 1/50. I hate to say I hate the new gmod and everyone in it. All the gmod Veterans are gone, and all that's left are autistic wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥ trolls, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like mikethanh (AKA Kelvin Evan). The game actually just infuriates me when I play it, I've never seen such a paradise be destroyed except during the great hurricane of chile, and the islands around it.  You ruined the game garry, you ♥♥♥♥ing ruined it.The community is ruined too, nobody with an IQ over 10 plays the ♥♥♥♥ing game anymore! It's an autistic child's paradise, and it ♥♥♥♥ing pisses me off, I officially quit playing codependently with anybody on this ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.			",86,5,0,3,6,0,2

												This game is really great and i do recommend this game. Why? I'll tell you. (Just in case you dont know or dont have it and want it of course!)The mods in this game are endless. You want Fnaf? Heres Fnaf mods. Want undertale? heres undertale mods! want weapons heres an endless amount of weapons. like anime/Vocaloid?, Here you go, Want skins/ragdolls? Here you GO. Want gamemodes other than sandbox heres murder,prop hunt,jail break,etc.Tired of singer player and want multiplayer and ect. Here it is multiplayer AND in game voice chat! IT'S ENDLESS...And i love it. You even get Tf2 ragdolls/props/maps. if you have tf2 and G-mod And THATS NOT ALL FOLKS... it comes with halflife/Counterstrike ragdolls to (With the game!) (And maps and props come with the game as well!)though the only down side lets say you DONT have counterstrike and lets say download... The Fnaf map. It will mostly be missing textures/errors-_-Yes i know ive may of went to far with the stuff in this game but it's true. I truly recommend this game for you  people who dont have it already			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best sandbox game there is for a rediculous cheap price. You can do almost anything in this game, because there is so much community content that let's you play for many hours. Be sure to also get other Source games like Counter-Strike: Source, this will give you even more textures and model to play with in Garry's Mod. You can even play the Half-Life 2 story in Garry's mod with access to all the stuff you downloaded from the Garry's Mod Workshop.			",61,2,1,13,3,0,7

												This game honestly can't truthly be rated as a whole. As there are so many gamemodes always out there that it would take so long to try out each one and and gather an opinion on it. I do however enjoy this game, as there are always new things to try different servers with different things so not even the gamemodes servers themselves the same. As it is always changing and when you play the game you can never know what to expect. I highly recommend this game, the community can be awesome on this game it always depends on the server. I hope you all have as much fun as I am.			",63,6,0,6,6,1,1

												Garry's Mod is purely driven by the community, the fun I personally found came from the variety of gamemodes and servers that the community offered me. I've wasted hour upon hour playing Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, along you can be sure to find something you like yourself.Aside from the community gamemodes, it does offer Sandbox mode, which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools, including ones you can easily download from the Workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels.

 For a game like this that was made in 2006... I really missed out on a lot back in the good old days of steamGarry's Mod is a very intresting game with some quite detailed and fun mods made from the ""Steam Workshop"" that our lovely people in the Steam Community has made for us too use. Before we go with anything else, let me list what I find intresting about this game :~ Gamemode's change this whole game into something new that we play and have fun with~ Sandbox one of the most popular gamemodes (for Singleplayer) to test Mods and make Posters~ DarkRP one of the most popular things for Garry's Mod and maybe the most fun thing to do, the first time I can actually roleplay in a video game 10/10~ Maps... the maps people made are just very creative and most of them are really great to use for making posters or to like play a gamemode like Zombie Survival, Horror Story, TTT, and Prop Hunt~ Achivements. The achivements in this game are pretty crazy when I think about it, like... ""waste a year playing gmod"" like do you want me to play this game for a whole year!?!? that is pretty insane but intresting I recommend this game if you love having to do whatever you want, because this game is basically like so many choices to pick and you can do whatever you want.

												Well I have not done a review and might as well.The game is great it's a mod for Half-life 2 (Source Game) and you can mess around with like make Gmod Movies or have fun with friends it's endless. Also there are other stuff you can do as people make Gamemodes you can play like DarkRP, Clock Work, TTT, Murder and so many more.The only thing I would say a game mode not to play is the Five Nights At Freddys game mode it will just make you cringe as it's just full of kids and trust me these kids are not normal.In any words it's a great Mod well it's kind of a game now sense it does not require Half-life 2 anymore but you should get the Orange Box and Counter Strike Source so you can get all the textures becasue most servers use them.

												Garry's Mod is purely driven by the community, the fun I personally found came from the variety of gamemodes and servers that the community offered me. I've wasted hour upon hour playing Trouble in Terrorist Town and Deathrun, along you can be sure to find something you like yourself.Aside from the community gamemodes, it does offer Sandbox mode, which allows you to use a massive array of interesting tools, including ones you can easily download from the Workshop to make everything from the most complex of machines to a bath with wheels.

												Garry's Mod is one of my favourites games if not my favourite. What I love most about it is, if you can think of it you can probably do it for example attaching a missile to a bus and watch it explode high up above you or just walking around as a chicken. With more than 430,000 mods on the Steam Workshop for Gmod. The variety in this game is huge to say the least. When I'm not experimenting with missiles I'm on a role-play server madly chasing a rebel in a stolen car try to get my car that's been stolen back.For the price of £5.99 (cheaper if its on sale which it often is) you can't really go wrong with this game. I now have over a thousand hours game time and would highly recommend it to everyone its amazing!			",826,252,39,60,90,6,111

												Good things:-*Decent Graphics.*Variety of Gamemodes to play on.*Offers Coders a chance to show off thier skills over Customly Coded Servers or Workshop content.*A Very funny game with a Full Physics Manipulation Experience.*Lots of Content to choose from and download Including Maps,Weapons,Playermodels,Content.Bad things:-*Young Trolls and Minges.*Game bugs occuring usually after certain updates due to Garry Breaking things in the game.*Lots of Content Needed for decent Servers.Overall Rating:-I Would rate this game 9.5/10,This game is a very fun game Offering me a Full Experience of Variety of Gamemodes such as Sandbox where Physics laws are proven to be useless and Building Large buildings as some one simply destructs it all with a Explosive barrel or such and TTT In-Which you are on the search for a Traitory terrorist or even become one and Work your way Onto killing all Innocents without being Noticed In order to survive or Deathrun as you run with other people attempting to avoid traps and gain Pointshop points to Buy new hats or Playermodels or even weapons or TDM In-which you join a certain team depending on the TDM Gamemode,Such as US/RU or VC/US And Variety of more classes depending on the server Or Pirate wars as you join a Adventoures Journey with your friends and Become a Red Coat and attempt to sink Pirates Ship or Vice Versa,However on Each Gamemode,There are these Picky Young trolling Minges,I've managed to adapt with most of them at most Cases,But its hard to do so,Overall I recommend you this game And by Judging from my Playtime its Totally Recommnd this game for Any sort of Person as this Game offers you more than 1Gamemode and each with a Diffrent Category of Options.

Want to team up with your terrorist buddies to find a traitor or two? You can do that. Want to throw Sonic the Hedgehog at Buzz Lightyear with a shotgun? You can do that. Basically, this game is your imagination multiplied by watermelon. 10/10. Would buy again. Actually, I have bought it again. Twice. ",204,41,2,31,13,2,15

												Garry's Mod is one of those games you look at and think: ""Wow, this is really stupid"", but then you buy it, and you exchange it for your soul. This game is addicting, mainly the multiplayer portions, where you have quite a few minigames, each you'll invest about a week of gametime into, or more or less, depending on your taste in games. Even if you dislike all of the games somehow, you can create your own mod or map using the sandbox on either single player or multiplayer. This game gives you everything you might want to do in general terms, and the only negativity you may recieve may come from unfortunate minor glitches or perhaps being in a messy server. Otherwise, buckle up and have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. Unlike regular games there aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play. You spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. If you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positionsYou can go on servers with different gamemodes its amazing.			",36,0,0,0,1,0,0

												I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients:4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)1 large free range egg½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)Pinch of saltButter for fryingHow to make pancakes:Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!!			",81,9,2,5,7,2,2
