												Don't let the Metascore fool you, this game plays better than its rating. This game is great for those who enjoy business and life sims, plus it's in the medieval times. I became addicted to this game because of its political mechanics, and how you rival other dynasties through out time (Through business trade, political regard, and even combat). I have played too many hours on the Guild 2 and the others in the bundle, and I'm always finding out new ways to do things. Does it have bugs? Yes. Is it pretty behind in terms of graphics? Yes. But to me, it's a really good game that I can spend 10 hours on in a row and not get tired of it. If you feel iffy about the game, then just get it when it's on sale. However, I highly recommend this game and The Guild 2: Renaissance and would say they are worth their standard price.			",356,70,13,44,73,2,70

												Me and my bandit buddies, robbed some guy as he was walking through the countryside.He then ran off to the courthouse to dob me in to the popo.  On the day of my court hearing, I kidnapped the guy who dobbed me in, and then went off to my trial. The court denied, the case because the guy didn't show up to the trial he was started. The court fined him for wasting their time.His wife then started a case against me for kidnapping. I didnt want to have two mouths to feed so I jst sent her on a long, permanent vacation.She never showed up to the trial and I was let free again. The court then thought their family was the biggest bunch of ♥♥♥♥wits, and branded them as outlaws.I let the guy go, and watched all the local town guards chase him and kill him.I adopted their children, and made them watch me burn down their old house. Now they work on my slave camps, I mean farms.10/10, would ruin lives again.			",185,16,3,28,18,0,50

												This game is so underrated. If you google The Guild 2, you will be overwhelmed with negative comments about the buggy release. Most of these issues have been fixed, and the game is definitely playable. If you want to play multiplayer though, you will have to download some 3rd party software, as the multiplayer servers have been closed. Would reccomend.			",191,26,3,34,33,3,44

												Better than WoW guilds.You buy a house and some slaves that get materials and craft a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥ ship it to the market as you run down to the market to get some more materials but get slapped by some random woman you offended somehow. Take it to court and be massive wimp and they'll execute her so you can steal her position as a Jailor and randomly jail people and send them to the dungeon where they get whipped until they confess something. I dont remember if it worked on kids but i remember trying.You'll atleast spend like 1-3 hours on this. I got it for free so I dont have alot to complain about. It's really strange and hard to understand in some way but If i spent more time with this I'd probably be able to explain better.EDIT: It is buggy as hell too, mechanically its not impressive but its an interesting mix between shop management or something like that and some Sims elements. It's also a very difficult game in a sense, if it's on sale consider atleast if this is something you'd like to try out. Consider heavily though, as its still not an amazing game.

												I first got this game when it came out in 2006. My dad almost didn't let me play it when we saw the opening cinematic because of the beheading scene. Naturally I quickly fell in love with this game. It is charming, the execution of the mechanics are GREAT, and as for the simulation style... well I have more hours logged on this than I do the Sims 2 and 3 combined. IT IS AMAZING! The fights, the murder, taking over a government and wiping out the local populace, destroying the economy etc, its just so much fun. Yes, the graphics are rather dated but it was made in 2006. You will have trouble playing on newer computers but that is not the game's fault it is your computer. I personally have no trouble on my Windows 8.1 and have 30+ hours logged on this version alone. The original disc version game I have more than 1000+ hours logged and I look forward to many more on this. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANY SIMS PLAYER!			",106,9,0,18,10,0,9

												I had lots of fun playing The Guild II. This is the first ""The Guild"" game that I played and am definetely a fan of the series now. Fun game, but game still has some un-resolved bugs, but make the game humorous (Sometimes characters talk in English then German seconds later). I'm a big fan of Medieval games and I thought this game was super realistic of the Medieval life. Overall, I recommend this game and would recommend to buy this on sale. Personal score: 8/10Genre: Simulation, Strategy, MedievalWorth-playing or Not worth-playing: Worth playingOverall, good game.			",70,0,1,15,21,0,18

												Was fortunate enough to win this in a giveaway, and I am so happy to have had the chance to play this game.If you like managing a family dynasty, heavy emphasis on ROLE-playing, and micromanaging simulation seen in games like the Patrician series, then you will love this one. For me, I can pass so many hours playing without even noticing (very similar to how I play Civilization - ""just one more action..."").The aesthetics are great despite being a bit dated - on max settings it is still really nice to watch your characters move around. The music is appropriate and helps immersion into the medieval setting. The controls are not too challenging to familiarize yourself with, however, the learning curve can range from moderate to quite steep - especially if you are not used to playing resource management games (in particular, buy/sell mechanics in the market). The tutorial is absolutely essential if you haven't played the first Guild, and I strongly recommend you play through the 7 different tutorial scenarios. They are pretty quick, and you can breeze through it if you click the message icon on the left of the screen, which allows you to read the narrator's script and move on to the next bit (if you are a faster reader).The options in the game are amazing and refreshing for an older game - I wish you could do some of the things in here in newer open-world games like The Elder Scrolls, Witcher, and Fable series.You start off by choosing which game mode to play - I suggest just leaving it set to ""dynasty,"" where you keep on playing until your family tree ends (last living member dies without an offspring). Set the difficulty closer to easy and the number of dynasties to a lower number like 2 or 4 to help you get a feel for the game.Before you start, you will make your first playable character. The different classes give you specifc boosts to skills, encouraging you to focus on areas where your role excels in. For example, the scholar is very powerful in politics, so concentrating on upgrading your charisma, rhetoric (used in political intrigue), and empathy (used to break through opponent's rhetoric) will benefit you greatly. The rogue can be extremely difficult to play because many of the things you will do are illegal, so maximizing your dexterity (for dodges) and stealth (less likely to be caught performing illegal actions) will be critical.After you start the game, you will have enough money to build a starting building that will provide you with income through resource accumulation and management. For example, the scholars can build a church or a specialty shop - both of which can be staffed by workers (priests and conjurers {pretty sure that's what they're called}). These units can collect natural ingredients (holy water by priests; herbs and plants by conjurers) that can then be transformed to more expensive items that you can sell back to the market. Other bonuses are granted by the buildings you choose to build - for example, you can hold sermons in your church to publicly denounce a rival family under the guise of divine favor (or disfavor for the opponent, I guess). You can also create positions in your magic shop to cause people to temporarily like you more (increase favor).Buildings can be upgraded once your character(s) meet the required level, however, for your houses you must be a certain reputation level. To increase this value, you need to apply for a higher noble standing in the town hall (just have to pay a heavy fee). You start off as a commoner and can pay 500 gold to become a citizen, which allows you to upgrade your modest hut to a nicer house. After that, you can pay 2500 gold to become a patrician (again unlocking the next tier for housing). Be advised, it is difficult (and time-consuming) to amass a large number of gold in the beginning of the game.There are also upgrade trees for each building, where you can do things like increase storage capacity for items, increase worker count, and increase security of the building (causing thieves to take longer to break into your structures). The game has a slow - fast forward feature, allong you enough time to plan your actions (or accelerate them if you are ready to move on).As you perform actions, you gain experience points that you can use to upgrade your skills like dexterity, constitution (increases health points and number of items slots you have), martial arts (determines how proficient you are in combat) and bargaining (gives you a larger bonus when you sell items).You can hire bodyguards from your household to follow you or protect your assets (you can make them patrol around your buildings). On the flip side, you can build rogue buildings like a smuggler's den to recruit thieves (they can break into buildings or pickpocket within an area) or a thug hideout to hire bandits (they can camp on spots to waylay any caravans). Crime is very risky in this game, as witnesses' memories for your actions will slowly decay over time (during this time they can still report you to the guards). Even worse, a competitor can even try to blackmail you with evidence of your illicit activites or take you to court. Depending on the crime and the crime laws, you could be fined or even executed.The courtship mechanic is fairly simple, but critical to surviving dynasty mode since you need offspring to continue your legacy. You start off with one character, but once you get a spouse you can choose to use her/him as a second character (you can only have 3 active characters at a time). Once you choose to turn an active character to an inactive one, you will be unable to add them to your active party - forcing you to really plan out your long-term goals.For politics, you can choose to run for office (starting at the lowest available tier). As your town develops (first into a city, then further on), you will unlock more positions that you can run for, with mayor at the very top. When you run for office, you can try to bribe the current council members to help swing votes in your favor. You could also blackmail them with evidence of their illegal activities (perhaps you ordered one of your bodyguards to ""spy"" on a councilman, following him until he tried to assassinate another competitor), however, they need to have illegal activites in the first place.The game is absolutely fantastic, and I will provide you with a possible scenario to help show how the game can play out:Your character is a craftsman, so you built a smithy to start crafting weapons and armor. You buy raw materials from the market, bring them back to your smithy with your wagon, then turn it into basic weapons and armor. Once you have enough money, you hire a few workers to craft the equipment for you. Free of your regular labor, you move on to see a wife. Once you successfully court a woman, you immediately take her to bed and have a baby boy. With your heir secure, you begin your very long-term preparations to enter the political scene.You've upgraded both your house and your smithy thanks to your effective craft/sell management. With an excess of gold, you are able to send your child to school, then to an apprenticeship at the local magic shop, and finally to university (you have 3 different opportunites, each costing more gold and providing higher bonuses to your child in preparation for when they turn 16 and you can add them to your party).Since you have the only fully upgraded smithy in both towns (you can select maps with 1, 2, or 3 towns), all four of your bodyguards are outfitted with the best equipment. You make sure to spend some experience points on leveling up your son's martial arts in case.You eventually realize that your patriarch will most likely not live long enough to become mayor (life expectancy is represented by the height of a candle on your character portrait), so you change plans and decide to pave the road for your son.(continued in comments)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its to rough to recommend unless your willing to put up with alot of wonkyness and willing to do workarounds in the game to get stuff done. The game itself is a definite pecularity. I can't say I have seen much if anything like this. You directly control your clan and family, but you also have RTS style building elements and upgrades. Theres also politics and courts and elections you can go through aswell.The only problem is its not made very well. Theres alot of stuff here but not all of it works very well or is interesting. You can manage business yourself, but thats very tedious and the AI knows what its doing while even on AI control you can still manually assign business to do stuff.  You can also hire thugs to do your bidding and I found the simplest way to get stuff down was to kill my competitors in the street in the middle of the day.Just call me Machiavelli, its better for them to fear me then to love me. Better to bleed them in the street then to take them to court. Which is unfortunate because there seems to be a decent amount of buruecracy you can do to get what you want in this game but thus far it seems more of a bother than just hitting them with your pointy bits and calling it a day.Its alright but unfortunately its just not put together very well and can be pretty buggy. In theory its an amazing idea but the game falls a bit short of that though it still remains pretty good if you can look past issues like people switching between German and English voice actors mid court for no reason and AI just refusing to do what you tell them do forcing you do find a way to make them. On top of that the mechanics just arn't telegraphed to the player extremely well and how things work is a bit confusing.  Such as how do you get elected to a seat? Bribing people seems to not work very well and it seems random luck if you do win an election.If you really want a city/village building game with politics and family management then this is about your only choice, its not a terrible game but it certaintly is meant to fulfill a niche and it could definetly have had more work put into it and polishing.

												Im usually not a fan of simulation games. I play ""The Sims"" for a day and call it quits, its just not for me. Ive only been playing ""The Guild 2"" for half a week and ive already invested nearly 40 hours at the expense of work and sleep, for me this game was very addictive. Its practically the sims but based in the dark ages where you grow a family and basically conquer your village with money, economic strength, and political power. This game features an abundance of mechanics, marriage, work, religion, politics, assassinations, blackmail, ect but there are various areas where its broken. For example there are times when my building was being attacked and i couldnt defend it because the attackers were glitched inside the house while not actually inside the building. (this can be countered by sending your men inside the building, then exiting the building with the camera and re selecting your men and ordering them to attack, then they exit and fight properly...assuming that there are no obsticles in the way). The game allows you to upgrade your cart to move faster, but you can only move as fast as traffic will allow, sometimes the streets are packed (it may be intentional to force you to strategize timing). My only other complaints are with its options menu, you cannot run this game windowed unless you alter the .ini file, and even then it pauses when you click away to another monitor, and you cannot remap buttons which you might assume isnt a big deal but when your speed keys are + and - it takes much longer when it could have simply been remapped closer to WASD. Oh and the game crashes on me once in a while so i recommend turning on autosave. Otherwise this is a game that i HIGHLY recommend if youre into sims and historical themes, yes it has a few problems but the positives outweight the negatives. Just be sure to get it on sale.This is just a funny story that happened in game, you dont have to read this if you dont want to. My wife applied for the position of town executioner which was held by the member of a rival dynasty. They didnt like the fact that i was trying to rob them of their title so they killed my wife, i reported this crime to the town hall and was given a day to appear in court to testify. I was working that day in 3x gamespeed just blacksmithing to pass time and I missed the court date. The next day i was arrested and thrown in the dungeon to be tortured for missing court. so essentially, i was tortured because my wife was murdered :(			",151,17,2,34,14,0,7

												The Guild II is a dynastic medieval simulator. Essentially what this means is that it is a simulator with some heavy RPG elements where you play as a family through the ages.As the game starts you make your character and pick a profession then you get put into a European city of your choice and set up your business. Soon enough however, your starting character will die off, hopefully from old age and not an angry competitor, but that is not the end. If you were smart enough to get married you can continue playing as your spouse as well as any children you may have had and so the game continues.As you progress in the game your character get increased stats and abilities which will rub off your children through teaching and genetics as well as the ability to purchase higher titles and run for public office. Of course there are other dynasties that try their best to put you out of business through out-competing you as well as myriad of more nefarious means such as firebombing your business and shooting you.The game is heavily reliant on the flowing and open supply and demand economy that dictates the price of all the goods in the game, unfortunately this does not always work quite that well without player interaction and cities often run out of basic products quickly simply because the only supplier has died or gone bankrupt.Where the game really shines is in the character interactions that all come out through this economy simulation. Did someone firebomb your bakery, go to court and attempt to have him put in jail if he doesn't bribe the magistrate or kill off the witnesses first. You want to get rid of someone but doesn't have the legal status to risk murder? Challenge him to a duel and hope for the best.Something that is also worth mentioning is that The Guild II, despite choppy animations, is a fairly pretty game for what is almost an indie production. Turn the graphics up as high as you can and you can almost forget that it was never an AAA development, until you hit yet another bug that is.The Guild II is a fun game in a fairly limited genre, it is heavily marred by bugs and semi-broken economics but it is still a game you can get tons of hours into without getting tired of it.

												Wow. Just wow.I bought this game and it's two expansions for a measly 5 bucks on sale, and I feel like I ripped the devs off! While it has a steep learning curve, this game is truly a gem of a sim/rpg. My only suggestion is PLAY THE TUTORIAL. This game was almost impossible to figure out on my own, but after playing the tutorial the game got a whole heck of a lot more fun.Basically, choose to start your family dynasty with a selection from several classes including: Craftsman, Patron, Scholar, and Rogue. Once you get started you can start a business, hire employees, improve your buildings, buy titles for yourself, woo a lady (or man), have children, send them off to school (or dont), commit crimes, bribe city officials, blackmail people, smoothtalk your way out of a court sentencing, smoothtalk your way into a public office.... Just way too much to even try to list. There is so much to do in this game. It has already eaten over 10 hours of my life and it's about to gobble up another 4 or 5 tonight.			",24,4,0,19,4,0,0

												This is an interesting game. You can Manage a business or 4, Make LOADZA MONEY! You can get married, have kids, get into Politics, get higher and higher in the Governmental Offices until you reach ""King"" or Governor/Mayor/Baron or whatever the Top Spot is called. And if you play your cards right you can get your whole family into office and Take COMPLETE control over the town you're in. Each seat in office offers a lump sum as payment every round I'm guessing the higher the office the more MONEY you get and if your whole family is in control... Pff forget about it. Along with your businesses... That's ... a lot of doe. ]:) and you'll have Rival Family's in the town. And if they♥♥♥♥♥♥you off for any reason you can (if you so choose) Charge them for some crime they've committed and have them executed >:) or i guess you can develop an alliance with them if they complement your business. This is a fun game. But be warned their are... a couple bugs in it, wired animations, occasional German dialog hear and their (theirs English text so its not.. TO bad i guess. But if you can see past that its a fun game that has hours of entertainment value. (if your into these kinds of games) but if you don't really like to many bugs you can always buy it on a sale or something :)			",55,15,0,23,20,0,12

												You can either love or hate this game......OK OK or like me you can have love/hate relationship with this virtual coccaine....Yes i said relationship as it seems i spended more time with this game than my family and friends, typical case of ""one more turn and thats it"" .What i love:Be catholic fanatic and make crusade to convert all towns to right faith,become feared crimelord or powerful politician.Problems with rival?Simply kill,kidnap,bribe,beat up,threaten,ambush his caravans or became friends by giving him delicious cake or reading sweet poem.Or try it trough politics create intricate schemes,make powerful alliances,befriend  council members and rise in rank make your family occupy  all seats in council then make sudden inspection in rival bussines,arrest him,execute him,strip him of his title,wealth, and finally banish him and tear down his buildings.Is that too much for you? Well then became simple smith,alchemist or farmer delivering your merchandies to market every day and dont pay any attention to that mean world around you.What i like:Graphics is nice,textures are sharp enough,scenery is beautiful with flowers moving in wind,4 different seasons and corresponding weather, like heavy rain in autumn with grey gloomy colors while summer is more vibrant and alive.Interface is pretty simple and easy to navigate,soundtrack fits game perfectly,there is enough game modes consisting typical sandbox where you make you own goals,mission mode where you choose your main goal you have to reach to win,or simple extinction where last one standing wins.What is ok:AI Is responsive enough and do what it should do most of times, they climb hierarchy ladder using their friends,politic power and spies againts you, kill member of rival dynasty and feel their wrath, they dont hesitate to bribe or use buff items to help their cause.Though when it comes to bodyguards they never spend a dime on their equipment leaving them with -1 dagger. And too bad they dont fear walking alone at night in forest in places where other members of  their family died...too bad for them ofcourse .(normal difficulty)Animation is nothing special and serves it purpose  though i wouldnt mind if there were more immersive animations .Character creation is typical you can choose your first and last name,faith,appearance,voice,level of your starting skills and occupation. RPG elements are ok there is 8 skills that affect certain actions + every few levels you get perks.You can level up and max your skills pretty easily which makes classes little pointless but its not big deal.Dissapointing:Fact that family members who are not in you party are idle. For exception of going to church or another town they do not level up,take council seats,buy bussines,work,have kids,or getting married you have to add them to your group and even after that if you assign member of your family a bussines and remove him from your group he looses that bussines.Courting is too easy and even if it says you need to take different approach for each class it doesnt really matter you can basicly do anything and it will have same effect on every class ie patron will like dancing same as rogue .What sucked:Bad optimalization(better turn bloom off its ugly anyway) horrible pathfinding and from it surfacing problems like getting stuck  or fighting in group where some merc just freeze and are useless.All in all i will recommend this game it is not perfect  and has its flaws for me flaws that didnt stop me from having alot of fun  even if sometimes ugly words were yelled...at monitor at night when i should sleep...because i had to go to work.Or you could go and play The Guild 2 Renaissance which has more expanded gameplay and less flaws. PS. It will still eat your time.			",519,234,4,141,41,1,89

												Started off planning to be completely upstanding member of society, run a couple forges and a mine, stay on the right side of the law. After a day of playing I had a fully functioning thieves guild with over a dozen pickpockets scattered across the cities, I'd sent a grandchild with thugs to murder an entire rival family that insulted my mine, planted my son and his wife as Captain of the Guard and Magistrate so I can legally arrest, accuse, and execute anyone that competes with my business, and was throwing a daily firebomb through my competitors window since my political status made me immune to the law.10/10 Would be a businessman again.This game is great! Yes it's a little buggy at times but usually just deselecting the unit and trying again is enough to get it to work. Minor gripes aside you are left with an incredibly well planned medieval life sim. You can do just about anything you want, approach it any way you want, end goal is simply to outlast the other noble families. Whether you do that by planting an identical business next to them and driving them out of business and into debt, taking them to court for every little misgrievance, taking your place as king and exiling them to another city to restart, becoming the judge and bringing down the lawhammer on their everythings, robbing their houses and trashing their wagons, simply going about your business and hoping they die out due to no sons to pass on the family name, or any number of other methods. It's a surprisingly in depth game about playing your cards right and sometimes slipping a few gold coins into the right palms to become the only noble left in the land, and 100% worth the purchace if on sale, or full price if you are really into management/sim style games.

												Great game, very addicting.Despite many comments saying the games buggy and unplayable I don't find that to be true. A few bugs but they all have work arounds and I certainly can play it without feeling I hit a dead end bug.But it really gets you invested, as I almost shed a tear when the husband went home to die. And the anger I felt when enemies killed my son walking home to see his wife...I then killed them all...and not just the men. But the women, and the children.

												I started playing with The Guild: 1400, which I'd seen at a local thrift shop and thought looked interesting.  I quite liked it, so I bought the sequel: The Guild II.  I'd have to say that it generally lives up to the original.  It's very similar gameplay, although the changes, especially to the UI, can take some getting used to, if you're coming from 1400.  The graphics are, of course, markedly improved.  Worth the money if you liked 1400.  Probably worth the money if you like these kinds of games.  I liked it, anyway.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a long time strategy gamer, this looked like it was a perfect fit. The concept is great, but the execution is weak. Guild 2 had the potential to be something really amazing. Pros: The artwork on the towns and maps is well done despite the limitations of the graphics capabilities. The gameplay is innovative and provides a lot of varied options including building wealth by running your day to day business operations and expansion, getting involved in politics and the accompanying intrigue, sabotaging competitors, and building a family.Cons: The pathing AI is horrendous. Much of your time will be eaten away hoping that your toon can find their way home or to town hall. Speaking of time killers, as you get into politics, the meetings get longer and longer. They end up easily taking up half the game play time. So, it ends up being mandatory to set up AI control of your businesses. You will probably want to anyway after the first few interactions with managing your business on your own because it quickly goes from interesting to tedious.I put in almost 4 hours and desperately wanted to love the game. Also tried the Pirate expansion in the hopes it would fix some of the issues. Eventually it became too annoying to enjoy.This could have been something awesome with better design. But no.

												Amazing game, building a family and ruling by political power has never been so much fun. Much more indepth then any of the civilization series. Sadly it is unplayable, after ~(close to)6 years. Saving every 2 minutes is enough for you not to lose to much when your game crashes (and if you play for to long this will happen). Even after the onslaught of patchs, this game suffers horrible memory leaks, crashes and poor (no?) optimisation. Leaving  a game that you could easily lose yourself in because of its charming world and fun game play for hours, to nothing more then a forgotten bit of software from its makers. With standalone addons telling customers one thing, the games engine was so riddled with bugs that the dev team decided to throw most of its code base out the window and start over? Fun throw away game, but really Guild 2 should have been a staple in gaming history sadly it wasn't.			",152,17,3,22,30,0,32

												The Guild II is part Strategy, part simulation. It's a lot like the sims without micromanaging of having to take a dump, showering, and whatnot. That's not to say that you don't have to micromanage though...because you do in a way. Firstly, you start out with humble beginnings, usually pretty broke, a small home to your name, and you're not but a peasant, not even considered a rightful citizen yet. You'll have to get a new title from the courthouse and then get a business going, whether it be robbing good folk of their coins or goods, curing aliments of the diseased, working metal, farming, or whatever other professions there are (only certain classes that your character(s) is/are can work certain professions). After that, you fight tooth and nail to make some coins so you get new titles, rise in politics (courthouse) and ultimately, either kill all your competition or outlive them (if that is the mode you choose in the menu, which has various setting to customize the game to your liking).Overall, I love the game. It takes a long time to get anywhere, but that's not changing anything in the configuration files to add money in the beginning. It can get a little boring after a while, but I find it addictively fun and great in small to medium burst (30 minutes - 2-ish hours). At the current price in this summer sale (9.99 for collection) I'd pick it up. You could wait to see if it hits a sale, but if it doesn't I'd pick it up on the last day of the sale. I doubt this will drop it's standard store selling price anytime in the near future and $10 is well worth the fun this collection provides.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes, it's a bit buggy. Yes, the animations are awful. Yes, the character models all looks pretty similar. But underneath all of that, there's an amazing game. You can do almost anything you like. For example, want to expand your business to another town, but your carts keep getting attacked by bandits on the way? Attack the bandit camp with your mercenaries, or pay to have your carts escorted, or just buy the camp itself, then use those same bandits to attack competitors carts. It's a very deep game that, once you get into it, will make you realize what kind of person you would be if you had power. Will you be a benevolent leader of a city, or a bandit king controlling the local town through terror? Pros Innovative blend of role-playing, real-time strategy, and economic-sim genres lots of detail and a great medieval atmosphereCons Repetitive gameplay really heavy on micromanagement limited character interaction			",904,197,17,59,57,3,87

												If you like the idea of managing your business from scratch, starting a family and take down your competitors though hard work, nefarious ways or simply by politics in a beautiful medieval setting this is the game for you.By the way, you die in this game from a variety of reasons, including of old age. One of your kids will inherit everything you own and will become the main character. You can practically play this game for as long as you wish, pretty neat, eh?The only mode I don't recomend is multiplayer. It has a few nasty and unsolvable Out of Sync game-breaking bugs.For an improved gaming experience consider buying The Guild II: Renaissance. 6.5/10			",350,85,11,59,52,5,62

												You can put so much, or so little to this game and get a lot out of it, no matter what. There's so many different ways you can play it, and so many different styles of gameplay that you can experience. You can run for Mayor of the town and kill anyone who opposes you, or you can be a friendly shopkeeper and make a lot of money selling your wares. Get married and have children. Raise those children (or not). Become a bachelor and own a huge mansion. Be a minister at your local church. Sabotage your competitors business (or their life). Don't let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking trailer or the screenshots at the top of this page fool you. Yes, I too thought the game would be a sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥when I saw them, but I've come to realize they don't reflect the gameplay quality of this game at all. This game will keep you going for hours. It's so much fun and I highly recommend it.			",192,39,8,23,28,0,13

												Wanted to play a nice easy mode game as a leisurely farming dynasty. Started my dynasty with a wonderful lady, who married a man who couldn't even do anything on the farm, and kept it clean. We were simple folk, content to sell sheep and wheat. Then our neighbor, the Guild Master and rival farming dynasty, decided to send thugs after my lady. After rendering her at death's door, her husband, though useless on the farm, would not let matters stand. Before the courts he stood, presenting evidence of that Guild Master's attempt at 2 murders and thuggery involving my family and one other dynasty. A large sum of coin earned from sheep and cow greased the palms of all three jury members, but there was a thirst for vengeance on my husband's tongue. My lady could not even leave her house without being attacked by thugs, and was basically on house arrest to keep her alive. This injustice would not stand.As the months passed in wait for the trial, we discovered the sins of the Guild Master and her dynasty went far deeper. We were not the only dynasty suffering under her tyrannical thumb. Surely such a horrid woman, in the end, would deserve nothing less then death!At last, the fated trial came, and the wicked woman, who thought she could feign innocence and abuse her position as Guild Master, faced the verdict. Guilty! And despite more liberal punishment laws, nothing less then death!As she was marched to the execution block, my husband followed to proudly watch it be done. My lady, 6 months stuck inside her house and reaching age 50, was finally able to step outside and stand by her husband to watch her tormenter face justice.We just wanted a nice farm and to raise our two daughters and son with a proper education. It didn't have to come to this. But in the end...it felt GOOD. 10/10, would execute the Guild Master again. =)			",39,56,0,41,29,0,3

												I bought this a long time ago but never really gave it any time so it was left rotting in my game library.I decided to give it another shot and I'm glad I did. I don't know why some people call it a bad game. My friend recommends The Guild 1 over 2.It has some bugs but for me it's a great sim. I've been playing as the patrician class mainly and finding the best ways to earn money and explore the game.When I first played I used the rogue class which is probably where I went wrong as you have to be more knowledgable of the game mechanics to play a rogue effectively in my opinion.

												It is a fun and good game, but not without its own problems. At a certain point in the game it becomes too much to handle with managing your family, and trying to rule over the city. And then there's a bug that prevents the city from upgrading once it reaches a certain point. That is a game ender since you can't progress further and can't perform certain actions. However up to these points it is a fun game, and you can usually catch it for a couple of bucks which isn't bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Guild 2 is a Real Time Strategy game set in the Medieval Period. Essentially, the game allows the player to use a bunch of maneuvres and tactics to climb the social ladder. If you like games that reward you for playing strategically, than this is for you. It's a deep and intricate game that gives you the freedom to do what you want. However, don't expect it to be easy or lightweight, it requires patience and concentration. The game however has a few bugs which will probably not be patched since the game is pretty old and a new installment will be coming out in the near future. Despite this it's still playable and enjoyable for an old game.			",40,3,0,6,9,0,5

												Some of my recommendations take longer to pen then others because I simply spend more time playing the game then wanting to write about it.  The Guild II is just such a game.  The Guild II offers quite a bit of novel gameplay, from running a variety of different medieval businesses to managing political office and trials as you build your dynasty one generation at a time.  In short, if you are a patient fan of RTS and willing to put up with the steep learning curve, the game has plenty to offer.  Unfortunately, the game is marred by inexplicably poor design choices.  The interface lacks useful tooltips, you cannot see what resources you will need for a given industry until after you build it, and even simple character navigation is obtuse and quite a chore to get the hang of.  That said, if you are willing to put up with generally terrible interface and learn the game through trial and error, there is a lot to love.  I would recommend the game to only the most patient player.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried liking this game, I really did. The game mechanics are fun and there's a lot to do, but it also has a lot of flaws. At first you'll be overwhelmed by the things you can do, but soon you'll be repeating the same things over and over again. The RPG elements are weak, the economy is fine until you start expanding, the political part is decent put the lawsuits ruin the whole game. I got a death penalty for a murder I didn't commit. Wouldn't be that dumb if the person I ""killed"" wasn't the same person blaming me for the murder. The whole game is just a mixed bag of various game genres, it tries to be the jack of all trades, but doesn't execute very well.			",41,7,2,9,16,0,5

												This is a great game, a bit complicated so I do recommend going through the tutorial to avoid some frustration. If you're debating between this and the Sims Medieval, go with Guild II, it is faaaaaaar better made, with realistic simulation of dynasty compared to the paltry 'take a walk in forest and click dialogue options' offering of SM. The graphics are a bit dated now, but they still look good for this kind of game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't get the appeal.I mean, I get it at first glance. TG2 presents itself as CK2 minus the strategic gameplay, with more of a focus on the characters themselves. That's pretty cool, right? Being able to forge a strong dynasty, play the political game, rise to power, govern a fiefdom, all while taking care of the day-to-day activities of medieval life. Who wouldn't want to play something like that?Well, that's not what you get. For $10.99, you get a glorified city management game that plays like it was designed for mobile devices. You know all those terrible cash grabs you find in the app store? The ones where you click on some materials, click on a building, and are awarded gold and a big neon CONGRATULATIONS sign? That's essentially the gameplay you're paying for with TG2.Sure, you can construct buildings, but that's essentially a matter of having enough gold and clicking on a large enough empty plot. Sure, you can get married, but the relationship system makes DA:Os look positively lifelike. Sure you can design your character, if you're happy with choosing from five beards, six hairstyles, and a couple of skin tones (rough estimates, not actual numbers).I know this review sounds harsh, and I know I'm using some pretty strong rhetoric here. However, when you listen to how 4Head describes their product (""the shining successor of the ultra successful medieval life sim..."", ""State-of-the-art role playing features..."", ""a beautifully crafted and immersive 3D world..."", etc.) and read the significant number of positive reviews on the store page, the objective and experienced gamer can't help but feel a little misled.

The game actually has depth, enough to confuse me at first. I was happy there was an tutorial!I'm not great at reviewing these types of titles because I have little to compare it to.

												The Guild 2 presents a fairly solid economic strategy simulation where the player can utilize a number of varying tactics and maneuvers to gain an advantage in a well-designed medieval environment. Unfortunately, the impressive level of detail and the interesting gameplay options at your disposal take a backseat to the technical issues and repetitive micromanagement. The final product ends up being decent, but not nearly as good as it could have been. If you're looking for an economic-based strategy title, The Guild 2 is worth a try.			",50,19,1,19,13,0,13

												One day I decided to go through my list of games and write out recommendations for anything I'd played for any decent amount of time. You know how it is, you scroll through your library and see dozens of games you bought on sale and only played for 20-30 minutes before going back to Fallout or Skyrim or whatever. Anyway, The Guild 2 and its expansions kept me occupied for a good 11 hours or so, but I'm honestly not sure why.You control your family and have to run a business or become a politician or be a bandit or something. It's like a medieval life simulator. The game isn't that great but there's nothing too bad about it either, it's just one of those things that chews up your time without you noticing. If that's what you're into grab this but there are better things you could be doing with your free time. Like writing out recommendations for all of your games for example...*Sigh*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has a good tutorial but the gameply can become repetitive. No story mode and once you beat the game a couple times using different stratagies, it becomes stale. I enjoyed the game but without a story mode, I felt like I paid too much for it. So, because of that, unless it's on sale, I can't recommend the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has so much potential its painfull to see the end result. If you google this game you'll find a lot of bad reviews. HOWEVER, Don't dismiss this game based on those reviews. This game had a really bad start. Numerous patches later this game is certainly playable. The gameplay is fun. Building up your own dynasty is fun, although you mostly have to figure things out for your self, becouse the tutorial is very very minimal. The logistics, production and details of running the dynasty is what gives this game its power. The game feels unfinished and buggy and slightly aimless. If you can buy this on sale for less than 2 or 3 euro's its worth it. More than that and you better be bored out of your mind and have cash to spare.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While not a bad game, The Guild II is shallow and lacks the charm of its predecessor.

Posted: November 7, 2015
One of a kind.That's how I'd summarize The Guild II. It's part social/life simulator, part business simulator, RPG and strategy all mixed together to create one of the most unique games I've played. You create your family's first member, then from there, you must choose a career path. You then must go about managing your business, obtaining wealth, climbing the social ladder of your town, ensuring your bloodline continues after your inevitable death, and trying to become the most powerful family through whatever means you wish. One thing worth noting is that while I fully recommend controlling your own business 100%, if this isn't something that interests you, you can choose which aspects of your business you want the AI to manage (can be nice for those who hate micromanagement of inventory, production, employees, etc.) or have the AI manage it fully.To expand on a few things mentioned, we'll begin with the jobs, which vary enough that certain careers can make the game play entirely differently from others. You can produce raw resources, such as wood/paper, metals, and ingredients to sell to the blacksmiths, alchemists, and priests. Or you can be the ones making armors, weapons, potions, and scrolls that sell quite well in the markets, but have the overhead cost of raw resources. Or you can be the ones using the weapons and armors to beat up opposing families who are either competing with you, or sending their cronies to attack your buildings simply because you looked at them wrong in the market yesterday. Or you can just go to the highways, and rob trading carts that are transferring valuable supplies between towns and businesses. Likewise, if you are a businessman, your own cart is subject to the risk of thievery, especially when travelling outside your city. Or you can be like me, and become a church priest, who can make documents that give social bonuses, and sell for quite a bit, in addition to being able to give sermons. With a high amount of speech, you can get a lot of money for just talking to your attendees about a magical man in the sky. Stupid blacksmith, having to buy metal and make items of value out of them, while I just prophet and profit. This is also one of the easiest ways to butt-kiss your way through the political ladder of your town.Speaking of the political and social aspects, they are quite entertaining as well. If you're good at speaking, and have some charisma, you can try your luck at earning one of the town positions by manipulating votes and your fellow townspeople. Each town has a certain amount of positions available, each offering little perks and abilities to the holder, and the amount of positions is based on the size of the town. There is also a justice system in place, giving a legal alternative to murdering the thieves that keep robbing your carts, or that one family that keeps sending henchmen to attack your buildings. If you visually witness any crimes, you obtain evidence, which is all listed and can be viewed at any time. Evidence is rated on severity of crime, believability, and time elapsed since crime was committed.  Believability is typically dependent on how you obtain the evidence. If you saw it with your own eyes, it's 100%. If you sent your henchman to town to investigate rumors, it's typically 50% or lower. Once you have a few severe crimes, or a lot of little ones on someone, you can probably get them the death penalty. But if you accuse someone, you are the prosecutor, so make sure you show up to the trial. If you're a criminal, or the thieves guild, it's in your best interest to make sure your prosecutors are unable to arrive to the trial by whatever means necessary.Overall, this game's unique gameplay and combination of genres makes it worth a purchase. From what others have said, I'd advise looking into The Guild II: Renaissance over this particular version though. Each of the Guild II titles are stand-alone games, so you are not required to own this to play Renaissance. This game does have it's share of bugs, and I will list the ones I found below in the pros/cons:ProsIn addition to political and business aspects, this game is an RPG. Your family members have levels, stats, and perks that they can acquire every couple of levels.Various career paths give the game replayability. Some careers are unique in how you will play.Robust social system - each person is unique, and most are born instead of generated. The game keeps track of 100+ individual characters throughout multiple towns. Each person must marry and reproduce to continue their bloodlines, or become a footnote in the history books.This game is truly unique. Not only is it highly enjoyable, but there is no game that really comes close to this style. Sims Medieval attempted, but failed.ConsBugs/Glitches - While I have read other reviews with worse issues than I've had, I encountered one problematic issue. Rarely, when my rival families would send their cronies to attack my church, they would somehow spawn in the walls of my building. Guards would stack outside my church, along with my own henchmen I sent to defend it, unable to go into the walls to reach my aggressors. I almost lost a level 3 church, which costs a lot of gold, because the attackers were invincible. Luckily for me, they disappeared somehow before fully destroying it. But because the guards and myself were unable to stop them, I had a hefty repair bill that should have never happened.AI Pathing - While this is technically a bug too, it warrants it's own bullet-point. Several times I have accused an opponent of crimes, and set a court date. When the game informed me the trial was soon, I would click the accuser, right-click the town hall picture, and send him on his way. However a few times, he didn't make it, due to wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out a path to the same town hall he's been to before. This would result in not only my opponent being found innocent by default, but me getting a fine for wasting the court's time. I have also noticed that when anyone approaches the town hall from the side that has a tavern neighboring it, everyone will walk into the tavern first, then walk out and go into the town hall. Just make sure if you have somewhere important to be, you follow your character so he doesn't get lost. It's fairly rare, but annoying. Also, my children would sometimes be unable to attend school. After I paid for their schooling, they would cancel it because they are idiots who are unable to leave the house for some reason. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really love the game started as the only real group I ignored in the original. Then got completely stuck when about to become sovern. The game still runs but when were called for meetings everyone just wastes the day standing there for no reason. The meeting doesn't even start but on the plus side my people can never be kicked out of there current offices. Thats a really good thing as when the glitch hit they all started really hating us for no apparent reason. This affected even the characters that really loved us one second before. Rather fun once you get past how glitchy the whole thing is.			",165,102,3,55,47,2,26

												Very great game with deep mechanics.Started off by buying a mine and mining gold and other ores. Got married and had children then retired and let my son take over the business then eventually my grandson. A rival mining family sent thugs to kill my grandson in cold blood outside of the family jewelery store. Since my original character was still alive but very old, I had him ambush and stab to death all the daughters of the rival family.I then went to the courthouse to seek legal  justice for the murder of my grandson but died like an hour before the courthouse opened.Great game and I highly recommend it.

												Ця доволі несподівана simодібна стратегія виявилась доволі причіпкуватою  штукою.  Розпочавши в неї грати вже непросто кинути напризволяще свого Alter ego та зростаюче сімейство. У німецьких розробників вийшла затишна, оригінальна і захоплива стратегія (жаль, лише що музика не вразила). Сподобається цей проект не лише  стратегам, але й рпґшникам. Оцінка 8 з 10.

												Bought The Guild 2 and it's expansion a few years back. I thought it was awful, tedious and broken. If you want a good city builder (not a Sims) game basically try Banished.I do believe that I gave all the chances I could to this game in 10 hours. I normally don't take the time to bash on something years later but this was so excruciatingly painful and tedious to play, I thought i should warn others. You can do much better buying anything else readers, even for 2.75 $			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wanted to like this game.. It's such an interesting idea. There was nothing in the very lenghty tutorial about what game mode to choose and why. I looked it up online. My first savegame I was kidnapped in the first 10 minutes or so. Okay, that's funny right? But then nothing happened for a long time. There was nothing that said what to do when you get kidnapped. I ended up just looking it up online and found out there would be a ransom demand eventually. When the ransom demands finally came I couldn't afford them so basically I was playing as a farmer for a while hoping I could pay to get my chick back. It got old real fast. When I chose to be a Patron I realized I didn't even really know what to do with that. I decided farming would be a good option to start with and realized I had no idea how to do that. All of that would be fine if there was something that sort of points you in the direction you need to be in. Once again I was looking it up online. It seems like there IS a really cool game in there somewhere but you have to dig to find it. Not a game for me. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is like The Sims, set 600 years ago.  Whilst its offers a big grapical upgrade over the original game, there's a sense of pointlessness about the gameplay itself.  The tutorials have you yawning and losing interest quickly.  This, I admit, is largely due to there being so many very much better games of a similar type around, and not to any inherant fault: it's an old game, and there's always a questioon mark when old games are revived for the current market.  This wasn't exactly a smash-hit trend setter in its day, so the classic-retro card can't be played.  There's nothing nostalgic about a game that merely occupies your time, doesn't entertain or amuse you.  Unless you have time to waste, I'd suggest avoiding this and joining the classic-retro game queue at a much later date, with a more accompolished title.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game claims to be an RPG... it isn't. What it is is a management sim and it ain't a very deep one at that. For something that's supposed to be about you living the medieval life there's not an awful lot of you livin' a life and probably a bit too much of you micro-managing your businesses and your employees. It is possible to set the AI to manage the buisnesses you build but you're very unlikely to make a sustanible profit doing that. The political system seems interesting at first but once you've climbed to the top it doesn't feel very fulfilling, and it doesn't add anything to the game to make you want to continue playing longer. The family system could've been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that it requires almost no effort what-so-ever. The most complicated thing you'll do is court your mate, but all that consists of is using four or five actions in the right order to increase your prospective spouse's affection, but each of these actions have a linked cool down with the rest so you have to wait a good few hours of ingame time (you can speed up the clock thankfully) before you can perform the next compliment. Children you send to school with a push of a button and there's no need to keep either parent at home to look after them either.Combat does exist in this game as does criminal actions but it's all rather pointless, you'll be far more successful running a lawful business than you ever would a criminal one and using actions like threats or murder are far too risky and made pointless by the fact that you can just bribe anyone and everyone into liking you.I find it hard to decide whether or not to recommend this game. Yes i've been critical but as a management game it's not bad and i've certainly played worse. It does carry an interesting premise, if not a particularly well implimented one. What it comes down to with me is, tho, the fact that it claims to be an RPG and a medieval life simulator and it's just not.A word of advice if you still wish to pick this game up go for the Renaissance stand-alone expansion since it has everything that both the main game and the Pirates expansion offers.

												After watching the ""Let's play the game"" about The Guild 2, I decided to buy the game and try it out.The first thing you'll find out, that's it's quite unclear what you should do.The tutorials give you the basics about control and actions you can take.But anything worthwhile is player made and quality varies. You have the different 'classes' you can try:- Patron- Craftsman- Scholars- RougesI chose craftsman and started a blacksmith making tools.Bought wood and iron and all went quite well. After a while I bought a woodcutter, which helped in making more money.In the meantime I went on adventure in the political arena and made it to some low-ranking office.Got some kids, expanded my buildings a little.After a while you get how the game works and all goes more easily.Instead of buying an already existing mine, which was getting more and more expensive,I instead send my thugs to attack and conquer it. After which, my wealth exploded.Because the mine was making much more then it was selling and wasn't controlled by one of the houses.Expanding my little empire, I ran into the rank problem which required you to buy an higher title to build more buildings. And decided to build stuff in another town.Meanwhile I had reached the highest political rank, with two children on the two 2nd tier positions.Making it easy as pie to stay in position and also to quel my oponents.And everybody was bribing me to get any position, which was a nice income as well.But at this point, the game lost my interest. There was little challenge left and only 'chores' that remained.The scope of the game doesn't magically increase. The city and villages around it are you playground, forever.Which means once you got enough buildings and such, you basically won. No endless games.You can make the AI 'run' your buildings, which is nice and all that, but mostly poorly worked out.1) You cannot setup 'routes' like ""Bring XX wood from woodcutter to blacksmith, then bring XX iron from mine to blacksmith""2) The AI buys the resources needed, not necessarily at your resource-producer3) You cannot set your building to sell only to -your- carts, thus you cannot set a lower price for yourself4) The AI ignores your ""only work in current city"" setting from time to timeBesides that there are various annoying buys:1) Translations in dialogues are missing or buggy. Resulting in German speech.2) Carts standing next to a building (or in it) don't show up for interaction in the building3) Various other glitchesAll these combined result in my regretting buying the game.It was fun for a maximum of 9 hours, but after writing this review and deleting the game.I highly doubt I ever will touch the game again.

												Meh. I was prepared to sink some time into this one, 'cause it looks like it could be interesting if I take the time to struggle through the clunky interface. Unfortunately, it crashed (hard) two thirds of the way thru the tutorials and I had to reboot my entire PC. That kind of ended it there. Interest was already waning, and I'm not willing to handle technical problems on top of design problems.From what I played, which wasn't much, the UI was a real turn-off - unintuitive and difficult to use. It was compounded by spending a significant amount of time just waiting (and this is in the tutorial, so I'm assuming it only gets worse). The graphics are, of course, typical of a game its age, so that doesn't help any. I think even without the crash I probably wouldn't have been able to handle much more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is extremely buggy in ways that are downright insulting. During council meetings, the sound files are all mixed up to the point where you will have a character switching between German and English lines of dialogue. The Character models are very similar to each other and they aren't very pretty to look at either. Also, there is really limited dialogue so you'll hear your character say, ""MY GRAIN IS NOT MOLDY!"" every third time you select them. There is fun to be had building up a small trading community, acquiring raw materials, turning them into crafting items and then selling them, but if you are going to buy a Guild game, buy the Guld 2: Renaissance as it is a stand-alone expansion pack that is far less buggy then this mess			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game thinking: ""I like RTS and micromanagement games, this one has a non-combat focus, let's try it"". All that I can say is: what a waste.-Way to bugged (specially the micromanagment part);-Limited options (you don't have much things like buildings, production, etc. to choose from);-It really has a different approach to the genre;4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, I haven't gotten the chance to play this much but I've noticed some odd sh*t going on. For instance, when the game is paused the people continue to move, though the time does not advance. It is also next to impossible to interact with someone as they constantly move away. It takes forever for your character to reach someone else, and by the time they get to the right location that person is already gone. Also, the controls are clunky and dated, and its a b*tch to deselect something.And I might be missing some important stuff that would make this game more enjoyable and less frustrating. I don't know; the tutorial wasn't helpful. Everything covered in it is so straight forward, and this would have to be your first game ever for it to be necessary. Overall, an interesting game of which I love the concept but not the execution. If you're interested in a tedious game where you micromanage details, try this out. For the price, it's not too bad. But otherwise I'd give this one a pass.			",22,21,0,11,17,1,14

The Guild 2 is a unique mixture of RPG and life simulation in an immersive middle ages scenario. The player and his party become part of history and can even change it in real-time. Go back to the dark middle ages and found a new dynasty! Take care of yourself, because your opponents never sleep! Marry a beautiful wife and make new friends... control your life!

												Possibly the worst game I've ever /tried/ to play. The game was literally unplayable, the AI was ridiculous and no clear way of playing it. I've played Civilization, Warcraft, Starcraft I, II, Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, etc, so it's not simply that I didn't understand the game, the game wasn't made properly for any human to play.To reiterate, the game played fine, but there was no consise goals, the game was just illogical, with no real direction. My person, if you can say person, entity, whatever he was, got attacked by thugs 30 seconds into the game, and the guards got glitched or something and would follow him everywhere.He wouldn't fully heal, and I was only seeing trickles of profit from something I bought, and the game plays in real time and I couldn't fast forward so I could move forward quicker to actually do anything in a reasonable amount of time. Further more, I managed to find a place to sleep, or lie down, and the character wouldn't heal. But the guards followed me, and it showed them all storming in and waiting at the foot of my bed for whatever reason, they were just glitched on me. The game just feels unfinished, and bad.It's not worth $10, it's not even worth $1, I feel like I should of been paid $10 to play the game for the 10 minutes that I did, that's how aweful it is.

If you like to sit down and learn an entire game, invest your life into it, and if you generally dont have anything better to do with your life than play a medieval sim game with graphics from the late 90's, this game is perfect. But if you actually want to buy a FUN game in which you can appreciate it and ACTUALLY ENJOY IT... Well, i doubt its for you. I bought the package for $3.50. Wasted money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It has some really neat and fun interactivity for sure, but what I truly enjoyed was the games ability to evoke your imagination.

												Relaxing and fun game, VERY simple and deep at the same time. I highly recommend this game if you like Life Sim's, it has trade, stealing, fighting, building your own bussinesses from scratch i mean it really is amazing. Running your own bussiness sounds tough but this game makes it easy to start off with one or two stores then upgrading them and building them bigger, eventually youll just start to want to something else other than your profession, but thats where the fun comes in. If you marry someone of the other profession you then can build some of those types of buildings and bussinesses, but why stop there? Start running for office, become a major political head figure for your city, change taxes, fight for the guard, hell be an EXICUTIONER!!!!!!!!!! Ya thats right, torture people and kill them, why? Cause its your job! Seriously this game is a must try, i havent been playing it long but i can certainly say it has really made me happy. Havent even tapped into the DLC yet, but i cant wait to. Buy this game, you'll thank me later ^_^ have fun!			",195,26,5,39,54,3,19

												You can make your own story. The graphics are only so-so, but this was proably made for the ol' 1024 x 748, so not the games fault.  The game isn't that hard once you get the hang of it.  -If you can keep people from ripping you off, attacking you on the way to work and fixing the verdicts in court against you.  But, you know there is some vengence when you keep that grunge against the ones that wronged you, and you can come around and screw them down the road, so don't forget about them...watch them, spy on them with your henchman, who is usually some sexy chick that you drop your wife for, only to find out, she doesnt feel the same way.  Like this game? No, I hate it.  I hate it because I married the wrong girl in the first couple years, and now I'm stuck with her!!! Okay, I'm better.Hey listen people.  No one has mentioned this, but JoWood published this game, same people that helped Prognosis launch the ORIGINAL - not the crappie follow on -Panzer Elite.  The game is good, for under 5 bucks, you get 3.  And, its engaging, fun and keeps you interested. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After many retries I started out as a craftswoman to start a business, get a patron husband and take office within the first turn. Proceeded to have two daughters and apply for office with both husband and wife and upgrade the business once. With the city informants now under my control, I got large amounts of evidence against two rogue families, one of which stole some oak wood from me early on. I blackmailed them for huge amounts of experience with both husband and wife. And so it went on and on.Now at year 1432, or turn 9 I think (Dynasty Mode), I have 4 fully upgraded businesses. I turned my husband and second daughter, named Burbles, into powerful fighters with the best equipment. The husband just had outlaw status lifted from him after 8 years as he didn't get immunity before being accused of that which made him a ""walking nightmare"", so he's been running between our hut, the church and the town hall to attend elections without being swarmed by bailiffs which attack him on sight. While the husband was out of commission, Burbles continued his legacy of blackmail, theft and murder. She has already been accused, but I will be judge in the trial. Now, finally, father and daughter can commit murder together.I've completely ignored the first daughter, named Hurkle. I simply sent her to school and she came back as Dr. Noblewoman Hurkle♥♥♥♥♥♥my-lord. For all that money, her stats rose from 1 to 2-3 and she goes to church all the time.However, doing all this may feel clunky if you just jump right into the game. I had to do the tutorial first to understand the basics, and even then some things are not (well) explained. I also read that the Renaissance expansion is better for bringing the best features and the least bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Surprisingly deep and interesting game. It has A LOT of weak points such as ugly graphics and weird bugs, but if you are able to see them more as a charming quality than a nuisance you are up for a lot of fun. You are able to play it however you wish, and it has fun trading, politics and combat aspects. I recommend playing it in multiplayer with your friends in local network. It is also very time consuming. I perfectly understand why people don't like this game, since I hated it in the beginning too. But as I played with my friend in online I began to respect the game as it is and see the charm. It is too much fun to follow the city counsil meetings when they swap languages almost mid-sentence.

												i play this game offline so my hours are more like 50+first of all this game takes a long time to get into, there is so much going on that you will likely start over a few times before you play through an entire game. some people like that in a game, as i do.the guild II is a great concept executed in an enjoyable way. you'll begin as a lowely merchant peddling your shoddy tongs or potions and eventaully climb the political ladder as your business grows beneath you, then you die.. but dont worry, you got a naive young rouge pregnant and have a family of theives and tavern owners.. great. you'll do fine.

It has some really neat and fun interactivity for sure, but what I truly enjoyed was the games ability to evoke your imagination. It doesn’t' spell everything out but rather leaves a good level of openness for your imagination to run wild.			",20,3,0,6,12,0,16

												This game is really a time eater. If you are looking for a game that is slow paced, has a slow learning curve, completly open ended, full of choices, and is challenging but not too hard, then this game is for you. You play the role of an entire family, that means you can control every person in your family, excluding the doughters... Aladeen was right ""is it a boy or an abortion?"". lol. sorry if you didn't get that reference or the joke.overall it is a really fun game if you have the time. BEWARE: it is FULL of bugs: characters not doing what they are supposed to, talking with different voices, and many more. Get the Expansion, Renaissance, if you want a less buggy experience. At least that's what I heard, have not tested.Have fun!			",28,2,1,2,7,0,6

												I am glad I listened to the reviews. The game is buggy, the graphics are unappealing, and has a dated feel, but it also has a lot of depth and is a lot of fun. In many ways it is like the sims on steroids. Its competitive and instead of controlling a single player, you control a lineage. My first game never made it to the third generation because I waited too long to have my first characters daughter marry, and 3 husbands later (one died of old age before they could consummate, wanted him dead before the child was of age, 2 were poisoned by the neighbors before she could get pregnant) I'm looking at a dead end. Run a business, make a business out of politics, be a rogue and rob and poison your way to the top, or simply enjoy the various businesses and crafting, there is plenty to do. The game could use more polish, and has a few bugs, but is well worth playing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you want to play the role of a merchant or tradesman in a historical setting, this is the game you are looking for!It's just a shame it's very poorly implemented.The UI and how the game responds to UI commands is horrific.The way the game is set means that far from being a relaxed experience you are constantly having to look here, there and everywhere trying to track whatever it is your intellectually deficient avatars are doing. The game also seems to enjoy having many things to do, all half baked and less a feature than a hurdle. Want to continue your family line, best try and romance someone!Oh, you also wanted to actually, y'know, be a merchant or blacksmith? Tough.Want to work your way up the political ladder? Gonna die alone, probably with a knife in your back.Theres so much to do, and no time at all to do it and often you can waste ( in game ) days at a time trying to accomplish one simple task.This game should be so, so very good and is exactly the sort of game I could sink months in to.If it weren't rotten down to the foundations.( Also badly coded, with terrible pathing, outmoded graphics and a sense that the game itself resents the player trying to do anything at all )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to like this game, but all I got was frustration. After going through the tutorial, you get ""some"" basic idea about how the game plays, but when you start the game you pretty much feel clueless on what to do or how to approch it. After fumbling around for a while you'll get your business up and struggle to maintain it. All you will be focused on will be trying to juggle getting resources, making items and selling it. On top of that, you risk your hard work being taken by robbers on the way to the market at the other town. Another thing to juggle with is finding and courting a partner, getting married and have children. If you don't do it, eventually your character will die of old age and there will be no one to carrying on your family business. At this point you haven't even started on the politics side of the game. FRUSTRATING is the only thing I got out of this game. I really want to like it and play it, but the frustration due to the complexity of the game makes me want to uninstall this game and not waste my time with it. Urghhh....			",101,2,2,15,12,1,9

												You can make your own story. The graphics are only so-so, but this was proably made for the ol' 1024 x 748, so not the games fault.  The game isn't that hard once you get the hang of it.  -If you can keep people from ripping you off, attacking you on the way to work and fixing the verdicts in court against you.  But, you know there is some vengence when you keep that grunge against the ones that wronged you, and you can come around and screw them down the road, so don't forget about them...watch them, spy on them with your henchman, who is usually some sexy chick that you drop your wife for, only to find out, she doesnt feel the same way.  Like this game? No, I hate it.  I hate it because I married the wrong girl in the first couple years, and now I'm stuck with her!!! Okay, I'm better.Hey listen people.  No one has mentioned this, but JoWood published this game, same people that helped Prognosis launch the ORIGINAL - not the crappie follow on -Panzer Elite.  The game is good, for under 5 bucks, you get 3.  And, its engaging, fun and keeps you interested. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Relaxing and fun game, VERY simple and deep at the same time. I highly recommend this game if you like Life Sim's, it has trade, stealing, fighting, building your own bussinesses from scratch i mean it really is amazing. Running your own bussiness sounds tough but this game makes it easy to start off with one or two stores then upgrading them and building them bigger, eventually youll just start to want to something else other than your profession, but thats where the fun comes in. If you marry someone of the other profession you then can build some of those types of buildings and bussinesses, but why stop there? Start running for office, become a major political head figure for your city, change taxes, fight for the guard, hell be an EXICUTIONER!!!!!!!!!! Ya thats right, torture people and kill them, why? Cause its your job! Seriously this game is a must try, i havent been playing it long but i can certainly say it has really made me happy. Havent even tapped into the DLC yet, but i cant wait to. Buy this game, you'll thank me later ^_^ have fun!			",195,26,5,39,54,3,19

												After many retries I started out as a craftswoman to start a business, get a patron husband and take office within the first turn. Proceeded to have two daughters and apply for office with both husband and wife and upgrade the business once. With the city informants now under my control, I got large amounts of evidence against two rogue families, one of which stole some oak wood from me early on. I blackmailed them for huge amounts of experience with both husband and wife. And so it went on and on.Now at year 1432, or turn 9 I think (Dynasty Mode), I have 4 fully upgraded businesses. I turned my husband and second daughter, named Burbles, into powerful fighters with the best equipment. The husband just had outlaw status lifted from him after 8 years as he didn't get immunity before being accused of that which made him a ""walking nightmare"", so he's been running between our hut, the church and the town hall to attend elections without being swarmed by bailiffs which attack him on sight. While the husband was out of commission, Burbles continued his legacy of blackmail, theft and murder. She has already been accused, but I will be judge in the trial. Now, finally, father and daughter can commit murder together.I've completely ignored the first daughter, named Hurkle. I simply sent her to school and she came back as Dr. Noblewoman Hurkle♥♥♥♥♥♥my-lord. For all that money, her stats rose from 1 to 2-3 and she goes to church all the time.However, doing all this may feel clunky if you just jump right into the game. I had to do the tutorial first to understand the basics, and even then some things are not (well) explained. I also read that the Renaissance expansion is better for bringing the best features and the least bugs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[Note: Do not look at this review and think ""Oh he recommended it that means it's a perfect game.""]I must say that the game is really fun, IF you know how to play. I strongly recommend doing the entirety of the tutorial, which will take, at most, 30 minutes. Do not just do the first two and think that the others don't matter, which I almost did. The rest of them can be even more important than the first two.You basically HAVE to set your bakery/shop to ""AI"" because it's practically unplayable on ""manual."" Also, you need a bakery/shop if you want to get any money at all, unless you rob people or something, which I haven't tried yet.If you start the game with a black screen, click twice with about a second between clicks, and a loading screen will appear.To me, the voice for people felt really half done. About 20% of the time, people would start speaking in German, and about 10% of the time for female voices in the political part of the game, it would switch to a man voice. And sometimes, there would be no voice at all. If this is starting to worry you, I'll let you know there is subtitles on screen at all times, and I dont know if they can be turned off.I haven't played the DLC yet, so I don't know anything about them (Especially since I only bought 1 of them).So, to summarize it:Is it fun? Yes. Is it perfect? No. Is it worth $10? No, get it on sale.(I bought it for $2.49, and it's definately worth that and somewhat more.			",107,5,0,27,11,0,11
