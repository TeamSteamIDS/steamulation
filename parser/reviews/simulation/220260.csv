												Don't let the metascore scare you away. This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig.			",116,46,3,44,44,1,28

												Perfectly simulates farming but without the crippling debt, cow turds, and bi-weekly calls to the suicide hotline. However be warned that enjoying this game will cause you to forever wonder at what point in your life it all went wrong, that you're now sitting in your underwear at 2am fretting about the fluctuating price of corn.

												A calming, surprisingly engaging game. Even if you laugh at the concept, it's worth a try if you're after a chillout game but have played Minecraft to death.One thing I would say is that the time you need to invest before you start getting the cool equipment is pretty steep, but there are things you can buy that passively earn money and mean you can earn more than you spend on production.

												My steam account only shows 22 hours on this game as I purchased this digital copy only recently so I could play coop with my six-year-old son.  I’ve played this, the 2011, and the 2009 versions for many countless hours. As background, I have a graduate degree in agriculture economics and have spent a good portion of my life farming.  By all accounts, I should dislike this game: * the controls are clunky* the physics are often aggravating* the particle flow/dust and other graphical elements are a throwback to 1990’s 3D engines* the ‘farming’ elements are incredibly simplistic and the economics are silly.And yet there is something oddly cathartic and relaxing about this game that keeps me coming back for more day after day. I derive the most enjoyment from utilizing some of the many modifications to stretch this game to its limits.  The most important is Courseplay, which allows me to automate most of the tasks and play a managerial role, even though the game it technically a driving simulator.  I also enjoy user-submitted maps, such as Paradise 2013, which are set up for larger operations and automated farming.  Even though I wish the developers would license a better game engine so that the physics, rendering, and particle flow are more realistic, as well as include an 'advanced' mode that actually adjusts growth conditions and incorporates specific pests/weeds that I have to control, I can’t help but think that I’ll keep playing this game for a long time to come.

												This is surprisingly good for something that doesn't even try to hide the fact it's a farming simulator. That said, of course it still *is* a farming simulator, so you *will* be doing some things that are a little more tedious than you'd expect from a typical game. For example, there's no denying that a large part of farm work is driving up and down a field at slow speed, so you will be doing some of that. At the same time you don't have most of the sources of excitement that other open world games have, you're doing honest work (except if you're stealing golf carts, which is possible and apparently nobody cares) so you're not going to be in any police chases or shootouts. The game does a very good job at simulating a farm. You start out with some money, machinery, a loan, and a field (depending on difficulty) and manage the operation from there on. You tend your fields, buy machines, buy more fields, perhaps some animals, and so on, and the level of detail is mostly pretty good. All this takes place in a completely open world, and while you can't buy any cars unless you install mods, there's a very large selection of tractors and other equipment that you can drive around. The nice thing is that equipment generally works like you'd expect it to work: Trailers can be attached to tractors, or in some cases to other trailers, making trains; then you drive them over a grate and press a key to unload your grains, which will happen in a way specific to the type of trailer you're using. Front loaders can pick up things and carry them around, sowers sow, sprayers spray, additional tanks attached to the front of your tractor provide more fertilizer for the sprayer attached to its rear, balers pick up straw and make bales, which you can then pick up with a front loader or another machine that stacks them. Cows produce manure, which you can use to fertilize your fields if you choose to do so, and so forth.The game does try to alleviate some of the tedium by letting you hire help for some of the repetitive driving tasks. For example, plowing, cultivating, sowing, fertilizing, spraying, and harvesting can all be done by a computer controlled clone of you. This is implemented very nicely, you just drive the machine to the starting point and press H and it'll start doing what you'd expect it to do. For example, a combine harvester will start slowly harvesting your field, driving up and down, and eventually stop when it's full. Then you can pull up next to it with a trailer and the computer help will extend the combine's pipe and unload the harvest into your trailer and continue. Similarly if you drive next to it while it's harvesting, it'll transfer the harvest to your trailer as you go. This makes it very easy to do some of the typical farming tasks that normally require more than one person. It also adds an aspect of time management to the game when you have multiple computer controlled helpers working your fields and need to jump around between them to support them.You also don't have to wait for your plants to grow. There are three settings to control how fast plants grow, and separately you can also speed up time by 120x. Machines only work at one fixed pace, though.The farming aspect of this game includes various types of grains, potatoes, beets, as well as cattle (for dairy), sheep (for wool), and chicken (for eggs). Additionally, you can buy green houses that you can freely place on the map to grow things such as herbs or tomatoes, and you can buy bee houses that'll produce honey.In addition to typical farming tasks, there also are some half arsed missions (basically two types: one requires you to pick up something with a front loader, another requires you to mow strangely rectangular areas where grass suddenly appeared on the golf course). You can also buy solar panels and wind energy converters, which will provide a nice consistent stream of extra income (they're a little too good).I'm rating this game a 9 out of 10 because it's a good farming simulator with a very nice open world and very detailed equipment. But as I stated above, it's still a farming simulator, and not an action game, and I would not necessarily expect it to appeal to the same audience as other open world games.

												From the moment I started playing this game, it felt like Need For Speed and The Sims had combined into one. From the visually stunning detail on every tractor, to the joy of harvesting that last potato, this game had it all. Want to plant some corn? Go for it! Feel like selling some eggs? You can do that too! The possibilities are endless when you're running your own farm. Why not play with friends? Feel the excitement when you and your buddies connect over the internet webs and spend hours cultivating your first crops. You will never run out of things to do with an extensive range of different sized fields. Form a clan and take on the annual MLG Farming Simulator 2013 Internationals to compete against the top teams of farmers around the world. Need to get somewhere in a hurry? Just steal a golf cart from the local golf club, and even crash it into a lake.  If that's not enough, Titanium Edition comes with 4 new maps and the urban camo assault crossbow. Pick up a copy of game of the year edition and become eligible for Double XP weekends and gain access to the Farming Simulator 2014 multiplayer beta upon release. So what are you waiting for? Become a farmer today!			",431,60,11,36,63,7,40

												Boring in description, but oddly addictive. You buy land, till fields, sow seeds, and harvest crops. Much like many simulations, though, there's an underlying satisfaction in setting the groundwork and watching your crops (and fortunes) grow steadily. It can get a little boring later on once you've got steady income and all the equipment you could need to maintain it, but still manages to be a relaxing experience throughout.

												Now that the new Farming Simulator 15 has come out, its high time to write down my personal thoughts of 2013 Titanium.This is a game sim about running a modern farm. You get 2 maps to start with, Hagenstedt and Westbridge Hills. The game started off with Hagenstedt, but more content and Westbridge Hills was added later in the Titanium upgrade.So what do you do at your farm?You grow crops, manage ure animals and do missions to put it simply. The crops that you can grow are: Wheat, Barley, Canola, Sugar Beets and Potatoes.The animals you can have are: Cows, Sheep and Chickens.There is also two type of missions you can do: Transport Missions and Mowing. You can freely choose how you play the game, and can freely roam on the map, doing what you like. If you only wanna grow crops, for example, thats just fine. Pros:- The free playstyle, doing what you want, when you want. - Multiplayer. This game is made for it, you can have tons of fun with ure friends working together on the farm.- Loads of equipment. From plows to harvesters. - Easy to learn and get into.- Literally TONS of mods to further enhance your gameplay!Cons: I really cant say bad things about the game, but no game is perfect.- The handling of some machines are wonky and hard to control (but you get used to it.)- Easy to get stuck in fences/rocks and stupid Ai cars. (Fortunately there is a reset function for ure equipment if it flips over or get stuck.)- It sometimes feels like your alone in a empty world just driving your machines in single player. There is Ai cars and people, but still feels empty. (Multiplayer fixes that.)My personal Thoughts:This is one of my favorite types of sim games. The playstyle is relaxed and easy. Might be a bit stressful at harvest time, but other than that, its really a great game. The game flows well, atleast in single player. Lag issues and small freezes can occur in multplayer, but thats not the game´s fault. I had some great fun farming with my friends. Its a perfect co-op game to work at your farm and earn cash for new machinery and expanding your farm.The game has plenty of machines and equipment to choose from and isnt that enough, there is a great mod community that offers tons of mods of all sorts from new maps and new equipment to gameplay mechanics.This is a great game if u like farming sim games. The new one is out, but i recommend to get this new ""classic"" too.			",237,164,7,31,27,2,10

												I own both this version (2013) and its successor (2015). I tend to prefer this version to the 2015 version because I am not a fan of the logging focus that was forced into 2015. I think they should have spent their efforts adding more crops and farming styles (like orchards for example). Regardless, they are both EXCELLENT games for those that enjoy an open play style and empire building style. A relaxing and enjoyable experience all around.The Modding community behind these games is AMAZING. If you can imagine it, then someone, somewhere has probably built it. Almost anything you can think of is only a few clicks away from adding it to your game.More than 500 hours played in FS2013 at the time of this review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can recommend this, as well as all the other FS (2011, 2015) only provisionally. First off, my biggest gripe is that it is NOT a farm simulator. There is no element of acually farming except for the equipment... And that's what it really is; a tractor driving simulator. Sure you can plow and spray and blah blah, but none of that really has any affect on the actual yield of a field. Should I plow before I drill? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Is it going to rain? Doesn't matter, you'll get the same yield. Also, other ""farming"" elements such as weed and pest control are absent. Having said all that, you can drive a variety of equipment for quite a few tasks such as drilling, mowing, raking, blah blah. It's an okay game if you like that sort of thing. I picked it up cheap and I feel I got my moneys worth, but if it were any more money and I'd not have recommended it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its always a grind to make more and more money, to get the next best machine or piece of equipment, to get more livestock, and to get new fields. I highly recommend modding the game with simple things like trailers, extra tractors, and trucks these will make the gameplay much more enjoyable.			",234,45,6,43,20,1,16

												Semi-open world, quasi-sandbox game about making profit from the land cultivation. No bloodshed, no thrills except of running out of money, questionable challenges... Yet, surprisingly, it's working as the game! Gripping with it's charming simplicity of the peaceful farm life and basic routine to make the day!After trying Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming recently, I was expecting everything bad from this game. Surprisingly, I was wrong. In fact, Farming Sim 2013 is really decent enough farming simulator - making you an operator of various farmers tools, starting from tractor with plough or fertilizer attached, going with mowers, harvesters, and even a trailer truck to get your stuff to the buyer.You're not get your hands dirty there, there is no actual manual labor (except of picking up eggs, maybe). All that you're supposed to do is to dig up the ground, sow it, fertilize, harvest and prepare the new planting. All by using different vehicles and attachments. And you're not even have to do all those works yourself! There are always convinient farmhand to dig some earth for you. Also there are some passive income sources: bee nests, greenhouses and solar panels - in the end, Farming Sim 2013 can be quite a good idling game. Just plant some stuff here and there, leave it be, and after some days passed, voila! - you're a millionaire! And that's not even a joke.As of downsides, the simulation is far from well-being and from reality in many aspects, starting from engine and physics, going with visuals, stupid gameplay challenges, unhelpful tutorials and so on. It is working - sure, but there is a big question, if you're gonna like it or not.If you're not minding just riding the tractor across countryside, performing some basic tasks here and there - that's good point. If you were ever wandering, what all those variety of tractors and combines are made for - you'll get a proficient picture.If you, however, play the games for thrills and hard challenges - that's not the right title. If you're gonna make yourself a farmer - you're not gonna find much useful info there, as well, as it's all not even covering the basics of the real farmwork.Still, again, as a simulator of farming life - it's working nice enough. Peaceful game, with achievements to unlock and fields to harvest. My mark is 6.5/10.PS: can't vouch for DLCs - they're pretty much the same, except of landscape			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												I give a thumbs up to the ""Farming Simulator"" franchise.The reasons are:1- Its absolutly relaxing gameplay, the closest you can get to nature without leaving the house.2- It is by far the most deep game that can still be played ""passivly"", meaning you can fullfil other life duties such as reading/ studying and still enjoy this game in the background.3- Has enough activities to engage you when you have more time and choose to play more ""activly"".4- Even provides multiplayer to enjoy with friends!5- Very educational for urban people like me who never even knew a thing or 2 about farming.I will gladly recommend all the versions even today: 2011, 2013, 2015 every game has a set of achievments and the older it is the more basic the gameplay is. So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)			",114,51,2,26,35,4,43

												Farming Simulator 2013 I would call it the best game I have played but a good and funny game none the less. By the title you can probably tell it is do with farming and that just what it is. From most simulators I have played this is the most polished and better designed compared to the rest. For me I didn't really know to much about farming and wouldn't be able to tell you a peice of equipment if you asked me about it but after playing this game I began to learn about the equipment and how it was used. It was more of learning excerise I had than a game but it was fun playing with couple of friends here and there if there was nothing else to do. Its not a game I would say have to play but if you and couple of mates are bored I would suggest all getting it and giving it a try. The price at £29.99 is a bit steep.. well.. very steep but I got it on sale when it was under £10 so I didn't pay but if you want to give it a try with mates not that fun to play alone. I would rate this 7/10 not because its a really good game but because of the enjoyment I had with it with friends not best buy but if you have nothing better to do give it a shot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time of writing I am in at 1200+ hrs. The extraordinary thing is the title is a bland, no bells and whistles sim.So what's the attraction?Initially, starting with 1 paddock on the stock map and a small amount of equipment provides an impetus to do what farmers do. Plant, reap, sell, expand. But it doesn't take long to learn the quirks and the cash points so ""expansion"" and accummulation of wealth becomes kinda pointless soon enough.The scenery can be special, the fields and textures quite mundane. Equipment modelling is very nice. The AI can be quite stupid at times (but I couldn't imagine playing this without them) and it's got a definite farm feel. On it's own, it might get 300-400 hours to dedicated tycoon-sim fan.So what is it? What made me do (and will probably continue) over 1200+ hrs of playtime?FS2013, to me, is all about the mods. New maps, new equipment, new fruits, new animals and new ways to do things are offered by a very dedicated modding community and have been since the game first released. The ability to connect the dots to create any specific industry on the farm has increased exponentially. New animal mods, such as the piggery, provide for a very diverse form of infrastructure modelling to run successfully. From grain to root vegetables to water to straw to mixed rations and onwards. Giants themselves have done very little to gameplay and it took them 12 months to release a new map and some new equipment, along with an engine update. They have not added new animals or fruits and even the new farm and new equipment was a DLC purchase. Pretty poor tbh, given the money made (and continues) from this, one of the most popular farming sims out there.Mod it up and it's worth every single cent and will remain a stalwart amongst the box of games we call sims.7/10 unmodded. 9/10 modded.gg			",35,16,5,7,31,1,11

												Let me start by saying that this game is one of the most realistic farming games on the market right now(next to farming simulator 2015). There are hundreds of thousands of mods out there to download. Also, this game doesn't just have to be farming, it can be forestry, mud bugging, tractor pulling, what ever u want. I would defientley recommend this game to anyone out there.			",6,0,0,0,4,0,0

												I originally bought this game as a joke, but I quickly became engrossed into the life of the farmer. Although the game can be very mundane at times (such as when you're waiting for the rain to stop so you can harvest your damn crops), it is still an overall fun experience, especially if you play with friends.

Farming Simulator 2013A great upgrade to Farming Simulator 2011.The Titanium edition was that good I had absolutley no need to modify it unlike 2011. The GUI and general gameplay is much better. Looking after animals is better as now you can feed TMR (Total Mixed Rations) as opposed to just silage or grass on 2011. The controls are better which makes things like the front loader fun to use and not rage inducing like 2011. Also one other great feature over 2011 is they got rid of the scarecrow haha.Great modability as usual with Giants games. Unfortunatley the modding community is corrupt, so many lame people using money mods rather than playing legit. This seems to be a curse throughout the FS series. People's first achievement is 1 million in the bank? Also people achieving 10 million before they have harvested 10 hectares? Please. The last achievement I got was 10 million on a farm bringing in 200k a day with cows and wind turbines. With harvest sometimes I could make up to 700k a day when demands were high, but it still took over 40 hours to get that 10 million due to expansion to keep work flow up. Play legit people!Freerider-Dave ",127,29,30,7,28,0,22

												An interesting insight in to the mundanity (not sure if that's a word!) of farming. Essentially, this game focuses on all the things that bored me when I was a farmer years ago. Plowing seemingly endless fields, before preparing and seeding them again. However, it is a beautifully created game and just not my cup of tea. There is nothing functionally wrong with the game, the level of detail and quality of mods are excellent. I suspect also that if I could stomach playing for a few more days solid I might get more bang for my buckHowever, I have a job and the last thing I want to come home and do after a long day at work is go back to work and plow the fields for a few hours! Sorry, I just found this game intensely dull, it's not overly complex. Plant, harvest, plow, prepare. When you've repeated that, buy some more fields and do it again. I don't know what I was expecting, perhaps something a little more fun like the old days of Sim Farm which had a bit more pace to it. Nevertheless, I'm sure enthusiasts love this game as the attention to detail is exsquisite - so I would recommend this game to anyone who falls into that category. As just an honest gamer looking for something interesting and or fun this didn't hit the mark.			",40,8,0,8,26,0,14

												On paper, Farming Simulator 2013 doesn’t seem all that thrilling, but there’s something intangible that keeps me coming back from more. The combination of the excellent community, unwavering focus on running the business, and the simplicity of the controls and your responsibilities creates a unique business simulation that rewards you proportionally to the amount of work you put into it. I’ve genuinely enjoyed playing it, and I’ll continue to do so even after this review is posted. It’s not the prettiest or deepest business simulator, but it would be folly to just dismiss it because of its subject matter. If you are patient and interested in a relaxing game without absolute winning or losing conditions, give it a try.			",188,26,10,10,40,0,19

												There's quite a few things that can be said about Farming Simulator 2013. I'd say it is aimed at a specific audience for a start. Some may find the gameplay potentially mind-numbing due to the whole repetitiveness with no action, but personally I find it's not too bad to play, because in some points you can also hire workers if you find it too stretching. It is better with friends (as are most games) as it creates more of a mood as well as splitting up the work between you.Essentially: Start with a little bit of money and some vehicles. Plant stuff, harvest, sell, repeat and get more income so that you're able to upgrade your vehicles, equipment and buy more land to maximise your profit. Pretty much an endless cycle until you have the best equipment and vehicles.The graphics aren't particularly good, but if you're someone that isn't bothered by that - You'll be right.The physics are pretty weird, but that's fine because they're pretty funny to play with. The game can also be customised to a certain degree with a large variety of community maps and vehicles that can be downloaded in.Once again, I say that this game is surely not for everyone, but it's not bad if you don't mind the straight forward farming concept with partial monetary and banking section involved. In final, I'd say pick this up on a sale if you like the look of it. What you see from gameplay and trailers are essentially what you get. You're in charge of your own wallet here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish I could coherently explain why I recommend this game. All there is content wise is exactly what you would expect: farming. You plant crops, fertilize them, watch them grow, harvest them and finally ship them to market. It all sounds dreadfully bland, and in all respects it should be. But it's not.I first saw this game on DocM77's Youtube Channel and honestly I thought it was a joke, but then I found myself thinking ""man I would have not invested that profit there.. woah watch the corners you're losing crop yeild!... right now I would definitely invest in more acreage"" and at that point I realized I really wanted to play this game.Boy did it not let me down, I loved every minute of that tedious harvesting and shipping and I don't have an earthly clue why. Don't judge this game by it's cover. Try it out and I bet you'll surprise yourself :)			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

I bought a windmill, and then called it quits.This is an excellent simulation game on agriculture, and if you are a city slicker like me, you will likely learn some things that you may not know! It was particularly interesting the view the different equipment and learn how to manage cows/slurry/haw/straw/chaff, etc. This is not as simple as it sounds! You will constantly be seeking to optimize your time, and you will work your♥♥♥♥♥off! digitally, of course! I recommend this game for everyone, if under 20 dollars. ",135,74,0,33,37,3,45

												Now, you've probably seen the videos and stuff online about this game, they aren't giving this game the highest of praises. But I'll tell you, this game is NOT that bad.Pros:-Fun timewaster-Maybe you could learn something about how the machines work?-Even better with friends-Lots of equipment to be used-DLC are okay-Mods out the♥♥♥♥♥br>Cons:-Boring by yourself-A little glitchy sometimes-(opinion)The Classics DLC doesn't have horses that you can use to pull machinery. (which, I think that brings me to my last pro earlier, they have mods for rideable horses, but I don't know anything else.)Overall, I'd give this game a 7.5/10, it's not that great, I'll let you know now. But it's a fun timewaster, especially with friends, just watch out for the glitches, don't hit the cars. I'd say the reviews of this game on YouTube usually get such bad reviews from Farming Simulator 2011, which sucked, but 2013 is a definite improvement. You could try 2015, but I haven't.

												I used to get mixed up in all sorts of devilment and such, but ever since I found this game I have become a better person!!

												It's Minecraft without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's Farmville without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.It's a deconstruction of the whole RPG genre. The only castle you have is your home, the only quests are the future.Yes, it's aggravating at first. You search desperately for the bandits and the dragons and pretty princesses. You watch videos and expect extreme dubstep drops from space.But, spoiler alert, you won't miss such trivialities. The game wakes you up from such petty tropes. What good is a princess with 2 lines of text? Or a recurring enemy who appears hundreds of times in the course of walking from 1 town to another?Farming Simulator 2013 doesn't try lying to you, not once. The game offers you quests every so often, to mow a lawn or haul a crate across the lush, bountiful countryside. A simple diversion to earn a simple amount of cash while your farm hands do the repetitive tasks.And then oh god yes, the multiplayer. Sublime bliss, shared amongst your friends.

												Farmer or not, you will enjoy this game. Farming Simulator 2013 offers a wide range of realistic equipment to suit any farmer. Titanium Edition adds a new American map, Westbridge Hills to the game along with fitting machinery to run the map. As well as this, the Farming Simulator modding community is huge, offering mods from simple scripts to improve gameplay, to tractors, implements and even new maps. BE WARNED: This game is highly addictive and hours will fly by as you wait for your field of wheat to grow, cart corn to the inn to get a little more cash and find yourself mowing grass at the golf course for money so you can fork out for that telehandler you need so much...

I was considering buying this game for 5 months and finaly bought it when it went on sale. I have 5 hours in 1 day. Once you start its oddly addictive. Bring a friend for the farming madness thats about to ensue. If you even consider buying this game for gameplay, buy it, BUY IT NOW! because its much better than it looks (or sounds).11/10 Would Farm Again~Pweedgemen the game buyer guy			",93,7,4,6,26,3,15

This game IS farming!You plow your field, cultivate your field, plant your seeds, fertilize your seeds, harvest your crop, perhaps harvest your dry-stalks, recultivate your field, rinse-and-repeat.  You also sell your produce: ergo, you load it up from your silos into your truck/tractor-wagon, you drive it into town, and find the best price!  You buy better equipment: tractors, harvesters, etc (all authentic equipment BTW).  You buy more fields to produce more produce!  Perhaps you raise some livestock......got FARM?

												You won't find a better time to try a new game type than the Steam Summer Sale.  That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.How is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.THIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.This game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.

												17 hours of my life I'll never get back, although still better than that time I woke up in a trough in Dundee wearing urinal cake glasses. You know your life has taken a turn for the worse when you're harvesting crops on a Friday night.This could honestly be an enjoyable game if they fixed the following issues:- Worker AI is pretty bad. If they face an obstruction of any sort such as a tree, other equipment or even another worker, they will just idle there and you end up still paying them- Driving to and from the market to sell your harvest can't be automated, resulting in an enjoyable trip through empty towns on a 5mph tractor- You can't run over people because everyone are just ghosts. Is this a farming sim or Scooby Doo?- Some in-game music would be lovely. I suggest the Wurzels or Rednex for next year's iteration- You can buy beehives, chickens etc. to get some regular income but no options for brewing moonshine or selling your family- I know it's meant to be a simulator, but buggering up things by driving too fast is not fun. Either cap the max speed so you don't have to accelerate for 3 seconds then stop pressing W for a while, or just remove this altogether so equipment doesn't fall off your vehicle etc.			",217,38,1,18,9,2,16

												This game changed my human life. Although because of all the time spent on it my dog died from malnutrition and porkchop bones it ate off my numerous plates because I am too drawn to this game to do the dishes. It's fantastic. It has traktors, plants, animals (that you can't see, probably ninjas, or black), and people. I bought this game on sale and it's titanium edition so I knew I couldn't be getting a better deal. But the game was so good I went back and paid full price when the sale was over. That's how fantastic it was. Then I saw Jesus farming my field, but the game spelled his name wrong and it looked something like De Jesus. I knew at that moment this game was endowed by our celestial creator n schtuff. I give this game 8 steamy streamy creamy wooples out of 10 moist Mexican steampiles.			",164,9,1,9,25,1,13

I have played many sim games over the last ten years and this has to rate in the top five. There are several issues but nothing that stops one from having a great expereince playing this game. My one major grip would be with the mods. I find many of the trucks and cars modded for this game are WAY out of scale. Its not often you see a car or a pickup truck larger then a semi truck or tractor yet in FS 2013 mods this is all to common, that said with some looking around one can find a few out there that are close to the right scale. If I where to rate this game out of 10 I would give it an 8.5			",28,3,0,1,13,0,0

												I know what you're thinking.  ""Farming sim? Who would want to do that?"".  Well, that's a good question Billy.  Let's sit down and figure this one out, shall we?  I would say this game appeals to a side of me where you start out with very little and you have to work to improve what you have.  Games like Minecraft, Harvest Moon, The Sims, etc.  Now I'm not saying you are going to dig for diamonds and fight zombies and creepers, nor am I saying this is exactly like Harvest moon or whatever.  I'm just saying that in those games you're started off without much and you have to work to make your world grow.  Likewise, they start you off with a single field and a few tractors and a bank loan, and from there you have to pay off the loan, plant your crops, figure out the best time to sell your crops, and in general keep finding new ways to make money.If you want to be lame, you can buy windmills, and solar panels and a bunch of other easy money-making items.  These items require very little to no maintenance and you earn money every day.  There's no challenge in that though.  You might want one so that you have some steady income while you're working 5 fields at once and hiring 2-3 workers to keep things moving as you jump from tractor to tractor.  You don't want to be able to just walk away and come back 8 hours later to find you're filthy rich though.There's plenty to do in this game.  You can play the original map (in Germany?) or now with the Titanium edition, you can play the same game with a more American theme.  There's cows for milk, sheep for wool, chickens for eggs, and several crops to plant (some of which require special machinery). You also need to learn where to sell your eggs and wool as well as how to feed your cows so your milk output is at its best,  When you feel like exploring there are some hidden items in the map that  you can collect (it doesn't really affect the game so you can ignore it if you like) and occasionally there are some side-jobs you can take on for extra cash.The only thing that's missing in single-player is an actual economy.  Prices will go down if you flood the market with a certain type of crop, but other than that, demand seems to be purely random.  There are no competing farmers for your crops so you merely wait for the best time to sell (except maybe in the early days when you have the loan to pay off).Fortunately, you can play this game online so it doesn't feel so empty...and it's a lot of fun to cooperate with farm work, though you'd need mods to get ""paid"" for your work in an online game.   If this game had a neighboring farm that you could cooperate with and/or compete with, and if there was an actual economy that was reflected in the prices (instead of price changes to simulate an economy), this game would be perfect.Still, as you can see, I've spent a lot of time playing this, and that was mostly before the titanium edition.  I've only just begun a game on the new map.  If you enjoy the satisfaction of building up a farm (or an empire or whatever) this game will have a lot to keep you interested.  It can also be relaxing to just chill out as you are taking care of the farm business.			",849,226,54,90,159,17,114

												IntroductionFarming Simulator is by far the best farming simulation franchise out there and this edition is no exception. It has much more equipment and a better appearance.  Many may know it for its glitchy physics but in truth this is the most realistic farming simulator on steam and on the gaming market. If you are interested in the world of agriculture or just love machines then this is definitely the game for you.GameplayFarming Simulator 2013 is, as i say again, by far the best farming simulator out there to date. With the expection of very bouncy and unrealistic physics, it is the most realistic agricultural simulator that you can find. The graphics could do with an upgrade to compete with other simulation games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 but none the less the equipment you can buy is still fairly detailed.When you first jump into the game you are given a very large, yet abandoned farm. You are given a few older tractors to start off with and some basic implements to put on the back. Things start off slow but it doesn't take long before you can be running a highly profitable business. In the begining you are expected to work the fields by planting grain crops such as wheat, barley or canola. The smallest leap into new areas of farming is to simply buy yourself a mower and plant grass instead. As you get further into the game you can explore new areas of farming from turning silage into biogas to growing potatoes and harvesting them with some colossal machinery.Farming Simulator 2013 has a large variety of real life tractors, implements and other agricultural equipment which look fairly good. If you feel that this selection is not large enough for you and you need more equipment then there is a large and very active modding community for this game with most mods being very simple to install. You can find some of the best mods here[www.farming-simulator.com] on GIANTS own website.ConclusionFarming Simulator is very addictive. Before long you will be wracking up many hours of gameplay. The quantity of areas to explore can lead you into hundreds of hours of gaming pleasure and when you've explored all of that there's still the modding community to rely on. If you like farming or big machines i can almost guarentee that you'll love this game.			",50,6,5,4,10,0,5

												this isnt a game for everyone.  most of the time its slow and it does get boring until you get more fields, more equipment, animals, and so on.  i was into it for awhile when i first started playing, then the grind just drove me away for a bit.  Picked it back up and just started expanding, now i stay busy, constantly doing something.  i keep the game at 5x speed...allows everything done in a timely manner.  it's a challenge to expand...buying the fields and buying the equipment to go with those fields.   the mods add a great touch too, it breaks up the monotony.  I enjoy collecting the older model tractors & equipment, some just sitting in a barn to display, some i use to work the small fields just for the nostalgic factor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At first glance you will ask yourself, ""How could this be fun at all, it's farm work and that is boring!"" Well let me tell you as a player of action and adventure games I thought the same.But if you give it a chance, and play with friends, it's one of the most relaxing games to play.You get a sense of satisfaction from just playing along with friends or family to create and expand a nice little farm.By no means will this ever get your blood pumping but if you play competitive games and get stressed out this can be the perfect thing to cool off with.Now mind you I only suggest this game be played with friends or family, as solo it can be rather lonely, and with strangers it can be... well it's the internet you can guess what sort of things can happen, but don't be afraid to try and make new friends, just don't expose your best save games to them for awhile ^^.All in all a good relaxing game when shared.

												Farming Simulator 2013 gets a recommendation from me because I personally like the premise of the whole game in general. Which is to say that it follows its predecessors in delivering the ultimate and realistic farming expiereince, and who wouldn't want to be in a world where everything they say goes?

												I bought this game less then a week ago and just love it. The graphics are very good, and there are SO many mods avalible its insane. I liked this game so much that within a day I bought a TS server and a dedicated server for the game. If you like realisim in game play then this is a great game for you. I have played many sim games over the last ten years and this has to rate in the top five. There are several issues but nothing that stops one from having a great expereince playing this game. My one major grip would be with the mods. I find many of the trucks and cars modded for this game are WAY out of scale. Its not often you see a car or a pickup truck larger then a semi truck or tractor yet in FS 2013 mods this is all to common, that said with some looking around one can find a few out there that are close to the right scale. If I where to rate this game out of 10 I would give it an 8.5			",28,3,0,1,13,0,0

												At first glance you will ask yourself, ""How could this be fun at all, it's farm work and that is boring!"" Well let me tell you as a player of action and adventure games I thought the same.But if you give it a chance, and play with friends, it's one of the most relaxing games to play.You get a sense of satisfaction from just playing along with friends or family to create and expand a nice little farm.By no means will this ever get your blood pumping but if you play competitive games and get stressed out this can be the perfect thing to cool off with.Now mind you I only suggest this game be played with friends or family, as solo it can be rather lonely, and with strangers it can be... well it's the internet you can guess what sort of things can happen, but don't be afraid to try and make new friends, just don't expose your best save games to them for awhile ^^.All in all a good relaxing game when shared.

												You won't find a better time to try a new game type than the Steam Summer Sale.  That was my justification for buying this one; it's super cheap, and you should be willing to try anything at least once, with an open mind.How is this game?  Let me give you an elaborate analogy: if gaming is like eating, then your 60-hour RPGs are the heavy turkey dinner.  FPSs are like the coffee afterward.  Indie platformers are the sugary deserts, 2D fighters are the alternate pasta entree, and MOBAs are the pizza the loud guys upstairs are having.THIS game is like the nap you have after eating too much.  The caffeine buzz has time to wear off, you feel a little less heavy because you've digested that turkey, and you're nice and relaxed because all your dinner guests have gone home.  The upstairs neighbors have gone to a sports bar to watch the game.This game is like taking a nap with your eyes open.  The first 2 stages of the tutorial were, collectively, a nice 32-minute nap.

												An absolute awesome game. If you love business & farming; this game is awesome. It has a really awesome co-op section and ability to use mods to make your farming experience even better. Take a small farm and turn it into a massive empire! Myself and a friend made over $25 million dollars farming. One of my favourite games for sure!The only draw back is after some time the gameplay becomes very painful and the maintenance on the farm becomes repetitive and time consuming to the point where boredom sets in. You HAVE TO play this with a friend or 2. You cannot do everything yourself and if you do you will not make as much money, you won't get everything done quickly and you will get seriously bored.Do take a look at the communities for mods. There are some awesome mods to add new features, new equipment, enhanced graphics mods & new farms that can be simply added to your game with ease. I am currently using 44 different mods for my version.			",40,2,3,2,4,0,2

												This game is actually not that bad.  Graphics are fairly decent and the gameplay is alright too.The best fun with this game comes with co-op/ multiplayer type aspect of the game.  You and some friends get this game and go do some relaxing farming together, when in fact it is not relaxing because the game is really complicated to learn how to do stuff.If you are a farmer then fair enough you understand it but trust me when I say this... If you do not know farming you will be confused on this game too.I like this game because I like simulators and sitting back and chilling out.You can download mods for it, vehicle mods so you can have lamorghinis, BMW's etc, and have extra vehicles to drive around it.  The world is pretty big so you can go off exploring while you leave your friends farm, I like driving around and learning to do stuff.This game is worth the money you pay for it, and right now writing this review the game is on sale, and totally worth the money so I suggest buying it!

												Случай из жизни фермера Кольки. Был ясный и светлый день, в общем как всегда. И как то разок я подумал позвать друга, кинул приглашение и тут он подключается. Начал говорить ему где он и как ему работать и тут он повез свою первую полную телегу пшеницы и тут он мне гворит ""(Моё имя) Я тут застрял и мне нужна помощь"" я сел за своё трактор с модом ""Цепь"" и поехал за ним. Я приехал и вижу картину ""Трактор промеж двух комней"". Я начал думать как его вытащить от сюда и попытался зацепиться и мод дал узнать о своём баге цепь окозалсь ограничена в дальности и как-токо я зацепился и подлетел и упал в туже позу. Я взял другой трактор и поехал на тоже место, и таже ситуация остался комбайн! Пошол за комбайном и опять тудаже приехал и тут совершенно другая ситуация ""Комбайн не может пролезть на камни. ОЙ как у меня тогда пригорело. Вердикт: игра с багами но она стоит своих денег! 10 раз презагружал сервер из 10! /open.bug.list!			",208,18,4,7,12,1,7

												An absolute awesome game. If you love business & farming; this game is awesome. It has a really awesome co-op section and ability to use mods to make your farming experience even better. Take a small farm and turn it into a massive empire! Myself and a friend made over $25 million dollars farming. One of my favourite games for sure!The only draw back is after some time the gameplay becomes very painful and the maintenance on the farm becomes repetitive and time consuming to the point where boredom sets in. You HAVE TO play this with a friend or 2. You cannot do everything yourself and if you do you will not make as much money, you won't get everything done quickly and you will get seriously bored.Do take a look at the communities for mods. There are some awesome mods to add new features, new equipment, enhanced graphics mods & new farms that can be simply added to your game with ease. I am currently using 44 different mods for my version.			",40,2,3,2,4,0,2

												This game is actually not that bad.  Graphics are fairly decent and the gameplay is alright too.The best fun with this game comes with co-op/ multiplayer type aspect of the game.  You and some friends get this game and go do some relaxing farming together, when in fact it is not relaxing because the game is really complicated to learn how to do stuff.If you are a farmer then fair enough you understand it but trust me when I say this... If you do not know farming you will be confused on this game too.I like this game because I like simulators and sitting back and chilling out.You can download mods for it, vehicle mods so you can have lamorghinis, BMW's etc, and have extra vehicles to drive around it.  The world is pretty big so you can go off exploring while you leave your friends farm, I like driving around and learning to do stuff.This game is worth the money you pay for it, and right now writing this review the game is on sale, and totally worth the money so I suggest buying it!

												I never thought I would be one to play this kind of sim but I'm glad I did. This is now officially my wind down game. When I'm playing this I can take time building my own farm. No trying to out run zombies or getting to pole position here. The game is sandbox and pretty much leaves you to run the farm how you feel fit. As you earn money you can invest it into new equipment, farm expansion and livestock. There is quite a good tutorial that explains how the various different vehicles in the game work. On top of that there are various mods around as well which further expand the game.The graphics are quite nice with weather changes and day / night cycles. Crop growing can take a while so fortunately there are options in the game such as time increase where you can speed things along. The scenery is quite nice and rural. There is also a nearby village with people and traffic so you feel more like part of a community.The vehicles themselves are quite detailed and its a bit like being a kid again where you get to play with all those farm toys. You can even hire workers for some and just stand by a field while watching them work on it.This won't be for everyone but if you are looking for a more laid back kind of sim that involves farming then this should do the job.

												This game is truly a masterpiece of its genre. At first, it seems like a simple farming game, until out of nowhere there are North Korean soldiers overrunning your peaceful farm. Fighters and bombers soar overhead, aircraft drop legions of paratroopers onto the farmland you so meticulously tilled as you realize that you, a lone farmer, are the last line of defense from foreign invaders. You prepare for war by breaking out that rifle you kept to ward off thiefs, along with thousands of rounds of ammunition, rocket launchers, grenades, anti aircraft guns, and that Davy Crockett you kept for those special occasions. As you fight through your blood soaked little property, you must continue to make those crucial crop deliveries in order to help sustain the crumbling war effort. The delivery missions are brutal, as you must guide your tractor convoy to its destination through complex ambushes, IEDs, and indirect fire. If you want a raw, relentless, and authentic farming/Red Dawn simulator, look no further. This is the game to get. 10/10			",311,29,9,27,40,0,46

												this is a very fun game with mods and the mods are easy to install. you have a bunch of features that are excellent but it will start to get repetetive when you play as long as i have. i highly recomend playing this game and when you are looking for mods, pay attention to the rating of a mod so you get something that won't crash your game.

												This game is the epitome of videogames. Finely crafted to every detail. Nothing will ever achieve the same level of detail and challenge as Farming Simulator 2013. With the American farm DLC, this game still stays at the top of the list of must have games. Every tractor is created to serve a purpose, and each fulfill that purpose at top mark. I truly and honestly recommend this game to anyone who comes across it, as you will sink many hours into this masterpiece.			",312,20,13,26,9,3,14

												The best farming simulator on the market, and I speak from experience. I've tried playing Agricultural Simulator from UIE (UIG?) Software, but getting it to run without encountering graphical corruption or crashing would be a miracle at higher graphics settings. Giant's Farming Simulator may not have the photo-realistic graphic detail of thier competitor, but the game is much more stable, even at the highest graphics settings. A must have for anyone who enjoys farming and the outdoors!			",12,4,1,2,7,0,2

												Summary: A game for those who don't care whether their farm has aliens they need to fight off, or NPCs they can romance. This game doesn't have that. It has farming equipment and a great environment for people looking for a relaxing evening or a great co-operative experience with friends who enjoy simulated farming with heavy equipment. Hours of fun: *Varies - If you like simulators then it may well be infiniteSuggested Retail Value: $20Graphics: 7/10Voice-acting: NA - No voice-actingMusic/SFX: NA - Calm music on menus onlyUniqueness: 5/10First Play-through Experience: 8/10Replay Value: 9/10If you have any love for simulated farming then I doubt you would regret paying up to $20 for the full version. I was introduced to the game through a friend who had put in 100s of hours and just convinced me to give it a try so I could experience what he loved so much about it. I didn't expect it to be this much fun, but it's a blast on co-op play.  After a stressful day, I can sit back and relax and handle issues as they rise. Choosing to pace myself in the game by switching it to real-time and literally doing needed chores then watching the beautiful sunset or... whatever. Then, when I'm feeling ambitious, we both hop into our private server and divy up the tasks at hand, co-operating in beautiful harmony to bring our farm ever closer to being a mega-success. It's hard to describe how it feels to grow a farm from humble beginnings with one small field to a booming business with dozens of fields, 1000s of tons of equipment, and a ranch boasting hundreds of animals, but I highly recommend sharing it with friends. To help with that, the game has an incredible community. Whether you're looking to see the mods that are available, wanting to create your own, looking for a buddy to chat with while you drive the harvesters, or wanting to join a sever with dozens of players trying to achieve a shared farm (even splitting up the tasks, creating jobs, dolling out wages, the whole deal!) the truth is you'll find it all here. I say this about few games (Skyrim readily comes to mind) but FS 2013 feels less like a game and more like a world you visit for as long as you like. Highly recommended if the above sounds interesting to you.			",1177,587,18,240,110,7,199

												This game aint just some bs ""simulator"" that doesnt even simulate the thing that it's supposed to simulate.This game is a masterpiece - it's badassness and awesomeness and all that crap just cant squeeze into this poopy review. You need to play this.Doesnt matter if you have any friends to play with - you wont need them. This game can offer you BETTER AI FRIENDS that can do almost everything you want them to do for a fixed price 1$/an hour. Damn, it even has a tractor that doesnt have wheels, it uses TANK TRACKS INSTEAD. You can plug a long♥♥♥♥♥trailer that matches the size of your member (it grows more and more if you actually play this game (confirmed)) to it's back and ride that bic all day long from your pimp-crop fields to all places where you can make tons of lettuce by just dumping all the crap your AI BETTER FRIENDS had grown in them.This game is worth whatever it costs, and i'd reccomend you to buy this mofo as soon as you can -  The Farming Mother♥♥♥♥ing Simulator 2015 is coming. Remember - the more you play, the more your member grows. Legit.			",58,4,3,5,5,0,4

												I have played this game more than any other in my library. While mundane on the surface this game is in depth, engaging and challenging. I would recommend this game to anyone who has an attention span of more than 5 seconds, however if you cannot make decisions for yourself, patiently cultivate and harvest crops, or find joy in admiring your golden fields of crop then this game may not be for you.

												Arguably one of the best Farming Simulation games in existance.  With the added ability of hosting a dedicated server (through a 3rd party, I used Nitrado) this game brings in the multiplayer aspects that Farming Simulator has been failing at until now.  The modding community is pretty good behind this game, as well mods are very easy to install on both client and server ends.  Animals exist in this version, however their use isn't highly detailed.  You simply provide them with the proper materials at their pens and the game calculates the rest.  That said, I would still highly recommend this game for anyone who's been searching for a good farming simulation game.			",151,43,3,34,48,2,29

Did i mention its as addictive as cocaine?Against: a bit clunky at times, sometimes feels like FarmVille for boys as you stand there literally watching crops grow.Good fun and pretty cheap now, plus... multiplayer!

												Do you like planting seeds and driving 10 km/h? Me neither! But if you like glitches funny phisics and you always wanted to mess with them with your friends, then this is the game for you! Not really for me,			",57,14,3,3,13,2,3

												Brilliant. Need I say more? Kick back, relax, farm, hurry to the shop with your corn when it is on demand, expand, farm some more. You want this, and so do I.The game is up front, supports controller, and you will have loads of fun and trailers full of corn no matter how you play it.Also features advanced car physics and AI.

												I enjoy sims very much and I love driving, flying, riding, you name it.  That being said, this sim sucks.  The lighting is poor and the physics is worse.  I would not reccomend buying this game.  Someone talked me into it and I regret my purchase from the moment I launched the sim.  It is true there are tons of mods, but the mods do not make up for the silly physics.			",28,5,8,5,9,0,2

												WHY DOESN'T MY FARMING SIMULATOR 2013  WORK? I PLAYED IT LAST WEEK AND IT WORKED JUST FINE.I'M NOT A COMPUTER GENIUS AND DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL STEAM TO HELP. MY OTHER GAMES WORK WHEN I CLICK PLAY.WHY DOESN'T FARMING SIMULATOR 2013? IS IT BECAUSE THE NEW GAME RECENTLY CAME OUT? WHY DOESN'T STEAM HAVE A PHONE NUMBER? I JUST BOUGHT THE FARMING SIMULATOR 15 AND IT PLAYS WITH NO PROBLEM. BUT THERE IS THINGS THAT I LIKE ABOUT 2013 A WANT TO STILL PLAY. STEAM NEEDS TO FIX THIS.LET ME PLAY MY GAME.WHAT GOOD IS IT TO HAVE A GAME DISK IF IT DOES NOTHING.WHEN I CLICK PLAY IT SAYS PREPARING TO LAUNCH BUT NEVER DOES.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF PUTTING A DISK IN AND PLAYING.ALL THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY SUCKS. IF YOU ASK ME PLASTIC CARDRIDGES WAS THE BEST. I'M NOT INTERESTED WITH PLAYING ONLINE OR WITH OTHER PEOPLE. I EARNED MY MONEY BY MYSELF WHICH I USED TO BUY THIS GAME WHICH I CAN'T PLAY. I CAN'T ASK STEAM TO HELP ME BECAUSE I'M NOT A HACKER.WHERE IS THE 1-800 NUMBER. THE NEW FARMING SIMULATOR WORKS GREAT AND IT IS WITHOUT USING STEAM. I AM A VALUED CUSTOMER AND ALL I ASK IS THAT MY GAMES WORK.FIX MY ACCOUNT. I PAYED MONEY.I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FIX MY ACCOUNT AS WELL.STOP WITH THE EMAIL CRAP. GIVE ME A PHONE NUMBER SO I CAN TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN WALK ME THROUGH WHAT I NEED TO DO.FARMING SIMULATOR 2013 IS A GREAT GAME UNFORTUNATELY ROBOTS RULE THE WORLD. THANKS STEAM FOR RUINING MY GAME EXPERIENCE. ",9,0,0,9,3,0,5

												The bare bones simulator that (I think) started them all. It doesn't try to be a game and doesn't aplogize for it. It's fun in a why the hell am I playing this but I still can't stop sort of way.Recommending because I had some fun with it, not because you will.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												☑️Realistic☑️Good framerate, no stutter, high FPS  in both i3 dual core and i7 octa core.☑️Variety of vehicles to chose from☑️Modding enabled☑️Trading Cards.☑️Lots of crops❌Driving physics seem too unrefined❌The tutorials are a tiny bit complex. I, as a new user to FS2013, got confused and decided to skip the tutorials. ❌Not enough support(in-game) for a new user. It took me a long time to figure out most of everything.❌Damage dealt to machinery is not realistic when crashing. 7/10. Would recommend to a person who wants to relax, or intends to be a farmer.

												Farming Simulatortwo words together  that you think would lead to a boring and drab game. and for a long time it sat in my wishlist. then one day i thought, why not and bought the game finnaly. Low and behold this turned out to be a rather enjoyable laid back game. Granted it does take a while to get to the large plots of land to farm, and the better  farm equipment, but once you got it and keep moving up in the game.The graphics are decent but not high end.the game is rather stableThe DLC's mite be a tad over pricedAdding Mods is rather easyover all i enjoy this game. just wish i could cut the trees down in some places, and that i could change to a female character.other then that, it is alot of fun.

												Really fun game, with some great details wherer you have to handle the machinery properly.Small missions to help you get a good start and the ""sales"" and ""increased demand"" add to the reality levels.Would be really cool if it was possible to redesign/upgrade the buildings, or even start totally from scratch where you could design the whole thing yourself.After all, driving tracors and farming os only fun for a time.One drawback is that the buildings does not look like their names. For instance, the restaurant looks more like a warehouse and so. These small building details would give it that little extra notch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll admit, I am a not a greaat gamer I love Forza and Falloutnand I would play thme until my fingers fell off. But FS2013 was just not my game I thought. I was Wrong! I played the demo on xbox 360 then bought it. then I watched some youtubes about the mod availible and had to try the PC game now afer 700 hours I would say I love the game and I am looking for the next major upgrades. Pros : relaxing even on hard you can't really fail.Cons: the phyics suck one second you are driving and you flip thousands of feet in the air. ok may 100s but you didn't hit anythingI love trying out new maps and mods and seeing the creaivity from all over the world join in this game instead of shooting one another.Please be careful though you can end up getting a virus by downloading from just anywhere two spot that are good are farming-simulator.com and FS-uk.comthanks for reading and have fun getting dirty			",14,3,1,4,14,0,0

												The farming and economy is very simple - harvest the crop you start with, sell it, plant grass.  Repeat daily: harvest, convert grass to silage, sell silage for bio-fuel.  What's left is a driving game, but you get to drive some great vehicles!  Even half an hour driving up and down a field mowing the grass can be fun with toys like these.The 'missions' (mow the grass - for a change! - or deliver a pallet) are annoying after a while but can be turned off.  Lifestock also add little  but you might as well have some hens (don't require looking after) and sheep (load-up their feeding trough with cut grass, see paragraph 1, and they're good for a week).  Cows are harder to feed because you need straw as well as grass (plus its variants silage, also above, and hay).  Should you venture into the exciting world of bovine husbandry you therefore have to grow wheat and/or barley as well as grass.  Apart from needing re-seeding after each harvest it benefits from fertiliser so now you can drive up and down each field FIVE times per day.Somehow, it's still a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game but the predsecessor was better by far. I bought this game to play with classic tractors but sadly they cant pull sht weight even a plough is a problem. Game also crashes on the regular when i sell stuff like seriously GIANTS engine stopped working error.  If you not modding or a big plough fan.. farming here is so easy i even laughed at myself is like an easy mobile rpg game for killing time. if you got the money just pick fs15 you will get the longest hardon of your life- again if you really love farming hehehe			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm giving this game a contingent ""yes"". If you played FS2013, this is disappointing, if this is you're first time, then you'll like it. It's a good game overall but adds almost nothing in the 2 years since FS2013. Sure logging has been added but this is a game about farming, and very little has been done in the actual farming department. First off, let me say this is definitely FARMING simulator and not USING FARMING VEHICLES simulator. What I mean by that is the concept of farming, what to do and how to do it in terms of growing crops is solid. What's not solid is the actual gameplay of the vehicles. The physics is pretty bad. The vehicles have no weight to them, accelerate and decelerate instantly, and have horrible turning physics (I'm NOT referring to the turning when you are attached to a tool but do not have a counter-weight up front, that is good attention to detail, but turning in general is awful). The cockpits are alright, but nothing lights up, very few instrument gauges work, and nothing is clickable. A few new vehicles have been added, mostly those associated with the new tree logging though.Furthermore, nothing has been improved when it comes to growing crop. You still have the same options and equipment. You'd think the devs with all this time would add something new like beans or even vinevards or fruit trees, but no, same as FS2013. Same can be said for farm animals. Nothing changed. You also get the same side, repetitive side missions. This is a REAL big disappointment, 2 years and the devs can't even think of a new side mission? The world still feels so empty and unlived in. There is no sense of ""people"" living around you. If you go into the one town you might see a one or two people walking but that's about it. There is some traffic but its not convincing at all. There is no AI really and they drive at like 5 mph for some reason. I wish the game gave you a reason to use your lights and turn signals when on the road, but with such unbelieveable traffic there's no option in even pretending to role play. At this point you might be wondering why I'm recommending this game after saying only negative stuff about it. Well, if you haven't played FS2013, then you won't be so disappointed. The game itself is very fun and makes you think about how to manage your crop and sell it at the biggest profit. The little side missions are fun (considering you haven't played FS2013) for the first few hours and are a nice change for pace from normal farming. The graphics are generally nice and reasonably well-detailed. A nice touch added is that your tractor and farming equipment now get dirty with use and can be cleaned off with a pressure washer (although equipment gets dirty way too quickly). Overall it's a solid game, especially if this is your first time. If you ever see this on sale for $20 or less, I'd say definitely pick it up if you're interested. At full MSRP however, you should checkout some gameplay and really think about if this is the kind of game you'd enjoy. If you're someone who plays a lot of sim games, then the answer will probably be yes. If not, maybe wait for a sale to get the most fun/$ out of it			",27,14,7,4,12,0,1

												You may ask why I am reviewing this game when there has been 2 successors since this. To be honest I cannot answer that. I just felt like reviewing it.ANYWAY on with the review... This game is often under £2 on steam sales and is sometimes great to come back to for a laugh or to look at some of the great mods that are sometimes better than FS15/17 mods. FS 2013 is one of my oldest owned games (not on steam, on the Mac App Store) so for me it is nice to look back on for memories. :')			",128,33,17,17,45,5,12

												Great sim overall. There are some glitchy parts to it like with the loading of hay bales onto bale carts as well with the front end loaders but no major issues found here. The game also allows modding which makes getting something thats not in te game very easy. It also has decent performance even on my non-gaming computer. Overall Id give it a 9/10 just because of the minor problems and some of the vehical textures(in the cab) dont look very good or dont function at all(like with the computers in the harvesters, etc) Id definitely recommend this game to someone looking for a relaxing game.

												You may ask why I am reviewing this game when there has been 2 successors since this. To be honest I cannot answer that. I just felt like reviewing it.ANYWAY on with the review... This game is often under £2 on steam sales and is sometimes great to come back to for a laugh or to look at some of the great mods that are sometimes better than FS15/17 mods. FS 2013 is one of my oldest owned games (not on steam, on the Mac App Store) so for me it is nice to look back on for memories. :')			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Farming Simulator 2013 is actually a good game to chill, just sit down after school/work, expand your farm and grow something on your fields. It's not frustrating at all. Has a lot of mods over the internet and has multiplayer mode. Unfortunately you cant just make a server, you need to rent it as it is a dedicated server so it's not really accesible to many people but its still fun to play multiplayer. Sometimes the game is on sale so you can get it for 4 or 5 euros and it's really worth it, especially if you want to chill and if you like tractors :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, just one more crop before I go to bed....People laugh and scoff at the idea of Farming Simulator, but you can't deny the 90%+ positive reviews. That's what ultimately led me to give it a try (and it was $4 on sale). This game is really fun, even if you're mainly chugging through to get the achievements like I did at first. Then you realize this is a really great sim game.It's a steeper learning curve than most, but with guides you can adjust easily. The scope is a little overwhelming at first too, but it certainly takes patience (just like real crops?). Gameplay is addicting and fun. Haven't tried MP, but looks like it's almost essential to keep from going mad (there's a LOT to do and keep tabs on).Graphics aren't bad, and no real bugs from what I've encountered so far. A solid game. Mod community is big, and plenty to download.If you like any kind of city building or other sim games you have to give this one a go. 8/10+Gameplay is fun and solid+Graphics on par for a non AAA title in '13+Modding community+DLCs are fun but not required to enjoy the full game-Clunky interface-Tutorial only covers machine operation-Physics not always consistent			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has alot of depth and variety to the simulation gameplay.  I have played many Farming/Agricultural Simulator games previously and to date this game with over 150 hours of game play is my favorite of the Famring Simulators.  For me a good simulator must have a business simulation aspect to it.  And this game does a great job at that.  I enjoy the rewards of raising crops and animals to earn money in order to further grow my farm, buy land, buy animals and add more equipment.  The other aspect that this game really expands on is the mods.  Almost limitless modding.I would rank this simulation game just above Euro Truck Simulator 2.  Both are great simulation games and are in my top 15 simulation games of all time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												6.5/10.  This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields.  I mean REALLY.  The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals.  The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc.  Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.

												It can be hilarious when you are playing with a friend or group of people. Flipping tractors over, getting them stuck, running over things, etc. The map has its limits that you can not go beyond, which is not too terrible. Playing solo for me got boring really quickly though. I had a lot more fun playing with someone else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, you really need to be into farming to actually enjoy this game. I only bought it after seeing Node do their LAN party tractor mountain, which sounds pretty dumb to me now. But for real, it is literally a farming simulator and nothing else. Would only say it might be fun if  you have some friends to play with, but other than that I wouldn't recommend it.

I am, of course, talking about the Harvest Moon series.This, however, is not Harvest Moon.  It can barely be classified as a game.  There are no goals, no physics and no one else on the farm.  I may just be a simple suburb folk but I'm pretty sure that realistic farms are a multiperson job even with tractors.Oh, yeah.  There are some people.  They drive in cars and don't seem to react at all when you drive your farming equipment over them or tip them over.   If you have some cash to spend, you could probably have a much more enjoyable time by going down to your local Sherwin Williams, buy some paint, toss it at your wall and watch it dry.   Mmmm...lovely paint drying...Certainly much more enjoyable than this locust infestation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played for an hour. I still don't get it. All I did was drive an extremely slow tractor towards a destination that was pointess. I mean wouldnt a farmer at least have a pick up truck and a map? I am done with this game for now, and unless I get an urge to  sing a good john denver song and drive a pathetically slow tractor, I will not go back. Don't wast your time here its junk. If the developers or indies could find a way to combine this game with farm giants economy, then  I would want to play that game.			",51,5,2,10,20,0,13

												This is not a game. It is a toy. It can be made fun if you have friends who like to joust with tractors but otherwise it's literally plow field, seed field, wait for growth, harvest, sell, buy a bigger shinier tractor. There are no set goals but very very limited interactions.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like a rollercoaster ride! When I say rollercoaster ride I really mean those horrible tractor rides at local fairs which go against all health and safety protocols. Anyway back to the game. Farming Simulator 2013 feels very empty and I cant quite put my finger on it... Could it be the lack of interaction between you and the environment along with the lifeless NPCs which share very similar player models. The fact that you just a floating head and most of the work can be done without you adds to the point that this world is lifeless and frankly dull.Now I am writing this in 2016 so many people may be saying, ""this game is three years old, give it a break"". The first statement is true however if we compare it to other games from the same year you begin to see really how bland it is. Grand theft auto 5, The last of us, Bioshock Infinite, Tomb raider  and battlefield 4 are only a selection of games which were released in 2013 and are still enjoyable.The controls are sloppy and the Interface is very basic. Not really much else to say about the actual.Farming Simulator is not. Who really wants to simulate manual labour in a world populated by 2D mountains and the same dead NPC. Not me really. One factor to take into consideration is that it has a multiplayer option which can be quite fun with friends until you realise the only thing to do is plow the same fields over and over again.So no I do not recommend this game, unless you are training to be a farmer. This game could actually teach you a lot about how you should not waste your time on this Earth playing a flimsy simulator based around a motionless town.Goodnight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried to love this game. For some reason the idea of farming / sustainable agriculture really appeals to me, so I thought this game would be fun. Instead I find myself wondering why I am mowing pretend grass when I should be mowing the real thing? There just isn't much of a game here, so it lacks in fun and on the simulator side - well lets just say its lacking there too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a person who has never farmed before or who has little knowledge about the different vehicles it's confusing to understand. Plowing a single field takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes. I understand that it is casual but it just seems like a really long time to achieve anything. You have to drive fairly far to sell crops and, it just isnt that satisfying to me. It's a good game, i wouldn't reccomend spending 27.99 on it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My sons and I have a lawn care business. We mow approximatly 30 yards per week. We use this machine probably 40% of the time. The hp is great! there is plenty of power for the application that we apply it to. The price was a bit much, but it has made up for it with performance. We bag most of the grass we cut, and when the grass is moist ( not wet ) there is some difficulty bagging. The deck cleaning attachment is great for keeping the deck clean from buildup. Deck is easy to remove and re-attach for blade sharpining and service. Service is the best quality! We needed a belt on Sunday and out local dealer opened for us and fixed us up. This was the main reason we bought this machine. Dealer SERVICE!Thx Paradox			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not what I expected at all. Bought this for my missus as I thought it would be like sim farm where you had your workers to do this for you. She didn't have a clue so I bought it myself to do the tutorial and I could teach her. Didn't realise you had to actually do the whole bloody lot yourself, get in the tractor, pick up the tool... drive around the field.Bugger that... too slow.. too dull.... mistake to buy for me. Maybe my fault for not reading so much but the opening movie gives no indictation of how this works at all. It makes it look like a ""settlers farming""... not a full on farming simulation.

												I love this game and I hate it. I love sims and farming and all that stuff that's boring, and this does all that. The only problem with it is the physics. It's like farming on Mars. Carrying a pallet on your forklift and hit a bump, have fun chasing it down and spending the next 5 minutes lining your forks back up just right to load it up and have it sailing off into oblivion the next bump you hit. Get your sheep going, finally get a few pallets of wool together and loaded on the trailer? Make sure not to turn that trailer because, as we all know, any sort of turn sends your load flying off. Accidentally hit Q on your harvester? Better bring your forklift over to try to flip your implement for the next 10 minutes.Accidentally put grass in your hopper instead of grains, have fun tilling that field for the next half hour and never getting it quite right.It's just bad. It could be a great game but it just isn't. Models are great, the towns are OK, gameplay is decent aside from the just terrible physics. Accidentally hitting one key will cost you 20 minutes of frustration. If you buy this game I suggest you save often because it's better to load 10 minutes back than try to recover from the slightest mistake.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The tutorial will tell you things like ""press the fold button"" yetnever tell you what the fold button is.Toobad because this game had alotof potential it was just never realized.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is that time again, yes. What could compell you to buy this title? It's definitely not a pvp game or competition of any kind, but there is something extremely relaxing to play this game in multiplayer, it's sort of a bonding experience if you can convince your friends to buy this. It has pretty much all the ""paid DLC features"" that FS2011 had, a much bigger array of real life brands and implemented some of the community mods.Oh yeah, this game also shine by it's vibrant modding community.It's sort of boring alone, and sort of fun in MP, it's also cheap.

												A good game in short bursts. Quite an expensive expansion though, especially when you have the base game already and the expansion is just a new map and some vehicles (when the modding community already provide so many of these)- Myabe at a 75% off sale.The trees around the fields ruin it for me though. Why cant I chop them down!!Some of the mods out there are essential like ""Course Play""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DEVELOPER!!!! After 2 versions of this game we still can not get technical support on their products. Anything by Giants software you buy at your own risk. If it does not work they will not help you. They do not respond on their own technical support forum. They continue to put out sub par software and expect the community to fix it for them.Steam should be ashamed of themselves promoting software on their site that you can not get technical support for.I guess it is true that it is all about the buck and to hell with the customers.

												Mechanics are clunky at best, controls frequently leave you feeling rather hamfisted, and the gameplay is centered around pure grinding interspaced with some really bad 'challenges'. Purcahsed to test it as something to get my nephews, but will pass on this. Barely keeps young kids who love heavy equipment interested, and the slow unlock progression makes it hard to get them new toys to play with. 'Simulation' is more than a little misleading for a genre catagory to place this game in.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A better suited name for this would be Farming Simulator Arcade: this simply is not ""simulation"" enough. After being surprised by the excellent Euro Truck Simulator 2, I was expecting sort of the same experience, only with cows and grain instead of long nightly drives through Germany. And with multiplayer! But I was let down…To be fair: the game can be fun, especially on a LAN with some friends, country music on the speakers and a bottle of Jack to pass around. And the models of the farming machines are pretty nice and detailed as well. However, many things simply are a let-down or maybe wasted potential. For example, the rear mirrors are not functioning, essentially making it impossible to play the game first person when driving. And don’t get me started about the dreadful physics engine powering it all: you will encounter gravity defying bouncing farming equipment at regular intervals (and pray those will not get stuck in the scenery). Also, there are no real management options: you can hire some dumb helping hands but that is about it. Even an ancient game like Sim Farm had this. And speaking of Sim Farm: why is there no option to actually upgrade the farm itself (beyond the buying of extra fields).Hopefully future versions will fix some of the issues I had with this game, since there is some great potential here. But for now I cannot really recommended it, unless it’s really cheap in some sale and you have some friends to enjoy it with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Original Review 5/31/14Updated Review 11/8/14Overall Rating: 4/10Pros:+ Good graphics+ Easy controls+ Kindof simulates farming in a realistic way+ Lots of places to explore in the mapCons:- Only one map to explore- Collision isn't detected in places it should be (you can walk straight through pedestrians and some other objects)- You can't go physically inside any buildings; things are bought with question-marks and other symbols- Some of the textures up close get blurry- Gets boring quickly unless you're using mods or playing multiplayer- A few repetitive textures (cars, pedestrians, etc.)The game isn't awful, but they could add more to it. Being able to have interaction with things in the game would help, like going inside buildings, pedestrians talking to you, things like that.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not play this game it is so♥♥♥♥♥♥you will literally die if you touch it, By this I mean that when you get to 4 freaking workers, you can get no more rendering the 40 odd fields available useless in multiplayer. Sort it out. I was really enjoying this game until i realised we could not get another worker, we only had 3 fields and it was totally reliant on the workers to drive the Combines while we collected the crops they harvested. Really disappointing when you have spent hours getting to the point i was at. They had better fix this problem for 2015 or heads will role, ♥♥♥♥♥.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been stuggle with getting the multiplayer to work since the game released. I purshase is as brand-new and still after 1 year I can't get the online to work.Basically I lost connection in-game. I have tried everything as portfowarding and all that. So for me 100% waste of money as for multiplayer was the only reason why I would play. I have loads of other games and other simulator games as well but never have I had any online issue, not even on farm sim 2012. So if you are going to play multiplayer, think twice.

												If you enjoy living your real life but wish it was slightly more restricted and boring, this game is probably great for you. If not, I would pass on this. This game was given to me by a friend so I have mostly experienced the multiplayer. If you are not player 1, you can't feed animals or see that they are creating goods, which is confusing. We spent a long time trying to get our tractors unstuck from each other before finding out there's a button for that. Nothing in this game is obvious or intuitive so we were just kind of confused.

												Its too bad the Demo Game, will not install/play, on any other Hard Drives other than C:\. I reserve the right on which hard drive  to Install Programs/Games on, as I am the Admin for my ""PC, NOT STEAM!"" I absolutely refuse to give fulll installation authority to an Outside Party to my PC. Its my choice, I know whats best for my PC!Dear Steam,You will find this way of thinking similar, if not Identical to 99.9% of Most Computer Owners. To get more Sales, and make a Hellova lot more money, and happier Customers too, I would like you to consider changing this antiquated policy of using the C:\ drive for your installations? You should simply use the wildcard *.* for hard drives. Let  your customers choose where they  want to install their product at please?It would really make a lot more sense to do things this way? After all, the old saying still holds true, I hope? The Customer is always right? Even if the Customer is definitely wrong, its their money, let them choose?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pretty much what I expected, but needs work in my opinion. There is no management, no depth, no challenge.The multiplayer is non - existant, though there seems to be a market for it. Some dedicated servers would be cool here. The level difficulty is awful. Easy is tutorial and far too easy to bother with. Normal is easy. Hard says - you start off in debt, workers cost more to hire. Okay, so going into the game I start off with a random 8000 dollars, I don't seem to have any debt or loan at all. Workers cost more to hire yes, but I hired them anyway and still got a profit. Also managed to sell my two useless tractors for 18,000. Then decided to open the shop, and oh....I can only buy the very most basic items, and only one type of some to do the entire map. This level isn't hard, its just pointless as you now cannot progress.Also, the devs seem to have plopped down this empty shell of a sim, and from then til now and forever, are just churning out dlc with new tractor bits from various companies. How about you add to the game more...?Other players put it well for me -''What I dislike is the fact that you start out with a really big farm in terms of buildings and stuff. I would so much like to build everything myself, just starting out with a small field and some equipment. I also miss seasons and crop rotations, as well as fatigue.While the game is somewhat shallow in terms of the overall mechanics,''''6.5/10. This game is great for someone who is REALLY into ploughing fields. I mean REALLY. The trucks and equiptment are nice and there is quite a bit of variety, but it's definitely more of a game about vehicles and farming technicallities than planting crops or raising animals. The low rating is only because it was not really advertised directly as such, and therefore I thought it might have more to do with animal husbandry etc. Great game if you're into the other, technical, physical side of farming.''

												This is basicly NOT a farm simulator and more of a driving simulator for REALLY slow things.  You cant ""plan"" and watch anything you literally have to drive your tractor and plow the field, and then drive over it again to plant, then drive over it again to spray, then drive over it again to harvest.  Meanwhile there is no way to automate anything, you literally have to drive your tractor to the chicken yard then get out and run around picking up eggs.  OK there is one thing you can automate...a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥worker to drive the harvester.  Did you want to sell  eggs?  well IF you can find the place to do it (since the ingame map barely functional) after you ran around like an idiot picking them up THEN you drive your tractor to that place and sell them.  Same silly plan with sheep and cows.  And crops for that matter.  There are ridiclous pop up missions that would be great if the game was called ""heavy equipment simulator"" where you drive your front end loader to pick up pallets.In short as a tractor driving simulation this is basicly ""OK"".  As a farm sim it is almost unplayable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK... where to begin... Let's dive straight in, shall we?PROS:- It's cheap! Given there's a newer version out, this is a bargain. (Of course, why you'd even CONSIDER buying a new version is beyond me, once is truly, SURELY enough...)- It provides a very clear insight into the riveting, high octane world of farming!- lots of vehicles, accessories, things to load, unload, fill, plough etc (if that's your bag...)CONS:- I wanted to die while I played this...- It's a simulator about farming - and yep, you guessed it, it's 'somewhat' realistic. That means it's so frightfully boring and dull you'll have trouble stopping your brain from exploding.- There are in excess of 3000 people who own this game who gave it the thumbs up... Why is that a CON? Well... let's put it this way, the type of people who'd most likely give this a thumbs up probably like watching grass grow, and can't get enough of farming so they turn to a simulator to continue the experience into the evening. I'm shocked. Seriously I am.SUMMARY: It's not that the game is terrible. In fact, you could very reasonably argue that in playing a farming simulator, you need to set your expectations lower than a crack ho' turning tricks with Jack the Ripper. But here's the thing - even knowing it's a farming simulator, it still was so awfully dull, so painfully boring that I can't believe I played as long as I did.I mowed some grass at a golf course, I drove a tractor with a trailor perfectly lined up next to a harvester to catch wheat, then dumped said wheat in a grain silo, I took a load of peanuts to a place so they could attract a runaway elephant back (yep, you heard me right), i sold a tractor, I ploughed a field. Then I realised I was SPENDING MINUTES OF MY LIFE, JUST WASTING AWAY DOING THIS!!!!The tutorial was mildly amusing for 5 minutes, then the game just continues the awful, mind-sapping exercise. Oh man, how this game will sap your very soul!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes, I have only played for 39 minutes so if you are seriously into this game (I'm not sure why you reading reviews to begin with) but this is not for you.  I could only deal with this game for that long.  I think it looks really fun, I love management games but actually plowing a field is not fun, frustrating and the controls are so hard on a computer.  This game is probably for more serious gamers then me but I regret paying for this.  I will probably try it again, because I paid for it but I would not recommend this for someone looking for a casual simulation game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game only to be asked to upgrade to the full version... I bought the full version and am restricted from online play and other content. The developers don't respond to you, and the community for this game is garbage. 0/10. Never buy again!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from the brief moments where one of your vehicles crashes and does something absolutely hilarious, this game is not much fun at all.It's like working at a really horrible job, in a world that doesn't feel alive at all, and coming away from hours of effort only to have nothing to show for it. Not to say that you don't earn money in the game, only that the money, like everything else in the game, feels as fake as it is.If you're looking for a simulator that's more fun than this, and more productive, you're better off washing the dishes in your house and pretending you're playing Dish Washing Simulator 2014, only difference being that DW2014 can actually result in some form of benefit to your life.

												I must say I was rather disappointed with this title. This game is entirely about farming and literally nothing else. I thought this was going to be a more action-packed adventure, shoot em up type of game, but no. Only farming. I guess there was a plot twist I did NOT see coming though. SPOILER ALERT: Sometimes the virtual heavens open up rains. I’ve been through every kind of virtual rain there is. Little bitty stingin' rain... and big ol' fat rain. Rain that flew in sideways. And sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath. Shoot, it even rains at night... And the worst part is you can’t thresh in the rain I guess if that twist is taken into account, It is good enough to get. If ya like farming. And my guess is you do considering you went out of your way to search for a game that relates to farming and you are now reading a review about said game. A review that continues to waste your time but you can’t stop reading it. Perhaps this review will sway your opinion of the game. Perhaps you initially didn’t want to buy this game but now you're seriously considering buying this product. Perhaps you are mouthing your words as you read this. But in all honesty you should buy this so you can pretend farm like the rest of us.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game because I love simulation games, but I was severly disappointed.  After getting out of the tutorial, I tried to start a mission, but somehow my tractor got stuck on a rock and I could not get it off.  This game has pretty bad physics, of course that is not the focus of the game, but getting stuck on stuff and not being able to get it off is a pain.Several times I took an attempt to like this game, but I could not get into it.  I cannot recommend this game to anyone, but to each their own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a really addicting game. I have played other farming games and they weren't that good, but this is the best I've played. There are alot of tractors and trailers etc, but you can easily add more if you want with modding. It is pretty easy to mod this game. Most mods have an installer, but it the mod doesn't then you put it in a folder, easy! The game can get boring if you keep doing the same think like planting, harvesting wheat, and you can't hire workers for everything like mowing grass or fertilizing. The physics are not good but they can make the game funny, like a flying tractor or upsidedown harvester. The graphics are pretty nice and it runs well on my laptop at medium at 30-40 fps. 7/10 Would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Get Ploughing While The Sun Shines !Though I am not usually someone who would play this game I purchased it for when I look after my nephew who is tractor mad and to my surprise this sim title has for me turned out to be gold compared to another farming sim I tried first and which was sadly just rubbish.Farming Simulator 2013 for me in its latest patched Titanium edition is both very simple but at the same time very engrossing with something always in need of your attention in the game so you don't feel like you are waiting it out for a crop to grow especially since this sim does not advance by seasons but can be played in real time speed and with a whole plethera of options covering crop growing speed and many many other things.The other thing that really helps the game is the graphics which portray a very nicely balanced view in any camera mode and lends itself well to the overall feel of the sim whether your ploughing or collecting hens eggs.As for activities and things you can do there is a lot more to the game than simply growing corn in a field as this sim features  the typical farm animals to care for and that form part of the farms income like the cows for instance which can be milked and the milk sold to the local milk supplier.When it comes to crops the choice is large and varied and can for your farm become more than just wheat to sell as you can not only harvest base items like wheat but you can then collect the hay left behind and use that in bales for feeding etc.One of the other things I am impressed by in this sim is the vehicles which are not only nicely modelled but seem to be able to mimick most things in the real world including needing front weights if you are taking an oversized plough out on your tractor.The one thing I would say negatively about this title is the default keys mapping which really should be one of the things you sort out when you get going as the default key setup is not too clever and not very intuitive either but once sorted it helps the game play become smooth and easier.Also of note this title has a huge amount of community of players behind it who have made over 300 mods which cover everything from new maps to a pressure washer for cleaning your vehicles and so there is always something you find to add to your farm.Although this review has not gone too deelpy into the sim and is just a general overview I would still say to anyone who has an interest in this type of gaming to buy this title and find all the great things about it as you develope your farm and feilds.

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. I don't think it will appeal much to those that like nothing better than hack and slash, but if you have a bit of patience to see your crop grow this is the game for you!There are a few minor comments to make, though. I might be a city gal, but I do know that chickens do NOT feed themselves, and that a henhouse needs a door so that the chickens can actually get in to lay their eggs and keep them safe against Mr Fox! I haven't bought any sheep or cows yet, but from the manual I get the impression that not much work, apart from making fodder, is expected there either. Also, I doubt whether even the most dedicated farmer can do without any sleep at all. Secondly, the world of Farming is a bit 'dead', In the town and on the campsite there are a few people shambling about, but that's about it. There's never anyone on the golfcourse, or in any of the other fields. And where are the birds? Where are the crows?On the good side nature, landscape, sky and weather patterns are a joy to see and watch. Machinery and crop are beyond perfect. So, all in all, 9 points out of 10, and highly recommended, nevertheless!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish it had longer range anisotropy, but aside from that extremely minor issue, this game is fantastic. It really lets you feel like you're an actual farmer. The modding community is very active, so new playable maps, vehicles, placeable objects etc. get added very regularly. The only thing that stinks is that vanilla, it takes a while to get to the second combine. That can easily be fixed by adding more combines through the various modding websites available. 8/10, would harvest again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid game that does a fairly just job of representing Agriculture in video game form. There are various things you will notice that might make you laugh or that seem unrealistic (traffic collisions, getting equipment stuck where it shouldn't like on fences) but everything specifically regarding Ag, it does a good job.The modding community is fantastic and does a great job adding things you expect like textures and new machinery, but you also find things like auto steer and new maps that completely change and enhance the game to its core.If you are curious, give it a shot and be patient- I think you will be happy you did!

												I went into this game thinking it was a cheesfest like woodcutting simulator, but quickly found it to be a fun experience.  At first it was slow, with much of my time spent waiting for my one field while I ran errands with a forklift or mowing lawns for money.  Once I unlocked my second and third field, the game rapidly became more of a time management sim to keep the fields planted, fertilized, and harvested.  Granted, the ai controlled workers did some stupid things while attempting to use the larger implements in the tighter spaced fields, they are immensely helpful as you grow to many fields over most of the map.

												Somehow this rather simple farming simulator has captures my attention. It has mediocre graphics and gameplay coupled with comedy physics. This is certainly not an accurate model of what it is to farm but I am in love. When I play this the hours just seem to slip away. Mods can make all the difference in this too as you add more maps and more equipment. In my opinion it is certainly worth a try if you like low production value simulators.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A light-hearted title, Farming Simulator 2013 provides an extremely simplified overview of life as a farmer.  The setting is based in Europe, but some of the names (e.g, International Harvester) are familiar to us Americans.  There are tutorials to help get your feet wet, though they leave a little to be desired since many of my questions about gameplay went unanswered.  Yourstarting equipment is basic at best and you have access to two small fields.  Pick your crop (wheat, barley, or canola) and get sowing!  Several hours later (fortunately, there IS a game-time speed control option) your crops are ready for harvest.  Hop in your combine, pipe it out into a tipper, and unload into your silos until the time is right for selling!  Now, go work your field and get it ready for the next crop sowing.  The process is fairly simple, but there are many logistical and efficiency-based changes to be made.  Your equipment will need to be upgraded, you will buy more and larger fields, and then there's the element of livestock to be considered...  It's a fun game for those who are into simulators.  The controls are not nearly as robust as polished titles such as EA's ""The Sims"", however Farming Simulator is a very enjoyable money grinder. To my knowledge, there is no ""winning"" objective.  You simply continue to grow your farm and see just how large of a farming mogul you can become.  There are no limits- as long as you can project manage your way to more and better equipment and maintain the upkeep for it.  Proper management skills will keep you moving from one task to the next:  sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, cultivating, plowing new fields, delivering loads to buyers, working silage, keeping the livestock tended, moving equipment between fields, and so on.  There is also a multiplayer aspect available at no extra charge.  You may host games for up to 16 players or join others at will.  There appears to be an open field of mods to be downloaded or developed at your leisure, though I have not personally delved into that facet.  In summary, if you catch this title on sale, it's worth considering!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not the most accurate representation, but it's actually playable.Graphicly and aestheticly it's not the best game, some things look better than others, but people break any immersion.Pros:- Informative and semi-realistic farming.- Lots to doCons:- Not aestheticly pleasing- Too much farming for me (personal, it may be alright for you)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Farming Simulator 2013 is a fascinating and amazing game. I like the idea of owning your own farm and continuously spreading out to buy more farmland. I think, personaly, that they should have more tractors and other farm equipment. I also think that it should have more animals and livestock. There are mods for extra items, but not every mod works. I also think that you should not be able to clip through the people walking around the map and you should  be fined for things like hitting them or driving on the sidewalk or doing other things that you shouldn't be able to do in real life. But if you can put those differences aside, i love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. I don't think it will appeal much to those that like nothing better than hack and slash, but if you have a bit of patience to see your crop grow this is the game for you!There are a few minor comments to make, though. I might be a city gal, but I do know that chickens do NOT feed themselves, and that a henhouse needs a door so that the chickens can actually get in to lay their eggs and keep them safe against Mr Fox! I haven't bought any sheep or cows yet, but from the manual I get the impression that not much work, apart from making fodder, is expected there either. Also, I doubt whether even the most dedicated farmer can do without any sleep at all. Secondly, the world of Farming is a bit 'dead', In the town and on the campsite there are a few people shambling about, but that's about it. There's never anyone on the golfcourse, or in any of the other fields. And where are the birds? Where are the crows?On the good side nature, landscape, sky and weather patterns are a joy to see and watch. Machinery and crop are beyond perfect. So, all in all, 9 points out of 10, and highly recommended, nevertheless!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wish it had longer range anisotropy, but aside from that extremely minor issue, this game is fantastic. It really lets you feel like you're an actual farmer. The modding community is very active, so new playable maps, vehicles, placeable objects etc. get added very regularly. The only thing that stinks is that vanilla, it takes a while to get to the second combine. That can easily be fixed by adding more combines through the various modding websites available. 8/10, would harvest again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid game that does a fairly just job of representing Agriculture in video game form. There are various things you will notice that might make you laugh or that seem unrealistic (traffic collisions, getting equipment stuck where it shouldn't like on fences) but everything specifically regarding Ag, it does a good job.The modding community is fantastic and does a great job adding things you expect like textures and new machinery, but you also find things like auto steer and new maps that completely change and enhance the game to its core.If you are curious, give it a shot and be patient- I think you will be happy you did!

												A light-hearted title, Farming Simulator 2013 provides an extremely simplified overview of life as a farmer.  The setting is based in Europe, but some of the names (e.g, International Harvester) are familiar to us Americans.  There are tutorials to help get your feet wet, though they leave a little to be desired since many of my questions about gameplay went unanswered.  Yourstarting equipment is basic at best and you have access to two small fields.  Pick your crop (wheat, barley, or canola) and get sowing!  Several hours later (fortunately, there IS a game-time speed control option) your crops are ready for harvest.  Hop in your combine, pipe it out into a tipper, and unload into your silos until the time is right for selling!  Now, go work your field and get it ready for the next crop sowing.  The process is fairly simple, but there are many logistical and efficiency-based changes to be made.  Your equipment will need to be upgraded, you will buy more and larger fields, and then there's the element of livestock to be considered...  It's a fun game for those who are into simulators.  The controls are not nearly as robust as polished titles such as EA's ""The Sims"", however Farming Simulator is a very enjoyable money grinder. To my knowledge, there is no ""winning"" objective.  You simply continue to grow your farm and see just how large of a farming mogul you can become.  There are no limits- as long as you can project manage your way to more and better equipment and maintain the upkeep for it.  Proper management skills will keep you moving from one task to the next:  sowing, fertilizing, harvesting, cultivating, plowing new fields, delivering loads to buyers, working silage, keeping the livestock tended, moving equipment between fields, and so on.  There is also a multiplayer aspect available at no extra charge.  You may host games for up to 16 players or join others at will.  There appears to be an open field of mods to be downloaded or developed at your leisure, though I have not personally delved into that facet.  In summary, if you catch this title on sale, it's worth considering!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very relaxing game if you are up for it. After getting the game search around there are tons of mods that keep the game playable. You can find yourself killing some time with this game. Of course it does have some glitches here and there some of which comes into play with mods you download. That are more powerful than what the game is use to.But all in all just a nice game to sit down and play when you need time away from the fast pace games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Farming Sim 2013 is good if you want something different.It represents farm well, but with its problems. It's not the most accurate representation, but it's actually playable.Graphicly and aestheticly it's not the best game, some things look better than others, but people break any immersion.Pros:- Informative and semi-realistic farming.- Lots to doCons:- Not aestheticly pleasing- Too much farming for me (personal, it may be alright for you)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												is a very fun and at times addicting game, I got the most joy out of it from running my own farm Server and leting others play on it.  Be warned though theres alot of trolls, so you have to heavily monitor each new player and this can become taxing for those who are not used to doing this.  Once you have a solid base of proper playing regulars though it's a blast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to admit that this game isn't my usual cup of tea.Technically, the game is not good.  The physics are terrible, the missions are extraordinarily repetitive, and there doesn't seem to be any real challenge to it.  What it succeeds at, though, is being a farm simulator.  It's not about physics.  It's not about missions.  It's not about challenge.  It's about farming.  Not life or death, but the mechanics and details of growing and harvesting crops.This is a 'zen' game that I'd play to relax and not think (once I got the hang of the process and equipment).  It's not a tense or pressure-filled game.  It's rolling along in a tractor, fertilizing a field, mowing a lawn, and towing a trailer.For that, I'd recommend it.  If you're looking for something deeper and more challenging, keep moving.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was gonna buy the 2015 edition but decided to try this one first.......This is my first step into the farming sim world (lived and grew up on a farm in northern Scotland though for 20 years)....Immediately flash backs of the good old farming days came to me... There is a lot to do in the game.. you start with the basics (harvester, couple of tractors, a few implements etc) and you then decide what you want to do.....you can start laying down seeds in your small field or do some missions... can even buy cattle, sheep or chickens.... The map for the game is very big and does take time from one end to the other... and missions can be tedious because of this.. There are plenty of fields to buy and oportunities to buy them cheaper (Auction)..... The Sim has a hell of a lot to buy in the shops... including premium items...plus you start with loads of items in the game to purchase with game money anyways...  No shortage of bits.... Takes a while to earn a good bit of money.....as for missions i find them boring... they were put in as an afterthought for a way of increasing funds fast... but all you can do is either take pallet from A to B .....or....... cut grass at X with Tractor mower.... seriously... could they not have added in ploughing.....seeding certain fields... race your tractors from A - B in time limit etc... anyway thats one of the few downsides to the game.... I still think its well worth a purchase whether you are new to the genre or familiar with the farming grind... plenty to enjoy... PROS - Big Open map with plenty of places to goLOADS of equipment to purchaseGreat weather effectsPlenty of crops to harvestCONS -Tedious missionsVehicles look great but surroundings have poor textures for 2012the Hired worker (AI) could have been much betterOverall great game 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've always been a fan of Farming Simulator specifically from Giants since FS2011.  At first i found just driving the highly detailed  and highly animated machines was fun when you're bored.  Eventually I started finding the challange of becoming a millionare fun.   Purchased 2013 for myself and a friend.  Since then we haven't really taken much time off.  Short of my son really loving the tractors it really is an engaging simulation.  As long as you don't modify your career files to give yourself money and actually earn it, the challange to get the ""awesome"" machines is what makes it so fun.Then there is the modding.  This has to be one of the most modded games i've seen for a simulator.  There are a tonne of awesome mods, some bad but overall an excellent modding community.Multiplayer:Oh and before i forget, i used to play this single player all the time on FS2011.  Since i bought 2013 for me and a friend, I refuse to play single player anymore.  Just not as fun or enoyable.  I absolutely love the multiplayer aspect of this game.The bad...It's poorly optimized.  Even if you have the best machine, you''ll feel a framerate drop at times.  Add mods to the mix and framerate on a medium budget machine becomes impossible at decent graphic settings.  I'd like to see the game engine heavily optimized.  The overall game is the best simulator of it's kind.  Don't fall for the others claiming to be farming simulators.  Giants is known for developing half decent sims.  I just hope they put more in to the game engine. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a regular ""money spawns by itself"" tycoon. You have to work for that money. Many diffrent tools for you to farm your wheat or whatever. You can even go full on animal and have a sheep,cow, and chicken farm!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Farming Simulator 2013 Titanium Edition is a fun and challenging game and if played properly takes a fair while to earn enough in game monies to upgrade to better and more efficient equipment, but that's what farming is about, there are tweaks that the game could do with by the makers but there is a huge modding community so any game additions or fixes needed can easily be downloaded to improve what is already a good title, if your after a game that is slow paced, relaxing and enjoyable then Farming Simulator 2013 Titanium Edition is for you.

												Wow i logged 197 hour on this game so far but like 150 of thoose hours were in the 1-3 months after i bought it. If you have a vauge understanding of farming plant seed fertilize and spray then harvest you will pick it up pretty quick. There is a little bit to be had with the few side missions and livestock management, play it on hard for the most fun. I would log more hours into it but it needs more to hold me in since i know all the effort that goes into farming. If the scale gets wayyyyy bigger I'm talking like just cause 2 size or bigger and some more north american brands of machiney and crop dusting to become a thing then the game would be awsome. Really good on multiplayer with a few friends.7.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The learning curve is a little high, if you know nothing about farminglike me.....but a very engrossing game!!!  Not to even mention the mods foreverything in the game, from new maps, different named equipment (ie JD),texture effects, equipment....almost anything you can think of, brings it to an even higher degree of gaming.  I bought it to help pass a little time between other games, but became completely engrossed with this!!!   9/10 score easily, if not a 10/10 score.  Highly recommended!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are a fan of sim games you will most likely enjoy this one. It can be rather tedious in the begining setting things up. But one of the best ways to progress is to do plenty of missions. It will build your $$$ fast and you can set the mission frequency or turn it off when you've had enough. I got to where I would turn down missions and just acept the ones that were best suited for my game play. I also recommend the ""Real Time"" Setting until you're ready to wait for the harvest and then set it on 120X until your crops are ready the save (which you want to remember to do often) and reset back to ""real time"".  I got so tired of using the front loader I eventually sold all of my sheep and invested the money in larger equipment to sow & harvest much faster. The real time setting makes it easier to borrow money, to make money, and then pay it back before the day is over avoid the interest. Use of the time element helps tremendously. The bad ... no fast tavel. If this game had fast travel ... Wow! It would rate another whole point. It can be so tedious at times to travel in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually enjoyed playing this game the only thing I didnt really like was the fact you were stuck with only playing one map with the initial base game. (it strongly relies on player made content which you can download elsewhere). As it can be a time consuming game with crops taking a rather long time to grow, graphically it was realistic. And you had a great choice of machines to use once you unlocked them. Playing in online mode was good, cause you could join other farmers games or they could join you to help you on your farm. This game is very repetitive so if your not into just buying this game and then completing the ingame achievements and just farming in general, I wouldnt recommend this game. A good game to play if you just want to kill time.The biggest let down of this game you do not get to herd cattle, sheer sheep or even milk the cows, so from an animal farming point of view this game is unrealistic. When you buy an animal it merely appears in a field and when its ready to havest eg. wool from sheep, appears as a small wool bale next to the field.Would I recommend this game, I say yes from the point of view that its the most realistic farming game at the moment on the market. However if another farming game came with an animal farming feature which was more accurate, plus all this farming game features, I would say buy that game instead. Don't buy this game if you dont like repetitive farming games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most unusual aspect of Farming Simulator 2013 is the complete lack of competition. In a single-player career, there is only you, the farm, and the AI townspeople who wander around but can’t be interacted with. Even in multiplayer, all players work together on a single farm. In both modes, the game will not fail you for slow production or even no production at all. As a result the gameplay is incredibly peaceful, though possibly a bit daunting for newcomers to the series. Admittedly, the act of virtual farming doesn’t sound like it would require a complex series of steps to perform, given that most of your job involves jumping in a tractor, attaching a tool, and slowly driving in straight lines. However, there are subtleties that are under-mentioned or completely undocumented that require some practice to master. AI-controlled workers can be hired for most tasks, and watching how they perform can teach you techniques to use when you get behind the wheel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why I like this game, but I do.There are plenty of problems with it. The physics is off, there's plenty of rendering issues that make the engine feel very dated, there's not enough variety in crops, etc. I could nitpick for quite a long time about how I wish it were prettier and bigger. Because I do wish for those things. In particular don't expect a 'simulator' in the same sense that X-Plane is a flight sim; this has very arcade sensibilities. Nothing wrong with that but, given how little there is to really do, you'll start to crave more problems to deal with.So, sloppy graphics, dull game play, lack of content - why did I click to recommend this?First, don't get it if it's not on sale, there's a limit here. However, there's something sort of relaxing about such casual, basic work. Manging logistics really since you'll often not do much of the actual farming yourself but rather 'hire' workers. What will you be doing? If you're like me, probably this:- Mowing; there are side missions to mow grass. It's fast and easy and gets you some solid cash.- Package delivery, you use a forklift to take stuff around and have to worry about it sliding off the lift at a sharp turn or a big bump (you also need a good lift if you want to make the bigger runs in time).- Hiring workers; you don't have to, you could do it all yourself, but any given field needs to be prepared, seeded, probably fertilized in some fashion, and harvested to start over again. Depending on what you plant and if you get tricky, you can do all this in 2 passes of a field. If you're not tricky it'll take 4.- Driving a wagon; you can't hire someone for this which is why you'll be doing it all the time, driving a wagon up for the harvester to empty into and then taking it to storage until the prices are good for selling. If you tried to do everything yourself it would take all day to manage just a few fields. So, goals... really just make money and get better equipment. Which is part of the problem, once I got the best harvester, the best tractor, could work with any fruit I wanted... that was it. Sooner or later I'd own the map and then what?The game is 'idle fun' until that point, something to do while you're doing other things really, but it wont keep you going for hundreds of hours. It's certainly not for everyone either, so if you don't think you're going to like it, you probably wont, but if the idea amuses you, try it.And if any devs are listening, take it further. More machines. More crop types and side missions. More things to go wrong: bad weather, insects, soil acidity, nitrogen loss - hell, teach me soil science as I play. Mechanic mini-game to fix busted engines? Hell, why not! Make working with animals more invloved too and don't forget long term goals. Make it a bit harder to stay out of debt, force you to compete with other farms, hire you to help with famine somewhere else. These are all just off the top of my head. I know, it's not a game that appeals to everyone, it's not going to pull in game-of-the-year money, just my little wish-list of what could be.For all its faluts it's still a recommendation, a light one but a recommendation.

												Most feature rich and just all around best Farming Simulator available; hands down! This game/sim is head and shoulders above any other farming simulator out there. Do yourself a favor if your debating on possibly purchasing professional farmer or agricultural simulator, try the demos and save yourself some money, they are simply broken garbage compared to Farming Simulator 2013 and you will totally regret purchasing either of them; DONT DO IT!  While the environment may feel slightly dated the models and physics are great with no functionality issues. There is a vibrant and thriving mod community with mod support built directly into the game. After a simple config file tweak to activate developer mode, turn off the frame rate cap and increase the draw distance ""bubble"" I found this sim to be thoroughly enjoyable much like a giant sandbox. The grind can be tedious for new equipment but a simple save game config file adjustment can result in any account balance you may desire; even when doing that and eliminating the ""grind"" I still find the game enjoyable and a draw that keeps me coming back for more.

												This game is a 10/10.  Let's break down the score:Graphics- Top notch, some of the best I've seen.  Even better than real life.  I can see the texture on the cow manure.  The clouds are vanilla, the grass is grasshopper colored.Gameplay- Not much to say here.  I can have the full excitement of being a real farmer!  Various tractors are available to use.  Gives me a once in a lifetime experience.Sound- I believe the game uses sound qualities that are not yet released to the public, providing the most lovely sounds I've ever heard.Content- This game features multiplayer.  That's right, you can mow the lawn and take care of the crops with your friends!  Be careful though, some people are jerks and try to ruin your hard work.  Running them over with a tractor shows them I'm not someone you want to mess with.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great farming experience.  Getting lost in my fantasy farm world was the best thing that happened to me since getting held back in kindergarden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game for the average joe that has an insatiable lust for Gaia. In this game you drive a honking tractor, plow the earth, multiply some chickens/ cows and have a honkin ol' time. All this lavish black waterness comes with some issues though. The world is static as hell and you cant have a head on collision with a car, with a satisfying result. In addition, there is a weird set of physics built into this engine. The trailers never come Un-Hitched, unless you do it yourself and their contents never spill. I have also found that the most entertaining part of the game was the drive to the market to sell your crop. I could be found reving up my 20 horse power tractor and off roading all the way there and when I was done, drive up a 90 degree angle to get home effortlessly. It was a interesting buy.

												KInda sucky the game gives you over 100 vehicles to use, but only lets you plant six types of crops. Also, the vehicles NEVER get dirty and remain as shiny and sparkly as if you bought it brand new, even after all the ploughing and the sowing you do. You never have to maintain them either.That said, the game is relaxing and engrossing, and you'll find yourself planting more and more so you can earn enough profit to buy that awesome cultivator with a much bigger width than the crappy one you start with. You can also run around looking for horseshoes although it's bloody hard and I've only managed to find five of them.Another relaxing yet engrossing game is Euro Truck Simulator 2. I recommend that also.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First, do you like ETS 1/2?  If yes, you will probably like this game for many of the same reasons.  The theme is completely different, but you are still mostly driving around meeting deadlines and getting bonuses for completing ""missions"" faster.Do you want to be part of the solution to feed America?  Don't you think it's time you busted out the flannel shirt and overalls?  Your tractor is waiting for you to start sowing the field.  Your front loader is ready to start selling hay.  Your harvesters are ready to collect their crops.  Your lawnmower is ready to ... ok, ok....you get the point.It's a good game, and it has a lot of nice mods.  Considering it's about half the price of a full-priced game, it's well worth it.  If you happen to catch it on a sale, even better!Get some of your buddies and enjoy the coop as well.  It makes the game 100x better IMO, and one of the main reasons I like it more than ETS2.Enjoy, and see you in the fields!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a 10/10.  Let's break down the score:Graphics- Top notch, some of the best I've seen.  Even better than real life.  I can see the texture on the cow manure.  The clouds are vanilla, the grass is grasshopper colored.Gameplay- Not much to say here.  I can have the full excitement of being a real farmer!  Various tractors are available to use.  Gives me a once in a lifetime experience.Sound- I believe the game uses sound qualities that are not yet released to the public, providing the most lovely sounds I've ever heard.Content- This game features multiplayer.  That's right, you can mow the lawn and take care of the crops with your friends!  Be careful though, some people are jerks and try to ruin your hard work.  Running them over with a tractor shows them I'm not someone you want to mess with.I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great farming experience.  Getting lost in my fantasy farm world was the best thing that happened to me since getting held back in kindergarden.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know why I like this game, but I do.There are plenty of problems with it. The physics is off, there's plenty of rendering issues that make the engine feel very dated, there's not enough variety in crops, etc. I could nitpick for quite a long time about how I wish it were prettier and bigger. Because I do wish for those things. In particular don't expect a 'simulator' in the same sense that X-Plane is a flight sim; this has very arcade sensibilities. Nothing wrong with that but, given how little there is to really do, you'll start to crave more problems to deal with.So, sloppy graphics, dull game play, lack of content - why did I click to recommend this?First, don't get it if it's not on sale, there's a limit here. However, there's something sort of relaxing about such casual, basic work. Manging logistics really since you'll often not do much of the actual farming yourself but rather 'hire' workers. What will you be doing? If you're like me, probably this:- Mowing; there are side missions to mow grass. It's fast and easy and gets you some solid cash.- Package delivery, you use a forklift to take stuff around and have to worry about it sliding off the lift at a sharp turn or a big bump (you also need a good lift if you want to make the bigger runs in time).- Hiring workers; you don't have to, you could do it all yourself, but any given field needs to be prepared, seeded, probably fertilized in some fashion, and harvested to start over again. Depending on what you plant and if you get tricky, you can do all this in 2 passes of a field. If you're not tricky it'll take 4.- Driving a wagon; you can't hire someone for this which is why you'll be doing it all the time, driving a wagon up for the harvester to empty into and then taking it to storage until the prices are good for selling. If you tried to do everything yourself it would take all day to manage just a few fields. So, goals... really just make money and get better equipment. Which is part of the problem, once I got the best harvester, the best tractor, could work with any fruit I wanted... that was it. Sooner or later I'd own the map and then what?The game is 'idle fun' until that point, something to do while you're doing other things really, but it wont keep you going for hundreds of hours. It's certainly not for everyone either, so if you don't think you're going to like it, you probably wont, but if the idea amuses you, try it.And if any devs are listening, take it further. More machines. More crop types and side missions. More things to go wrong: bad weather, insects, soil acidity, nitrogen loss - hell, teach me soil science as I play. Mechanic mini-game to fix busted engines? Hell, why not! Make working with animals more invloved too and don't forget long term goals. Make it a bit harder to stay out of debt, force you to compete with other farms, hire you to help with famine somewhere else. These are all just off the top of my head. I know, it's not a game that appeals to everyone, it's not going to pull in game-of-the-year money, just my little wish-list of what could be.For all its faluts it's still a recommendation, a light one but a recommendation.

												Every time I tried to figure out how to do livestock farming and just hire out all the tedious crop farming, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I tried looking up YouTube videos on this game. They all pretty much did the same thing; ""It's just like the last version of this game, except for these new bits!"" Maybe you've had to be in the series for some time, not sure. Even after the lengthy tutorials I was lost as to how to progress the farm in the ways I wanted. I guess I'm looking for just a simple ranching game, so take my review with a grain of salt based on that.			",15,1,1,3,21,2,8

												For me, this game is a case of ""It's so bad, it's good"". The core concept of the game is rather simple, to build up a farmland and maintain it. But, the rather broken physics make this game rather fun to see how far you can push the physics. Then you get a few friends and install many mods, and you end up having a lot of fun, which is the only reason I'm going to recommend this. :P If this sounds to your style, then this game will appeal to you. If you are looking for a real farming simulator game, and don't want to break the bank, try FS2015.			",58,10,21,11,13,1,5

												GOOD: -overall ok and easy going game-lots of mods and maps.-fun multiplayer.-somehow but not quite, realistic-dlc's seem ok-pretty realistic-nice amount of equipment-fun to use with wheel & pedals-wheel, joystick/controller support-ok grapichs-good pick if on saleBAD: -most mods are for 2011 version and the simple convert (file edit with notepad) doesn't work for all the mods. -options are just like theyre driven over by tractor. (can't switch options in game, so you need to go main menu, doesn't help when u need to change stuff immidiately)-very much bugs and glitches-grapichs are not so good as you might expect (mainly the shadows/and lightining issues)-no actual rear view mirrors-in world placeables, placing is another big minus (you can only place em to stupid points and camera angle is pain.)-AI is actually very stupid and annoying at times.-can't switch between the gps and other modes at pda/phone unless scrolling em all trough.-hit/touch points are placed oddly at some places. -Finding good servers is pretty difficult.-not worth of 24,99€ (wait it come on sale)Sentence: Good game for those who want to farm, drive around maps or just ""derp"" around or use lots of mods in their games and make it fun that way, but i is repeating game, of course it's based around farming (and it has forest mod) so what can you expect, also that can be fun with friends but after awhile that gets boring aswell.

												is a very fun and at times addicting game, I got the most joy out of it from running my own farm Server and leting others play on it.  Be warned though theres alot of trolls, so you have to heavily monitor each new player and this can become taxing for those who are not used to doing this.  Once you have a solid base of proper playing regulars though it's a blast.			",106,9,10,25,39,0,42

												The Titanium Edition is basicly adding more Case tractors, combines, and equiptment to the Farming Simulator 2013 game it puts  more fun and excitment into the game (i mean who doesn't want new case tractor to use or a new map instead of the original map) it brings a new level in farming bring up the hp and adding reliability and more red to the game it may be a little to expencive to get but other than that it is all around a good add.

												I wish it had longer range anisotropy, but aside from that extremely minor issue, this game is fantastic. It really lets you feel like you're an actual farmer. The modding community is very active, so new playable maps, vehicles, placeable objects etc. get added very regularly. The only thing that stinks is that vanilla, it takes a while to get to the second combine. That can easily be fixed by adding more combines through the various modding websites available. 8/10, would harvest again			",75,6,2,20,36,0,18

												Again a simulator which was way better than I expected even though the game has some weird physics and not the best graphics. The gameplay is fun for some hours and if  it's getting boring you can still install many cool mods because the game relies so much on the community which is very important in my opinion so modders can spread their creativity all over the web. Also there is a multiplayer  which is even more fun and the best thing about the multiplayer is, that it is compatible with almost all mods as long all players got them installed. Since it is so mod friendly it is also easy to understand how they are written. You can easily change some numbers here and a sprite there if you want to.			",91,16,17,15,30,3,20

												This game is awesome, I was a bit sceptical at first as alot of ""simulator"" games for pc can be pretty shoddy but this game proved to be a great buy. Its really addictive especially if you go the route of buying beehives/solar panels and wind turbines to get the money rolling in so you can actually buy stuff. Learning the keyboard keys for it is abit of a learning curve but all part of the fun. I've also played the multiplayer co-op with my mate who also bought the game and thats where it came into its own. I highly recommend it. :)			",168,77,22,29,36,2,22

												Farming Simulator isn't just a simulator for farming. It's THE simulator for farming. I've spent nearly 30 hours, on a farming game. It's that addicting. My mind is simply numb from the hours spent behind the wheel of the many tractors i've bought, the golf course lawns i've mowed, and the pallet crates i've dropped off.This game isn't for anyone by any means. In fact, if you like fast-paced action, storylines, or engaging puzzles this game would definately not be for you. The game is better played with friends who would likely enjoy slow, time-consuming projects, and it just so happens there are few of us out there who are willing to enjoy that.Not recommended for everyone, but simulator fans are going to enjoy it.

It was a bit difficult to begin with, learning what goes where etc but the internet and a google search machine you learn a lot.I found out it has some minor bugs, such as the other vehicles was stuck on my equipment like a fly on flypaper... but hey its minor...The details are quite impressive and i have noticed you can get quite a lot mods. I could imagine that multiplayer coop would be quite fun and a good challange.So yes, i would recommend this game :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun ad quite easy farming simulation, it's great for ages 7-10 but for older ages not as much. This game lacks proper physics and damages to your equipments, and is quite hard to drive at a set speed for work on the field. It's easy to pick up though. It's great with mods that improve the games physics and adds much more features. If you are a teen or adult you have the abiulity to mod this, and it is possible to purchase the modding tutorials makign it easier for teens with little experience modding and making game objects to do so. The tutorials are good and could have been more in-depth but I presume there are several tutorials that are better or worse on the internet. I believe this game is a good gift to childern and is quite affordable when on sale. I rate this game 5/10. 6/10 if modded.			",198,30,6,25,24,3,21

While the adults can have the serious fun and play with some tractors doing things they never could like farming fields which is a rather relaxing past time. 10/10 Educational and fun.

												Very boring if you just look at the cover.  When you open the book, it's veryaddictive.  The learning curve is a little high, if you know nothing about farminglike me.....but a very engrossing game!!!  Not to even mention the mods foreverything in the game, from new maps, different named equipment (ie JD),texture effects, equipment....almost anything you can think of, brings it to an even higher degree of gaming.  I bought it to help pass a little time between other games, but became completely engrossed with this!!!   9/10 score easily, if not a 10/10 score.  Highly recommended!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually enjoyed playing this game the only thing I didnt really like was the fact you were stuck with only playing one map with the initial base game. (it strongly relies on player made content which you can download elsewhere). As it can be a time consuming game with crops taking a rather long time to grow, graphically it was realistic. And you had a great choice of machines to use once you unlocked them. Playing in online mode was good, cause you could join other farmers games or they could join you to help you on your farm. This game is very repetitive so if your not into just buying this game and then completing the ingame achievements and just farming in general, I wouldnt recommend this game. A good game to play if you just want to kill time.The biggest let down of this game you do not get to herd cattle, sheer sheep or even milk the cows, so from an animal farming point of view this game is unrealistic. When you buy an animal it merely appears in a field and when its ready to havest eg. wool from sheep, appears as a small wool bale next to the field.Would I recommend this game, I say yes from the point of view that its the most realistic farming game at the moment on the market. However if another farming game came with an animal farming feature which was more accurate, plus all this farming game features, I would say buy that game instead. Don't buy this game if you dont like repetitive farming games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This games is good as a game but its is %100 true there are no short cuts just some systems wouldnt work and would be to confusing so they havnt been programmed exactly as they would be in rl. This game cant be put into wordw the feel of driving a tractor around knowing you making progress. Some might say its point less. But isnt that true with every game you play games for the feeling and no other game can give me that felling. So overall its just a unique as broken age. Making it not a game but a ary of emotions.

												This one is for Hardcore simulator fans, if you like to dabble in a bit of everything you might also enjoy it, but for Hardcore sim fans this is awesome. It requires you to actually concentrate on what you are doing, no quick fixes here. If you are looking for a Farming Simulator THIS is the only one worth getting, trust me I tried a more recent competitor called Agricultural Simulator or something like that, and the game ran like a dog even with all the settings turned all the way down, it also crashed on a regular basis. Farming Simulator 2013 is however very stable, looks great and runs very well, the only time you will find small lag/fps issues is in multi-player and this is due to mp being peer-peer rather than on a dedicated server. As you can see I have had MANY hours of fun with this game, and about half of that was playing multiplayer with friends.If you're into sims, grab it now.			",306,96,17,80,98,2,62

												A game that sounds so boring on paper but turned out to be a lot of fun.  I like the variety of vehicles you get though sometimes its not clear what sort of upgrade you are getting by spending more but they are all real companies.  Driving through farm lands I actually can tell what the tractors are actually doing so that is exciting.  Playing with friends can actually be quite addictive.			",172,41,5,23,46,1,31

												If you like farmin' and driving tractors this game is for you! It has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay and keeps you busy in Singleplayer and Multiplayer alike. Though if you do not like slow driving and repetitive work this may not be a good fit as you ofter find yourself doing the same work over and over again.			",76,10,2,3,18,1,4

												Don't let the metascore scare you away. This game isn't for everybody, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. If you like relaxing, slow paced, and somewhat realistic simulators, give this one a look. There are over a hundred different vehichles, and tons of different features. It's also fully moddable, with a thriving modding community. It's bug free, and runs on relatively low end machines. Works on my four year old rig. 8.7/10. -Lewis			",117,14,0,7,9,0,9

												If you like simulation games this is the game for you.If you like farming simluations this REALLY is the game for you.If you are a farmer and want to see how realistic this is, dont bother its not :-)My friends are laughing at me for likeing this game but...there is something about it.You sow, harvest, cultivate sow again, sell what you harvested, learn how to take care of the animals and make money from them all the while attempting to buy all fields and work them.....no small feat. Add on top of that the vast number of mods created by the community and it keeps you coming back everyday.check it out:examples:Modhub[www.modhub.us]http://www.ls2013.com/It certainly is not a deep game by any stretch of the imagination but for people that like sim games this is really really good :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say? It's a farming simulator. It has great graphics, good vehicle choice, and several methods to aquire crops, funds, and other things.It also has great modding support, adding even more vehicles and mechanics into the game. Having multiplayer is also a nice touch.With the vanilla game, however, it has its limitations. Aside from 'make money', there are no goals and no directions. There are missions, but those could be considered 'side jobs', eg mow the lawn or forklift this box over there. This offers a great amount of freedom into the game, but it can also be overwhelming for new players.Overall, this is a great farming simulator, but it falls short for anyone expecting it to be more than just a farming simulator.

												This game is awesome! I like the sharp graphics. It makes the game seem so lifelike! It's a little complicated, and they don't tell you all you need to know in the tutorials. (Ex. I needed to fill my sower with this ""implement"", but it didn't tell me how.)But from what I've seen about farm ilfe, this hits the nail on the head. It's detailed landscape hooks you to the game. Back to what I said earlier, I guess the reason for them not telling you all you need to know is because, they dont want to reveal everything. Which is fine, but if they want to know, tell them how. So, to sum it up, this game has:1, Awesome (Realistic) Graphics2, Detailed Game Mechanics3, Realistic GameUnfortunatly, it does have it's bad sides. One is while your playing multiplayer, once in a while it will ""sync data with the other players"", which is pretty bad, and that means it'll keep having you wait while you are working with others to establish that perfect wheat farm. All in all, it has a good plot, and I am a guy who is all for simulation games.My Overall Score: 9.5/10 - Really Awesome			",368,157,2,84,47,5,56

												Most feature rich and just all around best Farming Simulator available; hands down! This game/sim is head and shoulders above any other farming simulator out there. Do yourself a favor if your debating on possibly purchasing professional farmer or agricultural simulator, try the demos and save yourself some money, they are simply broken garbage compared to Farming Simulator 2013 and you will totally regret purchasing either of them; DONT DO IT!  While the environment may feel slightly dated the models and physics are great with no functionality issues. There is a vibrant and thriving mod community with mod support built directly into the game. After a simple config file tweak to activate developer mode, turn off the frame rate cap and increase the draw distance ""bubble"" I found this sim to be thoroughly enjoyable much like a giant sandbox. The grind can be tedious for new equipment but a simple save game config file adjustment can result in any account balance you may desire; even when doing that and eliminating the ""grind"" I still find the game enjoyable and a draw that keeps me coming back for more.

												I've always been a fan of Farming Simulator specifically from Giants since FS2011.  At first i found just driving the highly detailed  and highly animated machines was fun when you're bored.  Eventually I started finding the challange of becoming a millionare fun.   Purchased 2013 for myself and a friend.  Since then we haven't really taken much time off.  Short of my son really loving the tractors it really is an engaging simulation.  As long as you don't modify your career files to give yourself money and actually earn it, the challange to get the ""awesome"" machines is what makes it so fun.Then there is the modding.  This has to be one of the most modded games i've seen for a simulator.  There are a tonne of awesome mods, some bad but overall an excellent modding community.Multiplayer:Oh and before i forget, i used to play this single player all the time on FS2011.  Since i bought 2013 for me and a friend, I refuse to play single player anymore.  Just not as fun or enoyable.  I absolutely love the multiplayer aspect of this game.The bad...It's poorly optimized.  Even if you have the best machine, you''ll feel a framerate drop at times.  Add mods to the mix and framerate on a medium budget machine becomes impossible at decent graphic settings.  I'd like to see the game engine heavily optimized.  The overall game is the best simulator of it's kind.  Don't fall for the others claiming to be farming simulators.  Giants is known for developing half decent sims.  I just hope they put more in to the game engine. ",347,73,26,30,69,5,35

Then this game is for you.This game is very slow paced gut you can makemit faster with time changes and crop growth. I really love this game and you will too!			",36,8,1,7,25,0,1

												Fun but has a questionable price it does have a lot of replayability and bad graphics but good sound makes up for that but even the sound is limited.However I will reccomend it because it is fun and with all the bugs and stuff plus the TERRIBLE physics also is fun so yes I reccomend it when it's on sale.

												If you know little of me you would not expect me to be playing this game, at that pre-ordering the FS15, but I am actually interested in this game and the next that comes out soon. It's not only the farming portion, but just being able to do whatever you want.

												Among all other ""farm simulator games"" with all are utter terrible, this one is actually pretty good. It looks nice, plays nice and works nice (good fps all the time, no ctd). If you must buy one of those, you should get Farming Simulator 2013. Stay away from any other farming titles!!!!			",173,19,6,21,41,1,7

												Get Ploughing While The Sun Shines !Though I am not usually someone who would play this game I purchased it for when I look after my nephew who is tractor mad and to my surprise this sim title has for me turned out to be gold compared to another farming sim I tried first and which was sadly just rubbish.Farming Simulator 2013 for me in its latest patched Titanium edition is both very simple but at the same time very engrossing with something always in need of your attention in the game so you don't feel like you are waiting it out for a crop to grow especially since this sim does not advance by seasons but can be played in real time speed and with a whole plethera of options covering crop growing speed and many many other things.The other thing that really helps the game is the graphics which portray a very nicely balanced view in any camera mode and lends itself well to the overall feel of the sim whether your ploughing or collecting hens eggs.As for activities and things you can do there is a lot more to the game than simply growing corn in a field as this sim features  the typical farm animals to care for and that form part of the farms income like the cows for instance which can be milked and the milk sold to the local milk supplier.When it comes to crops the choice is large and varied and can for your farm become more than just wheat to sell as you can not only harvest base items like wheat but you can then collect the hay left behind and use that in bales for feeding etc.One of the other things I am impressed by in this sim is the vehicles which are not only nicely modelled but seem to be able to mimick most things in the real world including needing front weights if you are taking an oversized plough out on your tractor.The one thing I would say negatively about this title is the default keys mapping which really should be one of the things you sort out when you get going as the default key setup is not too clever and not very intuitive either but once sorted it helps the game play become smooth and easier.Also of note this title has a huge amount of community of players behind it who have made over 300 mods which cover everything from new maps to a pressure washer for cleaning your vehicles and so there is always something you find to add to your farm.Although this review has not gone too deelpy into the sim and is just a general overview I would still say to anyone who has an interest in this type of gaming to buy this title and find all the great things about it as you develope your farm and feilds.

												After 80 hours of playing this game I have to say I find it somewhat relaxing and fun - I have even learned a few things about farming that I did not know before hand.  True, I do use the mod Course-play, to help work the fields without hiring drivers, which sames me money and my sanity, but it still is interesting to play.  As it works on my computer - which is not a brand new one - it also means you get a good game that has nice graphics for a okay price for a low-end computer.  What more could you ask for?

												This one is for Hardcore simulator fans, if you like to dabble in a bit of everything you might also enjoy it, but for Hardcore sim fans this is awesome. It requires you to actually concentrate on what you are doing, no quick fixes here. If you are looking for a Farming Simulator THIS is the only one worth getting, trust me I tried a more recent competitor called Agricultural Simulator or something like that, and the game ran like a dog even with all the settings turned all the way down, it also crashed on a regular basis. Farming Simulator 2013 is however very stable, looks great and runs very well, the only time you will find small lag/fps issues is in multi-player and this is due to mp being peer-peer rather than on a dedicated server. As you can see I have had MANY hours of fun with this game, and about half of that was playing multiplayer with friends.If you're into sims, grab it now.			",306,96,17,80,98,2,62

												Awesome game but I seem to have trouble with saving. Everytime I buy either a new field or a new attachment for a tractor and save it, and load back into the save game it reverts back to when i didn't have this new stuff and I have to redo what I did to get these items again. It seem it started when I made a new game so sense I have two save games the one might counteract with the other one? I'm just guessing here.			",66,3,0,16,41,1,15

												This game is a time waster...but it's fun! The level of reward for the time spend doing the tasks to grow crops feels rewarding, and the vast expanse of land options is nice. This is a game for people that enjoy hording cash and using it to slowly grow your farming, tools, and tractors.			",211,19,6,28,50,0,62

												If you like farmin' and driving tractors this game is for you! It has a lot to offer in terms of gameplay and keeps you busy in Singleplayer and Multiplayer alike. Though if you do not like slow driving and repetitive work this may not be a good fit as you ofter find yourself doing the same work over and over again.			",76,10,2,3,18,1,4

												I was skeptical when I bought this but it has been one of the most enjoyable games I have owned. I purchased it for 6.99 during the sale, I was considering 13.99 but caught the sale. I love the sandbox nature, you can do only crops or just livestock. You work at your own pace and it creates a very peaceful playground where you get to drive combines, fertilizers, sprayers, tractors and so on. There is quite a bit to do outside of crops, like mowing lawns or raising livestock. If you are on the fence like I was catch it on sale, even at 13.99 I would have felt the same, game runs like a champ and doesnt even blink when I alt tab out to firefox to look something up.This would rank on my ""top ten games I would take to a deserted island"" list.

												FS2013 is a good game, but the graphics (modeling) and game interface are not state-of-the-art.  If you choose the ""normal"" setting, be prepared for a VERY LONG slog before you can dump the terrible beginning equipment (the combine and most of the tractors are junk).  This means hours of tedious/boring play, inching up in earnings.  If you are a casual player, go with the ""easy"" setting.  If you are new to the agriculture simulator gaming world, I suggest you only consider FS2013 if it's on sale for less than $10.  Otherwise,  go with the newer Farming Simulator 2015.  It is much better graphically and the game interface and controls are much improved.  The folks at Giants Software have a winner in FS2015!			",41,6,2,2,9,0,1

												Great game!  If you're into twitch shooters and fast paced games then this one may not be for you.  However, if you like to take your time, be maticulous and plan the best solution to gain money the quickest, then I'd recommend you to try this one out.  I'll admit that it can be a little daunting at the start because there isn't much in the way of on-the-fly tutorials while playing, but once you figure out what you need to be doing, the satisfaction is much greater.  Pro-tip: Sell all the crops in your silos that you start the game with and maybe take a loan or two to buy mower attachments.  Buy the front/rear combo attachments that fold/unfold because they allow you the greatest cutting width and put them on one of your starting tractors.  Quick way to get a lot of money from the side missions.  I received almost $30k just from one mission which nearly paid me back for the mowers.  This is a great game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												...This game is quickly becoming an obsession. Which is a complete suprise. Don't be fooled by the benign title. There is a strong reward feedback loop in this game that may grab a hold of you as it has myself. Besides the merits of being a game about something practical instead of lethal, the game really is actually fun in it's own right. You start small with a field and some equipment, and slowly expand. First it's planting and harvesting. Then it's ""gee i really would like to be able to plant/spray/harvest faster"" which leads to looking for ways to make money so you buy bigger and better stuff. Then you start expanding by buying other larger fields. Then you get into buying milk cows. Then you'll be like, gee I'd like to feed the cows. Which leads to moving, raking, tedding, baling, making silage, etc. Then you can take the manure or slurry and use it to fertilize your fields, and on and on. Once you have a few fields going and silage operations, you begin to have to juggle your responsibilities. It has gotten quite hectic for me. Really a lot of fun. There are things about the game that aren't tied to reality. Your crops grow silly fast, and I don't think there are seasons. Also, you don't have machines break down in critical phases, like during harvest (a lot of my in-laws farm, and they think that aspect is particularly amusing), but at least it's something that tries to expose the world of farming to those who don't know much about it. So don't be put off by any misconceptions you may have about farming. This game can be quite a lot of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone who likes Simulators, period. This game has some of themost fluent controls and least buggy gameplay possible. I've always loved Farming Simulator, and 2013 as well as the expansions pushed it to a new level. Whether you're interested in creating the biggest farm ever, or just chill out and watch your cows moo as you make money, you can do it. There's really limitless options when it comes to any agriculture option.. Really, limitless.It's really a ""Sims"" type of simulator, with a little bit of strategy -- and even adventure.Again, I STRONGLY reccomend this game.			",33,3,1,6,10,0,3
