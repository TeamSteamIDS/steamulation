This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods. Campaign:This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions. Gameplay:Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team. Teams:This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese. Hints:If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level. Results:If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more. Pros:+Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game).+High level of variability in teams+Allowing for turtle or rushing player types+Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty)+Each civilization is like a whole new game+On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map.+Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map. +Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive. +Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support. Cons:-Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file)-You cannot select your AI team members’ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards).-Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this).-Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography).-You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2. -You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.

												If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos. Though with this iteration of the series,  there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly. Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units. But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food,  to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth. If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.			",407,113,13,62,53,1,77

												Age of Empires III. How can one possibly begin to review a game of such magnitude and prevalence that this game holds on the gaming world? A game that, even though it has been out for over 10 years, has a large active online community? It isn’t possible, but I shall nevertheless try.This game has a rich story, which is full of interesting historical points. Even though it is fictional, it pleasantly covers the conquests of the new world. In the vanilla version and “The War Chiefs” expansion, the player can endeavour to fight against various European civilisations in order to achieve glory and fame throughout the Americas. In “The Asian Dynasties” expansion, it spans centuries of Asian colonialization by the British as well as the Japanese and the Chinese Dynasties. The gameplay is a perfect reflection of the RTS genre. You slowly build your settlement to include markets, barracks and a host of other buildings, increasing your population and army before getting ready to attack your enemy or defend your settlement. Getting the fine balance between your food, wood and coin collection can be challenging but rewarding when you get it right. Will you build a good army to begin with, or a good economy, praying that your enemy won’t attack before you’ve had chance to convert your good economy into a powerful army? Each of the units has a strength and a weakness. For example, skirmishers counter musketeers, cavalry counters skirmishers, and musketeers counter cavalry. So it’s important to get the balance right when creating your army. The new eso-community patch has nicely levelled out the civilisations, making the OP civilisations slightly less powerful and the UP civilisations slightly more powerful.Graphically, the game is simply gorgeous. Even though it’s definitely not a new game, it doesn’t feel outdated in this respect and looks magnificent from a distance (you’ll want to play fully zoomed out to maximise what you can see on the screen at all times). From buildings setting on fire and slowly crumbling as they take damage, to the glorious water reflections, to the breathtaking bloom effects, you’ll be wondering whether it was actually made in 2005, or 2015.The music is purely divine. I’m listening to it as I type this as it’s one of my favourite game original soundtracks of all time. As your colony grows into a mighty empire the soundtrack seamlessly transitions from slow, peaceful renaissance/discovery era, to the powerful and more rhythmic late game, mimicking the chugging of steam engines and factories as you journey into the industrial age.Overall, a stunning game. If you haven’t ever played it, buy it and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.			",165,46,4,16,11,2,28

In general, much more refined and fun gameplay compared to previous AoEs with more of an emphasis on combat, rather than micromanaging villagers. Still has decent graphics even by today's standards.Cons: The French.11/10 would buy again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Age of Empires makes a comeback by jumping forward to the Imperial Era. Cannons, muskets, armed cavalries, large vessels and more cannons present a change of pace from the old sword-and-shield Age of Empires II. The third instalment of the franchise also introduces trading routes, a set of locations that you have to capture and control by building trading posts on it, reinforcing your income and XP gain. You can order shipments of goods from your mainland at intervals of time and befriend local indigenous tribes.In a sense, there are plenty of new features to keep long time fans of Age of Empires interested, while retaining the same core gameplay. Build stuff, gather stuff, advance Ages, kill baddies. Only this time, with more cannons.			",304,77,3,67,32,0,67

												I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia. Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.			",527,112,15,50,38,2,73

												A fine installation in the Age of Empires series that has a greater emphasis on combat as well as teaching you about things other than human resource management and medieval history lessons. Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.General:>Zoology Lessons – Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia.>Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air.>Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies.>The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries.>If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn.

On the bright side, he can’t nuke you like Gandhi.>Russian strelets are a gift from the Aztec blood gods.>Russian strelets are equipped with large foam axes and airsoft muskets.>Created an Iroquois home city called Toronto, named the warchief Rob Ford. He smoked crack, befriended blowgunners and blew up his own city.>As another reviewer simply noted, you can beat up monkeys and steal their money.>The Haitians hoped that their new ironclad warships would be their knights in shining armor. They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil.>The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVER… The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.>SPECIAL EDIT: Indestructable outposts

												Still better than Age of Empires 2.Strike one for imperialism.Looks nice, sounds nice, cannons are a great feature, has a working online service, trading cards, steam hours counting, *breathes*, all the DLC you might have missed in the old days, great 3-tiered base campaign which follows a families lineage. Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of ""you mess up, you just might die"".Price is a little on the high side however, and if you can get it cheaper than $40, I would whole heartidly recommend it.

												An old classic that i have always enjoyed. There are many nations to play, each with their own special units. a real time stradegy game where you upgrade through the ages, offering better units and upgrades. You can fight with humans or with computer players. The best part of the game by far is the battles. Huge battles with infantry, calvary and cannons, War will be every where and dead bodies will rittle the bafflefied. A must play if you like RTS games			",44,6,0,1,4,0,12

												Though many people say AOE2 is the best in the franchise, I actually think AOE3, with the abundance of exotic civs from 2 expansions and unofficial mods, has surpassed that timeless classic.Graphics: AOE3 looks great at distance, even up to today's standards. That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2. Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My opinion on every AOE is almost the same. I absolutely love these types of games. I enjoy building and training a growing army then completely smashing everyone else (unless they are better than me huhuhuhu) but honestly AOE III is a bit graphic outdated now but it’s still an amazing game for it being released in 2005. Recommendation: Absolutely.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and won't mind a bit less graphics then the newer games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago. The addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.As I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10>25>40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.Onto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.Overall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.			",69,8,3,10,8,0,18

												The original Age of Empires packed a stunning visual punch and backed it up with solid gameplay. Back at a time where most strategy games were chunky and 2D, the first Age game pulled aside the curtain to reveal a world that was sunny, animated, colorful and lifelike. Strategy games were never the same. Age of Empires III presents a similar leap forward for real-time strategy fans. As Half-Life 2 did for first-person shooters, AoE III shows just how inspiring these games can be when lovingly crafted with outstanding artistry and solid gameplay fundamentals. Age of Empires III doesn't redefine real-time strategy gameplay. You're still scurrying to collect more resources than your opponents and rushing to field a giant army, and the game still rewards frantic clicking and unit management. But the presentation is unmatched, and even though the game is rooted in RTS conventions, there are enough new elements and strategic variations here to addict even grizzled veterans. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. And if you've never played a real-time game before, this is the place to start.Graphically, the engine that powers Age of Empires III has a laundry list of the latest graphics technology: real-time shadows, high dynamic range lighting, you name it. There's even bump-mapping on the barrels of the cannons. But the real impressive thing about the technology isn't that it's there, it's that you don't notice it. From the moment your Home City first appears on the menu screen, or a new map loads up to reveal pale grey waters lapping quietly against rocky New England shores, you become lost in the game world. The latest in technology is coupled with truly beautiful art.Age III pulls out all the stops to depict the sweeping majesty of the old west or the unspoiled beauty of the colonial-era Americas. One of the single-player campaign cutscenes, done in the game engine, pans across rolling hills of golden grass while huge herds of buffalo amble along like waves of water. Another level depicts a small Caribbean port picking up the pieces after a devastating hurricane, with citizens milling about amidst wrecked ships and broken docks. Yet another level has you picking your way through a dense swamp looking for the ruins of Spanish treasure ships half-buried in the mud and dripping with gold doubloons. You're never lacking for eye candy.The music is equally impressive. Done in full orchestra, it moves effortlessly from majestic scores highlighting the beauty of the landscape to pounding battle drums accenting the fury of battle. Of course, the combat is equally spectacular. The goal of the game is to devastate your opponents, and said devastation is accompanied by deeply satisfying images of destruction. A large part of this has to do with the real physics incorporated onto the game engine. You can feel the impact when a cannonball shatters into a wooden frontier building, breaking it into pieces that fly off in macabre arcs. Smoke billows from muskets, cannons leap back as they expel their fury, building spires burst into flame and collapse into themselves, and the masts of ships crash to the deck as the vessel shudders with the impact of enemy fire. Every game of Age of Empires III drips with spectacle.Age III simulates colonization, meaning that the town you build in the game can request ""shipments"" from your Home City. You gain new shipments by earning experience, and you have a set list of things that you can send over. This has a profound impact on your strategy. Do you send over economic resources early, to give your town a leg up on the competition? Or do you send over tons of military units, so that you can field an advanced army while your neighbors are still building up? Shipments add a lot to the game by giving you more strategic possibilities, and by giving you incentive to rapidly earn experience. They really reward players for going out and making things happen around the map. Every map is also dotted with Native American villages or trade routes that can be built up by your colony. Controlling a trading post gives you free experience or resources whenever a trade cart comes by, whereas Native American villages can provide you with inexpensive military units or technology upgrades. Controlling these points on the map gives you a major edge over the long term. As a result, it's a rush to be the first to locate these points, and they are always hotly contested. Battles usually play out as a series of skirmishes across the map before big conflicts rage at the town centers.Finally, Age of Empires III adds the ""Home City"" concept. Outside of the real-time portion of the game, you can create a Home City representing the world power that's supplying your colonies. Your Home City has a level - like an RPG character - representing how experienced it is. As you earn experience playing the game your city will ""Level up"" and you can choose new abilities for it, in effect deciding what kinds of shipments you'd like to send to your colonies. The decision about what kinds of upgrades to make to your city is agonizing and has a tangible impact on the main game. It's also fun just to level up, develop, and customize your own personal city. One nice side effect here is that, even if you get totally♥♥♥♥♥whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to use to develop your city. This concept works great all around and really contributes to the game.The single-player campaign is divided into three acts representing three generations of the same family. Picking up where Age of Kings left off, the lead character in the first campaign is a Knight adventuring in the New World in search of a lost treasure. Said treasure impacts his whole family line, as depicted in Act II, a rip-roaring Davy-Crockett style adventure starring his Grandson. Act III picks up two generations later, featuring a wild west romp involving railroads, the Mexican war, and a quest into the Amazon jungles before the family finally finds closure. As with the other production values of the game, the writing is solid and the voice acting is great. There's a good variety of missions in the single-player campaign, from protecting a stronghold until help arrives to building a railroad line to battling pirates along a series of islands. None of the individual scenarios have you doing things that hadn't been done in other RTS games, but the real magic is in the gameplay, which allows you to develop a different Home City for each act and tackle each scenario differently. Truly hardcore strategy gamers might find lots of nitpicks in Age of Empires III. It's difficult to unload transport ships, healers have to be micro-managed or they'll charge into combat, and there aren't a lot of options for customizing your hotkeys. Artillery units on occasion can't decide to fire or pack up to move. But the important thing is that none of these little problems really impacts the core game. Age of Empires III is an absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off. Age of Empires III may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we'll be comparing games to this for years. Shoulder your musket and pony up: this one's a real trip.

												Age of Empires III is criticized for being not a good follow-up to AoE II. I don't fully understand the criticism. I prefer the colonial-era setting of AoE III much more than the medieval one of II. The skirmish mode of AoE III results in roughly 45-75 minute games, which is great for short bursts of gaming. It's a great way to unwind and is an engaging game that has stood the test of time.			",16,2,1,2,7,0,12

												I own two coppies of AOE3, that's just how great of a game it is.Between my retail copy and my steam copy I'd have nearly 1000 hours played.Positives: ""Card Deck Tech Tree"" Allows you to select up to 35 technologies that are unlocked based on your XP in the match. The abillity to name your Explorer and Homecity. City leveling and user leveling adds noticeable multiplayer progression. Tradepost [specified spots on the map allow you to build a tradepost  for extra resources, units and technologies offering a bit of a King Of The HIll feel].Negatives: No diplomacy [unless a custom scenario], only 3 team options [FFA, 1 or 2], no capturing enemy units/technologies [in previous games you could use your priest/monk to convert enemies to your team].

												Age of Empires 3Genre: Strategy - Real Time StrategyRating: 10/10Personal playing period: 5+ yearsIs it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection.Girl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.Personal Comment:This is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.Online gaming:The online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.Short Summary:This is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time.The game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.Learning Curve and Gameplay:Easy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.			",130,13,6,12,25,0,25

Turns out i had a lone settler chopping wood who had been doing that the entire game, after taking control of this settler i started a wild goose chase which ended with my settler hiding behind 3 low level outpost awaiting his doom at the hands of hundreds of enemy soldiers10/10			",45,1,0,6,3,0,3

												A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when ""base building"" wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun.  It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game.  AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock ""cards"", which then could be called into play in a future match.  This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a ""capital"" city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle.  Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.The factions are nicely done.  The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them.  Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing ""wonders"" as well as other minor changes.  I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do.  Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.An old game, but worth the money.  Especially since newer quality RTSs are infrequent.			",84,3,0,15,16,0,47

												Well, a third part for Age of Empires. What to expect of it?If you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.Now, what is different in AoE III?First of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I & II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.The second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.And the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a ""hometown"" which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I & II.The AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.With the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.The War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations.The Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...The Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.Overall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I & II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try.If you have never played AoE I or II, but you like RTS games, you should definitly try this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A follow up to the 2'nd Age of Empires that everyone loved. Among many this game is not so good, some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city centre to store them. Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and father away into the 19'th Century. It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game. Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud, but they did add Trading Cards so that's one interesting thing to look forward to.This game is soon to have 10 years after it's release. But this edition is by far the best one yet. You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as ""one of the best"". The modest presentation of it's ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot:

												Good points of Age of Empires III:Good unit diversity: Each civ has a core of units semi-unique to them, making each one feel different enough that playing the Germans doesn't feel like a playing a reskin of the British, or vice versa. For the ""European Civs"" (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their ""Best Units"", which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to ""Kingsguard"" Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular ""Guard"" Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.Good story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.Good* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training ""blocks"" of infantry, and the Chinese creating ""Banner Armies"" which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.Bad points of Age of Empires III:Bad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a ""Revolution"" feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.Anachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.Overall Review: It's pretty good. Steam's char. limits are♥♥♥♥♥			",62,13,0,36,9,0,59

												This is a very solid game. I was expecting this game to be absolutely awful, however, in playing it and completing all three campaigns on normal in about 19 hours, it was an enjoyable game. The campaign is above-average, and the variety of the campaign is solid, yet it can become repeatitive, in my opinion.The AI is very solid, they act like they know what to do. This, with the gameplay, cooperates and makes it a very fun experience for strategy gamers because the gameplay, is as normal with Age of Empire series, is great.The graphics are dated, however they are not all that bad.People still play multiplayer, and MP is very fun, as it has modded modes, to just normal gameplay, so the community is not dead.Overall, I would recommend this game to any strategy fan. The overall experience is worth the price tag.8/10.----Thanks for reading my review!

												The game gives rather different experience than Age of Empires II, it's much more faster paced, the natural resources are limited, but you can get farms, plantiations and factories that produces them in unlimited amount. Also, you can capture trade outposts that allow you to get more experience needed for shipment's (which give additional units, resources or upgrades for your nation). Which those changes you are able to fight for longer, have bigger battles and in exchange - have more fun.The unit combat is really sweet and enjoyable, mixing various types of units gives an edge in the battle, which means that spam blobs can be easily defeated if played right.The game is well balanced, even with weakest nation you are able to defeat any other nation,and if meele combat is your kink, you can have a lot of fun here.The only con is that camera position is really really close to your units, and you can change it just by a little bit, which might be irritating, and when you alt+tab the sound options reset's so you have to change them again.Also, there is a lot of problems with multiplayer if you want to play via lan, which I still didnt figured out.

												Age of Empires 3. An amazing RTS taking place in the ""New World"" during the colonial age. Great game play that keeps you entertained for hours, continuously coming back wanting more!Pros:-Great game play, keeping you entertained for hours. -Has funny and entertaining cheats, like ""tuck tuck tuck"" which allows you to spawn in a huge monster truck. That will drive over anyone or anything, creating global havoc. -Has a large supply of maps, each map making you have to adjust your strategic plans to win. -You get all the DLC's, adds more to the game, civilizations, maps and more!Cons:-Dying online community and online support, servers can get high amounts of lag. Servers will go offline sometimes even for an entire day. -Franchise has been disbanded, meaning no more support. No updates, no fixing current glitches. -Population cap reaches only 200, meaning that your stuck fighting smaller battles. I would purchase this game on sale, it's worth to get the game. Just not at full price.Overall I will give an overall positive review: 8.3/10			",172,26,5,16,28,0,29

												Age of Empires 3 (AOE3) will always be my favourite RTS of all time. I have played this game since 2008 and on my disc copy (actually 3 disc copies lol) I would say I have played around 1500 hours or so total.The Campaign: The campaign is not a hugely different playstyle from skirmish or multiplayer but it allows you to feel more like you're involved with the people and characters than usual which definitely makes the campaign worth playing through. Each expansion has a separate campaign and I remember them being highly entertaining and interesting each to their own. The campaigns also allow you to use civs not playable in any other game mode.Map Editor: Not something I played around with too much, but it was fun to just create giant battles, or create your own scenarios and historical events.Civilizations: The civilizations are really interesting. So interesting, that my interest in European, Native American, and Asian history are based from this game. I play this game as an excuse for studying for my history tests but I can't say that it helped with much more than trivia-like questions. Anyways, This game makes every civilization slightly different from each other (The War Chiefs and Asians are much different respectifully though) and every one is recognizable by not only building styles but troops as well. Each nation is given at least one troop that is unique to their civ. In the original there is 8 European nations (Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Ottoman Empire) with War Chiefs, 3 Native American tribes were added (Iroquois, Sioux, Aztec) allowing 11 total playable nations, and finally with Asian Dynasties, 3 more were added (Japan, China, India), with a total of 14 playable civilizations . Apart from the 3 civs that are just a little bit better than the rest (You'll know soon enough), it is pretty balanced when playing online (IF playing with someone with similar experience).Multiplayer: AOE3 was slowly getting weaker with age a few years back but with the game being more widely sold on steam, I feel the community has a chance to bounce back. Usually when I go on, there are anywehre from 600 - 1000 people on at a time. This doesn't count the community that play on places like GameRanger and other programs like it. Don't get discouraged by people baiting new players into their games when they are veteran players. Host a game and name it something welcoming new players, read the ranks of the people who join, to make sure the game will be fair and welcoming to you if you are new. Or join another low ranked players game or grab a buddy or two and practice between you all. I would recommend being able to beat Hard or Expert computers before playing online, but of course, it is your choice. Multiplayer is the best place to play, practice, and have a competitive and some-what stressful game of AOE3. :)Graphics: Honestly, in my opinion, the graphics are spectacular for their time and do not look anywhere near ""bad"" even in today's time. Of course they aren't great for today's standards but they aren't awful enough to turn you away. I actually find them quite nice and I am more than satisfied watching the ships travel the oceans, or seeing the parrots flying through the rainforests. The loading screens are really nice too, all 3 games have different styles. For example in Asian Dynasties there is one loading screen with the Indian Emperor riding on an elephant with the troops behind them. Or the Japanese loading screen with the beautiful Torii Gates. In War Chiefs, one screen is the Aztec emperor on top of a temple with his arms up with the people looking up to him from the ground. This game sparks not only interest, but imagination, its amazing!Soundtrack: The soundtrack is phenominal! I absolutely love the theme song of each game and I find myself testing my opera skills most times I play this game. The music is great, intense, and is fitting to the epic introduction to the game or the conclusion to the massive multiplayer game you just finished.Opening: The opening to each expansion has a really cool video based on the game. The War Chiefs has the European explorers searching the forest and them being ambushed by the Native troops. It's epic, and amazing to watch from time to time before jumping into the game! I recommend watching all 3 intros so I'll let you watch to find out what they're like!Extra Features: Unlike previous installments to the franchise (AOE1, AOE2, Age of Mythology), AOE3 introduces cards, card decks, city levels, city customization, explorer naming, and city naming. Cards can be purchased by leveling up. One level is one card unlock point. A deck can have I think 21 cards to start, and with every ten level ups, can have an extra card in the deck. Cities level up by playing with them, and EXP is given for every building or troop made, or enemy building or troop destroyed. Cities can be customized by upgrading the buildings, such as France's Notre Dam by changing colours, adding features, etc. A minor touch but still interesting enough to have your own sort of style with leading a nation in the game. Your explorer can be named so you can make yourself, a friend, or family member be the greatest European explorer, Native American War Chief, Japanese Shogun, Indian Brahmin, or Chinese Master that has ever existed. The same goes for cities, you can name them the small rural town you live in, or your country's capital city and make it the most advanced city in the world! All theses extra features expand upon the replayability and fun that you can have with AOE3. Note, AOE3 - The Asian Dynasties expansion was the latest released and updated. All Civs can be played on this expansion and the majority of the people play on this one. I suggest only playing the original AOE3 and War Chiefs when playing with campaign, or really dislike playing with or against the Asian Civs as they cannot be played in the others.Also, check out Age of Mythology Extended Edition (AOM) on steam if you like this game, or if you're into Greek, Egyptian, Norse mythology. I prefer AOE3 myself, but AOM is my second favourite in the series. Personally, I would wait until this game, and/or AOM, go on sale to buy them but I still feel they are worth the cost. Like I said at the top, I have 3 disc copies of AOE3 that all work (long story) and also disc copy of AOM. These games ARE worth it.All in all, I want to see AOE3 bounce back strong. If you're new looking for help, a partner to play with, or want to join a clan who are mostly active, just message me on steam and I hope to see you on the battlefield soon!  ",48,1,1,2,23,0,14

												A fun RTS? Definitely. Better than Age of Empires II? Not necessarily.Age of Empires III  is a RTS game in the 18th/19th century, featuring Native Americans, European Countries and Asian nations. The recipe is the same as always: Build your town, build units, gather resources, build more units, defeat your enemies. However, they found a few things to spice it up: - Home Cities, allowing you to seperately level up ingame and overall- shipements from your home country to gain bonus units, buffs and resources- no more gathering stations > youg et wood / money / food right away- lots of diverse nations and units, making it possible to have a huge variety of tactics.The game aged (heh) very well and still looks awesome today. Graphics are very good, same for the physics. The gameplay is very fun, even more if you play multiplayer with friends. Here is also the only downside - multiplayer requires a seperate login. However, that's not too much of a problem.Would i recommend the game to others? Yes of course! THe campaign will take a good amount of time to finish and the skirmish mode is endless. This game will continue being aweosme until they release Age of Empire IV or equivalent.			",561,189,17,68,47,2,97

												Age of Empires III: Complete Collection is a real-time strategy game from Ensemble Studios and published by to what now Microsoft Studios. It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.Age of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.Graphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.Seeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.Age of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.Rating 9/10			",1157,346,58,143,166,12,228

												Before this incredible game was added to Steam, I could honestly say in all the years since its release I've played well over 300 hours. This game is therapuetic. Played AoEII since 2001 and you could add at least 200 more. It deeply saddened me when Ensemble went bankrupt. However if you want MORE than the complete collection, check out the unofficial sequel/expansion pack: the Wars of Liberty mod. Adds an extra 15 or so civs and a TON of features, even modifying the current vanilla civs with special features, and with a reasonable community backing and dedicated admins keeping up with patches every now and then, you will NOT regret this.Nevertheless, this game, and franchise, is truly up there with the best RTS games money can buy. To this very day, I enjoy a cheeky skirmish or two to kill time. Absolute classic.			",12,0,0,1,6,0,5

												Beautiful game! If you are one of those guys that hate easy strategy games, and want something that relies more on your capacity of situation analysis, like war strategies, economic strategies, and psychological pressure, this game is perfect for you. You have different kinds of troops, like light infantry, heavy infantry, cavalry, artillery, and your settlers. And each one counters the other. So it's all about team work and planned strategies. You can either create a strong economy, or make a fast attack. Of course it's not as simple as that. That's why this game is so awesome! Each game is full of posibilities.			",37,1,0,1,2,0,2

There is no support from the dev's anymore due to complex company issues, so there will never be anymore balance changes or ui updates. Servers go down quite frequently.

												I wanted this game for years, finally I own it and it has been worth the wait, it's easily the best in the franchise (In my opinon.)This time you play as the power hungry european empires from the colonial era, like The British Empire (Salutes to Union flag) The French, Spainish, Russians and more, addtionally since this the Complete collection, you get the bonus DLC which includes some tribes and Asain powers like Japan.A lot of features have been added like trading posts, and you can upgrade them from transported by horse into trains, however they removed some features I enjoyed like Captapults and cannons attacking areas you want them to, for an example if theres a forest in the way, I could send a small army of cannons to destory the forest so I can build a wall or something, sadly this feature has been removed possibly due to a glitch where you can attack ally buildings with no penalties.Overall if your a fan of RTS games, there is no reason to say no to this amazing game.*Note* Everytime I hear ""The New World"" I keep thinking of these.

												Pros :This is absolutely a fun strategy time-sink. Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.For single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.Cons (without bias) :Let me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun.It seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the ""tutorial"" portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already.The ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed. This is for both you and the enemy so it may seem that they pop up on you very quickly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While singleplayer is pretty boring, AoE III is one of the most fun RTS games in multiplayer. Factions play differently, some feel like totally different game, but at the same time they are well balanced. This also forces use of different tactics against different kinds of enemies. There is an abundance of units and buildings, and the game is fast-paced. The graphics are amazing even today, AoE III is one of the best looking RTS games I've seen. The multiplayer is well alive even today, after so many years. I definitely recommend getting this game for every RTS fan. The only thing is that you shouldn't expect a game similar to AoE or AoE II as AoE III is a different game, however, even better in multiplayer in every way. ",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												Its different from the AOE 1 & 2 style , with more choices , rpg like , enhanced better graphics etc.-Story is awesome if you will choose to play campaign , 3 stories , each one is better than another.-The difficulty with this one is reasonable , i mean unlike AOE 1 & 2 campaigns , you have to be so pro to finish them without cheats , this one will let you finish the campaign with no cheats.-The purchasing unit in this game is intersting , saves alot of time than previous AOE's , for example you could build 5 units in 1 queue instead of 1 by 1 , theres also town supplies that you can get them every 4 mins ~ ( you get to choose ur cargo and set up before starting game ).-This type of games aint about graphics i know , but this game's graphics are fairly nice and pleaseing to see.-When you're done with the main story , you could still play customized battles , as you will gain experince that will allow you to level up ur own town , with way more more cards/choices/upgrades than you had in story mode.Either you're going to play it alone or with friends , its so much fun. i'd recommend buying this game in full/sale prices , worth it anyway.  9.5/10.

												Do I recommend this game? I do. I really do.It's like masterpiece of music or artwork. You can make beautiful colonies, great armies and great battles. It's not about accuracy, but about tactic, strategy. You need to get resources as fast as possible, get units and destroy your enemy. Simple, but hard, since different nation has different bonuses. So far I loved France and Portugal. France for unique settlers, which are strong and gather faster than usual settlers. Voltigeurs and Gandarmes are strong together. Advanced formation for Gandarmes recommended. (able to turn on in gameplay options)Portugal is... just beautiful. I love the language and voices they have. Cassadores are powerful long-range units with cute voice. Organ guns are ideal against infantry. Jinetes (dragoons) are hardcore enemies for cavarly, so use 'em to keep your artillery safe from enemy's horses. There maybe hard choice for pikemen or halbardies, but imo pikemen are way more useful, even if weaker. I work with 45 Cassadores and 5 Heavy Cannons (also +1 for voice) which are powerful formation, but also weak. So I used to work with weaker (low hp) units, but faster and more powerful. Rathauses (or how do you call it) are a bit annoying, since if you want to build beautiful looking colony, 3 rathauses are enough imo.Even tho price may not be very convincing, spend money on this (or wait for sale, it's always an option) and have fun. Company is fun either.			",64,10,5,8,9,1,17

												The game is very enjoyable. Nice graphics like for a year of production, enjoyable missions in Campaign and a large variety offered by the multiplayer as well as singlplayer. Every game is not perfect, and this too has its drawbacks, one of which is the inability to select many languages, which is propably a problem for a younger players, but unfortunately you can't do anything about it. I could exchange the advantages and disadvantages, but i think thats enough to say that this game is really good and I really recommend this game for fans of open world-strategy games.

												A Great Game. I would say Age of Empires III is the best Of the Age of Empires series. But some might very likelly disagree with it. Specially comparing this game to Either Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology. But i prefer this game better.I cant bring myself to like the graphics in AoE II but i really do like AoM. Now for the review iself: Graphics: Nicely Detailed Envinronment with an (G)UI that is appealing and very straightfoward so you rarely get confused in the menus. Sound: Really nicelly recorded voice acting with very clear sound quality and excelent sound effects.... Although they sometimes seem a little bit too bland. Gameplay: You got a Map, Quick actions on a few buttons on the right of it and Basic information about your units such as: Unit count, unit health, attack, armor and relevant stuff. To the right of it a simple grid of commands to give to your units with very self explanatory action. Buildings can build more than one unit at a time allowing for up to five units to be deployed at the same time. It takes the same amount of time to deploy 1 unit and 5 units. Story: The game follows the story of a family known as the Black family. In which the first of them is a man Named Morgan Black. The story revolves around this particular family. This family also has relevancy in The WarChiefs. Although more to the side. ANd little relevancy in Asian Dinasties. Needless to say the story is very well structurally built with a fluent and smooth continuum without any drastic changes except between Acts 1,2 and 3. Difficulty: The game gets progressivelly harder as you progress further in the story. The same can be said in multiplayer except in multiplayer there is a point where the difficulty will stall as the game seems like its going nowhere.The final missions of each act are Significantly Harder than any other missions in each act. GFX: I already talked about graphics but now is for a less apparent thing. The effects used are detailed to a certain degree and really gives that extra punch to make them even more immersive. Variety: The whole game speaks variety. All countries have thier own unique characteristic. For instance, the Dutch can build banks which produce coin/gold constantly, albeit a little bit slower than mines, but never run out. The French have a better kind of villager (Called settler in the game) that is called ""Coureur des bois"" it gathers resources considerably faster, but cost more and take longer to train/build. Total: Overall, this game is a masterpeice for sure. But you probably wont want to play it if you dont have enough time. Because this game gets very long sometimes.			",56,2,0,1,8,1,1

												Introduction: My favorite RTS franchise of all time! Loved AoE 2 especially! Now coming to this one I wouldn't say its perfect as there are many new additions which is a mixed bag but overall I liked this game after spending some time. Played all of the AoE games and I would happily place this at the second place after AoE 2 HD.Campaign: Campaign in short is okay but mind you I didn't complete it though. Its not easy either but it just didn't feel interesting enough to me so as of now I have yet to complete it. So take someone elses opinion regarding the Campaign.Multiplayer: The multiplayer community is decently active, around 1300 to 1500 players are online on most weekends. Multiplayer is also one of the strongest points of this game as with 2 or 3 players against 'expert' mode Bots it can be really fun while being challenging and you can 'master' the game more quickly by playing with veteran players! So I recommend playing Multiplayer if you get the game. If the ESO Servers are down for some reason you can still play multiplayer on Gameranger and Voobly. Some dedicated players play there exclusively.Conclusion: Besides the Multiplayer the Skirmish Mode can also be challenging and decently fun to play. Other than that all I would say in the end is that I can definitely recommend this game when on sale to those looking for a RTS to play with friends. Yes this game has some bugs on more recent Operating Systems like Windows 10 though it can be fixed. Also there are some issues like path finding and builders getting stuck after building structures though it can be taken care of if you build your Empire a little spread out rather can cramping your structures while making sure you have it well defended with castles on all sides.NOTE : When you click on the 'Play' Button it will give you several options like AoE: Complete Edition, War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties etc. The full game with all the expansions is the Asian Dynasties option not the Complete Edition option ironically!Also for Windows users while you would expect Steam Overlay like every other game here it doesn't works for this game unless you run Steam in Administrator Mode though it depends on your UAC settings.

												This review comes after a four-in-the-morning-coffee-fueled 3 hour run of the game, just to give perspective.So I'd been wanting to buy AoE3 for a while, since I got AoE2HD actually, and the oppotunity came up, so y'know, here I am. After playing a substantial amount of AoE2HD, I thought I knew the system pretty well and there wouldn't be a shock to the system.Well..This third installment of the series was actually quite surprising, obviously there is the update in graphics, which is really smooth and eye-pleasing. Some of the games mechanics change too, gone are the days of clusters of gold and stone, mining camps and the like, it's been simplified so that all you need are settlers (Villagers). There's also a system where the player can use a card deck for a civilisation that bring in certain imports, such as food crates, siege equipment or units. This spices things up because to unlock these, you must gain XP (another new addition), this is done by killing enemy units, or building trading posts along trade routes or next to native hamlets.Basically, if you like the Age of Empires series, get this game (Preferably on sale, as it's bloody expensive when it isn't)Rating - 8/10 Tentacles			",109,11,2,8,25,1,15

												This is one of my all time favorite games. I've been playing these titles since they came out in the late 90's and they are just as good now as they were back then. The complete collection is amazing with no glitches and great game play. If your a real time strategy person this is the game for you. It's not a new titile so the graphics are a little dated. The maps are huge and you can play up to 8 people. Theres also an online mode with a ton of active players. It's very competative so I advise getting some practice in before you decide to take on some people online. The on-line games are pretty diverse with a risk mode, supremecy , zombies and a bunch more. The game is also fun to play with a few friends. There's a campain mode, a senario mode, and an online mode. Lots of game play for a reasonable price. Hope you liked the review and see you on the battle field.			",229,28,3,23,24,1,24

												This game never gets old. Even though most of the modern base builder games are more in depth. This one just sits in a special corner of mine for games that I will always love. I started playing Age of Empires when they were first released and once this on was released on Steam at a good price I had to jump on it. The graphics are simple the task is simple.. destroy the other players or play though the campaign and destroy the other groups. This game is a progression style base builder which means you start in an early age and advance once you have the materials to progress which will give you better technology. The faster you advance before others the bigger weapons you have to destroy :) or take the non violent way and just build a wonder... But there is no fun in that :p I recommend this game to anyone who likes to lob spears.. you go lob them spears ;) ",53,18,0,10,18,0,19

												Super great game, I was so addicted that my wife left me, I played it on work so I lost my job. Now I have no income, my friends won't talk to me, and my wife moved to canada so I didn't have a bad influence on the children, my parents hate me every christmas I am all alone, All I have is Age of Empires during the holidays, but that's enough and I think it was worth it. I sometimes play for 36 hours straight, the next days I only lie in my bed, I haven't been outside for 2 years now, I order all my food, I now live on foodstamps. But it is a great game, so it was all worth it.			",11,4,0,0,4,0,8

												Such a great classic. I still remember watching the preview videos/demos of all the new particle effects this game was going to have. The story line is amazing and although not perfectly historically accurate, its close enough that if you know your history, you will be able to relate the time period and settings to the characters story line. Graphics were phenomenol for their time so it still looks good today. All of the classic rts game play exists here. IMO this is the last great rts game made			",60,3,1,9,4,0,6

												Age of Empires 3 is the third and (seemingly) final game in the Age of Empires series. If you  don't know already, it's a traditional real-time-strategy game set in the colonial and imperial ages of European history, with a little of flair of Asia for kicks. Although Age of Empires games traditionally feature a very strong campaign, the replay factor in AOE is always the multiplayer and skirmish options, and this time players are given a multitude of options to suit their gameplay preferences. As a ""turtle"" (high defense, weak offense) player, I especially like the ""treaty"" mode, which turns off combat for a set number of minutes at the beginning of each round and also forces players to build their base within a confined space during that time period. As with previous games in the series, AoE3 features 4 different ""age"" milestones that allow your civilization to access new technologies and units.The Good:* Trading cards enabled.* Different civilizations, especially those from different continents, have entirely separate styles of play, giving the game different ""flavors"" of play and replayability.* Rather than just giving each civilization unique units and technologies, AOE3 takes ""Uniqueness"" a step further by giving every play 21 ""bonus cards,"" which can be used to dramatically alter your play choices. Two players can conceivably play as the same civilization and require completely different strategies and playstyles due to the bonuses given to them by their cards.* Vastly more multiplayer options than the predecessors in the series.* Some Civs, such as the Sioux, are fairly simplistic. This is a positive attribute as it allows differently-skilled players to enjoy the game in their own way.* There is a ""home city building"" side-game that is a little enjoyable.The Bad:* I feel like a game that supports 1000+ units on the screen and 1920x1080 resolution should let me zoom the map out a bit further. My town center annoyingly takes up way too much of my view!* No Steam achievements.* Antiquated map controls - the only way to scroll the map is by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. RTS games should support WASD map scrolling and/or click 'n' drag.* The final ""age"" is rarely ever needed in a match, and costs more than it benefits your team, in my opinion.* Map-editing is nowhere near as easy and intuitive as it was in previous AOE games.* Weak AI. It seems like a 1 vs. 1 AI opponent always focuses strictly on cavalry, which in turn focuses me to only focus on building one type of unit.The Ugly:* Horribly WRONG launcher screen. When starting the game, you are given the choice of loading (a) Age of Empires III: Complete Collection, (b) Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs, and (c) Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties. However, option ""A"" is not complete at all: choosing it gives you access to neither of the two expansions. Option B gives you access to the War Chiefs Expansion (but not Asian Dynasties), and Option C gives you access to ALL game content: the base game and both expansions.* Not as fun as AOE2. A sequal should be a step forward, not a step back. The differences are noticeable in all sorts of small areas, which individually would not be a problem, but lend to an overall diminished quality. Some examples are unit formations being nowhere near as ""tight,"" and units having a tendency to WALK into battle if they are grouped with a slower unit.The Verdict:* At the time of this writing, the base price for AO3 is $39.99. That is overpriced, especially since AO2-HD is a more solid and overall better game and comes for the same base price. However, I do think AOE3 is worth checking out if you can get it on sale. I have had a lot of fun with this game, perhaps 100 hours or so, before it ever became available on Steam. But now that AO2-HD has come out, I see little reason to play AO3.			",224,72,4,40,33,2,60

												At first, I was hesitant to play Age of Empires III, refusing it due to the sheer fact that it has guns. I see now how foolish I was. This game is by far one of the best in the series, the asthetics being amazing, the gameplay unique from the other games, letting you actually progress a bit, and train groups of units rather than singles, and, honestly, the guns are not overpowered or cheap, they work really well in the AOE setting. I reccomend this game to anyone who likes AOE, or any RTS. Give it a try, you just might like it. 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GameSpot said it best: ""Age of Empires III has some very big shoes to fill"".It is a very good game, and there are barely any real flaws to speak of, but I still prefer its predecessor, even though almost everything that was good about Age of Empires II is improved here, most noticeably the A.I. and the graphics.Perhaps the historical era covered by the game and its heavy focus on gunpowder in later stages isn't as compelling, and the scenario editor (which played a big part in Age of Empires II's prolonged success) is a little more complicated to use.But the core gameplay, which is easy to understand, but hard to master, remains pretty much the same, with some interesting additions like the ""Capital City"" and the ability to choose different bonuses as you advance through the ages, a similar system to the one seen in Age of Mythology.If you're a fan of the ""Age"" series or you just enjoy well-designed, polished real-time strategy games, or are looking to get into the genre, Age of Empires III is definitely worthy of your time and money.

												Super fun game, especially if you play with your friends online. There are many different civilizations to choose from and each one has a unique playstyle which can be strong or weak depending on how you play them and how your enemy plays as well. Very difficult but very fun at the same time. So much strategy and thought goes into every match and you have to make very quick and precise decisions or else you can set yourself behind from the very start and lose extremely easily. Keep in mind that this game is over a decade old now so the graphics are not ""cutting edge"" but the game still looks good, and graphics don't really matter in this type of game anyways. With how old the game is, the online functionality can be pretty bad at times. I've had many time with my friends where we struggled to all get into the same lobby together as some of us could connect and others literally could not join no matter what. There are rumors of an Age of Empires 4 possibly being made, but I wouldn't count on that too much. Despite the online problems, all the game mechanics work very good and the strategy required to succeed is insane. I recommend this to anyone who likes a thought invoking game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is worth every single penny. It's a classic RTS game. It's fairly easy to get the jist of. Hell, even I got the hang of it quickly. That really speaks volumes to me. This game is even better when you have someone to play with or against. On occasion, the online service will run into problems and people may not be able to join your game and/or you won't be able to join theirs. I have only recently started to notice this problem (10/31/15) so I am not sure how common it will become. It usually just takes a bit of time to fix itself though.As mentioned before, it's real-time strategy. You get to pick the Civilization that you like the most. These include the Germans, Spanish, British, Asian civs,  Native American civs, and a lot more. Each have their own strategies. In the game, you are pitted against another Civ(s), whether it be an AI or an actual player. Your civilization's economy relies on 3 things: food, wood, and coin. Your villagers, or workers, must work to gather these resources and build your colony. You can use the resources to create buildings, buy improvements, and train an army.Eventually, you'll need an army. There are infantry, calvalry, and artillery units. You can also have naval battles with various ships if there is a body of water on the map. As mentioned before, there are numerous strategies for victory. I'd recommend trying out all the Civilizations and see which one you feel most comfortable with.Overall, this game is godly. It will stand the test of time, and I hope that the online service will remain available for years to come (after all, it still has a sizable community).P.S. There is a fort called Het Huys de Hoop.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've probably put more hours into this game than any other (pre-Steam), and it was worth every minute of it. Everything, I find, has been greatly improved from AOEII - the graphics, gameplay (units are much more equal - no more trebuchets and cannons outranging everything), introduction of shipments, allowing for different tactics.I can't understand for the life of me how AOEII remains more popular, but for me, this is the highlight of the series.

												It should be known by now that I've been a fan of the Age games from way back. There's just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it's more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to ""reality"" as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of ""capital A"" Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.Now Ensemble is back on the history train with the third official Age of Empires game. Age of Empires III moves the action to the New World, letting players lead a variety of European nations from the Age of Discovery through the Industrial Age. Eight playable nations battle across a wide variety of geographies -- from the swamps of Florida to the snowy passes of the Rocky Mountains. Players can recruit different Native American tribes and seize control of various trade routes. Material and technological support will be offered by the player's home city back in Europe.The 24-mission campaign is very well designed. Divided into three large acts, it tells the story of three generations of the Black family. First Morgan Black, a Knight of St. John races to the New World to stop the Spanish from seizing a powerful natural wonder. Next, Morgan's grandson John and his Native American allies find themselves in the Seven Year's War. The final act shows John's granddaughter Amelia as the head of a railroad company making their way west.I won't spoil the particulars of the story here but a common quest and a common enemy unite all three acts. The connections aren't always clear at first, but the associations start to build as the game goes on. Putting the pieces together isn't terribly hard but it gives a nice sense of purpose to the whole game and keeps you invested in the action.While we're talking about the game's story, it's refreshing to see a game that covers this era of warfare without referencing either Napoleon or the American Revolution. While both are fertile ground for strategy game developers, it's nice to get something a little different this time around. Meeting Washington and Bolivar and taking part in the Seven Year's War adds a little authenticity as well as variety. On the other hand, some of the choices -- like finding Russians in Colorado -- may leave gamers scratching their heads in wonder.The range of missions is pretty broad. There are plenty of defense missions where you have to protect a given structure or a whole town from enemy assault. In other cases you'll have to destroy or capture key structures. Along the way there are plenty of other objectives: rescuing captured settlers, seizing trading posts, liberating Native American settlements and a whole host of other tasks. Better still, many missions combine a variety of these objectives at once. While most of the missions let you build a base and start collecting resources, there are some missions where you have to make do with a set number of troops.Outside of the single player campaign, Age of Empires III benefits from a very soild multiplayer interface. A few simple clicks take you to ESO2, Ensemble's online matchmaking service. Finding and joining games is remarkably easy and there are a wide variety of options to choose from. Different starting eras and resource levels will let players jump into as advanced a game as they want. The AI offers up a few taunts from time to time to (sort of) replicate the personality of a human player. It's a nice trick honestly.In general the AI is very strong. You can find some exploits here and there but, for the most part, the AI knows how to make a good army and how to lead it. While the computer opponents in some RTS games send out trickles of units from time to time in order to keep things interesting, the AI in Age of Empires III tends to rely more on groups of units and will hardly ever use them in pointless, suicide attacks. In my games the AI has had a good handle on when to press an attack and when to retreat. The only real weak point in the AI is its tendency to leave some of its settlers too isolated. (Since there are no resource dropsites anymore, it's also hard for human players to keep tabs on where all their settlers are.)The range of technologies and units is relatively broad here. In the early ages, players will have to make do with troops that are very similar to the medieval set from Age of Empires II. Crossbows eventually give way to muskets as the ages pass by. Soon players will be fielding long lines of musketeers and using mortars to bombard enemy towers. While it may seem that some of the unit types are redundant, you'll find that each type has a specific role to play on the battlefield. Like the other Age games you'll have a variety of ranged and melee-focused cavalry and infantry as well as a nice range of artillery units. Identifying the counter units and building a balanced force is just as important as knowing where and when to strike the enemy.Like the rest of the games in the Age series, the naval element is merely there to support the land battles. The handful of ships and maritime technologies don't offer many options. You will find that the naval side of the game is fairly compelling early on while you're dealing with pirates and chasing your enemies across the Atlantic. Once you start fighting in the interior of the American continent, you won't really miss the naval aspect of the game as much.Pathfinding seems to be a bit of a problem here and there. Huge formations can easily find their way through the most densely packed settlements but my one hero unit can't seem to find his way out of the middle of a line of infantry. There are cases where the pathfinding is a little too good. Units are able to predict the best routes through a maze even when large parts of that maze haven't been uncovered yet. This is most telling during missions where you're leading a small force through a series of winding canyons. As long as you click on their eventual destination, they'll make their way through the labyrinth with nary a wrong turn.While we're on the subject, it seems odd that you can't select a single unit out of a group by clicking on their portrait at the bottom of the screen. Trying to grab a specific hero unit out of a large formation should be easier than this. Luckily, there's an option in the game to disregard any non-combat units when you click and drag to select a group. This helps to keep your settlers from marching out with your soldiers.Age of Empires III also introduces some new elements -- home cities, native tribes, trade routes and such. Taken individually none of these are profound innovations but their cumulative effect makes the game feel fresh and strengthens the appeal of the core design. So in total of this review, I recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS Games.			",87,3,0,6,15,4,18

												Following on from the monumental success that was Age of Empires II, this third installment brings the franchise into the light with jaw-droppingly amazing graphics and a style of gameplay that is a dream to play. The attention to detail is astounding, from everything to cracks in a townhouse just about ready to crumble, to the wide range of sound effects ranging from hilarously stereotypical comments from Isabella of Spain to Frederick the Great of Germany, to the sounds of canons such as the Falconets. Even the different environments manage to evoke a sense of belonging, as if one is truly standing in the snow in Siberia, or sweating bullets in Caribbean - not an easy feat for a strategy game to achieve. The fact that no major installment have been released since (Age of Empires IV anyone?) is simply a testament to the replay value and endurance of one of the all-time greatest strategy games released.VERDICT: 10/10			",218,45,16,15,21,0,21

												the game have very nice and pretty Graphics even tho it is a bit old.I find it one of the Best RTS games the only issue it will be boring playing campeigns or skirmish once u reach the skills to beat expert Ai. I can play vs 3 Expert Ai so no point in playing the game in solo mode. and in Online I get high latency due to most players are in usa etc.. so I advice this game for the solo players or who want to play lan with friends.the 2 expansions are not worth the money unless they came in the bundle wich they did for me.the good addition came in game vs old AOE II the fact u can level up and build cards that help u in the game. so it will take time till u reach the cap that will give u so much fun hours to play with			",75,4,0,9,4,0,3

												I would definitely recommend this game !! I had this game on disc copy many years ago , and i have played endless hours all have been fun. There is still a good online community and there is always 500 to 2000 online at anytime so you can always find a game to play. The campaigns are challenging and fun, there are a great varierty of maps to master and a good amount of civs. Even at the full price is still worth it but if you can buy on sale its a no brainer !!The community is still very active and there are community run tournaments with cash prizes. There is lots of youtube and twitch content, plenty of established mods and mods currently under development, new maps, observer UI and scenarios. Its surprising how active this game is considering the age of the game but a true masterpiece stands the test of time.			",7,0,0,0,4,0,6

												I played this game when it came out 10 years ago. The conventional thinking is that Age of Empires II is the ""best,"" but the truth is that Age of Empires III is actually the best.I'll make it simple. Age of Empires III is better because it's newer and it's more of a game and less of a time killer. There is actually a single-player with a real story to the campaign. There are a ton of different units in the game and I haven't even gotten to the DLC yet. This version is more fast-paced and is equally as fun on land as it is on water.There is one issue that isn't major, but it kind of is for me. That is the game hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't allow for steam overlay (shift+tab) and does not contain any achievements. I'm not sure if the game supports 4K either.I am using WIndows 10 with a GTX 970 and i5-4466. There are absolutely no technical hiccups and the game runs very smooth.Overall, great game that surpasses Age of Empires II in every way while looking GREAT for its age. Also, no major bugs or compatibility issues with Windows 10. Needs update to add new steam features like the Shift+Tab overlay and achievements.			",357,47,5,27,19,2,24

												Summary: Age of Empires III offers gamers the next level of realism, with advanced battle physics and unparalleled visual detail. The new game picks up where Age of ""Empires II: Age of Kings"" left off, placing gamers in the position of a European power determined to explore, colonize and conquer the New World. This time period features stunning scenes, from towering European cathedrals to courageous tribes of Native Americans, and spectacular combat with Industrial Age units like rifled infantry, cavalry and tall ships bristling with cannons. Age of Empires III excites strategy gamers with new game-play elements, including the concept of a ""Home City,"" new civilizations, units, technologies and an immersive new single-player campaign that will span three generations. Recommendation: I crucially recommend this game to all Strategic game lovers :)			",38,2,1,9,1,0,1

												One of my favorite games of all time. I am still playing it 10+ years later. The online and pro community is active and my friends and I play this all the time since before steam was a thing. Deep complex rts that demands a lot from you. However if you put in time and effort the game will reward you. I wish more people would play and see how awesome this game is. I wish microsoft would see how much people love this game and make a REAL sequal to it or even a HD remaster. I have to say thank you to the people who worked at ensemble for making this game happen and making my childhood great. 10/10 must buy. If you're interested in rts, history, or strategy even a little bit, you won't want to pass this game up.			",30,4,0,11,7,0,4

												Better than AOE 2 ofcourse :)Play the game for a lil bit, Like it.... This game is a small scale war, unlike C&C Series or Total War Series.Simple RTS game with max population cap to 200. Mid-Age wars with horse, sword, lance, bow, and cannon artillery.Why it's better than AOE 2 :+ Significant graphic improvement+ Significant Improvement in gameplay+ Neutral campaign on maps (defeat the treasure guardians to get bonus for early  level)+ Trading Post available on maps (Neutral area which can be post by ur building for extra content) + U can train 5 units at once per queue, except worker+ Card System. This is used for shipment (shipment is somekind of a free bonus given to u for leveling up in the game)+ Unlockable & Costumizable Shipment (Various bonus that can be used in game)+ Indian Tribes have Warpit, and the other side Western country have Factory The bad thing in AOE 3 : - Towers has a limited build to 7.- Town Center can't be build by workers, instead by Hero / Explorer / WarChief & sent by shipment.- Town Center has build limit- Military units no longer can be garrison into castle or towers- Castle is an exclusive building, can't be build by workers instead by shipment.Well I don't like to play the Asian Dynasties anyway it's imba, just stick with The Warchief expansion.Having fun with this installment,  not the best RTS game on the market, but  'S awright to givin' 2 thumbs up for tis game.About the online multiplayer ? i dunno, never try it, cause  i play it just for single player fun mode only :DScore : 80/100			",339,86,24,35,33,3,64

												AoE 3 is the third installment in the series, offers an intriguing main single player story as various characters search for the fountain of youth. The single player skirmishes, custom made games, and multiplayer is the bread and butter of the game. In single player skirmishes, enemies are further apart, giving your base time to upgrade and build your army to your specifications before attacking enemy camps. You receive experience points when in battle, building, working, etc. Combat is much better than in AoE2, but unless you are playing on harder difficulties, the AI isn't as good as in AoE2.  This time around you  get wars dogs as well as cannons, and other weapons. You can build decks of cards for the shipments to your colony, forge alliances with natives or other allies to take over the new world.  There are a few things in the game that is annoying. 1. You can't put your soldiers in patrolling mode, you have to manually put them where you want them to be. 2. The npcs are dumber than a bag of rocks. Workers will just stand there while being attack instead of fighting back, soldiers will ignore enemies attack them while they are attacking buildings. 3.They have taken out most of the different matches from AoE2 like King of the Hill, Capture the Relic, Wonder Race, Deathmatch (where you start with supplies), and other matches that made AoE2 great making this game a dumb down version of AoE2. It is still a very good game in the series it just lacks depth. The music is okay and the graphics are beautiful I just wish it had more to offer. 8/10. A good strategy game to own.

												Age of Empires series was supposed to be the best series around - as I've read through many and many reviews. Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot. Basically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS. The only downside to this Age of Empires versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 3 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's. If I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me.

Addressing Concers for the GameThis reaches back to memories. I remember playing this game back when I was a kid. It was either my first or second RTS game that I still play even today. There are balancing problems, but I'm not the guy who favors the idea of balancing. However, it is worth noting that there are problems with certain civilations within the game as I spend the majority of my time in the multiplayer.Multiplayer Civilation Problems/Underdogs/My Opinion and ConcernsSome civilations, even through balancing with the popuation and resources, are just underdogs on their economy or just plain tough suckers who are hard to kill. An example of this are the Azetcs and the French. The Azetcs have food eco. power, but they lack in earning gold to pay for required units to counter such others. The French have an elite calvary that my cost alot in food, gold, and population. However, even that balancing doesn't stop them from being massively produced quickly and used effienctly. It becomes a redundant tactic to use in multiplayer games. Other civilations also have such advantages like the Russians using advance formations with seige calvary surrounding a horse archer to form a compact square formation in treaty games. This would generally cause massive economic damages and strategic disappointment for the opposing team. There are more in the game, but these are just a few examples.Unit Combat/Understanding of the UnitsThe game has unit balancing that kills the reality of what would really happen at the time, but I don't blame them for that balancing. An example is that a lightly armored unit can be have resistance to guns and arrows, and the same can be side to heavly armored Chinese units. I'm not saying that all firearms and archaic bows can break through dense armor, but I believe that the game should be updated to the point where things can make some sense and use. This is because that every unit within the game have only one resistance to a certain type of attack. There is the seige, the ranged, and the melee attack. Each has a different use and affect on certain units. There are even other units that can absorb lots of balls from muskeets and still not die. Even when they are lightly armored. I do want to note and point out my understanding that the game is an old RTS from 2005 with a golden RTS combat system, but looking at this just breaks my reality I put in the game.EconomyEach and every map in the game that are offical are designed differently with certain arount of food (animals/berries/treasures), gold (mines/treasures), and wood (trees). In addition, there are certain sites that can improve the players economy, such as trading posts. Do you that everything that is ""natural"" in the map is a consumable.  So, this makes them a nonreliable source of income. To further worsen this, they are all spread out through out the map. This stress the player to try to control the map and protect their gathers from hurrassments, which is what I like. What I don't like is that when the map runs out of trees, I have to rely on trading at the market. The market is a building that is used to upgrade your gathers to increase gathering rate. In the game, upgrades will generally consume two of the resources (food,wood, or gold) to perform upgrade for combat unit, gathering, minor improvements, and etc. Now, the problem with every map in the game is when the trees are all gone. Wood is esstential for constructing buildings and certain units. When wood is gone, this causes the player to rely on the markets or vulgar production from factions, trading post, and wood producing units. They don't produce a decent needed amount that is need for the battle. This makes pikemen and longbows useless; one of the few units that can counter French calvary are upgraded pikemen. Some civilations don't need to worry about wood income like Japan. Their shrines can generate a lot when upgraded and max. However, for them to generate more they need animals. In standard games, Japan is a faction that you might not want in your team due the fact that some players will generally take animals you use as food for their purposes. When that happens, you can't kill the animal for food. They are protected by the shrine from being killable or taken. This leads to another topic about popuation that I'll explain about later; Japan has a small limit of the amount of villagers that can produce. Back to topic, this causes Japan to become dependent on animals and other players to produce domesticated animals for them. Even more...Home cities are cities that provide aid to the player in the game. They do so by shipping passive upgrades that are unique to certain civilations, standard upgrades, consumbles, units, buildings, or ships for the cost of points(levels). Points are earned by reaching a ceratin xp (level (> or = to) xp). Xp is earned naturally, produced, or in bountry of a unit's death. Not all civilations can have passive upgrades to improve their economy to a decent or dramatic advantage. Take a look at the Aztecs. They can bloom their food production so well, but lacking in gold production to train certain units. To make this even worse for them, they can't have access to resource production type buildings or enchance to gathering like the Indians. Same can be said about all Native American civilations, and their firepits can screw up their uses of villagers in desprite times.PopulationMost Civilations have a popuation limit. This is a balance to pervent overwhelming quanity of units that we are all not interesting in coming at use. However, the there are limits in the amount of units each civilations have train. Most civilations can train upto 99 villagers/settlers/gathers (the three are interchangable). However, those who gets a benefits on their economy has a reduction to the amount of villagers they can have. This is a balance to pervent massive generation of income for a civilation. Do know that there are ways to lose a game. One of them is lose all your gathers, your town center, and your hero. So, those with lower villager counts are in a risk if they aren't protected. What I like:Decent Amount of CivilationsDecent Amount of UnitsAdvance Formations OptionsGood Options/Setting for a 2005 GameA Stable Way of IncomeMap Control is KeyUnit Combat is OkayVillager Gathering is OkayCivilations are uniqueWhat I want... Updates maybe and less redundant actions in the game? If you guys have any concerns about stuff you want me to address I'll add them below here. Questions about game mechanics will be answered in the comments. Anything that is etc. will also be answered in the comments. If there are grammar mistakes or something you want me to take another look back in the review please also note them in the comments ,too.  Pros Cons   Adds Asian Factions Underdog Factions   Okay Balancing ♥♥♥♥ed up Balancing   Lots of Units to Choose From Hard to Kill Units That Ruins Match Kill Results   Shift to Count for Five in Hundreds or Ones Digits Hotkeys are Poorly Designed ",26,4,0,5,9,0,13

												Age of Empires III, is by far my most favorite RTS game of all time. It is a well balanced masterpiece with plenty to do that will keep you busy for hours. Well balanced as in, it has that mixture to where it isn't too militaristic. You spend a lot of time improving your economy. Between building your Empire, leveling and customizing your home city, and developing new technologies, you'll be hard crossed to go to bed at a decent time. It has multiplayer, thirty or so maps, a scenario editior, and twelve unique nations ranging from the powerful British Empire to the traditional Japanese. This game is beautiful, even on my potato battery laptop. I've been in love with this game since 2005. I lost my retail copy so i was thrilled when it was added to the Steam Store. MANY more people should know about this game. It has tons of depth, and is one of the few games from Microsoft i love. Do yourself a favor, and buy this game! It is most certainly worth the hefty price tag!			",101,29,1,10,9,2,16

												*Note: I have very little time played on my Steam version of this game, but have played around 80 - 100 hours on the disc version.*Age of Empires III incorporates an awesome New England settings rendered in amazing graphics. The combat is more intense, more diverse, and much more realistic than that of the original two Age of Empires games, which were already great. The interface has been updated and greatly improved (only three resources allow for a smoother process of building and running your civilation). The game has many great new features, including:-use of a ""home city"", a city you customize and level up through battle, that serves as your main menu and gives rewards-ability to train troops in groups of five, instead of individually-random capturable treasures scattered around the map that give unique bonuses-more realistic battle (soldiers burn buildings instead of hit them, cannonballs knock down trees, ships sink, etc)-awesome revamped naval combat. Limited fleet size allow more tactical fighting strategies-unit special abilities. these vary greatly, providing a single powerful shot, treasure gaurdian taming, stealth, etc.-ability to build trade posts to ally with native americans, providing unique/powerful upgrades and native units-use of limited and highly-profitable trade posts along a railroad, which are visciously fought over-unique use of ability cards, picked outside of battle, and used during game for special advantages-highly diverse wild animals to fight, hunt, and tame. Tamable ones includes wolves, coyotes, bears, cougars, and more.-interesting and useful incorporation of time-period features, including minute-men, trains, native allies, and more.-addition of artillery units (various cannons) that add a unique element to combat-(with Asian Dynasties expansion) ability to play as one of three native American tribes (Sioux, Aztec, and one other)Things I do not like about this game:-population size still limited to 200 units-artillery is a bit overpowered (specifically anti-infantry artillery, though it is more realistic that way)In short, if you are a fan of the original two AoE games, love historical time period-set war games, like strategy combat, or just want to have some great fun on an amazingly underrated and easy-to-learn game, buy Age of Empires III now. And while you're at it, the expansions are great and well worth the money.9.5/10 - Highly, highly recommended.			",56,2,0,5,8,0,3

												After the critically-acclaimed Age of Empires 2 was released and the expansion of Conquerors was extremely well received, Age of Empires III was bound to happen. And it did in 2009. Moving away from the Conquistador era, AoE III takes places around the 1700's when Settlers began to populate the American continent. For starters, the graphics changed from the sprites used in AoE II to a tridimensionally rendered objects in AoE III and that made it extremely unpopular for some, as the hardware necessities the software needed were not average. But all in all, the graphical performance of AoE III was extremely well done and on par with other RTS games of the era. Unfortunately, the RTS gaming era was about to end, with AoE III marking a significant decrease in interest the gamers had in this type of games. What was it? One wonders. The gameplay was extremely similar, and yet the charm AoE II had was somehow missing. The AI was not extremely hard and the games had all kinds of countries to be chosen from. The expansions made AoE III a bit better, with the return of ancient civilizations being an option just like in the Conquerors expansion. Unfortunately this made a small impact to the decreasing interest in this RTS. However, it still is a fun game to play. In 2017 it is a game that doesn't require extreme processing power and it is graphically pretty. The investment is well done nowadays. If you feel a little nostalgic and want to play one of the last RTS games of the era,Buy it, play it and don't regret it.8.5/10			",49,2,0,2,4,0,9

												The game that reassigned the life goals of thousands of angry real-time strategy nerds who relentlessly blasted death metal out of their sterephones while molesting the taunt buttons when it first came back - is still alive and well. That is, perhaps not so much as when it first premiered, but AoE 3 still attracts a considerable amount of gamers which is impressive given how the strategy gaming industry was completely dwarfed with upsurge of other games is latter years. There's not much of a gripe you can hold against this now-classic: the texture and gameplay is focused and realistic, in startling contrast to the puerile graphics of the prequel (although I won't hold back that Age 2 also rocked) as well as the addition of the home city, which granted a completely new dynamic to the game. As is the problem with most strategy games, the inherently incoherent AI (some kind of stratagem devised by evil game planners to render games inconsistent and all puddy) is a bit problematic, but it's still something that can be coped with. The Online could definitely use some revitalizations, though. Yeah, everyone knows Ensemble Studios called it quits years ago, but still... can't someone do something to add some color to the online community and gameplay? The lack of updates is unnerving.However, AoE retains its place as one of the best RTS games, ever. Even the two expansion packs kicked♥♥♥♥♥ Asian Dynasties in particular added an exotic and 'colonial' palette to the game that made it even more memorable for me. The addition of three new factions (China, India, Japan) certainly made the game the well-nigh perfect, multinational, multi-tactical strategy delight. So without further ado, here's what you would expect from AoE 3:1)Strategy rampage.2)Fast-as♥♥♥♥♥♥cavalry running down your hapless peasants.3)Slow-as-dirt peasants 'collecting' resources.4)No corpses.5)Finding a mother♥♥♥♥ing enemy base near your town center just because you didn't have a proper sight.6)Wreckage.7)Learning the basic words for most languages.8)General ♥♥♥♥ed-upedness on the battlefield when your batallion of musketeers get creamed by a few cannons.9)Magical unicorn-horses attached to artillery that appear whenever the artillery piece has to be carried and disappear when you start shootin'.10)Free geography, history and zoology lessons.11)Free philosophy lessons from Monks or other atavistic religious dudes whom you'll name after your ex-girlfriend's pet iguana - who can literally outwit their opponents by a having a thick-as-♥♥♥♥ smoke (did they even have that stuff in China back then?) .12)Flying numbers.13)Paying attention to the meticulous numerical details of every unit until you realize that your horde of 100 pikemen can be ♥♥♥♥ed by a pack of rockets.14)Epic flanking action.15)Facing stubborn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wouldn't give in even after you've destroyed their town centers.16)Taunts! (number 15 in particular)17)Witnessing the beauty of a New England forest until ramming it down with a barrage of mortars.18)Imperialism. Exploitation.19)Where every Wall Street magnate begins: the 100 wood market.20)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing peasants getting stuck in between the buildings that they built.21)Tresures guarded by wolves, dogs, jaguars and other animals who pack a serious punch.22) Treasures that can be literally collected by empty ships (because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why) .23)Literally immortal colony explorers who yell like 9-year-old ♥♥♥♥♥es when they 'die' and start clutching their stomachs in agony as if they're on their period.24)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing population limits.25)Villagers that sigh for unexplained reasons whenever they spawn.26)Realizing that the narrator from the tutorial is the same guy as Arkantos fron Age of Mythology!And so forth. It's a fun ride. You'll learn along the way.So yeah, go buy the game. It's not like you've anything better to do.			",6,0,0,0,1,0,2

It is fun to play, and very exiting. the online has not the highest  ammont of players, and that is too bad cause it ofen take some time to make a match. but the game is so good that it is worth buying. and it has a great campain too. If you like strategy games this is a game for you.			",143,34,11,11,22,3,23

												I've been playing this game A lot before it came on steam so don't judge the review based on the number of hours.Anyways, age of empires 3.... its just fantasticI grew up playing age of empires games, from the first one up to this one, and each one was just so much fun, including this one...Now It's not the most nostalgic experience, but it does bring me back to those days where RTS was amazing... everything about it feels good, the mechanics, the gameplay, it all feels nice compared to other RTS's ive played..One thing that pisses me off is that you keep getting free villagers, and i don't really know (ironically enough) if i can turn that off or not, another thing is that sometimes i feel that resources run out way too quickly, or maybe i just suck at resource management..I have yet to go through multiplayer (im not highly interested in it, i mostly play skirmish since im a loner), so i don't really have much of an opinion on it..The graphics are good, i mean for a game this old i don't expect crysis llke graphics, and i feel that the graphics suit the game pretty well.In the end, this game is just fun, there are some bugs, but i barely really notice them, if you want a GOOD RTS, this game is for you, hey, it's AoE, nothing can go wrong there.EDIT: Some of the music in this game is really nice, by the way			",152,13,4,11,25,1,14

												Whether you are a fast paced strategist or a laid back gamer, Age of Empires might be the game for you. Personally, I can't keep up with the many skilled players in the online PvP part of the game, however, I enjoy the more personal single player skirmishes that AoE has to offer. That is not say that the community is terrible, because it is just exactly the opposite. When I first was trying to learn the hotkeys and tips and tricks of the experts, there were many players willing to take their time and guide me when I needed guidance. As you may have seen from the trailers and videos of this game, there is much fun to be had. The beauty of being able to conquer another empire is a victory in and of itself. It is a great game to come home to and just unwind from the stresses of the day. The campaign mode can be quite easy, so I recommend trying to challenge yourself and set the difficulty a bit higher than you normally would. The AI in the game can be slow and unchallenging should you choose the normal or easy settings. Also, the story is very cinematic so try to watch the video bits if that's your thing.Overall, I highly recommend this game. It is great for all ages of players.			",7,0,0,5,1,0,0

												A fair sucessor to AoE2 it takes gameplay to a 3D level but keeps the Age of Empires charm. It adds new features like a hero and hunting which add different stratagies to the game. In my opinion the gameplay is quite different to the second AoE which is misleading. Still this game pushes new limits for it's time and retains the live action charm of its previous version.

												  Having started my AoE experience with Age of Empires II back when it came out, I started playing this game with a high level of Skepticism. At first I didn't even really like it, it felt awkward to me, and perhaps I was a bit biased since I favor AoE2 (and still do). In fact I even stopped playing this altogether for several months. But I finally came back to it with an open mind, and ya know what... after completing the first campaign... it grew on me a little and started to win me over. It's not as great as its predecessor. But still quite fun and deserves its own place in your gaming library!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Age of Empires 3 is my favorite game. Yes, that places it infront of other video game giants, including Arma, Warband, Civilization, and perhaps more appropriately, Age of Empires 2.It's not the graphics... it's definately not the graphics. They're not bad per se, in fact they are sometimes beautiful, but compared to the standard rts of today, they probably rank 4 or 5 out of 10.AoE 3 is my favorite game because it's *fun*. Over the last decade or so, I've loved and then grown tired of dozens of games, Fallout 4 being the most recent victim. Age 3, however, is always fun. AI provides a challenge, the community is still amazingly friendly and going strong, there are tournaments where you can win cash prizes, plenty of mods, and a quite large amount of diverse factions. When you drop yourself into a game, both single and multiplayer, it's an engaging experience every time. Honestly, I can't even find the words to explain why it's always so fun, it just is. Perhaps it's the historical care given to each unit, or maybe the ridiculous cheats and snarky comments of the AI, I don't know. If I said every game was completely unique, I'd be lying; but that's not a problem, because Age 3 does what works.I usually don't like writing reviews, especially ones over 9 words, but this game deserves at least a little bit of support from me. It's the least I can do for the most captivating game on the steam market.			",73,4,1,7,17,0,15

												Best vidya game evuh. Pleyed dis sht for 12 hours str8 and didn't even go take a sht throughout the whole time (thanks shtbucket). 11/10 IGN real♥♥♥♥♥♥♥good. Old farts say the second one of the series was bettuh but they just crank as fuc. Got it when it was 8 smackaroos and lemme tell you they were well spent. Me and my bubs played this on multiplayer too and it was as fun as taking a sht in the n-th dimension while going at the speed of light. I mean like I was playing the Ottoman's and I had these big as fuc cannons that just blew everything up. Liek Yall dont even know fun until you blow the fuc out of some dumbass peasants working on a farm. It was liek BOOM and then BOOM and BAM and it was all fun until some sht asss enemy cannon started blowing up my factories that were making them. But other than that it was hella fun. The single player is real cool too with the campaign and sht. I mean this game is even kinda historically accurate so its some educational sht too. So if yall have kids, get em this game and theyll learn their sht cuz this is like studying history but doing it in a funner way where you can just kill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. But seriously doe dog, this game is da sht. Highly recommended sht here bubs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun variation on the age of empires formula, many features are ""streamlined"" and aoe-lovers might turn their nose on that.For example the workers don't have to make the trip back with the resources, this completely removes the skill involved (where once you had to properly place a gathering building, abuse sweetspots and manage workers, here you just tell the workers to gather X resource until it runs out) but allows for the game to run a lot faster.Many changes in aoe3 are like that, a gameplay feature is changed or removed completely so that the matches last less.But it's not just a ""simpler age of empires set in colonial times"", it adds 2 features that distinguish it from the ancestor and cousins completely: hereos and shipments.Age of empires doesn't have ""important"" units, everything is sacrificable as long as you spent less compared to the enemy's losses worth. Because of this the idea of a powerful RPG-like ""hero"" unit is not only heretical it's illogical and goes against the concept itself, does it work in aoe3?It doesn't and it does.It's not really an actual hero, it's an explorer unit that you can use for scouting or for clearing ""creep camps"" that give you a bit (or a lot, if the camp is big) of resources that you can use to strengthen your army, or build buildings. Other than clearing ""monsters"" the hero can build trading posts, these can be used to connect to neutral camps that give you a (weak) unit to train and (sometimes good) improvements for your economy, or travel routes which give you experience and this connects us to the next part the ""trading cards"" system:The experience points you gain through certain buildings don't go to your hero or any unit in your army, but instead allow you to receive ""shipments"" from the mainland. Meaning you can get moscow/amsterdam/istanbul (or whatever your home city is) to send you a shipment of resources, extra villagers, buildings, improvements, entire armies to help you fight.Aoe2 (and aoe) while fun in its own way, suffered from its length, only at 10 minutes you get to age up, aoe3 uses the above to ""fix"" that, with enough skill, by 10 minutes you might hit the last age.Not everybody can get there, but it's possible.Other than the several races, the shipment system can be edited allowing for a deeply personalized ""deck"" and gameplay style, takes a while to get used to, but the standard deck isn't painful to play with either.The servers work, and people still play, there's a consistent community that still gets to hone their skills.do you recommend this game?Not for 30 dollars, but the game goes on sale pretty regularely, get it then, it's well worth it if you want a faster  (but by no means simpler) age of empires title.

												Good graphics game, fair Age of Empire II successor, but i feel more enjoyment while playing AoE II. The UI of AoE II is far better, not so robust, showing more things at once. This game is a bit simplified although it was not needed, because AoE was easy to understand game always.Well, not so good as AoE II, but still good to play game. A bit overpriced for an old game - 37€. If you don't have any AoE game, I recommend to get AoE II first for 20€.			",733,158,61,90,308,8,201

												I am a big fan of the AOE series, and history. This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as apose to a musketeer taking up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the America's and even the Asian Maps. What I love most though is the story based campaigns, I have finished the Asian one's which I find very addicting, but the way the whole plot goes together makes it so intresting, the characters always serve a unique purpose on the battlefeild, + they are well designed.My favourte part in my Japanese campaign, was when I sent a group of Ninjas into the enemy base using stealth mode, to assassinate the leading daimyo, Immedialty after his death, a rebellion started and I gained control of most of the map. :P +1 BodygaurdsBoromir approves 9.5/10			",37,1,0,6,7,0,21

												This is the 4th, and hopefully the last, time I have bought AOE3. A brilliant game with a still very alive online community for the stand alone game.Solid story line and can be as difficult as you want it to be. As far as im concerned the whole game is a 8/10. I didn't give this a 10 because I know this is the last in the series and the graphics are starting to show their age. However I could put both these factors aside and give it a 10 if it wasnt for the lack of updates. Also adding no rush as a game type would of helped my review.Overall do buy, it's been nearly 10 years since I bought this game and i'm still playing it and will continue to if the online stays strong.

It is time of colonial exspanion of America. You can chosse between serveral nations and with the exspansion packs that is included, you get even more to chosse from. Every nation have its strength and weakness and very diffrent playstyles.If you like classic base building, and an era of muskets and exsploration, this is a perfect game to get.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic Real-Time Strategy set in during the colonisation of the Americas. Play as several European empires, the Dutch, German, French, British, Spanish etc. in multiplayer battles consisting of constructing a base, forming an economy, training an army and pillaging your enemies. Game modes range from FFA, TDM, King of the Hill, Treaty, Supremacy or Deathmatch and custom scenarios. Single-player campaign serves as great starting point for novices of the series to learn how to play before making the leap into multiplayer. Great for LAN parties.			",11,3,0,5,11,0,3

												I've probably played about 10 matches online. I'm late to the game and it's kinda hard for new players to get into lobbies with experienced players due to a level difference. I was kicked from lobby many times for being low level. Gameplay is terrific. I only experienced a lag issue once - all 8 players couldn'y move and units for about 45 seconds at the start of the game and then everything was fine after.			",4,0,0,0,1,0,1

Pointless nostalgic introBack in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.Then, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.Actual review and ratingI rate the whole expanded game 8/10*. If I were you I would wonder what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10? The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:-Lack of deep european theatreWhich subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):-European maps and respective natives (local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)-European conflicts within Europe (like the Napoleonic Wars)-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on-European ""minor"" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured (e.g. the thirty years' war?)-I could go on for ages*I rate the vanilla 7/10, and Asian Dynasties 9/10. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with (post-colonisation) north and mesoamerican civilisations.Many by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because ""muh europe"", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.Anyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all. In case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the Napoleonic Era mod[www.ne.elpea.net]. It adds some 5/6 factions and a bunch of units, maps, etc. It also has a small online community.			",53,2,0,13,12,0,18

												Haven't played it in years. Got this one and age of empires 2. Its a must buy on steam regardless if you play it or not. We need a new age of empires four, or maybe age of empires 2, but with 100 times the map size.  You can make women do whatever you feel like. Your villagers are your slaves.  You can gather them up and throw them at the enemy as a distraction while your main force attacks your enemie castle line. Or charge with you main force and distract their army while you send a hundred villagers to swarm and destroy everything in their town square. DOn't think just do it.

												Essential for RTS fans. AOE leans more towards offense and military developement more than maintaining a population and defending your city -- that is, if you want to progress. All kinds of strategies can be used, and I personally prefer the ""attack with one enormous army"" to devestate the enemy in a single blow. However, you can't select over a certain amount (50+?) of troops though - WHY?			",568,181,24,59,69,7,108

Using an innovative card system, Age III lets you build a deck of cards that you can use during game to give your fledgling empire a small advantage wether it be a squadron of troops or boxes of resources.

												Bad Points :1. Compared to its predecessors (including Age of Mythology), the campaign is just downright disappointing.2. Gunpowder units are unrealistically weak, samurai's and dopplesoldners can slice through musketeers with ease.3. Ships overlapping with each other : looks unfinished.4. Can't customise home cities in expansions.5. Skirmish does not allow multiple players with the same civilization.Good Points:I spent 100+ hours on scenario editor. LOLZ!!!

												This is the best Age of Empires game and one of the best strategy games of all time. Ships are big and beefy, cannons are cannons that do huge damage and splash and each civilization is unique. In AoE 2, you have crossbowmen shooting arrows at stone walls, battering rams hitting farm fields and making them burn, and swordsmen using their swords to beat down structures. In AoE 3, units have their own siege attacks and animations which fix that problem. Every civ's Church or religious building is a different model. Every civ has their own unique units and tech trees.The Explorer is your colony's leader and sort of a hero-like unit from Warcraft 3. You get to explore the map, fight neutrals and claim treasures during the start of the game, which makes games less repetitve and more fun in the beginning.The Home City part of the game is awesome. You can send shipments or technologies from your mother country to your colony. Every civ has a ton of different strategies.Each map is different enough. Most maps have Native people and settlements that you can trade with or ally. Your mother country will give you additional support on some maps, like early shipments or free economic starting buildings. There are also trade routes that you can establish.The game has good balance, almost rock-paper-scissors, with various types of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Also, farms and plantations do not need to be 'queued' like in AoE 2, fixing any annoyance from that game.In conclusion, AoE 3 is the most improved and well made Age of Empires yet. Every civilization is unique and all the annoying or bad features from the previous Age of Empires series games have been fixed. Each time you play will be different and every civ has different strategies. The maps are all different. My favorite part of the game is the sound of distant artillery, which echoes far! This is a great game and I am glad it is on steam, now it will continue to be supported!			",5,0,0,0,2,0,2

												One of my favourite childhood games. Age Of Empires III is an fantastic game even for one of the older games, it's definetely one of the best older games you'll find here on Steam!Select between many countries and defend your home city/colony in skirmish mode, play online multiplayer with up to 8 players! Create a home city and level up to customize it! Make cities, forts, and train soldiers and war ships to defend your base with over 35 new maps to try out and explore! Create your own heroic explorer for your country and use him/her in skirmish mode!Play the exciting 3 original campaigns stories with 2 new campaign stories to enjoy with the DLCS installed!There is loads to do in this game and it just never get's old, always loved playing this game. One of my all time favourite!In-game music is great and the graphics are pretty good and you can create your own levels/maps with the scenario editor! Have fun using brand new hilarious cheat console commands lol :-DClassic World war game, much fun and is absolutely fantastic! Best age of empires game by a long shot!This is a must have game for your steam library!This is a really great game this but I would most like to see an James Cameron Avatar, the Hobbit, and an How to train your dragon age of empires game as well, be even cooler :-D10/10Game Rating: PG (Mild Violence)Catagory: Adventure, Strategy			",7,2,1,2,4,0,0

												One of the best new features in AoEIII is unfortunately also the one that keeps me from enjoying it as much as I have enjoyed other games in the series. The introduction of the Home City was a pretty radical departure for the series, introducing persistent leveling to your favorite civilizations, with immediate and powerful gameplay modifications tailored by you to enhance and compliment your playstyle. On the one hand, this feature works great and is very enjoyable, as you pick and choose 'cards' before going into each match, which might upgrade your units, or your production, or they might give you free units, or unlock abilities. On the other hand, you'll quickly realize that each civilization has its own Home City and you have to play each and every one of them for dozens of matches if you want to competitively play all of them. If you have one or two favorite civs that you'll be playing all the time then that's no problem; you can focus on your favorites and be happy as a clam. If you enjoy playing them all though, and are a fan of the Random Civ option from previous games, then the removal of that feature and the introduction of persistence may irritate you.Other than that, all I'd have to say is that this is a great RTS, with good campaigns, good civilization variety, artwork, music, sound design, gameplay, and scenario editor. Highly recommended.			",298,109,3,56,31,4,52

Gunpowder units are unrealistically weak, samurai's and dopplesoldners can slice through musketeers with ease.3. Ships overlapping with each other : looks unfinished.4. Can't customise home cities in expansions.5. Skirmish does not allow multiple players with the same civilization.Good Points:I spent 100+ hours on scenario editor. LOLZ!!! Score : 7/10 ",55,2,0,10,5,0,1

												Love this game and the expansions, but wait for the sales. $40.00 for a game that came out in 2009 is too expensive. It doesn't have as many races at AoE2 even with expansions, so that doesn't really justify it. Definitely buy on sale if you like RTS.			",85,8,6,10,15,0,5

												One of my all time favorite strategy game. Unfortunatly it doesnt have a huge player base any more so its tough for new players to gain experiance without being attack or double crossed by a teamate. All is fair in love and war!			",0,0,0,2,8,0,6

												It's a fantastic experience  how you never stop learning new things about this mysterious explorer lost in the new world..The way you feel when you start the game for the first time, and you have to build those silly towncenters and you have no clue of what they do.How scared you are at first raid, when the enemy trashtalks to you for the first time.When you figure out which keys do what, and why.How you get to feel when you figure out how to play.When you figure out what goes where and why, and why it shouldn't go somewhere else.When you figure out how to play your favorite civilization, you feel surreal...The sadness that fills you, as your first  settler (that you became so attached to) slowly dies , and you cannot do anything becouse the enemy is in the Imperial Age already..When you have to make a new one..When you figure out that you are lost, you hit the resign button..When you achieve defeat... you feel like you are worthless..But then.. you realize you have to do it again..And the old feelings become new.

												An awesome game.Pros:- It has a shallow learning curve making it very easy for anyone to play.- A large selection of units allows you to build a very customisable & efficient army.- Stunning visuals even for a game that came out years ago.- Wide variety of units, unit types and upgrades - AOE3 allows users to participate in naval battles as well as land.- You can build items such as huge upgradable walls and towers to give your city that 'Empire' feel.- Mulitplayer is still alive and kickingCons:- For a game that came out in 2009, the price tag is high. I'd wait till it's on sale.- AI can be a bit tedious- In multiplayer, players are free to leave mid-game without repecussions.- Lag and frame drop become evident during large muliplayer battles as players can have 200 units each (thats a lot in a 8 player game)Neutral:- Multiplayer games can last a long time ranging from a 20 minute game to a 3hr game.- Hosts tend to choose bias teams during matchmaking.- Single player is a little too easyOverall, an 8.5. I recommend this game purely for the multiplayer aspect. It's just a shame Esemble studios, the developer, was cut loose from Microsoft.			",79,4,6,4,4,0,7

												Wow what can I say. This game is the pure best you can get when it comes to RTS games. I mean not just this one. Hell, even the very first Age of Empires from 1997 is a pure materpiece. And the following games in the generation don't fail to impress either. Age of Empires 3 is not only one of my favorite Strategy games of all time, it should be somewhere on your list too. This game brings endless hours of gameplay in singleplayer. Don't like playing by yourself? A03 has a pretty decent-sized community so you can play head-to-head with other players just like you. Got 40 bucks laying atound? Want to play an amazing RTS game? This game can fix both problems.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not, exactly greater then AOE 2 HD but, Its really close. My favorite part about games like these is the long games and RTS. I'm really fast when it comes to moving around soldiers so it comes in handy to be playing a RTS game instead of a turn-based game such as sid meiers civilization.<3 This game.

												This game.... THIS GAME!This game is phenomenal! The RTS genre wasn't my favorite type of game (I didn't even want anyrthing to do with it before) but when my friend recommended this game to me I decided to try it out. And, surprise surprise, I love it! I haven't even touched the scenarios yet and I'm having a blast with this game! This is an amazing game to play with friends and maybe alone if you're just wanting to chill and listen to music or a podcast to.The strength of this game is the jump from AoE II's graphics and gameplay. Now, I'm not one to base a game on it's looks because I love AoE II and Rise of Nations as well, but the graphical change give this game a refreshing look to it when you play. But gameplay from AoE II hasn't change a whole lot but has changed a little. The only difference is that A.) You can't build mines next to a silver or gold ore vein, and B.) You can't build a wood mill next to a forest that you're gathering wood from. Now I like that it is a faster and cheeper process to gather wood and gold fast but wood can be scarce at times and the fact that you cannot upgrade your wood gathering speed until the V age kinda bothered me at first, but then I messed around with my 'deck' in the game and by god:THE DECK FEATURE IS AMAZING!The Deck is practically bonus cards that you can use to help benefit you in certain points of the game and can be used either once or infinently and are spread across different era's in the game, for example; The faster wood gathering perk card can be used once and can (possibly) be obtained in the I era, but the faster gold gathering perk may possibly be obtainable in the II era. But for the closing of the AoE III review I have to say this: this game is by far my favorite RTS on the market right now! I was skeptical about it at first, but I'm glad I bought it! I recommend to everybody! This game from me gets a 9/10! Enjoy! :D			",125,15,0,21,6,0,5

												AoE 3, the nostalgia.Third in the AoE series. This game offers a different gameplay style as compared to I and II. The possibility to have home shipments (which in part is predicated on the colonial era settlement) which could to a large extent alter the dynamics of a standard game, can make games very interesting.The usual strategies and min-maxing continues, as are build orders, resource management, positioning and all the other micro and macro management skills are still present.Players new to the game, coming from AoE 1 and/or 2 should be warned that it has a generally different graphical style and generally fosters a more dynamic and fastpaced playstyle.

												I got this game with a 66% off the games price coupon and the price lowered to 12.58 euro. This was one of the best coupons I've ever received! This is my second favourite strategy game the first is AoE II HD Edition because it's without guns and it's a bit better in my opinion while playing. So AoE III has better graphics and audio than II but not only that the graphics are better but they extremely beautiful. The gameplay is good the missions are neither too easy or too hard i started playing on medium difficulty and its not that hard at the moment. There are added a lot more features to this game like you have levels and you can upgrade your home town + you can receive in-game bonuses to help you defeat your foes. I really recommend this game to all people who like strategy games though it would be better to get it on sale because it's really expensive. Rated 10/10!			",74,13,3,3,6,0,5

												With the great pedigree of Age of Empires (the father of RTS games), it can be argued that AoE3 is the weakest of the lot, but that shouldn't take away from the fact that it is still a solid RTS with good mechanics and the prettiest graphics of the series.The campaign is alright, but nothing to write home about, but that's okay, as the main focus is gameplay.The expansions make this game interesting and worthwhile to check out.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7.5/10Story: 4/10Overall: 7/10Conclusion - a solid RTS game, great for LAN parties.

												Simply the best RTS right now. What I like about it:- eco and micro managing the fights are both important- there are loads of viable strategies- there is more than 1 resource (!!!) wich makes managing economy more demanding- the historical setup with the unit types artillery, cavallery, infantery makes it easier to understand strength and weaknesses of each unit. For instance, it makes totally sense that artillery beats hand infantery, whereas I cannot figure out that easy why one alien is better than another alien in a futuristic or fantasy RTS.

Besides the massive warships, there's nothing that really stomps all over your opponent-Small pool of active online players, so the quickplay option doesn't really work-Expert AI needs to be made less predictable			",47,4,0,6,8,0,8

												10/10 would age again...Best game ever, like honestly I love this game. This game stresses your multitasking and reaction to your opponents strategy. All while doing your own. Would certainly recommend you get this game. Easy to play, nearly impossible to master. Also AI is very good and considering how old this game is the graphics are what you would expect from a new game if you crank the resolution very high and max everything out. You need a fairly powerful PC to do so but the bright side is you can play on a fairly underpowered computer if you are not gaming on your main rig. 10/10 would age again.			",23,1,0,1,3,0,1

Also it has a decent fictional story which spans a few hundred years.My advice: while I recommend this to someone who just loves RST and plays every single one they can get thier hands on, this will be a treat. There are definately better ones however.A few to consider are: Age Of MythologyAge Of Empires IIStarCraftStarwars: Empire at WarEnjoy,			",310,55,10,46,33,3,47

Age of Empires 3 Complete Collection ReviewAge of Empires 3 Complete Collection is a nice bundle for RTS fans that offers many hours of gameplay. I have been a fan of this series from its beginning. In fact, Age of Empires (the original) was my first PC gaming experience ever and a big reason why I switched from console to PC. If you enjoy this game then I recommend picking up Age of Empires 2 HD and Age of Empres Gold as well. Now, let's get on with the review.Age of Empires 3 is a lot different than its predecessors. Aside from improvements on graphics, it introduces several new features to the series. Home cities are a huge addition to the game. Players get to tinker around and spend upgrade points on their Home Cities to change the appearance of the buildings and environment, but more importantly, during each mission map you are able to receive a variety of shipments (resources, settlers, army troops) from them that help you achieve your goals. These shipments are selected from another new feature, a deck of cards. Players can build custom decks of cards that are somewhat unique to the civilization they are playing as they gain experience from missions played. The shipments you receive from your Home City are based on the deck the player chooses to use prior to beginning each new map.Another new feature is the addition of hero-type units based on the chosen civilization that regenerate health and can perform special abilities. A few new buildings have been added to enhance gameplay in a variety of ways: the fort, the factory, the capitol, and the plantation.  Maps now contain a few new features as well. Players will find treasure locations scattered across each map that can give a variety of rewards. Also, maps now contain ""trading routes"" that enable players to gain additional experience (used for receiving shipments from Home Cities) or resources once building a trading post along the route in designated areas. The new features added into Age of Empires 3 are integrated extremely well. They enhance overall gameplay and are not just thrown in hastily just to add something different. The bundle contains the base game, the Asian Dynasties expansion, and The War Chiefs expansion. Each of these contain lengthy campaigns to keep players entertained for hours. There is also a new multiplayer feature that players have been wanting for a long time (they even added multiplayer to AoE2). Overall, this game is really great. It plays smoothly on most all systems and is virtually bug-free as it should be since its been on the market for a long time.As with any game, there are some setbacks though. Firstly, it is way too expensive for a game this old. There is a lot of game content included in the bundle but its still not worth paying full price in the Steam store. It doesn't go on sale often but I recommend waiting till it does or else find a 66% off coupon for it. Secondly, players who have previously played other AoE games will find that the maps are much smaller and cramped up compared to the oher franchise releases. To compensate for this, the developers decided to include hefty population costs for various troops. This means that the days of having a huge army to overwhelm your opponent is a thing of the past. The city-building aspect has also been dummied down to the basics which will take some of the enjoyment out of the game for a few. Resources collected by settlers now go straight into the stockpile instead of needing to be deposited at resource collecting points, which takes some of the realism away from the game. Research is still included in the game but is not as intriguing as in the original games. Most notably, there isn't much diversity in the civilizations offered. The troops and research options seem to be the same regardless of which civilization is chosen. The map editor tool feature used to create custom maps and campaigns is no longer included so don't expect a lot of new player-made content to add even more life to the game. And lastly, only two types of smirmishes are available compared to the four types in the previous versions.The Good:========+  3D graphics with rich detail+  Smooth gameplay and controls+  Offered in a bundle+  Quality DLC content+  Great storyline and 3 full campigns+  Numerous new features to enhance gameplay+  High replay value+  Numerous patches to fix bugs from initial release+  Multiplayer online play availableThe Bad:======-  Extremely over-priced for a dated game-  Small player maps-  Limited Skirmish Options-  Simple tech tree-  Civilizations lack true diversity-  Its not Age of Empires 2Final Thoughts:===========Overall, Age of Empires 3 is a fun game that will keep players busy for numerous hours and I recommend it to all RTS game lovers as long as you can pick it up on sale. However, don't load it up and expect it to be anything close to  the other Ensemble Studios titles. In general, the game feels generic and simplistic compared to other games such as Age of Empires 2 or Age of Mythology. Instead, it offers a different style of play due to the numerous new features added and for that reason its worth playing.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group ",278,126,5,52,68,2,84

												 Highly recommend, as a guy who play only skirmish and campaign in almost every single game, the campaign and skirmish are very fun to play and i like how it progresses for the Black family. don't expect many people playing online though.the original nations play differently each but are very similar personally i don't play whit them much only whit the Dutch. Each expansion bring 3 nations, and each nation in each expansion plays similar but different from its sister nations. for example the War chief expansion nations have a dancing circle that impart bonuses(each have some unique bonuses for each nation works similar to  gods favor on AOM) and also instead of and explorer get a powerful Warchief. be careful don't choose and Asian dynasty nations expecting to play as a war chief nations they play very differently.the only complain i have is that artillery is to powerful.

												This is such an amazing game! I have played this game and AOE II since i was around 7 years old and I have to admit the game is still very fresh and enjoyable. Though it is a great game I feel there is a necessary requirement to enjoying this game. Siblings, family or friends! I have been playing this game with my brothers for many years and it is so much fun backstabbing each other, working together and interacting with each other in a video game. I think of it like a board game, it is most enjoyable to play it with people you know instead of robots or random people because it is a way to bond. There are some solo options but the AI are very predictable, the only other option is ES Online which is hard to use since the game is so dated and few people around the world play making for a lot of lag. I give this game 9.75/10 because of the way this game holds a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my brothers.			",45,4,0,2,6,0,6

History + action + strategyA bit underrated if you like history and RTS. Basically, you load up a map, gather resources, build buildings, train armies, etc., etc. Great diversity of nations, tactics and unique units/bldgs/techs.You can capture trade routes and mini-civs (""villages"") on many maps. Easy to customize multi and, when the game's balanced and playing right, it's a thrilling challenge. If you're the creative kind, you can dig into the editor and pretty quickly start creating your own maps, scenarios and cinematics. If you loved Age of Empires 2, this is an easy recommendation. Graphics hold up well - the game still looks gorgeous on a good rig.			",58,30,0,2,9,0,3

												Age of Empires really needs no explanation. This legendary RTS game is a good relic of a dying genre of videogames. Seriously when was the last time a RTS besides company of heroes came out? Ensemble Studios, the makers of the series. Were shut down by Microsoft a little while back. And even though Microsoft will never revive the studio(or the game series for that matter) We still have this little gem on the Pc. I want to warn you, this game is not for the graphics, the worlds and building models still look reasonably well for 2005. But the rest hasn't aged well. But it does not matter, the campaign is still enjoyable(if not cheesy at times) And the skirmish and multiplayer modes are simple-minded fun.			",15,0,0,0,5,1,0

												Put dozens of hours on this game on non-Steam version.Really fun RTS. Personally I prefer the time period of AoE2, but AoE3 far surpasses it's predecessor in gameplay mechanics and graphics. With complete collection you get plenty of civilizations to mess around with. The more you play, you level up Civs to unlock stuff. People still play multiplayer and comp. Most of the fan base is serious making multiplayer a hard jump to make (unless you have experience with other RTSs). Nonetheless the AI is pretty good (up to a point, skillwise) and Ive played way to many skirmishes with the computer.			",65,11,1,2,4,2,5

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out my  Steam profile, the  Youtube channel, and the Twitch channel[twitch.tv]!!Ah, yet another entry into the already incredible Age of Empires franchise.  There are few RTS franchises that can boast about having as much success as AoE has had, and there is good reason behind that.  After putting in nearly 100 hours into the game I can easily say, this one does not disappoint for the most part.  It's no AoE II, but it's close.  That puts this game head and shoulders above most other strategy games.  Ensemble Studios really did an incredible job on their final entry into this series, and they will be greatly missed.Gameplay : The gameplay of this entry in the AoE series is very similar to the previous two.  Build a base/town, build an economy, raise an army, destroy your enemies.  While it might be a simple straightforward process, it's a hell of a lot of fun.  The combat is visceral, the interface is simplistic enough for even brand new strategy game players to get a grasp on it in just a few short minutes, and the payoff is worth it, for the most part.  The only part that seems to have gotten worse in this entry, is the unit path-finding.  I don't know why or how this particular area got worse, but it definitely did.  Units will seemingly go completely out of there way to get to where you want them to go.  And villagers will CONSTANTLY lose track of what they are supposed to be doing.  The Idle Villager button was nice in AoE II, but it wasn't a necessity.  But in AoE III, you will be clicking it every minute.There are several modes of gameplay in this version including but not limited to: Campaign, Single-player Random Maps, Multiplayer Standard, etc.  But all of them hold the same general process of base building and conquering your enemies.  The campaigns are lengthy, but slightly repetitive and the characters are not really that engaging, even in the expansions.  The real gem is the multiplayer.  There are several different civilizations to choose from, each one with incredibly unique units that have completely different capabilities.  So while the units are different, this forces different strategies depending on the civilization you have chosen. This creates a unique experience and feel to each civilization and keeps the gameplay fresh while extending it's longevity.Of course when it comes to multiplayer strategy games, balancing is key.  ESO did a pretty good job of balancing units and civs to begin with, but there were a few missteps in the original that were fixed in the expansions.  So of course the final expansion, The Asian Dynasties, is the definitive AoE III multiplayer experience.  (I don't think you can even play the Warchiefs multiplayer anymore)  I do not wish to go much further in depth with gameplay simply because this is a strategy game and can literally be talked and discussed about forever.  So I'll just finish with this:  The gameplay is really incredible and enjoyable, while also being long-lasting.Graphics : This game was released in 2005.  2005.  I'll say that one more time.  This game was released in 2005.  And it STILL looks better than a ton of games being released these days.  The new physics engine that was put into place for AoE III is incredible and might be the best looking one in strategy games.  Buildings fall apart completely differently depending on what they are being attacked by and how.  Fire two cannons at two different houses, and they will be blown apart in completely different ways, even from the same angles.  This game was WAY ahead of it's time in terms of graphics.  You will often find yourself just sitting and staring in wonderment at the action that is taking place on the screen (when really you should probably be taking care of other things in the game).Sound : The audio is perfectly matched for this game.  All the way from the muskets firing, to armies being demolished by elephants, and to cannons thundering over everything else.  And you will hear those cannons from very far away.  Just this small addition, brings in a massive level of tension to the game (especially when playing with Fog of War on).  You can hear the artillery slowly encroaching on your base, and depending on your level of readiness, you are either swarming around trying to prepare or silently waiting for the first shot to be fired in a battle that will determine the fate of your town.As for the music, it's OK.  I'm a big fan of the soundtracks in the AoE series as they have always meshed ever so perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.  This entry probably has the weakest soundtrack of all three games.  But it's not terrible.  Just OK.Lasting Appeal : This game has tremendous lasting appeal.  And ESO specifically built it that way.  By implementing the new Home City system into this entry, your City can earn experience and level up after almost every match, which unlocks new cards that you can put into your City's deck that provide bonuses that can be called upon during the match.  Anything from a passive bonus to resource gathering rates, to massive extra reinforcement troops.  The servers are still packed with players ready to fight and try to demolish you so don't be afraid of dwindling player base.Final Verdict : This game is definitely an 8/10.  Superb gameplay, fantastic graphics, awesome audio, and great lasting appeal.  Is it worth $40?  Probably not.  That's a lot of asking money for a game that came out in 2005.  I think $30 is much more reasonable.			",321,38,4,53,19,0,49

Enhances gameplay greatly, as the combinations in team play are dramatically increased.  Overall, 4/5, would definitely recommend for anyone wanting that RTS style of game play with different strategies and team combinations that will keep the action alive and constant.

												Put dozens of hours on this game on non-Steam version.Really fun RTS. Personally I prefer the time period of AoE2, but AoE3 far surpasses it's predecessor in gameplay mechanics and graphics. With complete collection you get plenty of civilizations to mess around with. The more you play, you level up Civs to unlock stuff. People still play multiplayer and comp. Most of the fan base is serious making multiplayer a hard jump to make (unless you have experience with other RTSs). Nonetheless the AI is pretty good (up to a point, skillwise) and Ive played way to many skirmishes with the computer.			",65,11,1,2,4,2,5

												Age of Empires really needs no explanation. This legendary RTS game is a good relic of a dying genre of videogames. Seriously when was the last time a RTS besides company of heroes came out? Ensemble Studios, the makers of the series. Were shut down by Microsoft a little while back. And even though Microsoft will never revive the studio(or the game series for that matter) We still have this little gem on the Pc. I want to warn you, this game is not for the graphics, the worlds and building models still look reasonably well for 2005. But the rest hasn't aged well. But it does not matter, the campaign is still enjoyable(if not cheesy at times) And the skirmish and multiplayer modes are simple-minded fun.			",15,0,0,0,5,1,0

												This is such an amazing game! I have played this game and AOE II since i was around 7 years old and I have to admit the game is still very fresh and enjoyable. Though it is a great game I feel there is a necessary requirement to enjoying this game. Siblings, family or friends! I have been playing this game with my brothers for many years and it is so much fun backstabbing each other, working together and interacting with each other in a video game. I think of it like a board game, it is most enjoyable to play it with people you know instead of robots or random people because it is a way to bond. There are some solo options but the AI are very predictable, the only other option is ES Online which is hard to use since the game is so dated and few people around the world play making for a lot of lag. I give this game 9.75/10 because of the way this game holds a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my brothers.			",45,4,0,2,6,0,6

History + action + strategyA bit underrated if you like history and RTS. Basically, you load up a map, gather resources, build buildings, train armies, etc., etc. Great diversity of nations, tactics and unique units/bldgs/techs.You can capture trade routes and mini-civs (""villages"") on many maps. Easy to customize multi and, when the game's balanced and playing right, it's a thrilling challenge. If you're the creative kind, you can dig into the editor and pretty quickly start creating your own maps, scenarios and cinematics. If you loved Age of Empires 2, this is an easy recommendation. Graphics hold up well - the game still looks gorgeous on a good rig.			",58,30,0,2,9,0,3

												I had forgotten just how good this game was. Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.Fans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.Visually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).If you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved! This game deserves to be in everyone's collection.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												Age of Empires 3 is an RTS classic, the (unfortunately) last game in the Age of Empires' series installment, was brilliant for it's time, and definitely still can count itself among the best classic RTS' out there, even according to the standards of today for that genre in particular, as well as the Strategy genre as a whole.Aside from this, the game also has an interesting shipment system, which is quite unique, and spices up the game, that is not even mentioning all of the different units, from the different civilizations and their playstyles.The graphics are beginning to show their age, but nevertheless are still quite good, and decent to look at.The AI, though a bit rudimentary, at hard difficulty can easily prove to be quite a challenge, especially if you are fighting the French with the Napoleon personality (viva la Baguette?).The game is not supported anymore, due to it's age, however, you can easily through third party programs like GameRanger find and play multiplayer games online.Oh, and remember to launch the game through Asian Dynasties, as you would otherwise not be able to access the content of all of the DLCs and their content at the same time. Enjoy. : )			",201,31,6,37,42,0,67

												 I would say no because of the price tag, but this has to be one of the best RTSs that I have ever played. I can play this for hours. All the diferent things you can do. You can have a one-on-one battle with AI or maybe you would perfer an eight-on-eight battle with you friend. You can do what ever you feel like. On the other side, the AI is quite persistent. I have had times when they wiped out my partner then nonstop attaked me. I ended up having to surender because I didn't have time to build an army. I highly recomend this game to anyone who has the patience and time to sit through an hour-two hour game.			",196,20,6,30,20,0,22

												Honestly, I really resented this game for years. But I finally broke down and bought it and it is worth every penny. It took some time to get used to the whole cards thing, but once you get past that, its all good.2017 Edit: I would still recommend this game today, but if it was a ""one or the other"" situation, I'd recommend taking a look at AOE 2: HD. To elaborate a little on my original review, when this game came out, I was a die hard AOE 2 fan still, and a lot of the mechanics in this game (the cards especially) I saw as a gimmick. I figured they had just run out of ideas or something. Thankfully, I was wrong, I haven't played enough of this to say more but its definitely a good buy.			",173,12,10,14,21,0,9

												AoE é um jogo especial para mim. Embora não tenha jogado o primeiro, AoE 2 foi a minha primeira experiência realmente intensa nos pcs: o primeiro game que me dediquei de fato na nossa querida plataforma. Foi uma grande satisfação quando vi AoE 3 disponível no Steam. Assim como o 2, o 3 também joguei bastante. Contudo, à época, joguei as versões piratas. O legal era que, mesmo sendo pirata, conseguíamos jogar on line. Comprei AoE 3 aqui no Steam em retribuição aos momentos de diversão que me proporcionou no passado (e também por saudosismo). O jogo é um ótimo rts, que permite várias práticas estratégicas. As civilizações são realmente muito distintas umas das outras, cada qual com sua árvore evolutiva própria, o que permite aproveitar o game a partir de várias possibilidades de combates diferentes.  Interessante é que ainda hoje ele possui gráficos muito bons. Ademais, é possível achar na net sites com mapas, campanhas, civilizações e outros mods que acrescentam bastante conteúdo free. Enfim, aconselho a todos que gostem de construir cidades, evolui-las, formar exércitos e ir para o fronte de batalha colocar em prática suas estratégias.			",149,19,3,12,3,0,4

I suppose the chances of that are about as good as a new Freelancer coming out.  :(  The greatest game ever.  I do wish at least they would make that one to playable on Win 8.1 or even 7.

												O Age of Empires 3 é um jogo para Windows que faz parte da famosa série Age of Empires. O game se tornou a principal referência quando o assunto é jogos de raciocínio e estratégia. Seu objetivo é administrar as construções da cidade, as tecnologias que estão surgindo e a expansão da sociedade, de forma a fazer com que ela cresça da maneira mais organizada possível. O título faz você viajar pelos séculos e é diversão garantida.Ao iniciar a partida, você volta no tempo e vive como pessoas de outra época. Existem oito civilizações, entre elas: Britânicos, Espanhóis, Portugueses e Franceses. Neste contexto, é possível encontrar minérios, madeira e ouro. Além de comercializar produtos e conseguir comida de qualquer maneira.Nesta versão, mudar o status e evoluir acontece de um jeito diferente das outras versões. A experiência é mais importante e dá mais pontos do que conseguir novas tecnologias. Por isso, não é necessário somente avançar no tempo para adquirir novas ferramentas.			",22,1,0,0,1,0,1

												This is such an amazing game! I have played this game and AOE II since i was around 7 years old and I have to admit the game is still very fresh and enjoyable. Though it is a great game I feel there is a necessary requirement to enjoying this game. Siblings, family or friends! I have been playing this game with my brothers for many years and it is so much fun backstabbing each other, working together and interacting with each other in a video game. I think of it like a board game, it is most enjoyable to play it with people you know instead of robots or random people because it is a way to bond. There are some solo options but the AI are very predictable, the only other option is ES Online which is hard to use since the game is so dated and few people around the world play making for a lot of lag. I give this game 9.75/10 because of the way this game holds a special place in my heart and in the hearts of my brothers.			",45,4,0,2,6,0,6

												I had forgotten just how good this game was. Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.Fans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.Visually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).If you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved! This game deserves to be in everyone's collection.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												Great game for RTS fans, It has an amazing multiplayer mode. I personally only play treaty NR40 which is 40 minutes without attacking but most people play with just attacking at the start. Honestly the diversity in the civs and units is great there are no civs that arent usuable in anything. Every civ has its own advantages and disadvantages and while there are a few that are clearly somewhat overpowered you will find that players will often host ""No OP"" Lobbies where you can really play whatever you want.

												One of the best Real Time Strategy Games ever.  The third iteration of the series and its corresponding Warchiefs and Asian Dynasties add-ons really add depth and uniqueness to the game.  Playing as different civilizations make it feel like  a completely different game, which ultimately has some good and bad sides.  Overall the learning curve may be a little high for newcomers since the game has a long history.  But hang in there, you'll find the right Civilization for your style.			",34,5,2,21,5,1,8

												Age of Empires III: complete Collection is a small compilation consisting of Age of Empires III and the two expansion packs. I already recommend buying this over the retail version since there was an issue with it. If one was to purchase Age of Empires III then War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties retail, it would only allow the use of Asian Dynasties OR War Chiefs. So, one pro is that both expansions can be played at the same time.GameplayAge of Empires III is an RTS that is set in colonial times. What is most appealing about the game is the beautiful graphics for the time and the amount of replayability. The effort that was placed in each nation was specific and displayed the obvious strengths and weaknesses of each nation after some experience. For example, one nation might be unable to build a tower type build, but have a unit or another building that allows better protection against enemies. This also limits the player somewhat since not all nations can just wall up and defend well like in Age of Empires or Age of Empires II. StoryNot much to say on this subject as the story is loosily based on true events and is sub-par at best. To say the least, you would probably play through it once and never touch it again.VisualsThe audio is superb and feels right. The gun shots of the muskets don't sound like bb guns or anything, the ambient music is relaxing, and combat has its own fast paced music as well. Graphic wise, the game is very beautiful and seems to bring out the environments of the real world. Overall, I would recommend this game to long time fans of the series or fans of RTS games.

												This is one of my all time favourite games. I first played this game11 years ago when it came out, and it still holds up no problem today. There are no grand strategy games quite so immersive as this. There are other games in the real-time strategy genre, but I don't know what they are, nor do I care. This is the only one I need. The complete collection offers massive replayability, and I can atest to that as I am still not bored with this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had forgotten just how good this game was. Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.Fans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.Visually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).If you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved! This game deserves to be in everyone's collection.			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												It's AoE 3.Granted, tis' not the one that is the most popular in the series (compared to 2, AoM, or even the first one), but there's a lot of replay value when they introduced the card system. You can tweak it to your liking, whether that works or not. They also integrated one of the game modes that I used to play (xx minutes no rush) into the actual game as a game mode, which is fantastic if you like to build up economies and then clash with big arimes on the field. You can also have large navy fights that I haven't seen in a RTS except for the Empire Earth series. Very fun and replayable.			",26,1,3,12,12,1,15

												One of my favorite strategy games of all time.  It's almost a decade old, yet I still find time to play it.Campaign:  8/10  The base game's campaign is broken up into three stories loosely connected via the characters.  The level designs are creative and the gameplay is always engaging.  For first time players, the campaigns are a good place to learn the intricacies of the game.Skirmishes:  9/10  The base game has 8 or 9 ""Home Cities"" to choose from, each with unique units, buildings, etc.  Each Home City gains experience independently, so there is no shortage of game to be played.  The map selection is very diverse, especially if you indulge in the expansion packs.  The AI can be a little idiotic at easier difficulties, but challenging at harder ones.  The only fault I find with the gameplay is the lack of diversity among the units available.  Each Home City has access to a different combination of a dozen or so units, each with a specific purpose in your armies, so if you opponent is building mostly cavalry, you just build anti-cavalry units.  This can become stale after several games.Graphics:  8/10  What can I say?  The game looks great, especially considering its age.  The building models are great and 'evolve' as you age up in-game.  The landscape and scenery are very well detailed, notably the water and trees.  The game even has some physics involved when you attack buildings and the buildings fall apart.  The only fault I find with the graphics are the character models, which dont have idle animations and have identical faces, uniforms, etc.  Overall, I give this game a solid 85/100.  You might get bored of it, butonly after many hours of rewarding gameplay.  By the way, the soundtrack is fantastic.			",90,9,0,9,14,0,6

												Great game back in its heyday.  Purchased it on a whim when it was under $10 - don't regret it.  However, many years after its release, all its shortcomings are glaringly aboundant.  Other than specialized civilization units, pretty much every civ plays the same - get a mix of Cavalry, Pikeman, and artillery and hope you have more units than your enemy.  I really wish they would come out with a current-gen version that learned from its previous mistakes.  It definitely needs a visual overhaul but that's to be expected from a game over a decade old.Sound issues abound occasionally where the music will stop playing, and the unit voices will be muted.  Somewhat of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥when you're villae is getting attacked and you're concentrating on troop movements with your army elsewhere.			",39,1,0,9,1,0,2

												Age of Empires III: complete Collection is a small compilation consisting of Age of Empires III and the two expansion packs. I already recommend buying this over the retail version since there was an issue with it. If one was to purchase Age of Empires III then War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties retail, it would only allow the use of Asian Dynasties OR War Chiefs. So, one pro is that both expansions can be played at the same time.GameplayAge of Empires III is an RTS that is set in colonial times. What is most appealing about the game is the beautiful graphics for the time and the amount of replayability. The effort that was placed in each nation was specific and displayed the obvious strengths and weaknesses of each nation after some experience. For example, one nation might be unable to build a tower type build, but have a unit or another building that allows better protection against enemies. This also limits the player somewhat since not all nations can just wall up and defend well like in Age of Empires or Age of Empires II. StoryNot much to say on this subject as the story is loosily based on true events and is sub-par at best. To say the least, you would probably play through it once and never touch it again.VisualsThe audio is superb and feels right. The gun shots of the muskets don't sound like bb guns or anything, the ambient music is relaxing, and combat has its own fast paced music as well. Graphic wise, the game is very beautiful and seems to bring out the environments of the real world. Overall, I would recommend this game to long time fans of the series or fans of RTS games.

PROS:+ fun campaign stories+ nice building & unit variety+ AoE look+ XP system+ fun multiplayer+ two cool expansionsCONS:- simplified building & resource gathering- home base cards- the unit formations are useless- lacks stuff that would make this game iconic like the first twoComment:Do not be fooled by the hours played I have displayed here as I have played many many more. So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs. I truly do recommend this as a RTS game because it is good, but it just lacks something to be really great...

												One of my favorite strategy games of all time.  It's almost a decade old, yet I still find time to play it.Campaign:  8/10  The base game's campaign is broken up into three stories loosely connected via the characters.  The level designs are creative and the gameplay is always engaging.  For first time players, the campaigns are a good place to learn the intricacies of the game.Skirmishes:  9/10  The base game has 8 or 9 ""Home Cities"" to choose from, each with unique units, buildings, etc.  Each Home City gains experience independently, so there is no shortage of game to be played.  The map selection is very diverse, especially if you indulge in the expansion packs.  The AI can be a little idiotic at easier difficulties, but challenging at harder ones.  The only fault I find with the gameplay is the lack of diversity among the units available.  Each Home City has access to a different combination of a dozen or so units, each with a specific purpose in your armies, so if you opponent is building mostly cavalry, you just build anti-cavalry units.  This can become stale after several games.Graphics:  8/10  What can I say?  The game looks great, especially considering its age.  The building models are great and 'evolve' as you age up in-game.  The landscape and scenery are very well detailed, notably the water and trees.  The game even has some physics involved when you attack buildings and the buildings fall apart.  The only fault I find with the graphics are the character models, which dont have idle animations and have identical faces, uniforms, etc.  Overall, I give this game a solid 85/100.  You might get bored of it, butonly after many hours of rewarding gameplay.  By the way, the soundtrack is fantastic.			",90,9,0,9,14,0,6

												 I would say no because of the price tag, but this has to be one of the best RTSs that I have ever played. I can play this for hours. All the diferent things you can do. You can have a one-on-one battle with AI or maybe you would perfer an eight-on-eight battle with you friend. You can do what ever you feel like. On the other side, the AI is quite persistent. I have had times when they wiped out my partner then nonstop attaked me. I ended up having to surender because I didn't have time to build an army. I highly recomend this game to anyone who has the patience and time to sit through an hour-two hour game.			",196,20,6,30,20,0,22

												Great game back in its heyday.  Purchased it on a whim when it was under $10 - don't regret it.  However, many years after its release, all its shortcomings are glaringly aboundant.  Other than specialized civilization units, pretty much every civ plays the same - get a mix of Cavalry, Pikeman, and artillery and hope you have more units than your enemy.  I really wish they would come out with a current-gen version that learned from its previous mistakes.  It definitely needs a visual overhaul but that's to be expected from a game over a decade old.Sound issues abound occasionally where the music will stop playing, and the unit voices will be muted.  Somewhat of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥when you're villae is getting attacked and you're concentrating on troop movements with your army elsewhere.			",39,1,0,9,1,0,2

												This is the game that gave me my love for both strategy and History itself.  Until I got Civilization V, this game was by far my most played strategy game.  You get to fight in the New World or Asia as you build up resorces, construct an army, and conquer your neighbors!  Though I feel the game should add more factions to play like Sweden, Austria, or Denmark to add to to the already great experience (without the need of a mod) and the ability to fight in Europe!  Also, if you're a person who doesn't like to win legitimently, then look of some of the cheats, the're hilarious!  Also, the AI difficulty is very spaced out between easy, moderate, and hard, unlike some games that have easy WAY too easy, medium has a massive jump from easy, and hard is nearly impossible.  Great choice if you're a stategy fan.			",28,2,0,4,4,0,9

												great RTS game with high-skill cap which combines mechanics with strategy. Cards add an even further element of strategy as you're able to carry out a designated or set game plan before the game even starts. Extremely unique and different civilizations, making the game an almost unlimited source of entertainment. Only mishaps are with the multiplayer as it can be laggy at times, and microing in this game seems awkward compared to games such as WC3 or SC2.			",56,6,1,2,4,1,9

Age of Empires III is a great base-building RTS game for older and less powerful rigs.This game will run on almost any machine that will run Windows 10 as long as it has the space requirements met.  It's quick to load and easy to host/join.  It's not online-only.  It has single-player campaigns, one for the base game and one for each expansion, and it has LAN support.  (It has online features, too, though I never mess with that.)The game is real-time strategy or RTS at its core.  It offers a lot of resource-gathering options and many ways to creatively gain a foothold over your competition.  It also has hilarious cheats! If you don't care to cheat your way to victory but need an edge over everyone else on the battlefield, there is the handicap percentage.Why do I play this so often over all my other RTS games?My wife's laptop can't play much else.  That's the biggest reason.  We like playing strategy games cooperatively and AOE3 is one of the best-looking, most fun experiences we've got to work on her laptop.  Someday, I want to build her a gaming desktop out of my old parts so she can play newer, prettier RTS games.  Even then, we'll probably compare all of them to AOE3.			",571,115,13,72,58,7,60

												Some people prefer age of empires 2, but this still has got a lot of advantages and excellent updates, worthy to be considered a sequel. There is a lot less micromanaging of the unenjoyable kind as you can train 5 units at the speed of 1 and villagers don't have to travel back to resource drop off points. It feel more action packed and lacks the dull late game turtling that age of empires 2 would drive to. The AI can be an absolute retard at times but they can come up with excellent tactical decisions. I actually prefer this to AOE 2, and it certainly has made a lot of changes that makes it stand out with its independant identity within the AOE franchise.			",54,15,2,10,6,2,29

												As of today I still love this game. I played the series since I was young and never got bored of it.In my opinion it is definitely one of the best RTS games ever made. It's fun to single play all the campaigns, but it's also fun to play with friends on multiplayer or local lan.I really hope the developers consider to make a sequel to this awesome series.

												I love Age of Empires 3. I played tons of AoE2 growing up and still do (especially with the AoE2 HD available on Steam). It's such a great game and never gets boring. I really enjoy card system in AoE3. I think it adds an extra level of customization, and you can make separate decks for when you are on different kinds of maps. I also love that I don't have to put buildings near resources in order for the villagers to transport goods. Instead, they can just keep on chipping away and there will be a steady stream of resources being acquired. If you want to see some funny physics, cluster a bunch of ships close together and watch them twitch. Overall: great game is great!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay, here's how it is. If you absolutley adore Age of Empires 2 and want a clone, don't play this. If you like StarCraft 2 or similair games, Play this. Nice story, nice graphics, decent gameplay. The multi-player is not very fun unless it's with friends. There is mild customization. Such as which nation to play in skirmish. The ""card system"" is a little odd, but effective if you like it.   I have seen all the bad reviews, they all hate that this game isn't AOE2. The game is simple. Spam musketeers and two cannons and you win. But the story is fun. The historical accuracy is off, but this is a video game, not a history lesson. All in all, play it if you want a fun simple RTS with ninjas.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												8/10If you like the classic RTS style – that is building a base, collecting resources, amassing a giant army, and eventually crushing your opponent with massive amounts of soldiers – this is a great choice. It includes two expansion packs which extend the play time considerably. Graphics are a bit dated but look fine. You get a lot of game for your money and if you find it on sale don’t hesitate to buy. Single player missions are fun and somewhat varied in their objectives; it will take you a long time to finish. The challenge is decent but you probably won’t be failing too many missions.

												This has always been a favored game of mine, and the fact at how it has moved to steam im sure has helped a lot more. Firstly I can say, That it helps me store this game just as much as just discs have, giving me a chance to play whenever I wish. And if you are a real expert or ever have played this game on the multiplayer servers, I can definately tell it has saved The Ensemble Studios Online section.  In the good old days, there were about 2000 acconts and people on average, and now its peak hits over the 1100 mark, (Im sure that the moving to steam has helped the gameplay and popularity of the game and multiplayer mode).  Overall, the gameplay is and has always been great, especially for the time when this game came out.  Great story and campaignlines. 3 campaigns for the Vanilla Version, 2 for the Warchiefs, and 3 for the Asian Dynasties.Great History too! Not only featuring countless Military, Civilian Populations, Plus various amounts of warships, weapon(Cannon/Infantry) types.  Age of empires 3 consists of various playable civilizations. The Vanilla/Nilla version  with just the european powers shows 8 civs. The British, French, Spanish, Germans, Dutch, Portugese, Ottomans, and Russians.  The Warchiefs Expansion Includes more maps, and The Iroqois Civilization, The Sioux and the Aztecs. The Asian Dynasties includes even more maps, and the Japanese, Chinese, and Indian Civilizations, and what can i say.  I love it all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i was about 6 years old I started playing Empire Earth and I fell in love with it. Then I lost that disc and found a similar game at a pawn store, Age of Empires 1. I've been playing these games my whole life and now I just bought this 3-pack and I fell in love again. I recommend this game if you like strategic games and growing a colony to take over others. This game really gives your brain a tingle. You can play the campaign but I prefer the skirmish matches. Build your town center and start building Barracks, Stables, Farms, Armories etc. Build your army and crush your foes. (I enjoy building huge walls around my city!)			",13,2,0,0,4,0,2

												While the graphics has improved, and the possibilities in game-play have improved. The nostalgic feel of the original two games seems to be somewhat lost on this newer version. Its playable, enjoyable. But if you're purchasing this beceause you enjoyed the first two installments of the game you might want to try a demo first, it might be for you or you might be in the same boat i was and jump back to the old game. ~Remmy			",195,30,9,42,31,1,35

												One of the best RTS games created.Should you buy this, you will not be dissapointed with your purchase.Best feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. What I mean is, normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.			",75,3,3,6,7,1,12

												A huge big YES.I have followed and been loyal to the Age of Empires series since it was first released and I still think that I owe my whole career (foreign language teacher and translator) to this game as this is where I was exposed to foreign languages for the first time. Aside from that, Age of Empires just has the perfect blend of city building and combat mixed in with some micromanagement (especially in AOEIII) which has sometimes resulted in having multiplayer games lasting more than 4 hours at a time, 4v4. I will always cherish this game and come back to it, especially AOEIII as it's set in one of my favourite time periods in world history. I would recommend buying both expansions though if you have to choose, get the War Chiefs as it adds a certain 'something' that I don't think Asian Dynasties got quite right. I'm still hoping that one day, just one day, there will be an AOE IV and maybe even V and VI, maybe set in WW1, WW2 and Cold War era?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has always been a favored game of mine, and the fact at how it has moved to steam im sure has helped a lot more. Firstly I can say, That it helps me store this game just as much as just discs have, giving me a chance to play whenever I wish. And if you are a real expert or ever have played this game on the multiplayer servers, I can definately tell it has saved The Ensemble Studios Online section.  In the good old days, there were about 2000 acconts and people on average, and now its peak hits over the 1100 mark, (Im sure that the moving to steam has helped the gameplay and popularity of the game and multiplayer mode).  Overall, the gameplay is and has always been great, especially for the time when this game came out.  Great story and campaignlines. 3 campaigns for the Vanilla Version, 2 for the Warchiefs, and 3 for the Asian Dynasties.Great History too! Not only featuring countless Military, Civilian Populations, Plus various amounts of warships, weapon(Cannon/Infantry) types.  Age of empires 3 consists of various playable civilizations. The Vanilla/Nilla version  with just the european powers shows 8 civs. The British, French, Spanish, Germans, Dutch, Portugese, Ottomans, and Russians.  The Warchiefs Expansion Includes more maps, and The Iroqois Civilization, The Sioux and the Aztecs. The Asian Dynasties includes even more maps, and the Japanese, Chinese, and Indian Civilizations, and what can i say.  I love it all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i was about 6 years old I started playing Empire Earth and I fell in love with it. Then I lost that disc and found a similar game at a pawn store, Age of Empires 1. I've been playing these games my whole life and now I just bought this 3-pack and I fell in love again. I recommend this game if you like strategic games and growing a colony to take over others. This game really gives your brain a tingle. You can play the campaign but I prefer the skirmish matches. Build your town center and start building Barracks, Stables, Farms, Armories etc. Build your army and crush your foes. (I enjoy building huge walls around my city!)			",13,2,0,0,4,0,2

												Quite a lot of fun to be had in this game. I didn't really enjoy the story, and some of the Explorer's attacks just felt absurdly overpowered - eg. being able to onehit an enemy unit, no matter what it was, besides heavy siege weapons every minute or two minutes or something?Nonetheless, it brings exactly to the table what made AOEII great - pretty graphics for its era, superb, SUPERB gameplay that I've come back to time and time again over the years, and units feeling almost exactly perfectly balanced (with the aforementioned exception of Explorers.)

												8/10If you like the classic RTS style – that is building a base, collecting resources, amassing a giant army, and eventually crushing your opponent with massive amounts of soldiers – this is a great choice. It includes two expansion packs which extend the play time considerably. Graphics are a bit dated but look fine. You get a lot of game for your money and if you find it on sale don’t hesitate to buy. Single player missions are fun and somewhat varied in their objectives; it will take you a long time to finish. The challenge is decent but you probably won’t be failing too many missions.

												In my opinion, this is the best RTS, and perhaps best video game ever made. Despite being over a decade old, it still holds up as a great game which can be played over and over for hundreds, if not thousands of hours. The music and gameplay of this is excellent, and while the graphics may not be top-notch, they are decent for the game and allow it be played without much lag interruption. With 14 playable factions and multiple gamemodes, you'll stay interested and there is always something new to do with the excellent scenario making of this game.I would rate this game 10/10. It is a masterpiece.			",29,5,2,2,4,0,5

												(Note: Ignore the low playtime, i've sunk hundreds of hours into this before i made my Steam Account)I recall this being one of the first games i ever played as a child. Great fun, even more when i got into online with my brother and wrecked some faces. Despite AoE III beginning to show its age (it's more than 10 years old now), it still holds up nicely. So grab a few friends, pick your nations, gather ressources, build an army and wreck their stuff, then do it all over again. The social aspect along with the wide variety of nations (14 with both expansions) the novelty does not wear off too quickly.Definitely recommended.			",129,34,2,17,8,1,34

												A Timeless classic reborn in HD. The Age Of Empires series stands upon one of the three pillars of RTS royalty with the other two being Comand and Conquor and Dawn of War. AOE is one of those games you can spend hours on just fiddling away, building up a strong empire only to loose it when you win. But thats half the fun because you get to do it again. I often found myself building a strong base only to toy with my enemies before i crused them.In many aspects this game seems more ridgid and strict than the ones before, but on the whole i beleive it to be an improvement. With a single player campaign that i actually enjoyed playing this is my favourite in the series.A strong 8/10			",224,79,2,36,19,2,27

The Vanilla/Nilla version  with just the european powers shows 8 civs. The British, French, Spanish, Germans, Dutch, Portugese, Ottomans, and Russians.  The Warchiefs Expansion Includes more maps, and The Iroqois Civilization, The Sioux and the Aztecs. The Asian Dynasties includes even more maps, and the Japanese, Chinese, and Indian Civilizations, and what can i say.  I love it all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm still hoping that one day, just one day, there will be an AOE IV and maybe even V and VI, maybe set in WW1, WW2 and Cold War era?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												if you're a master at bailing out your teammates and fending off 50,000 enemy calvary troops at the same time, this is the game for you. the AI are so unforgivingly diffcult, they still rushed with all upgrades on the largest stock map in the game.

												While the graphics has improved, and the possibilities in game-play have improved. The nostalgic feel of the original two games seems to be somewhat lost on this newer version. Its playable, enjoyable. But if you're purchasing this beceause you enjoyed the first two installments of the game you might want to try a demo first, it might be for you or you might be in the same boat i was and jump back to the old game. ~Remmy			",195,30,9,42,31,1,35

												Hands down will go down as one of the best RTS games created. The depth of the campaign storylines makes for amazing experiences, the maps have great detail with more options in the game than the previous chapters. As for the online features sadly the mode has decreased much with people playing it but you will still get games. Overall it is a great game and I would highly recommend it.			",129,20,1,29,21,1,28

												What can I say, I love this game. Ever since I've been playing video games I've always kept this game dear to my heart. I love a game that makes you think, strategize, not just run around a map and shoot people. That's why I love this game. You have to think ""Whats going to be my next move?"" and then you have to think how will this affect your economy, your settlers, and most importantly your military. This game is also good because you can't just work on your town because you won't have a good military and vice versa. That's why I recommend this game.			",27,5,0,0,10,1,0

Posted: March 1, 2016
												AoE 3 is a pretty decent historical fiction RTS.  The game takes place mostly around the frontier days, with the exception of the Asian Dynasty pack.  I'll be talking a lot about that expansion because it's vastly different from the rest of the game.  Voice acting is decent, as are the stories, predictable though they are.  The music is catchy but highly repetitive.  85% of the game has no chill.  While it's not really all that challenging on Normal difficulty, most of the missions in the game have some kind of time or mechanical constraint that prevent them from being standard ""build then destroy"" affairs.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, but themes are re-used so much that they quickly grow old.  ""Oh, I don't start off with a base again.""  ""Oh, I can't get any villagers again.""  ""Oh, I don't get any resources so I have to use trading posts again.""  So on and so forth.  The UI is kind of bad.  It eats up a third of my screen on 1080p, and hotkeys (of which there are many) aren't discernible via mouseovers of the buttons, so you wind up having to go back into the Options menu repeatedly if you want to use them.  Attack-move seemed not to work properly for me, which was very noticeable but not a dealbreaker.  Asian Dynasties involved very different mechanics.  Minus the UI, the production value, and a couple of buildings/progressions, it was almost different enough to be another RTS.  Some of the alterations were neat, others were bizarre.  If you play the Chinese faction during Skirmish mode, they can't build any common soldiers until they Age Up (upgrade the town hall), only siege units.  I'm sorry, what?  Whose brilliant idea was that?  You see, although there are many factions, there are really only four styles in the game:  European, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian.  It's not merely a difference in units, or buildings, but the fundamental mechanics of how they work.  Because I didn't spend a lot of hours in Skirmish mode, it's impossible for me to say if the game is balanced, but I doubt it.Something that appealed to me were the farming/shipment mechanics.  There's food, wood, coin, and a separate export resource if you're playing Asian Dynasties.  The way it's handled, however, you can build farms or receive shipments that are slow, infinite pools of any of those things.  If you run out of wild animals to hunt, build a farm or raise livestock.  If you run out of gold, plantations or rice paddies are infinite.   Wood is more difficult, but Asian Dynasties allows you to plant groves, or you can receive shipments in any case.  As a result, resource-management in the game is a lot less stressful than pretty much any RTS I've played.  Another thing that stood out is the ability to train stacks of five.  If you have the resources, you can train five troops in one building at once, and when it's finished five will pop out.  The need for multiple barracks is basically absent.  That's about everything that stood out for me.  I wouldn't pay 40 dollars for the game, wait for a decent sale, but it's definitely worth picking up for RTS fans if you don't mind historical backdrop.			",203,15,1,24,18,0,26

												So this review was planned to be targeted towards those people that think it as negative that this game plays seemingly alot differently than the previous two games. However, I don't know where this review will be going as I am typing spontanously.First off, this game does play differently. Alot, actually. From what I have seen, the gameplay from Age of Empires 2, especially online, solely consists of spewing out as many villagers as possible in a short time, hamster all the resources to build yourself up quickly and just make a ♥♥♥♥♥on of units, preferably cannoniers and siege cannons.However, in Age of Empires 3 this is simply not possible, as the population cap is already at 200; considering that unit types [e.g. Musketeers as light infantry, Helbardiers as Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry, Ranged Cavalry, etc.] it is mandatory to have a balance in your army, as the quantity is limited. In this game it is necessary to think about the numbers of Helbardiers to defend your ranged units against enemy melee soldiers, the numbers of Skirmisher to strike down enemy infantry, the number of cavalry to attack the enemy's ranged units, additionally the number of cannons who are deadly agaist masses, and so on, and so on.Personally, having to think about such things instead of spamming units seems way more fun.Same thing is to be said about the buildings.Unlike Age of Empires 2, in this game most buildings can be build limited times only; you cannot build a wall of towers anymore to defend yourself, you can only build 11. You cannot build a Fort (basically AoE3's version of a Castle) in front of the enemy's town because for one, you cannot build things too close to the enemy's town centre, and for two, most civilizations can only have one or two forts in the entire game which can only be built by special wagons, making the risk of losing a fort far more tragic.These special wagons can only be sent by home shipment cards, along with other things that make your resource gather rate higher, send you a certain number of units, resource crates, and wagons which build towers/forts/town centres for free.This seemed to be a thing that could have confused fans of Age of Empires 2 at first (the only reference I have about this is my cousin who didn't like this specific mechanic, don't bash me), I mysel thought the game to be too complicated, although this turnt out to be entirely false as the home shipment system is far more simple than expected.Most civilizations in Age of Empires 3 differ alot from each other; Chinese can only build ""armies"" which are essentially packs of 2 different soldier-types; Ottomans produce villagers automatically and for free, however this takes longer and the production process has to be sped up with upgrades; they lack melee infantry and instead of having a musketeer unit, they use a more expensive and stronger Janissary unit. I could go into more detaill into the different civilizations like the Aztecs which only have Infantry, but it is best to discover all these things for oneself or just googling it, as this review would take too long.Ye.I love it.

												Okay, here's how it is. If you absolutley adore Age of Empires 2 and want a clone, don't play this. If you like StarCraft 2 or similair games, Play this. Nice story, nice graphics, decent gameplay. The multi-player is not very fun unless it's with friends. There is mild customization. Such as which nation to play in skirmish. The ""card system"" is a little odd, but effective if you like it.   I have seen all the bad reviews, they all hate that this game isn't AOE2. The game is simple. Spam musketeers and two cannons and you win. But the story is fun. The historical accuracy is off, but this is a video game, not a history lesson. All in all, play it if you want a fun simple RTS with ninjas.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite a lot of fun to be had in this game. I didn't really enjoy the story, and some of the Explorer's attacks just felt absurdly overpowered - eg. being able to onehit an enemy unit, no matter what it was, besides heavy siege weapons every minute or two minutes or something?Nonetheless, it brings exactly to the table what made AOEII great - pretty graphics for its era, superb, SUPERB gameplay that I've come back to time and time again over the years, and units feeling almost exactly perfectly balanced (with the aforementioned exception of Explorers.)

												8/10If you like the classic RTS style – that is building a base, collecting resources, amassing a giant army, and eventually crushing your opponent with massive amounts of soldiers – this is a great choice. It includes two expansion packs which extend the play time considerably. Graphics are a bit dated but look fine. You get a lot of game for your money and if you find it on sale don’t hesitate to buy. Single player missions are fun and somewhat varied in their objectives; it will take you a long time to finish. The challenge is decent but you probably won’t be failing too many missions.

												To me, this will always be the most underrated game in the Age of Empires franchise.I enjoy it since I was 10 years old and is likely the only game I downloaded in all my computers since the year it was released. I expected every expansion with great thrill and played every nation with equal enthusiasm.For as long as I can, I will say this game is one of the closest to my heart.9.5/10 cause the dutch are broken.

												Great game! The improved graphics and gameplay are definitely a step up from the 2nd game in the AoE series. The ships are a lot more realistic in size, and your army sports some new equipment (namely, guns). The one thing that I don't like about this is the resources. For example, in AoE 2, you had to build a mill, and then build farms in order to gather food. You would also have to constantly resupply your farmland. In AoE 3, however, it's more of a one-time-deal; you build a mill, which comes with farmland included, and that's it. You don't have to resupply the mill with more wood to keep the farm going. You can just let it sit there for forever. Now while some people may like this, I personally, am not a huge fan of it as since it makes the game a bit TOO easy. Overall though, definitely still a good game and a worthy buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a proud AoE fanboy, I was delighted to learn a steam version had become available. AoE3 is something of a unique RTS game in that it is well balanced vanilla (prior to expansions) because of nearly a decade worth of patching. While the expansions fail to deliver as solid a RTS experience (and bump the faction count from 8 to 14), they aren't inherently bad either.I was pleased to learn also that my ESO log in and password still worked after all this time.

												I bought this to play with my friends but we can't connect to a single game online. Neither LAN nor to any ESO servers. For 37 Euros I don't think it's actually worth it to go through trouble trying to connect online and end up lost in troubleshoots. Lucky for me that I spent a fifth of that price. I wish that it is able to be played online without errors and lots of problems between steam users.Overall I did play the campaigns and they are nice and have lots of work put into them so I would still recommend it if you're going to play this single player.

												I spent years playing Age of Empires 2 + Age of Kings expansion. Since I'm not much of a RTS fan, I never liked other strategy games much, but AoE 1&2 were a pleasure for me. When AoE3 first came out, I tried it, but didn't like it. It was annoying to young me, because I was used to AoE2-like gameplay, and the sudden change was something I hated in AoE3.Years have passed, and a friend talked me into buying AoE3. We started playing it together, and it changed my opinion completely. While he is a huuuuuge fan, I wouldn't call myself a fan, but I like the game very much. It's smooth, and has some interesting advantages compared to older AoE titles.Although I'm still not a good RTS player, and I still don't really like playing RTS games, AoE3 captured my time. When played with a friend, this game is a great co-op opportunity. A variety of races, all with their unique units and strategies, makes this game what it is: A classic.Although I loved the game, I must say that Age of Empires 3: Complete Collection is not worth buying at 37€. It's too expensive, and is old enough to fall below the 15€ mark. However, if you're like me, and like sales - buy the game when its price gets low enough for your expectations.My score: 7.3/10			",97,16,6,18,9,0,11

												Though It seems very similar to the previous two titles, AoE3 has vastly superior graphics and a greater variety of unit types for each nation.

												Good and decent game.I grew up playing Age of Empires 2 and loved it.I saw Age of Empires on Steam and got the newest one because it may have many upgrades. It did have many upgrades (graphics and such), but the gameplay is really different. The gameplay is not bad either, though.However, if you grew up with AoE II and want to play it, get AoE II instead of AoE III. Really differet gameplays and feels.Overall, Age of Empires III is a good game. Not anything that I would call amazing or classic though,			",30,3,0,5,3,0,0

												Since I was introduced to Age Of Empires II back in 1999, I was instantly in love with the series. For years I have played AoE2 and all of the sudden Age Of Empires III came out. The sheer awesomeness, value and inginuety that went into making this game can be felt in almost every detail. Be it the campaigns, the skirmish modes, the homecity mechanics or the general polish - everything is just cool. Even today, almost 10 years aftet its initial release back in fall 2005. The game looks great, plays great and even though many fans of AoE say that it might be step back, I can totally recommend this gem from a long lost age when real time strategy was at its pinnacle. The price might be a bit high, but it is much better than buying the games seperately for 50€ each. I did that. And then I bought this back on steam again. Fans of the genre can really grab it now or wait for a rare sale of this game.So all in all, this game is great and ..... WOLOLO!			",354,28,0,38,26,0,79

												The best Age Of Empires in my opinion. I've played Age 2 it's ok. This involves much more ""brainpower"" if you want to get good. Been playing the game since it first came out. Big fan of the series. But age 3 brought an entire new perspective to the franchise. Has sold the most copies out of all the Age Of Empires series. And to me is still considered the best RTS still. Starcraft2 can't even compare to it. It's got loads of diverse civs to fancy you with. And always a new strat and a new way to play being thought about in this game. And the home city cards adds WAY more strategical options.			",31,0,0,3,7,0,5

												I had this game (sans expansions) as a series of burned discs I would occasionally borrow from a friend. I say friend, what I really mean is ""guy I sat next to in visual basic."" Regardless of who he was, I got to play AoE3 from start to finish back in highschoolWhen it comes to the third game in the series, most people completely ignored the good about AoE3. I recall all my friends going on long, nonsensical tirades against AoE3. Mostly due to two things. The first, and most often bi*ched about, was the new twist on gameplay. AoE3 gameplay is basically the same as the first two games except for one major difference; the home city. The home city is a mechanic in AoE3 that allows you to recieve relief supplies from your civs capital. Everything from general supplies (wood, meat, gold) to extra soldiers (some of which can only be obtained from the home city.) Why this mechanic should stir everyones bile, I will never understand. The second was the story. AoE2 had several campaigns in which you controlled historical figures and reenacted historical events. AoE3 has a single campaign (unless you have the expansions) centered around a shady, almost illuminati type group trying to seize control of the fountain of youth. Pure fantasy, but well written. My friends though, sh*t on it. Back then, AoE players were a bit like todays SMASH players. Speaking of multiplayer...Microsoft has decided you must use there servers to play online. As far as I can tell, you cannot play LAN and you can't host your own internet server. The real problem is that microsofts servers dont seem to work, as they are down almost all the time. Check the community hub for details. Fortunately (for me) this whole multiplayer clusterf*ck doesn't effect me. I mostly play skirmish.Another issue is the price, what is with some companies (bethesda and microsoft) that they feel their games don't depriciate? Age of Empires 3 was released in October of 2005, and as of the writing of this review, it costs 40$. 40 f*ckin bucks for a game released ten years ago, holy sh*t, the price has dropped a grand total of 10$. One dollar a year. Buy this game on sale, or from a bundle. I do reccomend this game, but if you are paying 40$ for it, you are being ripped off.			",306,56,4,44,28,0,26

												AOE III is a great example of a game that was very good and (in my opinion) had lived up to is predecessor. And then Microsoft♥♥♥♥♥♥on Ensemble Studios and shut it down, very much abandoning the AOE series (And the F2P games don't count) The game has an intresting card system that could have been reworked, possibly with the decks being used in competetive while casual games would be very simmilar to how they were before.8/10			",227,47,3,27,44,4,48

												This is honestly my favorite game ever. I have logged more than 2k games on my old account starting about 2008 up till last year when the complete addition came up on the humble bundle and I started playing with a  new account. I don't play as much due the time needed ( I like long economic battles) and the lack of players at times. This game got me into gaming consistantly and PC gaming in general. If you like RTS games this is perfect for you. If you like FPS this is actually pretty fast paced. Easy game to learn, hard to master, still can't get the Germans and Russians to work.10/10, One of the greatest game ever produced. Wish the developers were still around.			",22,2,0,3,3,0,21

												This is an excellent RTS (real time strategy game) unfortunately you need friends to play this game with you as all players on the multiplayer are ranked really high and kick you instantly when you are a newbie, it's not fair but it's the way it is. Hoenstly the game is a little over priced, i only purchased it when it was on offer. Otherwise i can't see myself buying it. I put this up there with Warcraft 3 and Command and Conquer Red Alert 2.

So I will definately recommend the game. If you've never played any AOE, you're missing out. It's a great evolving strategy game. Absolutely brilliant.But don't pay 29.99 for it. That's ridiculous.

Well, if you put it on easy you don't even try. You WIN no matter WHAT. NO tactics, just start, quick colony then victory. This is why youu should NEVER press the sandbox difficulty and RARELY the easy one. Sorry if this is long, but at least I hope it is useful for you :)			",33,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I absolutely love the AOE series. It's grown up with me (except, it didn't really grow up much... it kind of stayed very much the same - which is the great thing about it). So I will definately recommend the game. If you've never played any AOE, you're missing out. It's a great evolving strategy game. Absolutely brilliant.But don't pay 29.99 for it. That's ridiculous.

												I have been playing Age of Empires series since I was very young. When I saw that this collection of third game has appeared on Steam, I didnt hesitate with getting it.Age of Empires III is a real time strategy game set into colonizing the New World to industrial revolution. Game is divided into Campaign, Skirmish mode and Multiplayer. Campaign is divided into 3 parts for each expansion and vanilla game.In single player skirmish you fight against AI in randomly created maps. After game you gain experience for your home town and get better units and upgrades. It has kind of appealing RPG like system to keep you playing. Multiplayer is practically same except that you cannot use your home cities and profiles from skirmish to keep the game balanced. Even that I must warn you. Multiplayer is filled with veterans and very experienced players. I recommend to host game with your friends to enjoy the best experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a GREAT game. a little out dated graphically, and in some ways can become somewhat repetitive. but the gameplay itself delivers a well balanced tactical strategy, that changes with every new round. Factors such as locations of resources, natural land obstacles, the strengths and weaknesses of which team you play as, which team you are playing against, and timing of every move all come in to play. If you are looking for a graphically superior game, this is not for you, but if you are looking for a well balanced game that tests your wit on decision making and productivity, this is for you!

It has a good skrimish play for both causal and returing players, there's mutliplayer for experienced and pro players but also has lobbies for causals, and has a descent campagin. Which most games these don't have (First comment).			",21,0,0,3,3,0,2

												8/10. It's really tactical, you usually don't just hop in and kill everybody, the physics are kinda funny. The campaign is good. Why 8/10 then? Well, if you put it on easy you don't even try. You WIN no matter WHAT. NO tactics, just start, quick colony then victory. This is why youu should NEVER press the sandbox difficulty and RARELY the easy one. Sorry if this is long, but at least I hope it is useful for you :)			",33,0,0,0,3,0,0

												I know many who love the original Age of Empires games (especially #2) hate this game or mock it for not being like the others. I grew up on Age of Empires 2 and it remains to be one of my favourite games of all time. Unlike the others I love this game as much, maybe even more, for fixing the small issues in the other games and generally making a more polished product.  The campaigns are more exciting and the combat more visceral. The expansions add many new civilizations with a whole new set of playstyles the likes of which the franchise hasn't seen before! The point of this short review is to convince people that the naysayers are wrong and that this product is the perfect swan song for Ensemble Studios.			",221,39,3,30,24,2,43

												An amazing sequel! Better graphics, better game play better everything! Age of Empires 3, has a very fun levelling system which each level you gain special cards that will give you perks for your colony. These can be customised into the players own 'deck' which then can be used while in game on multiplayer or skirmish, and it’s amazing. This immersive system really brings the thrill of a well planned strategic battle, keeping you hooked for hours. Although the multiplayer setting is extremely harsh on new players, you may have to spend half your time trying to find a lobby that will allow you to join; once you've reached a reasonable level, the game is at its peak. 10/10			",167,31,0,28,16,2,17

												Age of Empires III is not a proper sequel to AoEII, lets just make that clear at the start, even the developers admit that the game started development under a completly diffrent title and the AoE label was only forced on it by the publishers.Overall, the gameplay is decent, the grapics are good and it's got a very nice single player campaing, the multiplayer is fun but is dragged down a bit due to the persistent city leveling system.I'd say it's a good strategy game, it's not a good AoE game, but on it's own it is still decent.

												If you're planning to play this solely for the single player then get this game on sale. If you're getting this for the multiplayer...eh. I wouldn't recommend this game for multiplayer because not only I forgot my login account (which is very stupid btw imo to have an account when AOE2 didn't), but I keep getting ""Failed to join game"" message. I'm from the US and was able to play with my European friend once before, but after that I can't play multiplayer with him ever again.			",76,9,0,27,4,0,4

												Age of empires 3 was both a step up and a step down from Age of Empires 2.First of all I love the graphics sure i mean they're great and all but I miss the old mechanics from Age of Empires 2.The popular scenarios on this game are so much better than Age of empires 2 and that's a fact.The home city tab and cards made the game alot more interesting i mean without them the game would pretty much be♥♥♥♥♥♥So before you post your hateful reveiws why don't you buy both age of empires 2 and 3			",9,0,0,5,5,0,6

												Shame this franchise died but great last game to go out on. The jump to the 3D engine worked well and enjoyed the more personal black family story rather than the historical campaign of aoe 2. If u like this time period definitely pick this one up too rather than something like Empire total war. Would recommend to all RTS fans			",42,8,0,19,30,0,29

												While the game itself is great, the support for it is abysmal.Had an account issue and couldn't login, tried to contact support for weeks and all I got was a canned ""go to this link"" response. The link, however, no longer worked.Still haven't gotten the issue resolved, so I can't play online.So it's fun, as long as it works, because once it stops working you're on your own.
