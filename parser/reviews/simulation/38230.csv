												Robbed. I actually feel like I have been mugged by the developers of this game. The HD update has rendered the game completely unplayable as the main screen turns into a bizarre white glow so that nothing is visible. Such a shame as this game is so much fun. Seeing as this has been the case now for nearly 6 months (since the HD update) and the developers have done NOTHING to rectify the situation, I am not holding my breath for a fix anytime soon.Stay away.

												Agree with the guy who said he got mugged!After a long struggle I finally managed to get this game working and I spent more time trying to fix it than playing the actual game. I had major issues trying to run this game. First of all it would just crash on start up so run as Admin. Then I run the game and I get a glowing white screen! So I goto graphics options to see what I can do. I decide to put graphics up to high and turn off the glowing effect. There's 2 options to switch off for glowing effect.For some reson what I did completly messed up the game and crashed everytime on start up. So I give up. A few months lather I re-install my OS and decid to try it one more time. It worked! but I still had a glowing white screen! So I carfully changed the glow settings (dynamic lighting or somthing) and everythhing seems to run ok! From what I gather the graphics settings are saved seperate to the actual Hotel Giant install root folder (It was for me!) meaning that even a re-install of the game would not reset the games graphics  settings to default. Leaving me with graphics settings that crashed the game and unable to change back. Normally these settings are saved in a text file somewhere, so If anyone else is having these problems maybe your graphics settings are causing it and the only fix is to find that file to manually edit (which strangly is not in the Hotel Giant install directory nor Steam/apps/common/HotelGiant2) or re-install OS (which is a bit overkill just to get this crap game to work)This is just terrible and to me this code is all broken. They released an update a few months back and this was not even touched upon?			",92,15,0,15,14,1,21

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  Hotel Giant 2 HDDeveloper:  Enlight Software Limited & PerspectX 	Publisher:  United Independent Entertainment	Genre:  Economic SimulatorGeneral ImpressionHotel Giant 2 was released in 2010, but received in 2015 an HD update which has met a lukewarm reception. And with good reasons too. While the game looks very good for an economic sim, it crashes quite a lot (so I definitely suggest saving your progress every 30 minutes or so) even without the visual and sound glitches that were never ironed out since its initial release. If you can overlook these flaws, you’ll find a thoroughly efficient hotel simulator which lets you control everything from planning, building and managing the financial side of business as well. The gameplay mechanics are far from broken and you can find an educational purpose to this title. So don’t avoid it, thinking it’s a bad or generic game. It’s far from it.Strong Points+ Nice graphical details.+ Complex economic simulation.+ Steam Achievements.Weak Points- Relatively frequent crashes and glitches.- No Steam Trading Cards.Rating 6/10 This review was submitted for Imperial Reviews.

												I played the original Hotel Giant ten years ago for dozens of hours. It was very fun to decorate and have 100% satisfaction in all rooms and make thousands of dollars to make more hotels. This game is pretty much the same with a few new additions, and it delivers the same experience but with full compatibility with Windows 10 and full HD. I recommend this game because I loved then and I still love it. This a budget game thought, so it's pretty basic and doesnt provide much of a challenge. Is all about making an hotel, dominate the market and make millions of dollars. I did it once with a chain of motels in Hotel Giant and I'm very excited in doing the same in Hotel Giant 2.

												I played the original Hotel Giant for hours on end as a child and I adored the game. This game has improved on every single feature.Good Stuff - 1. By the looks of things the black screen and the glowing screen problems have been fixed2. Lots of different strategies to choose from3. Choose what sort of hotel you want to build - You can build a crappy♥♥♥♥♥♥hole like London or a stylish, luxurious, beautiful place like Oslo.Bad Stuff - 1. Guests always have complaints. You can do absolutely everything they ask you to do but oh no theres always another problem. In other words they are never ♥♥♥♥ing satisfied. Ungrateful♥♥♥♥♥♥♥br>2. I hate the fact that you have to pay money to be able to add bars, games rooms, coffee shops, etc.Overall I rate this game 7/10 ",14,0,0,1,10,0,4

												Folks, if your screen goes white at main menu, just go to options and take off 'glow effect'. I tried this on the recommendation of other posters here, regardless of the negative commentary and my game is fine, and totally playable. For it's time, Hotel Giant is a pretty seamless experience. I've played worse games, and I did enjoy this one. Sadly, it seems it is the only one of its type out there, so we have little choice in the matter, if you want to be a Hotel tycoon. Pro's: Great graphics, reasonably easy building system, and still challenging getting your coverage up to 'all rooms full'. This version, being HG2, includes a lot more shops...originally, there were only three, now there are a good few more, including 'Arts & Crafts', Coffee shop, and some others. More content added that I might not have seen yet, as I am still enjoying my playthrough. Cons: It does seem that the punters don't give a damn if the room is done out in a hundred mismatched materials, if only all the top priced furnishings are used ..which gives them nothing to complain about eventually, but also means you can't do the decorating completely your way, from a colour scheme pov.  Also, there is not enough micromanagement of any service available in the Hotel. I'd also expect cleaners, if nothing else, but I guess we can't have everything,Overall, it's still a good time sinker while you play it out. For a mere fiver and change, it's hardly vast in content, so you get what you pay for.  I'll still stand behind it, as a 'Good Old Game.'			",1,0,0,3,7,0,1

												You start the game as a small two star chain hotel manager. For you, life is cheap and your hourly rates are cheaper. Little by little you slowly devour customers and their possessions until you reach critical mass, allowing you to bribe hotel officials and pushing you up a star rating.Upon reaching a grand total of fire stars, the hotel drops the pretence of accommodation and uproots itself from its earthly bounds and begins rampaging through a downtown of your choosing. This is where the game really flys off the deep end interms of balance and replayability. Sure its cool watching a Novatel claw its way up the Chrysler building and swat angrily at bi-planes, but after the first time it gets fairly stale.The controls are dodgy and sluggish (You're a fifteen story hotel, I guess it was intended) and the concept is frankly ridiculously. I got it for a buck. Don't bother. There are better sentient building simulators out there.			",167,21,1,20,29,2,41
