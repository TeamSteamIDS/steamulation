								On this first version Physics are good but the collision is not.  Ball can go through or ""peek"" through the paddle which makes it feel like you're not really hitting it. I think this game has potential and it's pretty fun but the ball peeking throws me off. The environment is nice to look at I just hope the ball through paddle gets fixed in an update.Update:This game has gone from almost refund to my main ping pong game.  It took a while for things to click.  The updated version is better because there's more options.  The game still plays great.  Best PP game for me.   I knew it had potential because the physics are good and that's the hardest part to get right.			",84,12,0,2,17,3,1

								Ermergersh... I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was! I'm gonna be the Pong Champion!..This game is pretty rad, the controls are easy, there are several different difficulties (which are actually realistic, in that the beginner mode is pretty easy, but the intermediate mode was hard enough to give me a challenge, and the expert mode was tough enough that it'd take me some serious training to win a match).  The modeling is nice, and the physics are the most realistic of any ping pong game I've played, I mean, you can actually put some heavy spin on the ball.  The only thing I wish was a little better is the tracking on the opponent's paddle, sometimes it seems a far stretch that they'd be able to return a fast spike from the resting paddle position.That being said, this game is about as close to real ping pong as I can get, without standing behind an actual table. Would definitely recommend. ",42,2,1,2,0,0,5

								I have played every VR table tennis game I can get my hands on.  Pong Champion is absolutely worth the money.  It is quite playable as of the previous patch and maybe just as importantly, the developer is actively interacting with users and really working to take their feedback to heart as he prioritizes and adjust the engine to feel better and better.  Would I pay fifty bucks to play this game right now?  No way.  Would I pay 50 bucks for this game if it fully realized its potential and included multiplayer?  Hell yes!  Would I invest in the game to see if it meets that potential?  Well it was about 5 bucks and I did.  I hope some of you do too!			",129,19,2,20,20,4,22

								I consider myself a VR Pong connouissuer (didn't spellcheck that). I can say without question, this one is the best. Best graphics, best physics, best AI. Buy it!			",59,2,0,5,0,0,8

								This game was fun, reminds me of when I played as a freshman in Colledge.  I like the expert mode, because the computer hits it back at you like a real challanger.  Also the spin hits in this game are real.  You can put a strong spin on the ball and it feels very realistic.			",50,3,0,4,0,0,4

								This is the 3rd VR Ping Pong game that I've purchased, and it's my favorite. The physics are a little better, and I think it's the only game that allows you to put some spin on the ball as you hit it. I also like that the physics adjust by the difficulty that you play. So on easy the ball is huge and moves slower. On the harder difficulties you get more realistic physics.			",62,8,1,1,13,2,6

								Might be good one day, but that day is not today.I get that this is Early Access, but this is not even playable for me since there is no option to reorient the table I have to stand at the very edge of my playspace, which means the cable is streched.Honestly, at the very least get a meny with this sort of simple stuff before launching EA.I'll do another review once I can play it without pulling out all my cables.Edit 1: Although this edit is a bit late I finally tried this game again, and being able to reorient the table at least made it playable :)And I enjoyed a few rounds, with the AI slider in the middle the the competition was at a good level for me.Although almost two months later I would have hoped that the game would be a litte bit more polished, aside from some UI tweaks (which aren't much better than last time I played) I didn't see any difference.The music is very annoying after about a minute, since its like a 30s loop. And there is no variatino in anything, aside from the table moving about a little bit. I want more arenas (think world championship type arenas with audience), I want an actual opponent, not a floating racket. Maybe a hand model for the non-racket-holding hand.Sorry dev, I think the base physics of the game is good, but right now due to not much happening I'm calling vaporware :(			",46,10,2,2,9,2,0
