Early Access Review
								I'm using the rift/ touch,  with two sensors. Upon firing the game up it seems like it's well suited for the touch controllers. The play area looks cool and interesting. I noticed some performance issues which shortned my play experience with it (motion sickness).  I'm running on a gtx 970, I7 4790k, Most games run well on my system but at lower settings so this could be due to lower system specs but my gut says that it's just an early access optimization aspect.  About half my shots would go up in the air and flop down onto the lane without much momentum. I suspect this is due to some kinks with performance they're working on. When my shots did register as expected it was really cool.  I could see myself playing this alot when it is more fluid. One critique I would like to offer up is that it is mentioned this game is suited for room scale/ standing/ sitting experiences but currently I think it is only suited for room scale.  Perhaps they are adding ways to accommodate the other play styles? Personally I think that is really cool to aim for because I'm on the rift and while I have some mobility in my room, until I get my third sensor,  I like being able to warp around as needed.  This allows me to orient my game experience to my living room layout on the fly. For instance, my living room is wider than it is long, so I would prefer to be able to rotate my game orientation so that the direction I run towards the lanes to shoot is along the longer direction of my living room layout. Overall I'm excited to see where this game goes.  I love vr games like this.  As the development progresses I will come back and update my review.			",64,12,0,9,6,2,5

								[Bias Review][Tried to be as Unbiased as Possible]====================| Simple Spec Sheet ||Graphics| 980ti|CPU| i5-4570 @ 3.6|RAM| 16gb Corsair Vengeance 1600mhz-----------------------------------------January 20, 2017-----------------------------------------I can definately see the progress that is being made on the game, and I think it is going in the right direction.The most important thing I have noticed is that I stay at a consistent 80-90 fps, with 0 lag spikes.I appreciate the addition of an options menu to turn down different sounds.As of right now the video quality options aren't easily accessible (read patch notes for more info)I also appreciate the option to use animated or regular pins.Criticisms: ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---I think that the touch pad is cluttered, but maybe that is just me.I think you should be able to access the option menu during a game. I wasn't able to.I think that naming players needs an alternative way to use the keyboard. Pointing and clicking is far too tedious.As of right now there is still no trailer for the game. ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---   ---The game is a lot more fluid than it was a month ago, but I don't think that the development is going fast enough. It took almost a month to get this essential update out. My advice would have been to fix the performance issues and option menu in a ""patch"" and then do the content additions with an ""update.""-----------------------------------------December 27, 2016-----------------------------------------Looks like it could be a great game, but i am getting the performance issues as mentioned by other users. Disregarding the performance issues the scene i got to see looked great. It felt  like I was in a real fictional bowling ally that for some reason only has a minute amount of lanes.I would recommend:A high quality trailer (currently no video on steam, and the one video I saw was very low production/low quality)Option menu ASAP (the continuous moans and gasps of the pins can get annoying)Fix performance ASAP!! The framerate currently gives me a headache)I am not returning the game because I am related to the devsFinally, why is Free to play in the tags? This game is most certainly not free to play.

								I understand its an early release but the game is glitchy and laggy even with a I7 - 6700k and GTX 1070 Strix.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
