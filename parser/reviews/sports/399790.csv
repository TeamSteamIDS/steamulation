YouTube™ Video: Indiebitably - Destiny Warriors: More than likely a scam, definitely a ripoff of Naruto.

			I review the game Destiny Warriors and detail some of the very suspicious activities around it and its developers. Original review on...		

Not a well made game at all, a user called HappyPanda calling themself a ""game promotion company"" was handing out free copies of the game code and telling people that they are influential members of the community and would love it if a review was left (edit: somebody accused me of making this review because I was salty I didn't get a code, I was actually one of the people he sent a review code to and I am clearly in no way an influential member of the gaming community and you have never heard of me unless you've killed me repeatedly on another videogame) and that they would be handing out copies of a game called Road Redemption next week. This same ""company"" has left a positive of the review after logging 0.1 hours, basically playing long enough so that steam would allow them to leave a positive review (edit: HappyPanda has mysteriously decided to actually log time into the game after this review came out, almost as if he now realizes having a positive review with between 0-6 minutes played is a dumb move). The review also says ""Seems to be well worth the price so far"" worth what price? He's the ""game promotion company"" handing out free copies of the game so he clearly didn't pay any money for it. The same people that are handing out review copies leaving a positive review is sketchy at best, it seems like a ploy to get positive reviews in at the start to scam people into buying the game. Edit: The user HappyPanda is confirmed to be a dev for Road Redemption (the game they are handing out codes for next week), whether they are a dev for Destiny Warriors I am unsure of but the the fact that they are hiding that they are devs when reaching out to people and calling themselves a ""game promotion company"" just makes it all that sketchier. Onto the game itself: Not good. Storyline: Lazy ripoff of Naruto with cringy dialogue and a ridiculous amount of grammatical errors. In one of the first scenes, you meet one of the characters named Kitt his own name is mispelled everytime he talks while everyone else says it properly, this no longer happens in later scenes, there are constant grammatical issues and entire words missing from the dialogue. The actual story: There is a Kage of the Grass village who sealed rampant beasts inside children (sound familiar? keep reading). Your main character is a slacker/klutz type put in a squad with someone classed as a ""bookworm"" despite him clearly being the strongest and macho-esque one in the squad. There is a girl healer and a male who is LITERALLY classed as ""The Emo"" just so they can have the Sakura-Sasuke relationship thing going on. The first mission as a squad? You must collect a bunch of bells your squad leader has hidden...bells. You could literally be finding ANYTHING but they couldn't be arsed to even change it to something besides bells. Gameplay: Not good, abilities have little or no animations that make no sense to them at all. A ""clone x-tu"" (jutsu but they clearly couldn't even bother to find a new name for it so they just wrote X-tu) is literally just your character walking up to the enemy and attacking it, there is no clone of any sort. A fireball is just a random burst of fire where the enemy is standing. They haven't even programmed in the ability to choose 2 targets on abilities so your 2 target abilities hit random targets, sometimes targets that aren't even alive anymore. Enemies do little to no damage and spend half their turns defending and just dragging the battle out, one mob does about 20 damage when it attacks yet when it poisons a character they take 100+ damage a turn. Oh yeah, your characters start out with an absurd amount of health and level up at an insane rate despite killing the exact same weak enemies. Your main character does around 100 damage with his standard attack, the enemies you encounter at the start have about that much health. The kicker? Your characters do not actually have any weapons equipped when you get them, not even a basic rusty sword or anything which is just plain lazy and makes me wonder what in the hell are they infusing when they use weapon enhancement abilities? The majority of the ablities are lazy renamings (your non-clone clone jutsu also has thunder clone, fire clone, etc. variations) and have animations that don't match them at all. Based on the clips provided on the steam page it appears that even later in the game the damage values barely change if at all.  Overall Impression: Not worth the time, I quit after 40-something minutes because of how bad it was and I was trying to push myself to give an accurate review. Hell, if you really want to try it go contact HappyPanda he'll probably give you a free copy if you say you'll give it a good review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recycled RPG Maker maps and it doesn't look like anyone even attempted to proof-read what looks to be written by a 12 year-old.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
