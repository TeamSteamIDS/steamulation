												don't even think about the rating of the teams in this game it doesn't matter.  the ai is also set to only foul if you get close to them.			",92,22,8,14,13,3,10

												Controls are shotty at best, the gameplay doesnt flow, will probably give it a second chance. I am going to bank on my terrible knowledge of handball as to why this game isnt very good. It feels a little dated but I am no snob. I purchased on sale for fairly cheap. Everything feels like this was a game made by accident.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not understand why this game gets such poor reviews. I am an avid sports gamer, and I love the old along with new. Yes the graphics are dated, but the gameplay is not. I really enojoy playing this game as it is unique and I only saw a bit of this sport while stationed in Germany. If you are like me and an overall avid sports gamer, this game is worth getting for your library. This game is not for the faint of heart, it is challenging. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT COMPARE THIS GAME TO THE LIKES OF FIFA, MADDEN, THE SHOW, OR 2K SPORTS.IHF IS IN A LEAGUE OF ITS OWN, WHAT I TERM AS NOVELTY SPORTS GAMES.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
