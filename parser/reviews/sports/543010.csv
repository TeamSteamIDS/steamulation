												Ok. I can't explain how HAPPY I am to have a Hockey game on steam. Maybe now I can get rid of my Xbox One and NHL 17... I'm not so sure. I love the Sega Genesis style, but it just feels to be lacking. It is really hard to switch players. I wish it was more acurate and when you switched players it selected the player closest to the puck. The puck to ice physics are meh. The puck doesn't slide enough. The controls are not horrible, it would bve nice to polish them a bit more. I understand the Sega feel, but it just feels a tad clunky still.I really hope the devs stay on this release and we see some good patches. I would LOVE for them to eventually add ONLINE multiplayer, even at the barest of bones. Just let me play a match. I don't need rankings/leaderboards ect, it would just be nice to form a communtiy around this.If the devs read this, as I think I am the first person reviewing this, PLEASE continue to support this game. It has a ton of potential, even more so with a DEAD sports section on PC (Look at Rocket League). I'm loving it so far, and I for sure watched the leaked footage on youtube and still purchased Day 1. Please update this game!Edit 1: I'm happy to see the day after release they have already updated the game and acknowledged the issues and fixed them already! Keep it going devs! But uh, why do I have to go through the tutorials multiple times? lol.Edit 2: Today they updated the game, yet again. The list is extensive. Would still love the online multiplayer. I feel alone. :( Maybe even a shoot out mode. Keep the updates coming guys! This could be THE hockey PC platform game. There's no other competition ;p			",117,17,4,10,12,5,6

												Even if this game isn't without flaws, I would still recommend it to any hockey game fan out here. It has a lot to do to be the ultimate fun and violent hockey game to get, so there's my pros, cons and wishlist about this game. Pros Unique visuals and overall 70s ambiance The ability to develop as a team in Story mode by gradually unlock controls (alot of people hate this one, but I think      it's a fresh way to learn control and add challenge to the game) The soundtrack  Ultimate fun hockey couch gaming with friends experience Overall humor here and there in the game Cons Clunky player selection (not fluid and intuitive like old and new nhl games) Forced tutorials during story games (suggestion in the wishlist) Some bug here and there (who's probably gonna fixed) Wishlist Online mode Unlock the controls and do the tutorial during team practices instead of games (could be shown in the calendar) Instant replay (even nhl 97 have this function on the SNES) Practice modeOverall, this a good and fun game for the price. It is perfect to play with friends in coop. If you want this game to be better and to offer more content, back it by buying it. You're not gonna help the game by leaving bad reviews because the game dont have features you didnt pay for. Play it, leave decent comeback, and be a part of the community.			",76,6,7,4,12,1,0

												I love that theres a hockey game on steam but I dont like how you have to unlock controls . I dont like how the GK makes a save and you cant control him when he has the puck. He just dumps it to the side of the net.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For 12 bucks this is a great deal, with only one real negative. The negative is that you have to do this odd story thing where you have to unlock moves.  I get what they're trying to do, it's cool you play more you unlock more modes, and skills.  But this is very clunky way to do it, and it's not fun having to get on fire three times, and score with same guy, just to complete a primary objective.  Win the game 9-1? Doesn't matter if you weren't on fire 3 times and fought the goalie...  I've won same game over and over, but have only managed to score 2 on fire goals so I'm stuck replaying this rather early game just to advance to learn and start fighting.Having said all that, this game and story are really fun, I played three hours straight and it works better than ubisoft games on release day! Looking forward to seeing where this game goes.  If you liked the movie slapshot you'll enjoy the random stories that are told as well.  8.5/10 with potential for a 10will update review in future as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all, the lag on the controls is just awfull. I mean awfull. Having played hockey games for decades, this has far the worst lag on passing, shooting etc. It's a fun game no doubt, but really a mess from the start when starting the tutorial. You have to pass all the tasks given to you in order to get the advanced controls but at the same time you are supposed to use use the rookie controls but for my part they didnt work but insted you get the advanced controls with only passing, wrist shot and body check. Which all have a major lag in them.Be prepared to lose games in the beginning from left to right. The AI on rookie level is skating past you anywehere on the ice since you don't have the boost ability.....due to rookie controls, not advanced.I had high hopes on this game to be straight forward and fun. I did not expect any simulator hockey, but after 10 games I just quite. It's not fun due to the lag on the controls. And the fact that you cant use the same tricks as the AI in the beginning.

												The game is great, old school gameplay and that feel is there. NHL Â´94, Blades of Steel, Ice Hockey, you know it. The story mode is a great idea excecuted badly: it's just not fun that you can't do all the moves from the beginning. It's not fun to watch AI hooking your guy and you can't do it back because you haven't unlocked hooking. Just frustrating. I think skating speed was okay but goalies should hold the puck, not just shove it behind the goal all the time. Maybe we should even be alloved to do the opening pass, not just AI doing stupid passes randomly.Overall a very, very welcome release to long gone genre of arcade hockey. Get it, support it and they might make something really special of it.			",130,42,4,22,11,2,46

												For fans of the oldschool hockey titles, this game is an absolute gem.Lots of fighting, very few penalties, and a wry sense of humor coming from a clearly small, yet dedicated developer. There have already been several patches since release, constantly improving performance and quality-of-life.It won't replace big bad EA any time soon, but hey, we finally have a hockey title made this decade for the PC, and it's a ton of fun!

												It's a decent enough approximation of a hockey video game for the asking price.  Suggest they patch this soon to address the sluggish controls and tweak the story mode, because the occasional line brawl or ridiclulous goal isn't enough to look past the major flaws.  And if you DO score a ridiculous goal, get a good look at it because there's no replay, which, come on now.EDIT:  I still recommend this game (on balance, it's pretty fun) but if you score 20+ goals in a game, it will crash right as time expires in the 3rd.  That sort of sucks.			",43,3,2,6,10,2,7

												After a few hours of play to write this, I will change it from time to time hopefully.I've been waiting this game for a long time, since the trailers in fact. + Nice atmosphere and cool ideas+ Soundtrack is great (ft. Leningrad Cowboys and more !)+ Story plot has a lot of potential+ Devs are reachable- Tutorial and Story Mode shall be separated, in order to play a full season (or more!) with full controls and really get the Brews to the cup (or  more cups!)- Controls are a bit slow/dull, and I'm not very harsh with them in the first place- Goalies are complete robotsRequests :=> Multiplayer=> Custom leagues => ADD TEAMS (and their players) THROUGH WORKSHOP (I've been told by devs it was a possibility for the future)=> Team customization ? (Kits, gloves, helmets, etc... )=> Be a Pro career in the style of NHL, I know this is a tough request but it would be such a great thing !=> Radar ? Or at least a way to see where teammates are, so I don't end up doing weird passes to the opp. defense. I'm a little bit disapointed about the story mode, as it should not be a tutorial for so many games.Controls are weird but I might get used to them, I've played a lot NHL14 and I've always set the speed and stuff to be as realistic as possible, making some controls very hard. I feel a bit the same here on OTH so it's ok atm. Team AI and goalies AI could be improved, I find it hard to set up plays in front of the net. Also, goalies are robots that never freeze the puck and release it on the side of the crease. It's predictable and can bring weird plays.I love the ideas that drive this game and the overall atmosphere, which is why I bought it. Also, it's quite cheap atm. All the above make me think I would recommend the game, but it might be worth a wait to see what's tweaked and eventually added in the coming days/weeks/months.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game honestly has a lot of potential. I'm so happy to have a hockey game on PC and be able to play another hockey game aside from NHL. But there are some cons with it as of now. There is lag with the controls and you actually have to unlock the advanced controls. So basically you are playing on rookie controls while the AI is on advanced. The Story Mode is a very cool concept. I was wondering why my team was so bad in the beginning but then I realized it's supposed to be that way and your team will get better down the road. I do recommend this game, however, be aware that there are some bugs and chances are you won't be an all-star right when you jump in to your first game. At least I wasn't and still am not. Aside from that, I think this game could be really exciting. They definitely need to add a multiplayer feature though in the future.			",29,4,0,5,4,2,2

												Basically ""Slapshot: The Game"". Don't expect NHL17... this is old time hockey for sure. It's not about crisp passes and fluid skating -- its about beating the crap out of the other team like the good old days!Yes the tutorial can be a little tedious just to unlock certain controls, but understand they locked the controls to show just how bad the Brews are in story mode, and as you unlock more controls you gradually get better because you can do more. I don't fully agree with this method but its whatever. Still a super fun game. Most of the negative reviews are taking this style game way too serious. It has its flaws for sure, but this overall a very well done game from a brand new developer.			",70,21,5,4,26,4,1

												Ok I'm going to start by saying I really like this game and with a few tweaks this could be a great game. The problems that I have with this is the skating, passing, AI, and faceoffs(Advance controls). the skating feels so sluggish, I feel like I'm skating in slush. The passing is nice just why is it every time I make a pass my player comes to a dead stop to recive it? It should be one fluent motion right? The AI is relentless... especialy in story mode. Ive only scored 1 time in the 5 games Ive played, and the AI has not scored less then 10 in each game. When I shoot the puck its either glass, post or out of play. Which moves me to faceoffs, extremly difficult to perform in story mode. As stated earlier I'm not doing so well, haven't won a single faceoff (Advance controls). I know this game hasn't been out long and I still have to work at it, but when I can't even get pass the tutorials I have to believe that it my not be just me.			",10,0,0,0,1,1,0

												This game needs a lot of help.  Sluggish controls.  Quit my first match because I was down 10-1 in middle of the 2nd.  Controls are just way way way too slow.  I'll try it again in a few weeks after they've patched it up. But this game was not ready for release. Has huge potential. But like the trend in PC gaming, they release it and collect our money then we end up doing the final beta test.Another thing. Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesn't my team chase loose pucks?  Puck gets loose in the defensive zone and 99% of the time I can't get to it because my teammates are frozen.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is broken asâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥I'll come back in a week or two, try it again. If they can figure out the control lag I'll gladly give it a thumbs up.			",87,6,7,5,5,2,9

												I desperately wanted this game to be great and wanted to put money behind hockey on the PC platform - sadly this title just doesn't cut it.The good:Fantastic presentation, hockey card collectables, funny (if not a reptative commentary), and I kind of like the low graphic cell shaded look.The bad:   Gameplay...  Controls are sluggish, the AI (especially on goalies) is horrible,  advanced controls are locked behind a tutorial wall that is annoying to play through, and lack of multiplayer.    My suggestion to the devs - go back and play EA's ""3 on 3 NHL Arcade"" game they released a few years back ... that's the control feel you need to hit if you want your game to be sucessful.   Doesn't need to be that fast but it it needs to be that fluid.			",192,47,7,15,40,5,31

												Old Time Hockey has a steep learning curve. You can play this game wrong. I was for a time. It honestly felt like the game cheats and it kind of does at times.You get into the game and immediately, memories of NHL on Genesis/Mega Drive come to mind. You play it just as you remembered.And then you proceed to lose hardcore. After several frustrating losses, the game's title will remind you of what this is: OLD TIME Hockey. You need to be aggressive. Not just in scoring, but to others. You WANT to get into fights, you WANT to bash people's faces in, you NEED to. Rack up that injury report as high as you can. Once you discover that? You'll realize Old Time Hockey is a wonderful return to classic hockey games but not so much as to be a simple retread. It has its own identity and style that Hockey fans will come to adore.This is a game I can highly recommend.			",249,12,16,13,48,2,43

												Okay so the cheat code that lets you play Story+ (pick the team you want) put me from ""hmmm...okay it's fun'ish"" to ""hey I want to play this now!""  Don't get me wrong, the story looks like it will be interesting, but I'm really digging picking a team I want to play and doing a season.  Granted there's some things I would like to change (team management, line changes I control, etc.) but it's not what they're selling--it's a great little hockey game where a lot of love went into the teams, bio's, etc.  Great fun and if  you like hockey I recommend it.Pro's:Feels like your controlling the players on the ice and not hopped up jitterbugs.You can't just skate past someone and expect the puck ""not"" to get picked.You can choose to hook, slash, hip check, check, poke check...imho this lets you push the edge and risk a penalty.The sound effects and music clips capture an older era of hockey and sells it.Various control schemes.Controls feel responsive (Xbox 360 pad here).Con's:I'm not a fan of the weird on fire effects, glowing net, etc.  Just not for me.Forced to play one team in Story mode unless you put the cheat code in (or beat it on Story first).Sometimes team mates seem a bit ""daft"" and won't do what they should (note, don't see the other team AI doing this).Goalie doesn't cover up...like a puck vending machine.  ;)			",385,54,3,59,45,3,77

Product received for free
												The game features a story mode that follows a local hockey teamâs tale of redemption. Each match has objectives requirements (either learning controls or achieving specific statistics) that are ridiculously difficult to meet; this results in extremely frustrating matches that must be replayed over and over until you luck out and roll easier semi-random objectives. In addition, the advanced control scheme doesnât unlock until you have progressed far enough in the campaign, restricting your options in the exhibition mode. An easy solution would be to remove mandatory objectives and simply reward any achievements with experience points (a mechanic already in the game). The game also lacks custom seasons and online multiplayer. The control scheme (designed for a gamepad) involves somewhat complicated procedures for shooting, passing, defensive maneuvers (hook, slash, check, block), and fighting; more simplified control schemes are also available (though the story mode requires the advanced controls to be used). Player movement in the game is satisfying, and the hockey itself is entertaining to play. Line changes are automated, and penalties are rare. Momentum may be gained by leveling the opponent three times in a row or gaining a power play, which allows for more powerful shots and hits. The friendly players lack intelligence on defense, although this is possibly by design. Despite the generally solid gameplay, frustrating mandatory campaign objectives cast a dark shadow over the rest of the title.

												- One-Timers don't exist in the gameplay.- There's an excessive amount of fighting, which is hilarious, but the actual fighting is way too clunky and basic to be as frequent.- Veteran mode doesn't make the game harder, it just makes my team's goalie worse.  The exact same shots, breakaways, and ""outplaying"" I do just doesn't work.- When there's a rebound, the character isn't done with his cooldown so he can be activated to touch the puck again.- The gameplay is fairly slow and laid back to begin with, and the controls can't even keep up with it.  All fixable.The game is awesome.  So far, not too excited about the remake of an old style, but not keeping up with the actual old time gameplay.  Looking forward to all the tweaks which could make this game something I play at least once a week, forever.			",17,1,0,0,1,1,2

												Good game. Tickles a nostalgic nerve for older gamers and hockey fans. Instead of NHL teams, it features a fictional league with it's own lore. It looks similar to the EA hockey games you grew-up playing in the early to late 90's, but it lacks much of the depth and features. The controls cannot be re-mapped, but there are a few different pre-sets to choose from. I was able to pick-up the game and immediately outscore the medium level AI-competition just as if I was playing NHL '96 on Sega Genesis.  The game does not control as well as those old classics, but it's not as bad as most of the negative reviews claim. Although you can set-up and play exhibition matchs, the game focuses on it's 'story mode', which puts you in the shoes of a pre-chosen 1970's era failing bush-league hockey team. This mode is more interesting than it sounds, but having to playing the season with the same pre-defined team may not lend itself to replayability. Hopefully there are other unlockable modes, or the unlocklable ability to play the story/season with a team of your choice. Besides that, the game features nostalgic-looking fictional hockey cards to collect/unlock, and a surprisingly good soundtrack. I don't write my reviews in point-form. That's for people with 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'. If you read all this, you've earned yourself some pudding.			",513,111,16,44,115,14,61
