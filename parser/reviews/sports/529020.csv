Early Access Review
								Bear in mind, it is an early acess game.And like with any early access game, by purchasing it you will greatly support the development of the game and speed up the progress towards a final release.The core game is really nice and though it lacks a bit of content now, I'm confident that the final product will provide a fully digitalised version of the sport orienteering.Briefly:Positives:+convincing running simulation, just like running IRL+graphics+weather settings and night/day time settings+online course and results sharing+course replay, well done!+customisable settings for map and course+menus have a nice appearance, especially the earth screen when selecting country+close interactions between community and developerNegatives:-limited content (so far), only two maps, no city scape terrains..-online sharing is a bit messy-no map converter-match between map and terrain not always perfectTargeted players: if you are aiming to learn orienteering, improve skills for the real sport in front of your computer or just want to compete in a digital version of the sport, this game is what you seek. If not, I don't see any reason for you to buy it.in depth:If you're looking for an orienteering simulator, this is it. The essence of orienteering is brought into this video game making it possible to sharpen your technical skills despite ailments that hinders you from doing it IRL. What makes the game really enjoyable is the online course and results sharing which challenge you to compete against other players. As for now the game only provides two different sets of terrain/maps which makes the experience a bit limited. Although the ""orienteering"" works nicely on these two maps, there is a lot of room for improvements when it comes to the different in-game menus. It's a bit bulky to work with, both finding your way through the different options and learning how to use the course builder takes time. There are some tutorials uploaded to steam and youtube to get you going faster. The online course list is a bit of a mess and not all courses uploaded by players seem runable even. The course builder does, despite it being a little tricky to comprehend at first, provide a lot of ways to customise the races you upload. There are certain presets of map appearance such as brown for example and beginner tools like position assistant to mention some of the features that you can add to your race.The actual ""orienteering simulation"": The running seems very natural and the running speed vary with respect to terrain/map symbols as well as steepness of the ground just as it does when doing it for real. There is even direction disturbance applied to make you loose your direction when running through dense vegetation and so on. Obviously A lot of things have been taken into consideration when simulating the running in this game which makes it really convincing.The map handling takes time to get used to however. You can rebind the keys if you want but there are a lot of commands to handle the map. I find it easiest just to use the ""focus on current leg"" and the ""scroll"" to manage my map handling. It takes practice however. But all in all, the game really accomplishes a good orienteering simulator, which makes it a great tool for practising in that sense.Terrain: Very beautiful. There are a lot of options when it comes to weather and time of day which is really nice when you want to add a nice atmosphere.When it comes to map generation: There is currently no map converter implemented and as I understand, there is no promise there will be one available to the ordinary user in the future either. The current maps coincides well with the generated terrain with the exception of some smaller height/brown details that I found to be missing while playing around. Hopefully the developer finds a way to respect those details, which probably were'nt on the lidar data from which the terrain was generated, during future map converting.The Virtual-O community together with a very engaged developer makes it easy for you to ask questions and/or add your opinions to discussions held on either Steam or facebook forums. If you encounter problems with the game the support will help to resolve these as well as ask for any bugs you find. Interaction between user and developer is close which encourages progress of the game.To summarise: There is stilll a lot of content missing and some rough edges that needs polishing before this game becomes a fully fledged orienteering simulator. But seeing as this game has just launched as an early access, with the quality it currently holds, I'm sure that the finished product will be well worth its price. The game is a bit expensive compared to other steam games and if you're hesitating about buying it I recommend to wait and see how it progresses. In the meantime I and those of you who decide to buy it will have a pleasant time running each others courses, competing to become the very best. This is really what holds the fun whilst the content is limited!			",13,0,0,4,2,0,4

Early Access Review
								TL;DR> definitively recommended if you are an orienteerer, but way overpriced otherwise.Virtual-O is a orientering simulator, and that is all it is. If you know what orientering is, and have done it before, you will get a simulator that is much better than any other orienteering simulator on the market (as those are a decade old). If you do not know about orientering, this game will not work for you, since it requires you to have a lot of detail knowledge about map symbols, control symbols, how to use the compass, and how to do a course. It is a great game to improve map-reading skills and route choice strategies, especially since you get a chance to see how the good players (and there are already some playing this game right now) do it during the replay, which you might know from the TV coverage of the world championship but might never have seen for your own races.There is little help in the game right now for beginners, safe for some very high-level loading screen tips; you will be thrown into a course and the tutorial only covers how player input works. (If you quit the course, you can enable an option that puts the compass to  where you are - which is about the most important thing to get right in the beginning - but that is not very obvious.) This can result in a rather frustrating experience, especially if you take on difficult courses. The game is clearly targeted at good orienteerers - if you are completely new to orienteering, you will have to read a book on the sport in order to be able to play it at all.What this game does really well is to simulate how movement in the terrain is impacted by route choice. If you take a shorter path through heavy bushes, you will be slowed down a lot, and also loose your bearing easily. This is much more like actual orienteering (well, to the extent a computer can replicate it) than I've experienced in other simulators. It makes it much more important to do smart route choices and relate the map to your surroundings, and you will not get far by just aligning the compass and running forward all the time.Right now, the game offers two maps, which are of pretty high quality. How many more can be added remains to be seen, and there is no community-based map creation yet. In that regard, the game is really early in its development, and it is not entirely clear that this can be solved in the future. The problem is clearly the quality the game already has: a fully automated map import will not produce quality on par with the existing maps. Further manual work is required, for which the developer would have to add a rather complex level editing into the game, or provide it alongside - which might be hard to accomplish. Since courses (on the existing maps) can be added by the community, you can play this game for a while before it gets exhausted, but after a few hours the maps will become familiar. The price-tag of 40â‚¬ does not reflect that, and clearly conveys that the game is a special interest game.If you know orienteering, and have done some courses in real life, and want to improve your map and route planning skills, get this game. It comes much closer to the real-life experience than the other orienteering simulators, looks much better, and is a great opportunity to compare your route choices to other orienteerers.If you are new to orienteering, this game might be a way to get started if you want to invest the offline learning of map symbols and how to use a compass. You'll have to accept that usability can be a bit tricky then, but there are options on a course re-run that will help you.If you do not know orienteering (and do not care), you should not buy this game now, since it will just give you a frustrating experience and not do anything to get you hooked. As a mere walking simulator, the game won't be fun at all.Or looking at the price tag: if you are wondering if upgrading to a headlamp with 6500 lumen will improve your orienteering performance, get this game, it will give you good value for the price. If you want to try out orienteering without getting lost in a real forest, wait a bit till the game gets on sale or has its onboarding improved. If you say ""this is the same price as Skyrim these days, how do they justify having approximately one hundredth of the content?"" then, by all means, do not buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Virtual-O is still in it's early stages, but I do want to write a review on the game in Early Access. However some of the negative things I write here are hopefully gone within the next weeks and months. To start with the postitive feedback. This game is the best game in the world for orienteteerers to train on their tecnique. Old games like catching features, can't compare to the realistic terrains and map handling of this game. The graffic is outstanding compared to old games of the same genre. So for the people that can't get enough of orienteering, this game is a must buy. For me as both a hobby orienteerer and gamer, this game is perfect. but if I was only one of this things, I wouldn't recommend it, atleast for now. The reasons for this is that there are only two maps, and without the possibility to create your own terrain from your own maps, you will pretty soon feel that you have ""completed"" the game. I'm sure that the developer will get more terrains out soon, but the game isn't going to be really excellent untill you can run on your own maps. For example in your own home town. So the avarage orienteerer aren't really going to be completely satisfied with the game as it is right now. If I was only a gamer, this game would be so hard to learn properly. If you like a big challenge, maybe you would like it. And you would learn a pretty important skill to have in life. How to get from A to B using a map.However, for most gamers this is not a game to buy, and I know that wasn't the intesions of the developer either. But I do personally belive that when the game is developed to it's final state. It has some potential to get some none orienteerers in to the game. But then there will have to be a course for beginners to orienteering that will learn you the basics of the sport. As of now,  this isn't really a part of the game. At least not good enough.To end on a positive note. I do feel like I'm actually running orienteering while playing this game. That's how realistic it is. And that is why I recommend the game. I personally are going to play the game untill it's stops being developed. And if it in it's final stage are awsome. I'm probably gonna play it for decades.			",12,2,4,1,19,1,6

Early Access Review
								tl;dr : Buy this game if you are orienteering fan. Buy this game if you want to try orienteering and you don't mind the higher price. Wait if you want a complete game with lot of content.If you're an orienteering fan this game is a must buy for you. If not but you like reading the map and want to try orienteering in comfort of your home you will like this game.  Graphics are suprisingly good for such a niche game, and running feels very realistic.  Just be aware that the game is still in early access and as of now does have only two maps, but they are very well done. And there are plenty of courses availlable for the maps, so you will have plenty of hours of fun and the course editor is easy to use, so you can make your own courses easilly.The developer is very good at listening to the community and implementing requested features.

								Good thing:-Really good grafic that you can't compere with other O-simulators.-It has not been any bugs or wronge with the game for me.Missing in the game:-A map converter, so it's possible to run in more places.-Be possible to run in more contries. (Heard that is comming).-Split-time results, so it is easier to see in seconds the different for the route-choises.Bad things:-The slopes isn't always fitted to the height-curves.After all this is an Early Access, so I think it's going to bee much more changes in the game to it's complited. In the begining the price seem a little bit high, but with some after thinking, it's not a very high-requsted game. So thats affects the price.So I recomend the game if you like orienteering, because it's the best orienteering simulater I had play qualitatively!			",2,0,0,0,1,0,1

Early Access Review
								Even though Virtual-O is only in Early Access at this point, the playability is already great, time just flies while playing. The graphics effects are awesome, especially when also turning on night/fog etc. It is possible to set your own courses on the existing maps as well, as well as playing somebody else's course. For active orienteers, I can clearly see how this can improve their orienteering in real life as well (I know it will improve mine!), in particular when it comes to map memory.The main limit at this point is the availability of maps (there are only two). However, these two maps are quite extensive (and in particular the Czech one is hard), so I have many hours of play left before I know these to well (the availability of maps, and knowing them too well after a while, is a problem in ""real"" orienteering as well). Some features are hard to see (in particular ISOM 509 Narrow Ride, as well as controls in pits), but in general, the terrain rendering reflects the maps extremely well.For players with no previous exposure to orienteering, of course there is a learning curve in learning the map symbols. I recommend using very easy courses that mostly follow trails at first (again just like a beginner would take up real-life orienteering). A suggestion would be to add some simpler maps, like urban orienteering sprint maps, but of course these would require additional rendering features.I can strongly recommend getting and playing Virtual-O. I am not particularly fond of most computer games (just too boring after a while), but this one I know I will spend many hours with.			",0,0,0,0,1,0,0

								Tutorial works but none of tha maps (2) seem to. I am an adventure racer/gamer and am hoping this will be fixed and I will give feedback to help make it work. Right now I can do nothing but the start tutorial. Game crashes is I try to load on of the two maps.update: the maps are now loading and things seem to be running smooth. Thanks to the prompt responce from Contours (DEV) for really caring about the what people have to say.  I am looking forward to seeing it evolve.			",13,2,0,0,4,0,2

								Is this game worth the price in early access? Probably not.Will it be, as it develops in the future? Most definitely!As my review fell a little bit short, I quote a tweet of Donald Trump about Virtual-O: Dishonest media says Virtual-O won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly.
