												I bought this game for two reasons: it was ridiculously cheap, and I recognised the type of game it was and thought ""I haven't played one of those in a while"".Why the thumbs down? There are plenty of flash games on the internet that do this better, and of course for free. It's a very simple formula, and yet this game manages to mess it up.1.) First time running the game, I was treated to a splash screen advertising a different game by the same developer, complete with embedded youtube video. (I understand they were giving it away for an email address, but still guys, this is bad).2.) This was followed by a config window for resolution that can't be accessed from within the game.3.) Navigating the menus with the mouse was frustrating as the pointer displayed as higher on the screen than it really was. This meant having to guess where the volume bar was to lower it, and in some cases clicking the button above the one I wanted to click to get the desired effect.4.) The 'tutorial' level gives you controls, but doesn't really say what they do. I was plonked on a planet that I couldn't leave using thrust alone, instead having to toggle gravdrive first. I'm still not really sure what this actually did.5.) Those purple lines. Oh god those purple lines. These are horrific for three massive game-ruining reasons:a.) They constantly move back and forward in a swaying motion, standing a really good chance of giving you a horrible headache after about 5 minutes.b.) As the lines are all parallel and always in the same direction, it makes it really difficult to accurately judge the boundaries of the area they surround. Just from the screenshots you can see this. Look at the stage in the shape of a 'W'. Where do the edges parallel with the lines even start? It's not where they're purple, because the space between them also kills you, and the lines are constantly shifting....c.) This is the worst part in my opinion - the purple-lined 'death zone' only kills you if you go a certain way into it, which isn't marked in any way whatsoever. From part of the trailer I thought that maybe just the purple lines themselves would kill you and you could maneouver between them, but this isn't the case. There is an arbitrary distance which you're allowed to travel over the lines. Worse still the game actually depends on this and gives you levels early on that require you to skip those gaps, with no way of knowing how far is too far. It frustrates me that a game like this can make any money at all. Bugs can be forgiven, but this is just an absolute masterclass in terrible design. tl;dr - I spent more time writing this review than playing the game, and I also had more fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think it is a cool game. I just picked up the full game and it is a bit of a challange! It feels retro, while fealing current. It's a fun game and i sugest it for it's 2$ price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
