												Super old game here, so you can't really judge the graphics but for 20 years ago it's pretty good!  For primitive 3D graphics, it is impressive.

			Here's an ancient relic for you! This game was made 20 years ago. Some of these really old 3D games are hard to play but I really enjoyed this one.		

I just tried it out and everything works as you would imagine.  I was able to use an Xbox 360 controller right out of the box, and the split-screen works fine as well.  Even has networking modes which you may be able to get working at some point, essentially the game is untouched as it was released in 1995.  Was able to use keyboard or mouse controls as well and there was no issues there, the learning curve is quite easy on this one.  All sorts of various gameplay modes and upgrades are available.  If you look at the screenshots and like what you see, then the game will not disappoint you, but only recommended for those looking for the retro PC gaming experience.
