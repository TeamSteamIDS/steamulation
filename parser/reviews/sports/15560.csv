												When I first started the game up, I was very sceptical of it. Everything from the name, the intro screen to the actual gameplay struck me as cheap and plain bad. I went through a few levels, the whole time thinking ""What the ♥♥♥♥ am I doing?"" and quit.I decided to jump back into the game again after I felt pretty bored. I started seeing a pattern, and I was actually enjoying the randomness of it all. I understood what hugs, kisses, thumbs ups and obscenities did. I was just dumbfounded when I saw that I got 2000 Teeth after a level, but then I figured out it's just basically points in order to unlock other levels. After that, I started getting a lot more into it.I passed most of the normal levels, when I noticed a button at the bottom of the screen, titled ""Awesome!!!"". So, I clicked on it, and another full page of levels popped up. The same as the regular ones, but here you unlock them by getting knees instead of teeth. Except, these ones were... pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ intense. Compared to the first levels, here you were falling at supersonic speeds, straining hard to concentrate on the mess of colors, patterns, beeps and clicks as you flew past the actually beautiful world. At first I thought it was a dumb game, very relaxed and easy, but boy, some of these levels are  tough! . I found myself more dedicated to passing a level than in any other game I've ever played, and I kept going for more!Overall, at first glance the game seems very bland and stupid and random. But it slowly starts taking up shape in your mind, making more and more sense. The real fun starts when you get good enough to start the ""Awesome!!!"" level pack, because some of the levels nearly caused adrenaline to seep out of my skin.I'd give this game a very strong 9/10, because it does take a bit of time to get used to the weirdness of it. But, trust me, once you get a bit more into it, the game really shines, and is insanely fun.			",220,40,6,17,34,2,21

												My nomination for ""Best use of gravity"" in the 2016 Steam Awards ;) This is a light-hearted quick-action title where risk meets reward as you base jump through a floating city, maneuvering through terraces and around buildings while trying to accumulate points. I think the developers did a wonderful job with this title.I suggest picking this game up when it goes on sale(for ~$2 or ~$3) as it is easily worth a night's great entertainment, especially when you or your friend are drunk off your♥♥♥♥♥			",2749,1092,86,261,363,24,411

												Ever look over the edge of a tall building and hear that voice in the back of your head tell you ""... jump...""?This game seems like it's entire concept was constructed from that very principle, often called ""Lapelle Du Vide"" or ""Call of the void"" though with a comical twist to the whole idea. The goal is simple, jump from a VERY high altitude (some go as far as space), come close enough to buildings and objects that you ""kiss"" or ""hug"" them without suffering the ill effects of free-fall collision, and try to land safely. BTW, instead of earning coins or something, the main currency you use to unlock new levels is ""teeth""... I don't know why but it makes me just uneasy enough that I laugh every time I finish a level and it sais ""You've earned X number of teeth!""For those with vertigo or who have a fear of hights/falling, I don't reccomend this game as you'll probably find yourself reaching for a bucket every level. To everyone else, I absolutely reccomend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Holy crap. This game is super awesome. It's frustrating as hell--but it's one of those games where you don't mind dying 62 times on the same level, because it's just so damn fun. It's exhilarating and invigorating in a way that I forgot video/computer games could be.I don't know if anyone else had/will have the same experience I had, but on the off chance that it will help: Take the time to tweak the controls and settings. I wasn't crazy about the game until I played the tutorials several times with different settings to find what I liked. Once you hit the sweet spot, this game is like candy. Sweet, terminal velocity candy.Highly recommended. 9/10.			",21,6,0,3,2,0,11

												This game isn't for me and I don't think I'll play it much, but I think a lot of people would enjoy it.The concept is that you're freefalling (BASE jumping) and you have to weave between buildings and platforms, falling as close to the walls as possible without touching them, to accrue maximum points. You also get to smash through score pads, gesture at fans, paint tag, and other such stuff. Then you need to nail the landing in a tight spot, deploying your parachute at just the right time to not break your bones.The skill in the game is to know which weaving path to take as you fall in order to maximise your points and be able to spend them on unlocking further levels. Which group of buildings has the longest walls, which score pads are the most valuable, which landing pad to aim for, etc.I would have liked the movement to be a little more responsive, but I understand that would defeat the purpose of the game.As usual with Dejobaan games, the music is a lot of fun and the game is imbued with a witty edgy mood.Playable with a controller, and that might be the better way to play it.

Title: AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the AwesomeGenre: Action, Indie, SportsDeveloper: Dejobaan Games, LLC Publisher: Dejobaan Games, LLC Release Date: 3 Sep, 2009Lets avoid those broken bones by not falling face first into a building, and remembering you have a parachute on your back.Gameplay Gotta stay close to those objects to get the hugs and kisses! A parachuting/base jumping game where you fall from high heights like the daredevil you are, avoiding buildings yet kind of sticking close to them for points until you hit the ground for points. You can do stunts and daring  falls – the idea behind it is pretty entertaining and stomach dropping if you've ever had the experience yourself of parachuting, since you can feel the buildings rushing past. The response in the game for your character is good, and the visuals are not hard to follow. There's nothing like flashy neon lights as your character plunges to their potential death because they really like jumping off high buildings.The controls are not adjustable which is bad for me as I use an azerty keyboard, the game is awkward to play smoothly like this. The settings are inflexible. I wouldn't mind an option to be able to change the controls to what I want.  Also the moment the game gets harder, I think it would be better to play it with a controller, rather than a keyboard. I don't like the layout of the pre game screens too much, though that's just down to personal taste. I think it looks a bit cluttered with the numerous squares/spinning squares, but the playable part of the game is addictive, plunging down those heights and trying not to accidentally splat myself on a building. I have to say I wasn't sure if I would like this, so I'm pleasantly surprised how addictive it is.I find the terminology/language of the game amusing. “Mash face against mountain.” “Collect teeth.” “No broken bones?” “You aren't dead! That's grand!” Small, witty one liners make me happy on the inside, I admit it. It's hard to play but rewarding for your progress. A game doesn't need to look amazing or be complex to be good. And there seems to be a lot of game time available,  and a lot of levels. I wouldn't keep playing it  continuously for hours, but I'm more than happy to go back to it and play it in-between other games, or for half an hour or so at a time. It's fast paced and lets you get stuck in almost straight away.What I find annoying is how far back a level/save point resets if you die, which can mean you have to refight tough monsters you already killed, and repeat a lot of content, which could make it stressful fast. Though there is a sense of achievement getting past those ANNOYING OBSTACLES.ProsLots of game time/content to get throughGood priceWitty one linersAddictive ConsNo adjustable settings/controls for a movement based gamePre game layout isn't so attractiveTL;DROverall VerdictI think it's worth the buy and play, as long as it's in a bundle or sale. There's enough here to keep you going for a while when you're bored with your other games. If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group! ",628,256,9,95,99,4,82

												Once I played the original version of this, I knew that Dejobaan are the chaotic neutral mad scientists of indie gaming (and that I love them for it). Frantic gameplay that requires that you plan things in order to get the best score, and some surprisingly well-done world building for such a relatively plotless piece (on top of the massive amount of stages for such a price). Overall, I'd recommend it, and it's my favorite Dejobaan game to date (with Drunken Robot Pornography being a close second).			",537,122,8,71,45,5,39

YouTube™ Video: AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome: Steam Backlog 

			Views: 304		

			AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome: Steam Backlog We take a look at a slightly older game ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! For the Awesome"", a game about jumping off buildings.		

Above is my video impressions of the gameAaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome is an interesting game with some pretty simple mechanics. It's all about jumping off of buildings and accumulating as much points as possible. The game features a ton of levels and features to unlock, with some pretty eye catching aesthetics.The game is simple and that is both it's strength and weakness. It's easy to jump into and will grab player's attention very quickly, but because of it's extremely simple design, it could possibly lose the player's interest just as fast. It's really upto you to decide whether or not the game is worth your money.Pros:- Good looking- Easy to understand mechanics- Can be thrilling at timesCons:- Overly simple- Might not hold the attention of some players			",1483,525,23,180,133,13,163

												This Game is absolutly amazing, it totally understands what it is trying to do and does it perfectly. The only question is do you understand what it is trying to do?If you are wondering to yourself 'wait in these clips it seems like you could just go on the outside of these courses' the anwser is yes, yes you can. And have absolutly nothing in your way so you can master the movement without getting frustrated. Getting frustrated? THE GAME HAS A SOLUTION TO IT!!!!! It will go through breathing exersices with you to calm you down. This game does not take itself seriously it knows from moment 1 that it is made for fun and the challenge is there if you want it, but only if you want it. This game has a huge varitety making me reccomend it to casual gamers and Hardcore gamers because you can progress from level to level fairly easily for casual but if you want to 5-Star every level it will give you a good challenge. Getting the movement down to a useable level is really easilly but mastering it is really hard. I absolutly love this game from start to just leaving it in your library for every-once-in-awhile play.			",45,5,2,3,1,1,4

You probably wont play for 2-3 hours nonstop but its really fun for the 20-30 min you will usually play.

												Date: January 28, early morning hours.Context: About to go go to bed.Cannot say too many positive things about this game.  It feels like the skydiving portions of Pilotwings without the charm and with a much more unintuitive control scheme.  If you're going to make a game about BASE jumping in which the only remotely challenging aspect of the jump is the landing, landing controls should not be 100% opaque and incomprehensible.  Also the music is unfathomably bad.  Basically, this game is a great representative of the early days of Steam, and its perceived success is owing to the fact that it was one of the first indie games out there, at least as far as I remember.  Difficult to recommend, unless you love aerial acrobatics and have an easy time figuring out controllers  Verdict: Immediate uninstall.			",271,101,2,58,42,4,46

It's a skydiving simulator set in a Tron world on acid by way of an infant subversive through and through.  The controls are just tight enough to make it work and it gets pretty intense down the road.The Oculus Rift support doesn't hurt, either.

												While this game is a blast overall, it's even a greater experience in VR with its excellent Oculus Rift support since the days of the DK1, later adapted for the DK2 in full and updated regularly. I've actually gone as far as launching this game in VR during my work breaks. It's one of the best games to have a VR beginner try, as the feeling of falling is not only comfortable, but oddly relaxing and somewhat addicting over time.A great, challenging concept overall. Excellent sense of humor. Driving sound tracks. Prime time VR support. Much safer than actually jumping off buildings in a wingsuit.			",118,17,6,4,16,0,1

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! ....For the Awesome, the Anti-Platformer!! In this game you will do all in your power to AVOID landing on them, as you leave every platform far behind!I nearly made a mistake with this game (beyond thinking the dreadful title actually said something about the game, that is): I read the reviews. Then I read the awards it's won. Then I considered the type of games I enjoy most: pinball, Puddle, FOTONICA. Flowing, limited control type games. Actually, the decision was easier with more information. And I made the correct one.WHAT  a game! While some call it ""boring and repetitive"" how can the possibilites of every building, tower, mountain in the UNIVERSE possibly be boring! People accustomed to absolute control, who have paid large sums to get games to perform in very precise ways, might not understand how gravity, and a body falling at very high speeds, are forces beyond simple control. They should play The Collider, a fine game with a similar basis. In THIS game you are being pulled by the force of an entire PLANET! Control must be earned, and learned....Basically, after completing some ridulously simple tutorials you are given a building to leap from. On the way down you gain points by coming close to objects, coming VERY close to objects, hitting score-coded, colored glass plates, and not smashing to boney, bloody bits. By succeeding, and obtaining enough points, you will reach awards of 1 to 5 stars. Each star pays off in ""teeth"", the currency used to unlock new levels, of which there are more than 80. Teeth can also be used to buy things like the ""flip-it"" glove, to either give a thumbs-up to fans, or the opposite to haters. Yes, of course, granting additional points. Once you have fallen as far as you feel is safe, a player opens their ""fins"" in order to glide safely to a smooth landing, possibly on a high-scoring smaller target. All movement is performed by mouse and the ubiquitous WASD keys (or controller.) But one must keep in mind that despite the availability of directional keys, a falling/floating body will ultimately move forward, to the exclusion of most other directions or intentions. One quickly learns the power of ""spiraling"".You may also unlock tongue-in-cheek ""relaxing meditations"" (for significantly lower prices,) or (so far) a cookie recipe from the strangest old, pseudo-cannibal lady ever. The purpose of spending teeth is not just new levels and objects, but access to yet more, since you must unlock an adjacent level before opening a new one on a tall, turning ""level drum"". Prices increase with progression, and only hints are given as to what will be found once a choice is made.There are also many bits of BASE jumping trivia, at no cost, basically to fill out he wall. A!FtA (for lack of better) does have achievements, but mostly for putting in the time, and only ten of them. Not a lot can be done to actively pursue them, other than sitting in a dark room, slowly wasting away. You know, the usual.IF this is your game, it is VERY much your game. A marvelous, funny AND fun game. So much fun as to not provoke the rage tendancies that will cause me to ""delete local content"" almost immediately. No two jumps are likely to be even remotely similar, since the distances fallen can be great. For me, it's almost as much fun to die as to win. Almost...(Like many Steam games, offline game time is ignored.)4tdc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I might just be terrible, but I don't find this game any entertaining at all. Sure, there's a bunch of content, it's challenging and scales well as you go through it, but I never really found it too entertaining. Not a big fan of how it looks, or the humor they're going for, or the way the menu works and looks.			",614,131,17,65,42,4,59

												A Puzzle game about a base jumping person. Or is it an adventure game. Or one of those arty farty indie 'life story' games about a suicidal person falling to their death and realising how thrilling life can really be when you do something spontanious. Cheered by the thrill of falling, and the daring of spraypaints and high fives from observers. No idea.What I do know is this game is a strange kind of fun. The idea is simple enough - fall from a great height and collect as many points as you can before you hit the bottom. Be daring and 'kiss' the lips of buildings, spray paint your logo wherever you can, wave to your fans are you plummett and make that soft landing. The more style you put into each trip to the bottom equals more money; more money equals more goodies and unlocks. Simples.There's a strange sort of anti-oppression narrative tacked in there too, for those who seek reason for madness. However, it's a lot more fun to just pick up and play this game in small bursts. Long play throughs will probably lead to burn out. No joke.That's not to say that this game doesn't have it's frustrating moments, but that's more to do with the game's levels and ramping difficulty rather than any ill-fated design decision or game breaking bug. So, if you're looking for a 'pick up and play' kind of game that can fill a 10-20 minute gap here and there then I do believe 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome' could be the game you're looking for.It often goes cheap in the various Steam Sales too, so there's always that if you're really unsure about picking it up.

												Welcome to the first ever falling simulator that ive ever seen. I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone whos looking for a real good time but others may have a different opinion. For what you pay this game is very basic allowing you simply to fall while avoiding obsticles with the more risk you take earning you more points.  You start with only a handful of maps to choose from but you have to earn points to spend unlocking other maps.  This leads to alot of repetition just to allow yourself access to more repetition. The cost is made up for by the number of maps you can unlock as the game progresses but I dont find that to be all that worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game really comes into its own once you have got competent at all the basics and played most of the basic mode levels then charge in to the 'awesome' mode which is much faster and honestly even more fun. Just like in real life, hugs and kisses are very moreish, and in the week I've been playing it I keep wanting to come back to it for about an hour at a time. Plus I keep getting amusing chat reactions to 'Gagaman is currently playing AaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!' which is a bonus.			",122,17,3,1,1,1,5
