												I am a long time player of Blood Bowl, starting with the 2nd edition of the tabletop game, through to the nineties MS-DOS computer game, to not-Blood-Bowl-honest Chaos League and finally Blood Bowl 1/Legendary/Chaos. The thing I loved about Blood Bowl 1 was the single player options, from creating a custom league, to participating in a classic competition from Blood Bowl canon, and of course even playing a proper full career, clawing your way up the rankings over the years, up against all the famous classic teams of Blood Bowl lore, winning cups and trophies along the way until eventually, hopefully, winnng the Blood Bowl trophy itself.Now comes Blood Bowl 2; the graphics are prettier, but graphics aren't everything. The part that matters to me, the gameplay, the thing I loved in Blood Bowl 1 is... gone. The single player campaign is a shadow of what it was before. You can create a custom league, but there are no proper tournaments from Blood Bowl canon, and certainly no proper career. You play a few games in a single tournament, and then you are done. And the classic teams don't even appear in these leagues anymore. The whole thing is clearly obsessed with multiplayer, to the point that even in single player games the game still looks, feels and plays just like the multiplayer version, with randomised AI team creations clearly trying to pass themselves off as player teams. But it doesn't work. To take examples, the Broad Axes team might have the emblem of a Bugman's tankard, while Bugman's Faithful might have the emblem of an axe. Eh? It's randomisation gone mad. It makes no sense. And as I said,  there are no Reikland Reivers or Gouged Eye or Chaos All Stars. Unless you play the introductory ""tutorial"", or single one off matches without continuity, you will never see the classic teams of Blood Bowl lore at all. That's just not good enough. For me, without the ability to play a league or proper career with your own team against the classic sides of history, the appeal just isn't there.  And there are other disappointments. You can't improve/modify a player's armour any more. Many of the other options of old just aren't available. The font is -  to my eyes - some horrible thin eyesore - and the UI just ugly, literally not pleasing on the eyes. Meanwhile the commentators Jim and Bob now insist on actually appearing, but just get in the way. In short, while this game might be a multiplayer's paradise, it doesn't work for me. Maybe Blood Bowl 1 spoiled me, but to my mind Blood Bowl 2 is several steps backwards.Now this might sound like I'm some kind of hater. But I am a fan of Blood Bowl and for the sake of the franchise I sincerely hope that people out there are enjoying this, and I wish the game very well. I do want this to succeed. But the single player aspect desperately needs work. The single player game is an opportunity to offer players content that multiplayer content cannot provide - such as a proper career.  But it simply doesn't. For me personally, Blood Bowl 2 is a big disappointment, and until the single player game is improved I will be sticking with Blood Bowl 1, because unfortunately, for solo play, Blood Bowl 1 remains far superior.

												Blood Bowl 2, Learn to salt again.Played several games now and I don't know what to think. It's sure prettier than Chaos Edition (Blood bowl 1, all add-ons), and the client seems more usable. But there is so much in it that just irks me. This product doesn't seem to deserve its price bracket:-Fewer teams, I know more are coming, but I also know they are going to be add on DLC at an as yet unknown price. At £35, thas a bitter pill to swallow. It also makes some teams indirectly weaker, with all but one of the current teams being relitively tough, or having easily available tough units, this makes a block/injury focused team less affective.-Lack of assets, there are only 2 spectator models, ork with drum and human in armour. Stadiums are all identicle until leveled up with small differences that have nothing to do with their starting theme. Players have only one model and sometimes an alterable face (per unit type obviously).-Poorly thought out UI. For the most part better than BB1 but with a host of new flaws that I'm hoping will be fixed dispite being identified early in testing and still being there now. For instance, team purchasing, in which you ask players to purchase units without allowing them to pick extras. This means that new players will end up spending all their ingame cash on units without getting vital re-rolls, because re-rolls are purchased later.-Poor single player experience. Yes it is a 2 player board game, but we were promised a decent single player experience. But the ""Campaign"" mode is a drawn out and frackly dull tutorial, while league mode doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that its just a bot game generated at your teams current point value. Combine this with a bafflingly inconsistant AI, and I can't see why I should play this over Chaos Edition right now.			",182,42,3,74,31,6,47

												Having put over 150 hours into Blood Bowl 1, and a little over 50  hours into Blood Bowl 2, I think the game is well worth the upgrade. The graphics are better, the UI is vastly superior, and it's far easier for newer players to pick up the game and learn. There was an issue with the end turn button being in an awful place, but that's been fixed.All that said, there are a few downsides. I do wish the DLC had launched with the game, as it seemed to me they marketed it that way. I also wish the league settings and stat tracking were a bit more in depth, but that's something that could get patched in down the line.Overall though, the game is solid, and I've had a ton of fun playing it. Some might say it's not worth the price, but I've played this game far more than a lot of other games I payed the same, or more, for. If you love sports, turn-based strategy, and fantasy, you'll love Blood Bowl 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, this game is the definition of one step forward, two steps back.So, this is what we get after almost a year of delays. Well, let's get to it, then.Stepping in the right direction:+ Better UI.+ New Race: Brettonians.+ Better Graphics.+ Easy to invite Steam friends to a friendly match of Blood Bowl.Retreading same old footsteps:= The announcers are back, and they are just as fun to listen to.= Solo Old World League is as close as you'll get to the original Campaign.= It's Blood Bowl.= Customization ups the ante with choosing uniform patterns instead of just a single colour, but scales it back again by letting you only change the players' heads.And, of cousre, the backsteps:- No mid-match ""quit and save"" option in single-player, except in the campaign. As clumsy as the old SaveBetweenHalves/Drives->AbandonMatch->QuitWithoutSaving routine was, there was, at least, a way. - The Campaign (Story Mode) is just an extended tutorial utilizing the Reikland Reavers (Human). - Blitz Mode is gone. No more custom gear for you.- Back to 8 teams? Are you joking? Chaos Edition had 23. 23! - No team-specific cheerleaders. Human cheerleaders for everyone!- Very limited graphical options (Resolution, Quality presets, Grass, Spectators). Don't bother. Wait for the Legendary Edition.			",89,8,0,11,4,2,13

												An awful let down, the developers haven't listened to what the community wanted. They've delivered a console-centric game that's currently, and likely to remain, inferior to the original version and not a patch on the board game or FUMBBL. The list of disappointments is too long to go into, though amongst the worst offenders are the console-centric cut down options and UI, the AI that (despite devloper claims) is exactly as bad if not worse that in the original, the treacly performance on decent machines, the lack of visible levelling on players, lack of star players and the temerity to change the rules of an established and hugely playtested game.  Suffice to say i've tried to get a refund for this and would not recommend it to anyone in it's current state. ",185,12,3,34,22,4,48

												DON'T BUY THIS NOW! Wait until the Legendary Edition comes out around about Summer time so that you get ALL DLC included, and the updated version of the game.Really fun game and accurate to the tabletop version. One word of warning for new players though, this is not for you if you can't handle RNG. 95% of this game is dice rolls. Have fun out there :D			",96,35,4,12,12,3,19

Now we have:-Clunky menus fit for a console.-Mysteriously vanished options for saving ingame.-No visual progression on your players as they level up-A total lack of faces for your players. Twins or even triplets in your lineup is a must it seems.-Tiny, no info log.-no singleplayer campaign except for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial ""campaign"".You done ♥♥♥♥ed it up Cyanide!!!

												Traded out quick gameplay for gimmicky graphical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Otherwise it's identical to Blood Bowl I, with most of the races cut out to be sold as DLC and a completely gutted single player campaign.* It's actually a lesser game than its predecessor in every single way other than graphics, and even the UI is klutzy and awkward comparatively.*You can make a league, which is a 40 team elimination tournament. There's an actual Campaign mode, but it's like playing a tutorial for eight thousand games, where your team is selected for you and cutscenes can't be skipped.			",119,16,1,30,14,3,49

												So, I can't recommend this game for several reasons. Although Blood Bowl is a really fun blend of strategy and RNG, the implementation of this is poor. Single player is OK - the campaign is just an extended tutorial, and not actually challenging. Although the commentators are mildly entertaining and most games the AI has some gimmick to keep you interested, its clear the game is geared towards multiplayer. Unfortunately, multiplayer is awful. Matchmaking times are ridiculously long, and  the longer you're in queue, the less the game cares about an even matchup. Using petty cash to even out the odds is inadequate to really level the playing field and allow a fair competitve match. Furthermore the game doesn't use MMR - matchmaking is determined by you're teams gold value, not winrate. So player skill isn't taken into account and experienced players with low TV teams destroy any newer players. Also since there's no real incentive to win, and no penalty for conceding, the leagues are infested with Chaos teams whose sole aim is to kill and injure your players. If you try to injure their players back in return, they'll just concede. Also, the main league - NAF - has ageing on for some reason, which is a stupid rule. All your prized players you spend ages levelling up will eventually retire. Other complaints include a shoddy UI, a distinct lack of teams compared to the previosd Blood Bowl, and the devs being very slow to update the game or add new content. They also seem unwilling to actually balance the game, and allow CPOMB teams to run rampant in every league, which is completely anti-fun. The game itself also runs very poorly, with low framerate and really long animations that are unskippable and leave you unable to do anything while the animation plays out. Often you will run out of time each turn because the game runs so badly. Games also last too long - 16 turns each at 2minutes per turn is 1hr 12mins for turn timers, however ONTOP of that is time for animations/cutscenes ansd kickoff/events/injuries. The entire game feels like it needs to be sped up. For the full price its definitely not worth it. If you're a hardcore Blood Bowl fan and don't mind playing against Chaos/Nurgle every match then maybe pick it up on sale.			",4,0,0,3,3,1,4

												I was really expecting great things from BB2, but I'm sad to say I'm rather disappointed. I can't give it a positive review for now, even if I hope that if some issues are corrected and more content injected to the game, I will gladly change my review.The Good:- Nice graphics- It's Blood Bowl... It's brutal, it's fun, it's challenging. But well, that's thx to the board game rules, the videogame adds little to that.- Cool multiplayer with permadeath: it adds a sense of danger everytime you play, it's fun.- Cleaner HUD. There has been a lot of complaints about the ""player cards"", but I find it not so annoying, it's rather clear and nice.The Bad:- The campaign is crap: you only play 1 human team, with false rules. It's utterly boring, not worth your time if you already know BB1.- The solo content is mediocre: the solo leagues are just multiplayer leagues but with AI. It all feels too generic for me, games are chained without other things to do inbetween apart from the rare level up. It feels really empty.- No player stats: that's the major complain for me, what's the point of playing games after games when you have no player stats (how many TD, passing, blocking, etc...) and leaderboards between all teams?? That's the basic feature missing that is the cause that I don't want to play anymore: I just don't see the point.- No visual enhancemnent when players level up: it's not major, but the lack of all these little features makes that you don't care for your team players, because they stay the same even if they are über strong.- Games are veeeery long: solo or multi, one game lasts in average 1:30 hours... It's too long! For just one quick game, when you don't have that much time to play anymore, you know you must reserve 2h of your time to play just a little game...- In solo, you can't speed up turns like you could in BB1: it made the whole thing a lot less repetitive.- The commentaries from Jim & Bob become repetitive very quick.The Good to Have:- It's not major, but watching the same hit animation over and over when you block someone become really dull after a while, considering that you block A LOT during a match. I would have launched this animation only on big hits like injuries.- Where are the women? There's only 1 female player type + the duplicates pom pom girls. A strong lack of variety here, it's not made to help making women play this kind of games...- Eye candy: different pom pom for each race, a real spectating crowd, etc... What I don't understand too, is why making a big solo campaign with a lot of animation and what not, but for kick-off events you just have one poor line of text where you could have cool animations? (like, spectators trampling players...)SO that's that, my major complaint is that in solo, the content is very thin and don't want to make you take care about your team and see it to the top, and in multiplayer it's good but the matches are very, very long so it's a strong barrier, for me at least.Hope the game will be updated and devs will listen to the community! It can become very cool.			",91,51,6,71,30,9,56

												Blood Bowl is an amazingly fun and deep tactical and persistent tabletop board game. It's the Warhammer races playing american football against eachother, what's not to love? I've been a huge fan of blood bowl in one form or another (BBCE, FUMBBL, tabletop) since 2010 (over 3000 matches played), but Blood Bowl 2 is the one that really brings it home for me. The excellent modeling and animation work give a much more powerful feel to the game than any other form ever has.Be advised that Blood Bowl is a multiplayer game first and foremost. If you get into the game (and you should!), be sure not to spend too much time in single player mode. The 'campaign' is basically a tutorial, slowly introducing game concepts to you. If you want to get playing quickly, you are probably better off looking for youtube videos (cKnoor has a good set of tutorials for the basic rules, and for more advanced gameplay help you can check out my channel)When you do go to multiplayer (and you should!), it's worth noting that the 'main' non-competitive ladder has a fairly low standard of play. People there will concede matches a LOT. If you do not enjoy this, then you can join the champion ladder. While this is competitive, losing matches there will not result in a reduction of your rank as a coach, you can always start over fresh with a new team. Be advised that anyone who concedes more than 5 matches in a season (which last 6-9 weeks so far) across all his teams gets kicked from the champion ladder, so if you want the right to give up and stop playing a match, then this is not the place for you. The real heart of blood bowl 2 lies in its scheduled league play. There are dozens of great leagues around, and if you can commit to scheduling and playing a game per week, then leagues are the way to go.Be advised that when you are new to the game, it is often difficult to tell the difference between someone minimizing risks better, and someone rolling better dice. Blood Bowl is renowned for people cursing at 'Nuffle' (the dice god) for their terrible luck, but with insight and learning, this is truly a skill-based game at heart.Blood Bowl is an amazingly fun, deep, tactical, persistent game, and Blood Bowl 2 makes it gorgeous too!See you on the pitch. =)the Sage			",38,9,0,11,8,2,11

												The game is ok, but give it time to stew this game still requires more work and its slightly over priced for what its worth, pick it up on a sale etc but for now i would not recommend this game. Underneath i put some points i liked and dislikedother players are voicing their issues with the game on the discussion boards i'd like to point this one out as being a really good example with problems in the current build http://steamcommunity.com/app/236690/discussions/0/523897204944724525/The goodThe UI is much better than the previous game displaying the percentage chance on rolls and popping up cards showing the stats of the characters in question are really nice and easy to understand.The commentators are on point with great witty banter.The musics good.The not so goodThe animations are pretty sweet but still very limited, seeing your teams march out at halftime with a low camera is an epic sight to see but there is not much difference in the way characters tackle, so each time your characters makes a tackle regardless of who is around and what direction they're coming from the tackle is the same. Goblins do tackle different from humans etc, but as pointed out, the goblins tackle is its only tackle with no variaton.The graphics have improvmed on the original although not by that big of a deal. Its 2015, the game looks to be on par with Dawn of war 2 and other games that came out about 5 years ago, not a big deal for me still id of liked it to be better.The badThere arent that many teams on launch, even the Pre-order bonus teams arent available on release.The graphics options are extremely limited  with only preset settings such as Very low, low normal high and very high, enable grass and spectators and resolution. Thats it.Volume is the same with 3 options on 3 fixed sliders: FX Music Comments all going from 0 - 10.The Tutorial is once again sorely lacking for any new comers to the game with no showing of how the calculations are done.The campaign mode is a huge step backwards from the original, i prefered where i could pick my own team and lead them through a campaign rather than a single story mode.

												In it's current state, I see very few reasons you'd pick this over the Chaos Edition of BB1.The graphics are significantly nicer, but that's about it. Rules have been changed, bugs are still present, the single player is an absolute joke of a drawn out tutorial, but the killer is there's only 8 teams. I don't think it's so much a problem that you don't have access to more, rather that when playing online, you're only going to be seeing those 8 teams. It gets very stale, and without some of the more ""fun but garbage"" teams, games just play out the same time after time.			",200,53,4,16,18,7,27

												I don't normally review games. When I do it is normally to warn about some issues with early access content. I am writing this one solely because I feel the overall reviews for the game are too skewed in the negative direction. It's a little expensive for what it is if you aren't a huge fan, but on sale it's very much worth it. The game is not easy. Some rolls and some games will be hell. That's part of the fun. You're  best player will someday get killed by rolling a 1 twice in a row, having his armor broken, and rolling dead dead. If you want an easy game this game is not for you. However, the complexity of the strategy and the randomness of the rng are a mix that I personally love. There are a few UIC quirks, like only being able to do borderless fullscreen or bad controller support, but most of these are rather minor issues. The games not perfect, but too many people criticize things that don't matter because they don't like the gameplay or are just bad and don't learn how to play the game. I would give the game like an 8 at least. It's a game that should be enjoyable for most, but for some it will be one of the best games you've ever played and will hold a special place in your gaming heart. Giving a game a bad review for bad controller support when it isn't meant to be played with a controller is just childish			",246,52,3,39,29,7,44

												----30 hrs----I bought this game first day of winter sale, it's been on my wishlist for a while : Campaign is about 15 hours long, and worth the $11 for the game alone.After the campaign you can join solo player leagues vs computer or multiplayer leagues vs players... depending how addicted you get leveling up and learning the game will depend how many hours you go from there. I'm addicted for sure :-)---75 hrs---Don't concede in player vs player matches.. play vs computer til you get confident in how the game works (25-30 hr play time)If you hate RNG then do not play this game.. you will win games based on luck and lose games based on luck once you learn how to play. Skill factors in this game, but no where near the luck factor. Not very often will you get balanced games where it comes down to who the better tactian is, but when you do it's awesome.Each game vs another person takes at least a hour and 15 mins to complete on 3 min turns (slightly less than a hour with 2 min turns)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most reviewers do not seem to understand what they have bought, so let me give it a try.BB2 is a board-game adaptation of the popular GW tabletop/board game of the same name.While the older Chaos edition has a lot more variety in terms of available teams, BB2 improves on the frankly horrible UI, Sound and Animation quality. While one can argue that the older designs are more charming and characterful, the new models are look pretty good, especially for a board game adaptation.The gameplay remains faithful to the board game, while tweaking the rules and resolving some balancing issues inherent to the game. It's debatable whether the developers have succeeded, however it has generally gotten better since the release.The Multiplayer has become more accessible, but as always it is basically unavoidable to get involved with the community and to organize your own league to play online in any serious way. The organization of said leagues and the games has been greatly improved.Real time mode was removed, it was after all a silly addition in the first place.Player customization has unfortunately been somewhat reduced.The teams are pretty balanced, much more than they are in the board game, but imbalance is not a bug its a feature. Beating a strong team (like the Lizardmen) with a comparatively weaker (or less blunt) team is one of the great sources of rewarding gameplay.Both ballplaying teams and bashing teams can win. Ballplayers are at an advantage however and bashers must play with some brain if they want to have a chance. This is not a game of brute mouse skill or reflexes, but rather of strategy and planning. You should not expect that just because you play chaos or orks that you can play like a drunk potato on Ritalin. Surprisingly the fast and fragile teams are a lot easier, which is balanced by their inability to dominate and submit the enemy.For new players the campaign, frustrating hours of crushing defeats or heavy reading online are the three unavoidable options. The game is arguably much more complex and punishing then the genera average and even knowing that the learning curve is unexpectedly steep.So after saying all that what is the fazit?A resounding recommendation.Even though frustrating at times, the fun to be had exceeds most multiplayer experiences I have had in years. The authentic and refreshing hard to learn, harder to master approach drew me in just like the first official videogame adaptation did. If you have a heart for this kind of game, check out the Crendorian Invitational videos on YouTube. Wait for a sale and buy the game. Unfortunately you have probably lost the opportunity to get 4 of the new teams for free, but still, 15 to 25 bucks for the base game is a pretty good deal.			",52,6,2,9,7,2,17

												I've waited a bit to submit an evaluation. I will try being objective.Most of the complains about BB2 came from players that were playing BB chaos edition.You'll hear, that the game is not finished, not enough teams etc etc.Well, true there are only 10 teams released as for now. But they kind of forget that most bought 3 games and a few years to get to BBCE while the first BB was in fact realeased only with 10 races too. And no, you just cannot do a copy pasta from an old game to a new one with new engine and animations. So saying that all was already done for them is just nonsense.BB2 is a remake if you want call it. The graphics are very good, the color choice is well placed. When you look at it, you just wanna play.And you can play! Never had any crash of any sorts, updates, not that frequent, are fixing skills issues. Looks also like the devs are listening to community needs (just read next patch) but are the worst rubbish team at communicating.True there is a ingame real money market (actually you get free coins to spend on that market) but its only eye candy stuff like jerseys. ""Apparently"" they made a mistake by taking some ""free"" jerseys away from players to sell them, and we should get them back.DLC wise, you will need to buy with real money new teams. True, this could come up as a lot of cash if you want them all. One could argue that you only buy the ones you really need!So do i recommend the game?Of course! The game is good and very playable! The game itself is a bloody good game!there are still issues to be fixed true, but nothing gamebreaking.If you really want all the teams just buy BBCE, but dont mind old horrid graphics, and in all fairness ""not so better"" interface.

												I like the graphics and the new format, but mostly play single player which kind of is a joke for now. There is no real campaign or offline mode, and the AI is really, really stupid. It is hard to overstate how stupid it is.I can live with the AI being stupid since it can just get other advantages if I can just have some form off offline campaing.			",75,51,0,39,44,6,71

												Seeing this many bad reviews makes me feel like it doesn't do justice to this title. Note that most reviews do not have a whole lot of time invested in the game.Initially when my friend talked me into playing this I was hesitant to try it, but boy was I happy I did try. The game revolves around the RNG table top version of Blood Bowl and gives a sub story to the all famous Warhammer games. The goal is scoring a touch down, when you are defending you want to stop your opponent from doing that. By any means necessary. This is great and it can get pretty bloody. Some players will try to avoid you, while others try to maim your teammates. Team choice pretty much decides play style. though there are quite a few teams where you have the option of doing both.About the community, this game really shines when playing others. I've seen a lot of negative reviews about bad AI or long wait times in multiplayer. You can solve this by making a league with friends like I did. So far it has been a great experience, we have players with 1500 hour of experience and players like me with 20 hours (when I started). People have been really polite and helpfull to me and I've enjoyed both winning and losing.If you still have trouble finding a proper league be sure to contact me, I'm co-host of the Inner Circle Blood Bowl League and I'd be happy to welcome you.

												I am a HUGE Blood Bowl player, starting with the tabletop game in the '90s.  I played the original PC edition years ago and really enjoyed it.  As far as I can tell, this is a fun, faithful recreation of the Blood Bowl I enjoy.  BUT.  I bought this so I can play against the AI.  That's all I really want to do-- I don't want to use this to play other people online, because I don't want to be tied down for 2-3 hours at a time to finish a game.  And what do I find out?  Against the AI, there is NO SAVE GAME feature.  Meaning, even though I'm playing a solo game on my own terms, I can not stop a game and restart it at my own convenience.  I think this is a huge oversight.  I hate to do it, because it does seem like a good, fun game, but I can not recommend this for other people like me.			",38,3,0,4,16,1,19

												This is a no purely because I like playing against the computer.  If you like to play PVP instead of playing against the AI the game would get a thumbs up.  If however the idea of a long campaign and single player storylines is what you are after, this is not the game to get.  I purchased this game (after owning Blood Bowl 1) because I read in a review that the AI had been improved.  Sadly that is not the case.   I played the entire campaign, over 15 games, and did not get scored on at all throughout the entire thing.  If you like playing against other people and miss the leagues that were in BB1, there are leagues going on here, and you can get some games in that way.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love blood bowl since the boardgame, but this version of it has so many bugs that it gets frustrating. I have had players get KO'd without being hit. The game forgetting to put my ogre on the pitch and worst of all not adding those precious star player points that my team have earned. This does have slightly better graphics and the UI easily better than the first version but the bugs have made me quit in frutstration and concede games on multiple occasions. The AI also has issues by making non-sensical moves, for example, when the opposite team has chance to score but doesnt, even on the last turn of the half. Additionally the menu UI (not the game) has taken a major step backwards from the previous game. As a huge fan I am sad to say give this a miss until either the bugs are fixed or it comes down by at least 33%.  Or play the previous version.			",9,3,0,2,5,2,4

												Better graphics and animation, and its nice to see the announcers now.  Other than that?  An entirely inferior game to the original.  There are still bugs, there are vastly less teams, there seems to be less in-match announcer dialogue, there're no team-specific cheerleaders, the slow-mo tackle animations don't need to be for ""every"" tackle, tournements just ""end"" without any sort of victory scene or trophy.If/when the game gets a few major content updates, it may be worth it.  Til then, stick with the original.			",78,23,0,12,1,4,3

												This is me making a new review of Blood Bowl II, Previously i gave this game a negative but to me i am now enjoying the game here is the Pro's and Cons of this game and my Personal opinions! feel free to discuss below as i love to communicatePro's1 - UI Is a Superb upgrade from BB1 its not clunky as it used to be.2 - The new Race aka Brettonians are a joy to play and use as there are multiple ways to play them! ( cKnoor has a good tutorial on how to build Brettonians and has footage of him playing them i suggest you check him out! )3 - The graphics here are amazing its superbly executed and it makes the gameplay a tad bit immersive for me personaly4 - Inviting your friends for a fun game of blood bowl is now a thing you can do, this is huge for a game like this!5 - The Announcers are back with more witty banter! I love Jim & Bob so so much <3 6 -  AI is alot smarter than BB1 but still make silly mistakes like ridiculous re-rolls7 - The Armour Customization Patterns are pretty nifty i like them alot i just wish you could have the option to create your own uniforms in a creator and choose from the multiple patterns , colors etc, But as it is im happy with it!8-  It's Bloody Bloodbowl!!!!!!!!!!!!The Bad1- The Campaign acts like a tutorial but that shoudlnt be the case, its a bit of a slap in the face to those who are wanting to play offline campaign which was actually very enjoyable for me in BB1 but it is possible to make a solo league online.2 - The Graphical options are not acceptable to be frank , its lacking in many customization.3 - There are a ton of races missing so there is not alot of variety to pick from and to much about with, this is probably going to be dlc im just hoping we dont get screwed with dlc teams for like 5$ a pop4 - When Customizing your Characters you have a minimal amount of faces to choose from so your team just ends up looking like an army of clones.These are my points feel free to share your opinions As of now i rate Blood Bowl II at a 7.5/10 Its a SUPER Fun game but with the minimal races i cannot rate it over 8, if there were more races this game would easily be a 8/10 but theres still things need fixing!

												Lots of mixed reviews for this game.I played the original table top game back in the 90's (2 different versions of it). I'd say it's pretty damn faithful to it in the fact that now matter how well you plan you're going to end up rolling a 1, another 1, a 10 and a 12 and your favourite player is going to die horribly.The dice rolls aren't off, dice are dice and nuffle hates you.Sure there's a lot of races missing and there's a lot that could be done regarding customization but that's all fluff that players of the older pc version are used to.I actually got the first version after getting this one and found it clunky and horrible regardless of the extra features.At the time of this review I've got about 290 hours in the game, only played 3 races + the campaign/tutorial and not played MP yet. I've more than had my money's worth even with buying all the dlc.People don't understand that creating a new team requires all new models (for the most part), animations, programming and sound and not something the team working on the game can knock up in an afternoon and give away for free. I'm not a fan of paid for dlc but in this case it does have value and is worth the price. Just because you've been used to playing with 27 (guess) teams on the previous game, table top or fumbblr you have to realise that in a new engine it's not cheap.All that aside it's not without it's issues. The AI is a bit clunky at times. I've never been fouled by the AI and they've never used the quick snap event. The UI is better after the last update but still a bit icky at times. A few rules are a bit silly (bank stuff and stadiums).All in all though it's a good faithful adaption of blood bowl albeit with a few changes. If pressed I'd give it 8/10 and hope more people discover it, buy the dlcs and we end up with more teams :)			",124,33,1,10,17,3,10

YouTube™ Video: Blood Bowl 2 - Review 

			Views: 9,339		

			Idiotech presents an in-depth review of Blood Bowl 2. Blood Bowl is a complex turn based strategy game set in the Warhammer universe and developed by Games Workshop.		

For a more in-depth review watch the video above. This was my first time playing blood bowl and I have to say I fell in love with the games mechanics. That being said the game does have problems and I am concerned about the yet to be priced DLC races. The game does not present information well and if you are new to the franchise expect to be reading guides and watching Youtube videos as the in game tutorial is awful. It's a must buy for strategy fans, for everyone else it might be worth waiting for a sale.			",246,73,13,26,64,3,50

												CAREFUL : This is not a Sport or an Action Game, This is a pure Turn-based Strategy Game. It needs a lot of planning and thinking at every minute. And the RNG must be part of the strategy, which means you must try to throw the dice as little and as late as possible each turn.You can expect long and slow matches, but they are GREAT if you like this type of game and the Blood Bowl Universe.

												Fun tactical game with team customization and online play, especially good if youre planning on picking up the boardgame since the rules are same.PROS:+Great gameplay+Large replay-value+Multiple factions (More with dlc)+Online capability+Challenging AI+Customization+Graphics+Easy to learn basics from the campaignCONS:-Graphics/visuals (clipping issues, somewhat repetitive or poor animation time to time)-Campaign is one race only-Campaign is pretty much just a glorified tutorial-Couple of the dlc teams should be in the vanilla game-Dissapointed that the players appearance doesnt change when they level up (minor issue)-Mechanics can seem unforgiving or weird for players new to the genre or have never played tabletop miniture games.Some of the things are both pros and cons in their way, but generally i'd recommend this game. It's really addciting and great, i only bought it recently so these notions can change. ",107,7,0,15,4,2,29

												This game is probably fine if you are mostly interested in playing multiplayer. However unfortunately this game revealed how much AI's struggle with situations like Blood Bowl. I played through the entire campaign and conceeded one touchdown in the entire series. Now some of this was due to the fact that the campaign gave you a TR far in excess of your opponents without give them inducements but most of it was due to the fact that the AI constitantly made stupid plays. From running their throwers away from the ball and picking it up with someone else, random one square moves and just having no understanding of how many turns were left in the half. The storyline was fun and the random events were interesting but in the end if I could get my money and time back I would.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodbowl itself is weird to recommend. It's something you have to try to see if you like it, but ask yourself these three questions firstDo you like strategy games? If no, don't get this, this is more strategy than sport.Are you not okay with permadeath, Don't get it, your players who are amazing will eventually die. (X-com level of trauma).Are you not okay with losing due to bad luck? Don't get it, because chance will screw you.This leaves the question, should you get Bloodbowl 1 or Bloodbowl 2Bloodbowl 2 is like two steps forward and one step backwards. Graphics are obviously better than the first one. The UI has improved in some aspects, percentages are shown instead of forcing the player to know the rules. However grids on the field are missing, as well as the quick overview of the roles of the players. This is quite annoying since some different players can look the same. Tutorial is also way better than BB1, it's slow but it explains the game fairly well.The other single player content is lacking though, so you will mainly be playing this multiplayer. I recommend joining a private league though, as the normal matchmaking is flawed, due to some teams being clearly better in that format. These are easy to find in the steam forums. The community is way bigger, so you will find matches much faster, about 30 seconds, instead of the 15 minutes in BB1.Difference in the amount of teams is quite big though. 10 in BB2 while there are 24 in BB1. That said the ten teams in BB2 are all of relatively equal strength, with one maybe being weaker than the rest. Whereas at least 6 six teams in BB1 are deliberately weaker. The advantage of ten players however is that it is easier for new players to learn strategies against the different teams. So, I would say that for a new player bloodbowl 2 is better, but I would still wait for a sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Another attempt. I'm not sure why those involved in converting GW titles believe they need to recreate a new experience, when folks already enjoy an existing one. Unless you believe digital gamers today are that different from their traditional gamer counterparts? No. Guy and gals - the game's been designed and tested. All we want from you is some lovely visualisation (which this title does give) and for you to use our computers to aid our play. Team managment. Customizing models/painting. Organise leagues. Customise leagues. Learn to make the computer support and expand on the existing play experience. Make it work for us.A virtual table-top for GW fun.Instead we get poorly implemented league management tool. Feeble customisation options. No tools to aid play, such as a grid. And a terrible camera. That cannot be rotated. Because...?Oh and some rule/skill changes. Let's fiddle with the player costs (Orc Blizter) and the human catchers's AV (Now 8). Because the years of itterative testing and feeback are obviously not as valued as the opinions of Cyanide's so-called game designers. Good call guys/gals.Those lovely graphics? While certainly pretty, they suffer from form over function. If you were a fan of Chaos Edition's visual graphic changes as each player levelled (for example, Chaos Warriors would get more impressive armour) then tough luck. The models don't reflect the player's level - where once you could simply look at an opponents player and get an idea of its level/power, now a rookie looks the same as legend. And racial cheerleaders? Ha! Humans for everyone! Yes, no more race-specific cheerleaders. Finally, you can't choose to NOT use a skill - and some skills simply work differently to the actual game rules, that this mockery is meant to be representing. I'd like to believe it was another attempt at Cyanide trying to 'improve' the game, but its mostly probably just poor implementation. I swear to the RNGods - whenever/whoever makes a Necromunda game, if they follow the logic of Cyanide and those chumps that did Mordheim, we'll have a narrative-driven multiplayer FPS shooter....Edit: Update the info on the grid, which was added after launch. Added additional details on changes to orc/human, inabilty to rotate camera and no option to not use a skill.Edit 2: Orc prices changes have been reverted. It seems they realised that their in-house data may not have matched over a decade of real-world play testing and development. Camera still locked.			",78,19,1,17,9,3,29

												Overall, unless you want to play online, I recommend folks grab the Chaos edition instead - it's got the complete teams, and other than that, the game is almost identical. The AI is somewhat improved in this version, but it's still quite poor, and rarely poses a significant challenge.The game isn't bad, but certainly not something I'd recommend non-BB fans play at all.

												This game is actually a pretty faithful re-creation of the classic Games Workshop Board Game, which was kind of an American Football-lite for Fantasy Nerds.  Blood Bowl always seemed to me like what the Wargamers at GW went and worked on when they got sick of writing all the ""In the grim darkness of yadda yadda there is only war"" stuff that is the rest of their product line and just wanted to make their admittedly-brilliantly modeled dudes hit one another for 20-30 minutes.This is a turn-based, piece pushing, dice-rolling game played on a grid.  The object of the game is, of course, to score the most points by putting the ball into the opposing team's end zone, and that is where the rules stop being American Football, since there is no down system.  Instead, we have wargames miniature mechanics instead, which is cool, if you're into it.  The campaign is servicable, and teaches you to play while throwing a couple of fun curves your way, but League Play is where it's at!  Watching your pieces level up only to be unexpectedly permakilled by an enemy piece is actually a heck of a lot of fun, and combines all the best of a sports management game, with a fun little tactical wargame thrown in.RIP Gnaklet for example, Goblin rookie sensation for the Skacrag Rudeboyz - an agile, touchdown-scoring machine, Gnaklet managed to reach Level 5, was an unparalled reciever with a 7 Agility, until he met his end during the final moments of a disasterous match against human team The Marauders, when one of their Blitzers, Detluf Fleif, rushed him to clear the field for Catcher Manfred Angurney to score their second touchdown of the game, trouncing my poor Rudeboyz 2-0. That being said, the AI is kinda stupid at times, and the RNG can feel frustrating when the dice are against you, but I'd definitely say this is one of the more successful Games Workshop IP translations out there, and if you're at all into Blood Bowl the boardgame, or the premise sounds interesting to you, I say, check it out, Join a league, and have a laugh.

												They took a game, rereleased a prettier simple version with customisation and leveling aesthetics removed and are now selling back to you what they took out from before - equal+ to the initial cost of the game.I had HOPED, that BB2 would end the constant rerelease of editions from the BB era.  I was HAPPY to pay for the DLC races as I actually felt there was some value.  Had I known there would also be microtransactions for simple player shirts  and other features REMOVED from previous games, I would NEVER have bought it.  Thanks Cyanide, you just made me add another game to the list of things I refuse to support.  I realise the game has not sold as well as you had hoped, but if it hadn't been released halfarsed and incomplete in the first place things would have been different.			",539,113,30,113,100,5,132

												I wouldn't recommend this at any price over the original.For all it's faults BB1 beats BB2 in almost every way.+BB2 has the shiny graphics. Sure. -Less teams. WAY less teams.-It also has a terrible UI (even worse than BB1).-Much less stats.-No player names.-NO PLAYER NAMES !?-The camera is dreadful. You cannot plan your next move while your opponent plays as the camera keeps moving.-No scrollable log of the dice rolls. BB1 had a horrible little text log but it was scrollable at least.-League creation is a joke. BB1 had far more options when it came to creating leagues/cups.Shocking stuff.Super 'game' wrapped up in a stinking mess of a product.			",790,197,46,79,93,13,132

Unfortunately I passed the two hour mark for a refund.Seriously, how do you make a game worse? Hell, the same game with improved graphics would have been nice, instead we get a worse version, with paid limitations, but better looking.Disappointed.Graphics and animations: improvedSolo gameplay: bad, campaign feels highly scripted and the AI are terrible.Multiplayer: Not sure if I'll bother.I suppose if this was just marketed as a multiplayer experience and offered no single player, I probably would not have bought it.

												Still one of my favorite boardgame adaptations to play on the PC.  Graphics are much more polished this go-around, the AI is a bit smarter and for the most part the rules are kept intact.  BloodBowl isn't for everyone, there are a ton of RNG nail-biting moments due to it's boardgame roots, so others may not like that.  As for me, smashing down the field with a bunch of crazy greenskins will always be enjoyable :)			",48,8,0,28,4,1,17

												I have never played a Blood Bowl game before, just a big warhammer fan and I also enjoy turn based, tactical games (XCOM for example). At first I thought the whole football premise was weird but this game is actually incredibly fun. It's really easy to find people to play, the game looks great and runs well. If you are a BloodBowl fan, or a fan or turn based tactical games like XCOM then I would definitely give this a try.			",70,6,1,23,7,1,18

												Bretonnians and graphics are the only real advantages to this game over Bloodbowl Chaos Edition. You can't save and exit from a single player game, and get penalised for quitting against AI. I don't understand the people who think the UI is better: inviting people to leagues is decidely more fiddly and sometimes it is infuriating that you click on your team wanting to play with them, only to remember that you have to exit out of two menus, and then go back into a completely separate menu just to play with them. The control system is worse than the original, though you can switch it back to the other system. The cutscenes get boring and samey. There are less teams, and ironically less graphical customisation options.			",72,22,0,24,31,2,45

												Being a fan of the board game, I got a discount on steam for this game and some in-game cosmetics when i got my very own box of blood bowl from GW. I figured i'd give it a shot, and i'm satisfied as all hell. Besides offering the more intuitive and fast-paced gameplay experience that modern computing offers, it feels much like a living, breathing version of the board game. With it being so much cheaper, faster, and easier to grasp than the board game, I do reccomend this to new players of blood bowl. For old players, you will want to try it out as well. However, when the nerddomsets in you should get yourself a box of the newly released board game and kick some♥♥♥♥♥in the physical world as well.			",18,0,0,5,2,1,2

												Once you get your head around tackle/ assist zones, you'll find Blood Bowl is an extremely strategic and tactical game. It's basically super-violent chess. If you take the time to learn all of the mechanics and little nuances, you'll be rewarded with a great gaming experience. This sophisticated rule-set is counterbalanced beautifully by the incessantly crunching violence of the game's stylisation, which makes it this complex gaming oxymoron, simultaneously intellectual and mindless.In keeping with the prevailing ethos of early Games Workshop, the game is brutal and unforgiving: your favourite palyers will die and you will be subjected to the unpitying randomness of the dice. Suck it up. Savour it. In terms of the philosophy of games, I find that this kind of game mirrors life most accurately; when you expect your Kroxigor to tackle the living daylights out of an elf, he'll roll double skulls and die. Great, I say. Who wants some patronising game that leads to you to believe in the fallacy of a 'sure thing'? I know I don't.Anyhoo, 10/10 would be tossed mercilessly hither and thither by the winds of fate again.			",65,15,0,20,13,2,29

												The game is a lot like Chess. You move your pieces around and try to out think, out maneuver and trap your oppnent in order to win. But imagine you are playing Chess and you move your Queen to capture an insolated Pawn -- but what happens instead is that Pawn kills your Queen.That's Blood Bowl 2.			",97,1,0,23,13,1,34

												There's nothing better than a game that gives you RNG that really slaps you in the face. When it's choosing which crappy die result after attempting a tackle, or screaming at your dumbass Troll who refuses to move a single space (or ate your  Goblin for that matter). After every failed roll, loss, injured player, or failure to pick up a ball that is right in front of them; my verdict on this game still remains positive and I will break it down why.Gameplay: Blood Bowl is a turn based dice rolling game of football where every player on your team makes a difference in terms of positioning and stats. My favorite part about this is that you can create your own team and have them compete in tournaments and leagues. Death is permanent for your players however so be prepared for when high level Mr. Badass gets murdered by a little innocent Skink. As you progress, you can upgrade your stadium and team staff with more cheerleaders and coach assistants so you can make the best team of all the Elves, Orcs, Rats, or Humies.Atmosphere: given that this is a Warhammer fantasy game, you see a lot of familiar races such as the Skaven, Black Orcs and Chaos but set in a stadium for some good wholesome sport where anything goes to achieve victory. The two announcers are quite the treat themselves with their commentary on about anything that goes on in the game.Graphics: very well designed and detailed with every separate character in the game. not much to say but nothing to really complain about.Overall, Blood Bowl 2 makes for a great game for you to get angry at because RNG dictates that you  cannot make the perfect play. So get your team together, warm up those blocking dice and pray to Nuffle that you will succeed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will list the positives first then move on to the negatives. The graphics are great, the animations excellent. Unlike in Blood Bowl: Chaos edition, the animations actually add to the drama rather than distract from it due to their clunkiness in CE. Even in the 8 race basic edition, there is quite a bit of variation in the races, so players of different styles can experience very different play styles.Private leagues and competitive leagues enforce rules that make it less likely, that people concede games mid-game, so there is a lot of possibilities to play proper matches in good humour. The developers are also continuing the development of these features, and are also adding new teams as DLC.However, there are quite a few problems as well. First of all, in the official casual ladder people concede constantly, since there are no negative rewards for doing so (I myself recently conceded a match after I lost half my team to injuries in the first half. In my defence, it was the first match with that team and there was no way I was going to keep it. But still, it was a douchey move, my opponent certainly wanted to finish the match.).There have been several bugs, like the infamous reimbursement of money used in the inducements stage before a match.There are only 8 teams in the basic game, and the dlc are about 7e a piece, which, if you get them all, adds up to a quite an expensive package. The dlc are also coming by at a rather slow pace, since the game is already a year old, and there have been only 5 new teams so far. This adds up to only about half of what CE had.The most serious problem with the game is, that there are no ""fun"" teams available at the moment. The teams are all more or less competitive, and there are no teams that are designed to be fun and not serious. For example goblins, halflings and vampires aren't great, but when one gets bored of being hacked to death by chaos, dwarves or the undead (necrotic or not), it would be fun to unwind and lose with a team that is not even supposed to win all the matches. All in all, it is a mixed bag and I recommend it to anyone who finds the setting interesting, but you need to be prepared to study the game and watch some tutorials on youtube. It is great fun when you get into it though, just very frustrating kind of fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's blood bowl so it's pretty great off that. To those who don't know it's like Xcom and NFL blitz came together. It's wicked fun. The game has a very sharp learning curve and the in game tutorial does a terrible job teaching it. Because the game is so niche expect to get destroyed when you go online. Sites like bbtactics will help a lot in getting you up to speed.One complaint I do have about it is that the DLC is very expensive. I'm hoping during the next steam sale we start seeing it drop in price more. Also it doesn't really effect the game play any, but since this is an extremely fluff heavy game I really wish there was more options to customize your stadium and cheerleaders. I want to see a bunch of orcs and skaven with pom poms.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I Know Nothing... ...  about American football.OK, So I know that the word football in the name is misleading because it’s mostly played with the hands (I had a little rant about this in my review for Rocket League if you really want to read more of my ramblings on the subject...) but beyond that I’m lost, I have no clue about the rules of the game, the tactics employed or anything else useful.As an ignorant Brit peering in from the outside it looks similar to Rugby but with body armour.My knowledge ends there.I Know Almost Nothing... ... about the Warhammer universe.OK, So I Know that it has got something to do with Games Workshop which leads me to suspect it involves tabletop games with complex rule sets, multifaceted dice and a liberal sprinkling of Orcs.I’ve seen several Warhammer based video games come out over the years, none of which I ever got around to playing (I know... I know... shame on me!) and I’m also pretty confident that whilst a “Blood Bowl” sounds like an implement you might find in a hospital it is in fact a game set in the Warhammer Universe.Beyond that I’m as ignorant to the intricacies of Warhammer as I am to those of American FootballUniquely QualifiedArmed with this devastating lack of knowledge I have recently dived head first into the football/Warhammer mash-up that is Blood Bowl 2, sequel to the 2009 title Blood Bowl which you won’t be surprised to learn passed me by completely.Educational BeatingHaving watched the funny and brutal intro scenes I found myself managing (and controlling) a down on its luck human (mostly) football team called the Reavers.Looking after this team serves as both a  tutorial and an introductory campaign to get you up to speed and ready to take your “Blood Bowling” prowess online.The tutorial campaign does a really good job of showing you the ropes, starting off with a simplified version of the rules and building up the complexity with each progressive match until you actually know what you’re doing.This subtle, layered approach is a perfect introduction for a blood bowl beginner like myself, I never felt overwhelmed by rules and each new concept was introduced in a way which made sense.The campaign also has a light but fairly interesting story to keep you engaged between matches and ties everything together nicely.Pad AwayWhilst Blood Bowl is a fantasy sports title don’t go into this game expecting a FIFA or PES like experience or you’ll be disappointed, this is a turn based tactical affair, think XCOM with a football and you’ll be pretty damn close to the play style on offer here.Dicey DecisionsThe game take place across various stadia where you'll issue commands to each of your players individually and cross your fingers that everything goes to plan.There are several actions available depending on the player type, from moving to a new position on the field, passing the ball or nobbling an inconveniently placed opponent to take them out of the action.The success of these actions will depend on your player stats (as you would expect) and the randomness of a dice roll.This randomness can be hugely irritating at times, if lady luck isn't smiling then even the best thought out move with most appropriately skilled player is going to fail, stats be damned, the dice of fate always have the final say... (how I've come to hate those dice).Having said that, I can understand the need for this dice based uncertainty, even the best players fall flat on their face sometimes, it's still annoying though and maybe a little too random for my tastes.GOAL!The aim of all this games-workshopy, dice-rolly action is to get one of your little guys  to stay upright long enough with the ball (which isn't round) to run clutching it between their hands  <cough> not football  <cough> and score something called a ""touchdown"".  (which apparently isn't anything to do with planes and runways).Compulsory FrustrationAfter you've struggled your way through the tutorial campaign you'll know enough to be able to create your own team, and take your overconfident self online for a lesson in humility.But before I get into the humbling experience of on-line play, let me explain why I both love and hate that introductory campaign.As I mentioned a few paragraphs back, the tutorial does an excellent job of introducing the game rules and mechanics at a steady pace, unfortunately, what it doesn't do so well is let you progress through it by winning matches, that alone is not enough!It also insists that you complete some very challenging objectives along the way such as ""Score a touchdown with player type X"" or ""foul player X a certain number of times""The campaigns insistence on completion of these ""bonus"" objectives can result in you having to replay a match several times before you're allowed to move forward.I can't overstate how annoying this is, but you could just skip the campaign and dive straight into team creation and online play if you know what you're doing. (which unfortunately I didn't).Creative ChaosYou create and manage your own Blood Bowl team from a selection of different races, from squishy humans through to squat dwarves.The eight disparate races on offer with the base game come with their own strengths and weaknesses , an Orc isn't likely to have the agility required to pull off a graceful run around the opposing teams defence just as a slender Elf is less likely to muscle its way to the end zone by flattening a wall of defending  Orcs.The different play styles required by differing races go a long way to keeping the game play fresh, although many might be by disappointed that only 8 playable races are included with the base game, but hey, that's what DLC is for, right?Depending on which race you've selected you'll have several different player types available to choose from ranging from throwers and catchers (bet you can guess what they specialise in) to blitzers (for blitzing...) and linesmen (for... err... making up the numbers).Anyway, after you've agonized about putting together a well balanced squad and more importantly given them all amusing names, it's time to actually put your team to the test.Play Ball!There are several ways to do this, you can play a friendly match, join a league or even create your own.  You're not forced to go online until you're ready either, the AI will happily try to pummel you into the ground as readily as any online player would.As I said earlier, the matches themselves play out in a very turn based, action-pointy kind of way, but there's more going on here than just the matches, there's a football management side to Blood Bowl too.You'll be buying and selling players, doing up your stadium, investing in bonuses (some of which can make a huge difference to the outcome of a match, re-roll is especially useful as it gives your dice a second chance to win lady lucks favour.)There's plenty going on here  and you'll find yourself becoming attached to certain players as you progress through several matches with them, don't get too attached though.They Killed Kenny!Like X-com, you're going to end up with ""favourites"" on your squad, there'll inevitably be a thrower that always seems to hit his mark, or a catcher with safe hands that always comes through for you, but be warned, your players are not invincible.They can get knocked down, knocked out, maimed and even killed during the course of a match.Losing a star player can...

												Now with a ""Year After"" review added.What BB2 still currently lacks...is the Ability to allow Sportsmanship.  Continuing to Lack the Tools for Players and Especially League Admins to fix ""issues and glitches"" in order to keep things fair and right is a problem.  The game STILL isn't worthy of the people who play it.Granted it looks and sounds nice, but there are so many things wrong with this release.Price Point.  Far too high, especially in light of just how much content is missing.DLC teams.  Again Price Point much too high, Seven Ducats for EACH team is practically criminal, the first Blood Bowl is far better value for the money.Lack of Starting Teams.  Seriously?  Where's even the basic Undead team?  No Amazons?  No Norse?  The list goes on and on for just how many teams that came with the starting Board Game of Lore.  Goblins?  Nope.  Halfings?  Nope.  And it goes further and further.  Elf variant teams?  One is DLC and the rest are missing.  Chaos Dwarves?  Not here.  Necro or Khemri?  Triple Skull.Bugs and Stupid AI.  Well the AI is still no shakes of a stick at like in the prior game, and some of the bugs are really bad.  They have promised patches  but these appear to be slow to follow.Seriously, if just really need to get this one, wait for a sale at least.  It is NOT worth the full price at all.July 2016 - Is it any better after a year?It's STILL not a recommended game at full price point.  Gradually we have more teams coming out...Norse finally, and Undead e-v-e-n-t-u-a-l-l-y.  But at this rate we're looking at YEARS if ever to have a full complement of teams.  No Amazons on the Horizon...Goblins or Halflings?  Nope...Chaos Dwarves?  Not a peep, etc.  There's ""whispers"" of Nurgle but suspect we're looking at 2017 at this pace.  I've seen Mummies shuffle down the field faster...Glitches...oh yeah.  They continue to be an issue.  Play the campaign?  Better not score with a player with Kick when it gives that mission to unlock (spoilers) Griff.  Griff with Kick is enough to make Jim renounce his Red Wine...Badly coded Overtime?  Still there, and saw that even in the World Cup recently.  Team wins a flip yet ""gets his drive picked FOR him"" if he wants to be offence or defence.  Seriously?  Cost a World Cup game to the unfortunate coach, and yet STILL no Admin ability to ""correct and wind back the clock"".  If you're going to be serious about wanting this to be a ""major multi-player supported game with leagues and tournaments"" you NEED those tools in place.  The ""concept"" of the game is STILL brilliant to this day.  And the opponents and wonderful casters out there Sage, Fantastic, VG and all the rest keep me coming back and just enjoying myself.  Someday...this game might be worthy of the quality of people who play it.  I dare to dream...			",55,44,1,27,40,4,23

												I am not a person that usually writes reviews but seeing how many negative ones there are I figured I should try to help balance things out. For those who know nothing about it. The game is a very unforgiving and clever turn-based strategy game set in an alternate version of the Warhammer Fantasy setting. It parodies american football and follows a similar set of rules but is (arguably, hah) more violent.Most negative reviews made by the self-appointed veterans of the series have rated the game poorly mainly for the reason that it has fewer races than the original Blood Bowl did. They write this however not mentioning that the previous iteration had in fact FEWER races on it's release. Sure, Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition has a noticably larger collection of them now but this was the game in it's final form. It was released THREE YEARS after the regular Blood Bowl had come out and was dubiously priced at the time.These reviewers in their frustration add that the only way that the game improves on it's predecessor is in the graphics department which is in fact not true in any way whatsoever. A common complaint is that the new campaign is worse I but in all honesty the original one wasn't good either. The game was always best when playing against other people and Blood Bowl 2 features a significantly better matchmaking system in it's multiplayer. The game's UI and controls are not nearly as clunky and unfriendly to new players (or all players for that matter) as the original was yet at the same time it does not feel dumbed down making the game much less frustrating than the first part.Finally I'd like to add that the costs involved in making a single race (it's animations, models etc.) are astronomical and it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the game has ""only"" ten races so far. I strongly recommend that if you are even slightly interested in the game you should buy it now, not wait ""for more to come"". The game is a blast as is, is regularly being updated and the developers do really need any money they could get in order to ensure more content in the future.			",408,189,5,74,34,6,54

												I see a lot of negative reviews from people who have played the original blood bowl games which I can't comment on due to BB2 being my first experience of the game, all I can say is that I love it, if I've got free time it's my first, second and third choice, and if I'm not playing I'm watching a stream :)Pros: 1. Incredibly deep gameplay/strategy, after 600 hours I still feel like a noob, every team can be developed differently according to how you like to play, and more than half the teams haven't been released yet so still plenty of variety to come. 2. The game looks great and the UI is mostly excellent with some occasionally annoying exceptions which the developer has been regularly but slowly fixing.3. The community. This is the best thing by far, Bloodbowl isn't a game with a huge player base but it seems like once you start playing you don't stop, a huge amount of strategy guides available, all the streams I've seen have a very welcoming chat and once you feel like you've got a grasp of the basics there are a lot of private leagues with some really good and friendly players.Cons:1. Steep learning curve with a not great match making system can lead to some impossible games when you're just starting out, the tutorial will teach you the basics, but very slowly, I'd recommend watching some streamers and asking questions in chat over playing the tutorial, and when you search for a game stopping and starting the search every ten seconds or so will help to avoid the more ridiculously impossible match ups.2. Time. Games can take over an hour to play, there's no speed mode so if you don't have that kind of time then this isn't the game for you.3. Salt. Everything in this game is decided on the roll of a dice, there will absolutely be times when you know you're playing someone who isn't close to being as good as you but he'll wreck you because he'll get every dice roll his way. The better you are the better you will be able to allow for the variance but sometimes you're going to be left disgusted.4. No competitive rankings. There's nothing currently like the ladder in hearthstone to judge yourself by, the main match making league is perpetual so really you have to join private leagues to find proper competition. Cyanide have put up prizes for a world cup competition but reallistaically only the very best players have a chance of qualifying for that, definitely my biggest problem with the game currently.Edit: I now have over 1100 hours on this game and still addicted to it, to update the pro's there has now been a year of DLC teams being added, with two more imminent, all done to the same high standard as the base game teams, and all definitely beatable by the teams you start with, so don't feel like you need to pay to win here.With the cons, the match making has been improved somewhat, with everyone going into a pool with a max 5 minute waiting time, which generally has improved the fairness of the games. There is now also a Champion ladder where experienced players can challenge each other to get the best record with the race of their choice, the winners all going into play-offs to find the overall champion. This new mode has really improved the match making experience, allowing you to find a real challenge even if you don't have the time/interest in signing up for private leagues.

												Exactly like Blood Bowl 1, with very marginally improved graphics. They conrols have actually been made clunkier than the last game, so expect some unintentional moves and passes that will help you lose. Also making a ton of races DLC? I love Warhammer, but I can't stand Games Workshop. Seems like a shameless cash grab. Oh, and all the reused artwork from the last game feels like a $50 slap in the face. For shame.

												It's Blood Bowl - if you're familiar with that, then you'll, at the very least, appreciate this game. There aren't a lot of massive changes from the first game, and there are even options to change various things to get an experience more similar to it. The campaign is a nice touch, but getting involved with a community is probably the best way to play the game. Thankfully Blood Bowl communities are fairly inclusive and not hard to find.

												It's pretty, I'll give it that. And I imagine in a year or two it will be solid. But much like BB1 was at launch Bloodbowl 2 is far from a complete game. Putting aside the fact that they don't have goblins or halflings (which is sort of a dealbreaker for me right off the bat) the lack of fullscreen (You can play borderless window at full resolution, but that overtaxes some hardware) makes it almost unplayable and little things like no armor upgrades and lack of a true solo campaign (you can play in a solo league but it is noteably less awesome than the solo campaign in 1 where there was a map and more of a sense of a world and story) make the game just lacking in gameplay compared to Chaos Edition.So here's what it comes down to. If you're a hardcare blood bowl player and you want to support the studio so they can continue to imrpove this game and utlimately have 2 as full featured (or hopefully more) as one, then buy it. It definitely has promise and my family bought 3 copies for this reason.If you don't already have Chaos Edition it really comes down to what's most important to you. If it's graphics then by all means, get II!If it's gameplay... well I honestly can't bring myself to recommend II over Chaos Edition... yet. Chaos has had years to polish things and has 23 races compared to 8 here.  Which is really frustrating for me because I have friends I'd like to get into BloodBowl. But since I myself will be sticking with Chaos Edition until they've added some key things like fullscreen, more races, and a better single player experience, it's pretty hard for me to recommend this over Chaos, particularly given that Chaos is cheaper.

												Highly recommend Blood Bowl 1.  This sequel functionally adds some fun additions to the play and fixes some multiplayer annoyances.  The game content is fantastic. But there's no reason to spring for the newer version. Normally I'd support the switch to a more open platform with some purchasable mods in the interest of the developers making a few honest dollars from some colorful content (along with vastly the multiplayer community.) However... Unforgivable Sin: Must now Purchase Formerly Free Content (Wood Elves, and Lizardmen Races)Bad Things: 1. Much Increased Loading Times2. Increased AI Thinking Times (The 4 minute countdown timer doesn't apply to the AI.)(On my computer about 2 minutes for anything more complex than a kickoff or the first turn after.)(Totaling to double the time for me to finish a game, although admittedly, my computer isn't so great.)3. % of Success posted not modified by auto-reroll skills such as catch and dodge. (Essentially they're showing the odds of a single dice roll. Yay.)Good Things: 1. In-Game Save.2. Players have modifiable appearance.3. Interesting Campaign4. Modifiable Locations  (Including some really fun stuff.)5. Funnier commentary.6. % of success posted for risky moves.I don't resent them for trying to make money off a great game. But I bought the game for the content. Now there's additional charges for races I can play in the old version for free? Sorry. I'll play the old version. There's just not enough difference for me to care.			",13,1,0,7,3,2,25

												Look.. If you had.. One turn.. And one reroll..To seize the ball with your thrower..In one moment.. Would you capture it..?Or just let it slip..? Yo - His palms are sweaty, grip's weak, ball is heavy..There's a blitzer aimed at him already..Coach's upsetti..He's nervous, but his team look calm and ready..To fight on, but they keep on forgetting..That they're 1 STR down.. The black orc's blocking now.. They try to dodge out, but the 1 rolls won't stop now..Another Turnover, how!? Another player gets knocked out..Mighty blow.. Thrower's down.. It's over - POW!

												Chess meets American Football.Very hard learning curve. I recommend ppl to play abit on single player before going into multiplayer. Also Google bloodbowl tactics and ""Tackle zones""Very satisfying when things goes as planed, but BBII is also the game I've been most frustrated with.Nuffle, The God of Dice, can be very sneakyOne more thing: Do the safe moves first, like raising your players after they're knoked down. Do not start with the uncertain moves, like picking up the ball and passing it (there are 3 rolls there, pick up ball 67%, pass: anything from 17%-83% depending on agility of the players involved and on the lengh of the pass. The catcher also have to roll to catch it)			",65,25,0,14,6,2,9

												well, after now logging 450 hours on this game i can honestly say this. while i havent logged ANY hours against live opponets, all my time is against the AI. that being said i have found that as your team gets better the AI throws up a♥♥♥♥♥♥team which you GIVE a HUGE handicap to and then it proceedes to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥outta your team that has taken quite the while to build up. the game is done by the same company that does MORHEIM and my edumacated guess is that it uses the same AI or a derivative there of. this version of blood bowl does in fact mirror the 'new' version of the miniature game very well. all in all it is a fun game and i would recommend it, tho be preparred for some let down especially against the AI.

												Bloody football is a turn-based strategy. I've played in the last part and I like they both. Of course there is less teams, but the developers will add them. And most likely they can be purchased in-game currency.The main disadvantage of this MAGICAL RANDOM ...Even if your player has a 83% chance to dodge an opponent, then it is likely that it will fall ...At the same time it is possible to evade at a probability of 37%.It is also frustrating when your Minotaur can die from slipping.Graphics in the game is good. But it would be possible to add more animations.The final score 9 injured players of 11 elves.			",536,213,16,74,54,10,65

												Part 1: REVIEW FOR PLAYERS FAMILIAR WITH BLOOD BOWLThis is just another BB client. Some pros, some cons in comparison with BB1.  The most noticable differences:1. Much better online than BB1 in public leagues. Private leagues will need some time to evolve to the level of BB1, but I believe it will happen soon enough.2. Interface is different and will require some time to adopt, but is of about the same level.3. Less number of teams, others will probably be in DLCs.4. AI is betterm but still good only for newcomers, it'll not hold vs experienced coaches.5. Some optional and obligatory homerules and some rules are bugged, but nothing gamebreaking if you can live with some changes from the rules.6. Better graphics.Part 2: REVIEW FOR NEW PLAYERSThere are several BB clients on the market: Fumbbl (the worst GUI and graphics, the best content), BloodBowl2 (the best GUI and graphics, most differences from original board game rules), BB1 is somewhere in between. There is no point in buying BB1 now as the number of players in online is bad. If you are not a diehard board gamem fan, the differences with the rules should not matter much for you, so get BB2.Most negative reviews are coming from experienced coaches who are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off with some differences with the board game rules and low number of teams. In fact it doesn't affect the core of the gameplay and present teams are enough to represent most aspects of BB and are balanced well. Teams that can come as DLC later are not going to be much better, the balance is quite good here, so if you are not going to try them all you'll not have to spend money on them. So do not be afraid of poor ratings or ranting in the forums. Haters gonna hate, but it doesn't really make the game worser for new players.I would recommend this game to you if you like turn-based risk-managment games or warhammer universe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't mind the mixed reviews. This game is hell in a handbasket fun.The only issue is that you need to actively find people/meet people to get in a league for multiplayer. It's got a bit of a learning curve, but it's plenty fun, especially for the more tactical of folks.And if you're a nerd like me, you get to tackle the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the people vicariously that you couldn't before in high school.-Slazz			",126,18,0,24,9,1,14

												Ok I finally got this game, even though I waited until it was on offer. After reading other people’s reviews and how some actually said it wasn’t worth buying, I eventually got a chance to play a few games, oh yeah, I also bought all the DLC’s, well technically that’s not true as the Undead DLC was thrown in for free because I bought the wood elf and lizard men, thanks, that was a pleasant and unexpected bonus. Where to start, Ok if you have never played this game on PC before, don’t bother getting the older version, and just buy this one instead. Graphics wise this version is so much better, I don’t think it’s been optimised in any way, but you should be able to get playable framerates and visuals on a medium rig PC.Gameplay wise, I never really noticed that much difference from the original game, and the camera angles have remained the same. This is a quick game to pick up for new players, but learning the game properly can take a while to master, even with the dumb AI and sometimes ridicules dice roles that you get, but that’s the fun of it.Don’t be expecting some easy game, this game is very challenging even with the AI set to easy, because this is based on a table top game, where you are at the mercy of the dice rolls, this has certainly been captured and the frustration of seeing your thrower either miss his catcher or the catcher missing the ball entirely can be really frustrating.The commentary in the game is both entertaining and repetitive, but you do have the option to switch it off, I think. If you like the Warhammer universe, then this is certainly one to add to your collection, it’s by no means the sequel that everyone was expecting, but who knows, with more DLS’s coming out, we may eventually get the game that all the fans were waiting for.If I were to rate this out of 10, I would give it a solid 7.5, with plenty of room for improvement.

												I am going to recommend this game... but there are issues which detract from the enjoyment.First off, the positives:-This brings back a lot of fond memories of the original table top game.-graphics are decent.-Dialouge from the commentators is funny and the intermitent segments of history that pop up before a game are interesting to read.-Teams are quite balanced and so you can choose your style without finding yourself dramatically outmatched by a different style of play.Negatives:-Playing AI and in a league, you are unable to save game during a match. There might be an argument that you could just go back to an earlier point if loosing.... but... if you 'quit' the match, you can restart without any penalty.-The next issue is also related to AI games and is infuriating: If for whatever reason, you loose internet connection, your progress is not updated and you have to start the game again... there is no forewarning that connection has been lost...  so you only find out you've wasted an hour+ at the end.-Turn based games are fun.... but games are really slow... In this instance it can take the AI up to minute to decide on it's first move... seriously? I expected a bit more fluidity and speed from an AI's computations.-One of the commentators ruins the feal of the game by bringing up dice rolls - usually commentating on rolling a one. This takes some of the spark out of the roleplay genre... in a real game would you say a fumble was a roll of one? This is a pedantic irritation... but irritating netherless.Yes, I would recommend, but be aware that you might end up tearing out some of your hair.			",97,26,4,14,12,1,21

												Blood Bowl 2 despite people complaining about the campaign and lack of content compared to the Blood Bowl 1is a great game. Blood Bowl 1 had a lot added on after launch so I am sure they will add more content and continue to support this game, and in terms of the campaign I think its completely skipable. If you want a good offline experience just play a solo league, so I don't see why saying the campaign is bad is a thing people would give this game a negative review for. The learning curve is a bit steep and the time comitment is a bit much but if your willing to keep trying you'll get the game down and have a great time with it.			",59,4,0,6,9,1,10

												After watching TotalBiscuts' Blood Bowl 1 tournament years ago I saw this game coming up and thought why not give it a shot. Since then I've never regretted my decision.At first the game seems very punishing. If you don't take the time to learn the order of operations (safe moves first, risky plays after) you'll feel like you're getting♥♥♥♥♥♥on by RNG, but once you get the hang of that the game opens up. After 150+ hours in game I still feel like I learn something knew every time I play.The community is also pretty great, from what I've seen so far. I stream the game and so many people have come into my chat and offered to give me tips and tricks. They've really helped me improve and get much more enjoyment out of the game.It does lack a lot of teams for the moment, but they seem like they're looking to add more in the future. So far they're already addedf Norse and Undead. Nurgle, and Necro are on the way too.There is also the occasional bug, crashing here and there, but nothing has ever affected me personally aside from hilarious camera angles.Over all it's a solid game. If you're at all interested in the turn based strategy (with some rng), warhammer, or football you may very well enjoy this game.			",99,14,0,12,4,1,13

												Absolutely no balance in the online play.  Unless you have 12 friends that all want to start a team together good luck finding a league to start a fresh team.  The matchmaking system has no ranking filter and will put you up against seasoned teams in your first match, making it not only almost impossible to win, but also not the least bit enjoyable.

												If you're a fan of the original game then this is well worth picking up. Same great Blood Bowl but with better animations, graphics, sleeker interface, better online support, and more. Only downfall is base product has a small selection of teams which makes the DLC feel a little forced in order to expand your options. However the developers have been offering up the DLC for free to those who already owned the game before it released so hopefully that practice will continue if there is another set of DLC teams.Hope to see ya out on the pitch!

Same rules and play but the immersion is more successful.Edit: Campaign mode is basically an in depth tutorial (super easy) with a story and lots of random events that don't happen in league play. Single player league vs AI is akin to the campaign mode from the first game with the added stadium upgrades feature.			",53,11,1,17,2,2,11

												+ Greatly improved graphics over previous editions+ More intuitive interface+ Stomping the enemy team's star quarterback into the a dead, bloody paste is still fun+ Interesting single-player campaign/training mode for those new to the strategy in the series+ Stayed mostly true to the ruleset- Only 8 teams out so far, with as-yet-unpriced future DLC purchases required to get more teams- A few issues with crashing, which wouldn't be a big deal but for the fact you can't save an in-progress game.- Reported multiplayer issues.  I haven't had a problem, but others have.- Fewer player customization options than previous editionsOverall, I'll give this game a reccomendation because as a standalone game it's fun and enjoyable, but It was released early and it shows.  In the end, it'll probably be a worthy successor to the other Blood Bowl games, provided they don't charge an arm and a leg for extra teams.If you're on the fence, I'd wait to buy this product until we get to see how much they're going to charge for new teams.  If the price is too high, wait for a sale or a bundle.   Definitely worth getting, but don't be taken for a sucker on DLC.			",94,15,0,19,14,3,31

												Here are my taughts after playing trough 90% of the campaign and trying out a bit of multiplayer.1. If you are a player experienced with the tabletop go buy BB1 Chaos Edition instead of this unless you prefer the better looking graphics. BB1 CE is still way superior to BB2 if you want genuine gameplay.    If you are a player new to Blood Bowl it's an awesome game however I recommend you buy this game on sale since in my opinion it's just not enough bang for your buck.Pros - Beginner friendly, Better graphics, slightly better AICons - Expensive in comparison to the content that you get. Being beginner friendly comes at the cost of many functions from the original game not being available (see below). Gameplay isn't optimized for PC but rather for console.As a genunine fan of the tabletop and in general I very much enjoyed BB1 Chaos edition I must say that i am in general dissapointed with BB2. This game still feels like it is in beta 1 year after its release. There is no option but to have your skills forced upon you, there is no passing template from a potential possition etc. Perhaps one thing that realy bugs me out is how much the adaptation for the console verision shines trough in the PC release, it makes the playing experience feel alot wonkier than BB1 Chaos Edition. Despite BB1 having its fair problems with bugs I still prefer that verision so far. Positives in BB2 are definelty graphics and so far I havent encountered as many bugs as there were in BB1. I'd also like to say that it's probably a lot more beginner friendly than BB1. There AI in singleplayer is also somewhat better.Maybe I just had to high expectations from this game since ive loved the game for more than 15 years. However at its current state I simply cannot recommend the game unless you buy it on sale.			",5,3,0,3,0,2,6

												BETA REVIEWTHE BASICSFirst thing First the KILL CAM IS TO DIE FOR. ( slow mo death time is awesome :D)Blood Bowl 2 is the mutant ofspring of american football and the fantassy warhammer world. The game is sertannly a great laugh but also is serious enough to justify long term dedicated game time.This game inspires me to rage and ROFL in equal mesures depending on who nuffle ( blood bowl's god) shines on that day.The game is ALOT more new user freindly than BB1 with a user freindly interface and you can even get an assistant coach (AI) to build your team for you till you start to understand how things work.Bob and Jim our beloved ogre and vampire commentators never fail to make me laugh, a great example here (

			That awkward moment when ..... Yea nuff said hightlight from : http://youtu.be/ISLL0myRq8w		

 )The gameplay has 2 layers.1.The first of witch is where you design and change your team to fit you need as you manage things like your teams money and how many chearleaders you want to have.2. The second layer is the actual pitch where the game takes a TBS role where you posistion your players and fight all over the ball with the ultamate aim of scoreing more touchdowns than your rival.PERFORMANCEHas been outstanding for me to say the least next to no loading time and good frame rates throughout. (and i have been recoding gameplay on top so performance is awesome for me to say the least.FOR PEOPLE NEW TO BLOOD BOWL ( Starting guide )Orks and humans are the 2 teams id recomend starting with there good allrounders.orks if you want to be more blocky (fighting / killing) and humans if you want better controll of the ball.After you have a few games under our belt you may want to try a more specilised team with a playstyle you seem to lean towards and or like.For example you try the Humans out but notice you like to bash in your rivals head ... well then try moveing on the the dwarfs or the orks if you dont want to give up the ball game alltogether :PAt first it may seem like you have nothing but bad luck with turnover after turnover and the game is treating you badly for some reason but a large part of the game is risk managment to reduce those turnover and a good coach knows how to manage those risks.a few good tips for this are1. Allways stand up your fallen players asap2. Prioritse low risk and high reward actions before the vice versaFOR BLOOD BOWL VETRANS / CHANGES FROM BB1Its the old game you loved with a few ballance changes such as the ork blitzer has increased in price. ( I would go into more detail but as its the beta i expect they will either revert back or change more after the release / in updates to come)The animations are really nice and far better than BB1 as well as the graphics.The variations and differnt ""jerrsy"" / armour types are nice comapred too BB1The lack of teams compared too BB1 can hurt but its not as though be seen alot of those teams played often. All the bases are coverd basic playstyle wise though with it only despratly needing a goblin team for the pure ROFL epic failness that they create and the shockingly epic 1 in 200 play where it all goes right :PYou now get your own teams stadium to change and personelise to fit your team.Cheerleaders are allways the basic humans and i am hopeing and praying that is just for the beta but if its not i am going to be one sad bunny as i loved the differnt chearleaders from BB1AIThe AI is a big step up from BB1 with teams acting acordinly with there playstyle but any seasond players will probally still find it underwellming and need to look to PVP for there thrills.I expect there will be 5-10 DLC teams comeing either as single teams or as larger expanions pack style DLC.Hope This helps you decide if you want to take the plunge and try this game out.Good luck and se you on the pitch :Dwant to see gameplay please hop over to my channel :)https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWi55_w4pBFCy06QGTdOBw ",50,8,0,36,33,2,50

												Excellent TBS/RPG game, chess with multiple different teams who all have their own specific weaknesses and strengths. All actions are also decided by dice rolls, so if you hate having bad luck sometimes, stay clear! Reviews of this game are polarised, some will not like this game, but those who do will drown hundreds of hours in it. Also be warned: this is a strategy game, not FIFA. Hours played says it all: If you think you might like BB, do yourself a favor and give it a go.			",66,44,2,49,27,4,60

												Let me start by saying I LOVE Bloodbowl.  I really enjoyed the board game and later the first Cyanide release of the PC game.Unfortunatley they somehow managed to epically F@#k up BB2.  The good things I will say is that they made the graphics better and more polished, and thats pretty much the end of the 'Pro's'There are too many cons to list so I'll just name my main ones.1. Your players look the same FOREVER, they dont get better looking gear as they level up, so your noob lineman ends up looking like a pro level 6 lineman.  Those who play BB will understand how lazy and lame this missing feature is, it was in BB1.2. They just made up some random rules, so the BB game that has been tested for 20 years apparently was no good so they just made some tweaks withouit checking with the community.  BB rules are like scripture to BB players, dont mess with them.3. You have to do about 10x more clicking than in BB1 to do your moves4. Leagues need fixing5. They dont listen or respond to the community on their forums6.  There are so many issues yet they hardly ever patch the game, in its current state you wouuld expect a patch a week.I never write negative reviews (I think this is my first ever) but they really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  I would have been over the moon with all the features of BB1 and just improved graphics (you would think that would be the minimum).  Instead you get half the features of BB1 with random new rules and no updates/patches in sight.  Stay away for a year or so until (hopefully) they complete the game.			",138,23,2,58,28,4,45

												I already really like this game. Awesome, brutal animations, relatively beautiful graphics and easy, simplistic controls. Blood Bowl is essentially American Football mixed with the Warhammer Fantasy Battle universe where Orkz pummel Humans into the turf with wild abandon. Ever wanted to kill your opponent's entire team rather than score touchdowns? Well, Blood Bowl is your game. And as far as competitive Blood Bowl Multiplayer goes, this is the best Blood Bowl to date. Full on team customization from colors to races, mixed with Cabal TV (allows you to watch community replays and live matches between players) and a fully fleshed out League mode means having a persistent team  that competes against other players is definitely the way to play. You also get quite a few races to choose from, Humans, Bretonnians, Dark Elves, High Elves, Dwarfs, Chaos, Orkz, Skaven and even Lizardmen (or Wood Elves). Still, I'd like to see the other races in the game as well, especially the Undead, Vampire Counts and Tomb Kings.My biggest complaints with the game are in the features the game is missing as opposed to Chaos Edition. For example, there is no real-time mode, there is no World Cup mode or tournament mode. It really focuses on the League mode between players. Essentially, if you have no friends or don't like playing competitively, there isn't much for you to do. It would also be nice if there were more animations overall.Gameplay Footage (Still processing):

												For the curious: Blood Bowl 2​ is a turn-based tactical combat game, loosely based around American Football, played with the fantasy races from Warhammer, and with X-COM style persistent characters.  (They gain skills, injuries, death.) It's a gorgeous, rules-perfect (nit-picks aside) adaptation of the 30-year-old board game.  It is goofy and stupid and fun while also providing quite a bit of strategic depth, if you have the stomach for dice-rolling (and don't get too attached to your players).  I have sunk entirely too many hours into this game.			",162,69,3,18,16,4,24

												An absolutely fantastic adaptation of the tabletop game. A handful of changes, but Cyanide have been very open to the community and are implementing some great changes in the upcoming expansion.A few diehard Blood Bowl fans may be taken aback by the inclusion of the not-quite-traditional race Bretonians, or critical of the slight changes to individual positional costs and stats. However, I do not mind these little quirks, as the platform offers a great way to get your game on!			",44,9,0,19,5,2,6

												Football, orcs & a malevolent god of spiteful dice Rolls: Blood bowl is one of my favourite games that I have absolutely failed to get my friends in to.  If you like turn based strategy and team management games I'd definitely reccommend this game to you.  It does have its issues, but the developer is putting significant effort in to fixing the bugs and adding additional features since September. They managed to impress me enough to post a simple review, and that's time I could be using to think of more puns to base my player and team names on!			",81,15,0,19,5,4,21

												Great game, has some issues but developers are working on fixing and improving.I haven't played Blood Bowl before, but now I can say that the game itself is fantastic and I very much love the graphics and animations in this game, the UI is also very clear and it shows the percantage chance of sucess on every action, making taking risks a lot easier for players new to the game like me.There are only 8 races in the base game included, so if you don't care how the game looks and can deal with the old UI maybe you should consider picking up blood bowl chaos edition.However, they gave the first two DLC races away for free (for early adopters) and now have announced that the upcoming next 4 races will be free as well.

												Buy it on sale for 50% or more.  It is often on sale at that price.  Game looks great and feels like an improvement in every way.  I haven't played very long so I will update my review if I encounter any issues.  Only thing i've seen so far is the subtitles of the announcers are off pretty often when they speak but its not a big deal.I debated buying this for a few days because of the lousy option to buy extra teams for 6 plus usd.  That is a crazy price in my opinion.  I'm not opposed to what they are doing as the orginal took 2 expansions before you had all the teams but additional teams would be much more appealing at the price of 2 bucks.  So I will just wait til they go on sale.  If you buy the game now before the release of the next 4 races you get them for free.  I think that is a decent price....about 20 dollars  (at 50% off) and you are getting half of the total teams most likely...then just wait for a sale on the rest of the teams.   I think the game is worth it when it is on sale for 50% or more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You will read many reviews of BB2, either from crazed fans or from endless complainers, sometimes from both at the same time.Both have their reasons, of course: complainers mostly focus on the fact that the game seems ""unfinished"", that it lacks many teams that were present in BB1 (and the DLC is coming in quite slow), that many small eye candies are unfinished (like cheerleaders being all mummified human dolls in blue) and so many other issues that they will be glad to point out for you.But before deciding whether to buy or not the game, silence the nay-sayers a bit. Listen to the crazed fans for a moment. To those that still find more than satisfying getting home after a long day at work, grab a ball and get lost in the rush of a Blood Bowl game!If you know Blood Bowl, you will feel at home. If you never played Blood Bowl, this is your ticket into the madness.And if you decide to trust the developers *now*, they will be motivated to fix all the small (and, frankly, irrelevant - the game is great already!) issues that bother the complainers so much.

												I waited to buy into BB1 for a variety of reasons: (1) the way Cyanide essentially highway bandited my wallet on DE-LE-CE BB1; (2) BB2 has fewer race options than BB:CE and the races are currently relatively expensive DLC (although you only need to buy them to play AS a race, so they are optional); and (3) I wasn't convinced that Cyanide could produce a game that was superior enough to CE to be worth the upgrade.BB2 is a vastly superior product. The visuals, animations, UI, options... everything is better. The game is smooth and gorgeous. The DLC model, while expensive if you want to play as every race, is fair in that people like me who deliberately chose not to buy early aren't being rewarded vs. those who did yet we can still play against those teams.The league management options are also improved, although I haven't dug into multiplayer yet. The AI is actually worse than BB1 if you can believe it, so don't expect a long term single player experience out of BB2.Pleasantly surprised with BB2 all things considered. It makes you wish we had this product 7 years ago when BB1 launched and we started up the OFL.			",133,24,1,39,20,4,38

												Amazing Turn-Based Strategy game, with a steep learning curve, rewarding those who don't get scared of RNG elements in the beginning. You should not hesitate to give it a shot. Most people who complain about the game being RNG horror and pure luck would call Poker the same. That being said, professional or experienced Poker players tend to turn luck in their favor with strategy, the same can be applied to this game.I own the game since launch and haven't had a single crash nor' did I see any bugs/glitches. There's a ton of in-depth guides online about pretty much every aspect of the game and all races since theres a huge community behind ""Blood Bowl"", (Tabletop/Online Java/BB1 and BB2 on Steam) that should make it easier for newcomers such as myself, if You like to dedicate time into reading them.--Pro's:- Balanced- Good graphics, running smooth on 3 year old hardware- No lags / no glitches / no bugs so far- Hot seat for 2 players (rare nowadays)- Huge game depthCon's:- The game itself is not newbie-friendly if you don't dedicate time into reading guides or ask experienced players for help- Match length can go up to 1-1,5 hours without the chance of pausing (Multiplayer)- RNG tends to scare off beginners, game not recommended for short tempered people--My final rating for Blood Bowl 2: 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Blood Bowl 2 is a hard game to review, because it very much depends on how you want to play. On balance I am saying yes to a recommendation because I have, and am, enjoying playing, and have had a decent number of enjoyable hours from it. That comes with the caveat that it's not going to be for everyone and it feels like it requires some reasonable commitment from the players. I have been a blood bowl fan, but hadn't played for many years, and had only played the tabletop versions before this; never any of the computer variants. For me, Blood Bowl 2 gives a reasonable way to play the game online, while not really providing much else. There are two real modes of the game; playing vs the AI or multiplayer games. Playing vs the AI is a fine way to play the game, and get a bit of practice in, but is not ultimately very challenging. If you are new to the game, I think the AI would be great, and a good way to learn the game, but there is a point where you will win every game, and there's not a lot more to learn from it. There is no difficulty setting, and the AI lacks a lot of basic strategy. Games vs other players becomes the game once you're half way decent, and is good if you're happy to schedule games and play regularly and be organised. Blood Bowl as a whole has a vibrant and friendly community, and joining their organised leagues is relatively easy. Organising private leagues with friends is better. If you want to pick up an odd game to play now and again though, you're left with the Cyanide Open League, which is... well it's a way to play a game but not much else. There's not enough players, which can sometimes lead to long waits if it's the wrong time of day, or mismatches where someone with a very high team value is matched against a new team. Inducements are not good enough to balance the issue. There's also no goal or point to the open league, it just runs as a way you can play your team. For me, it feels like a practice room, somewhere to take a team for a spin to find out how they play but ultimately not really somewhere you are competing. The open leagues feel like they need something more, like extra play modes, different competitions to enter and goals to strive for. Even something like a cosmetic rewards for winning a given number of games with a team - maybe win a new jersey, or get a trophy in a trophy cabinet. Extra play modes and different competitions is difficult though, because the player base isn't big enough - and without them I am not sure I can recommend the game to someone wanting to play on the open leagues. Something of a catch 22. There are things missing from the game; sponsorship doing something, teams are missing, the marketplace has basically no utility etc.Those aren't big factors to me but it feels like the game is incompete, and the developers are active if somewhat uncommunicative. For me, the game gets a thumbs up on balance, on the basis that you're happy organising games and playing the private leagues, with friends or online communities. It just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. I like the game, I just can't love it.			",68,62,2,34,20,2,41

												A long time fan of both the Table top and computer editions. I don't really see the niggly problems of the game, other than it isn't finished....is it? My main gripe comes with Steam putting on a sale barely 1 month after release...come on...this shows no respect for the fans who are gonna buy DLC's etc.....I was gutted to pay the full price, but did it to support the game......it's not got content for the SP to match this price tag, and MP doesn't interest me ... wait til the next markdown to buy...I am now only going to buy steam on sale..

												Crazy harsh RNG, a community that knows the woes of RNG and is more than willing to crack jokes with you about it during a bad game, goblin chucking, permanently killing or getting killed players. the only downside no rotter cheerleaders Nurgle needs some un sexy putrid lovelies in the cheering department or we can just wait until the crack addiction the human gals clearly have runs its course so sad, someone should start a kick starter to get them some help and rehab that♥♥♥♥♥♥isn’t cheap. This game is for a lot of people IMO, but there is also a certain type of gamer that shouldn’t play Blood Bowl and that is those that can't handle luck ruining a good strategy without getting to salty because it will happen you will also see bad starts plus good luck ruin your day.

												Take the negative reviews with a hefty pinch of salt.This game is plagued by people who are completely baffled by the concepts of RNG and probabilities and blame bad luck or the game being rigged for their poor grasp of tactics.While luck plays a part, at the end of the day, it is all about tactics and minimizing risk.Also it should be noted that Cyanide has made tremendous efforts to address the main criticisms of the community when the game was first released and most of the initial flaws have been ironed out.In a gaming world flooded with what I call junk games that'll you play for a week end or a week at most and then never touch again because they're so casual and shallow, you can spend years playing BB, it is incredibly rich and offers tons of replay value.

												Ah, Blood Bowl. A game in which bribery is rife and fouling is fine. A game in which a player must be carefully nurtured, thoughtfully assigned skills and then ruthlessly fired after a few seasons because he's inflating the team value. This is all assuming said player doesn't break his neck after being tripped by a particularly malevolent blade of grass. It's a game in which a medical professional's treatment options might either be accepting death or simply accepting death. It's a game in which you swap players through Nurgle's Rot and the Necromancer instead of swapping jerseys.It's the world's greatest game when your Orc Blitzer gets up off the ground, runs over to grab the ball at an opponent's feet, evades a tackle and then throws a pass for a touchdown. It's the world's worst when half your team suffers from heat stroke in a must-win match. (How does a zombie suffer from heat exhaustion anyway?)It's certainly a game for a niche audience. The game's complexity makes it a frustrating experience for new coaches. Expect a lot of ""why can't I ...?"" and ""how do I …?"" moments in the first dozen or so hours of play as the ruleset is filled with gotchas and exceptions. Since the game adheres closely to tabletop rules, The Living Rule Book is an essential read and new coaches would also do well to consult guides on bbtactics.com (one of gaming's great strategy sites) while leveling up players. There are laughable suggestions Blood Bowl is completely random and devoid of strategy. It's not. The game's strategy involves risk-management, canny positioning and deep understanding of the complex skill system to tilt the odds in your favour.Just as in any dice- or random number generator-heavy game, risk-management is essential. Make low-risk moves before attempting risky blocks or dodges. Gang up on opponents to improve the odds of success. Mark or foul dangerous opponents. Self-restraint will often be just as valuable as tactical acumen because sometimes the best move is not moving at all. And finally, plan for failure because Nuffle, god of dice and unintentional comedy, delights in tearing up your carefully laid plans.Victory will be all the more satisfying considering the forces arrayed against coaches:  the opposing coach (AI or human), fate and time. The game's AI is mediocre but it offers enough of a test for new coaches. New or experienced, coaches must contend with fate as represented by the RNG. While the odds can be improved with tactics and carefully crafted player and team builds, time is an implacable foe. If the referee blows for time, it doesn't matter how close you are to the end zone.Some would-be coaches will find it difficult to get past the fickleness of the RNG and the twiddling of thumbs while the opponent stalls and drags out matches that can't be won. Those who persevere will be rewarded with one of strategy gaming's great campaigns. There are few gaming experiences as enjoyable as taking a team of hapless butterfingered greenhorns and turning them into a battle-scarred team of champions over the course of several seasons.Still, the initial reviews for this latest adaptation of Blood Bowl were mixed and understandably so. The playerbase was irritated at having to pay extra for teams which were bundled together in previous editions, annoyed at being nickled and dimed for customisation skins and just as annoyed over missing customisation options. The publisher responded by giving away most of the DLC teams to early customers and this placated some but not all.It bears minding Blood Bowl 2 was developed by a small developer backed by a small publisher for a relatively small market. Of course, there's room for improvement and of course, the playerbase should push both developer and publisher to make those improvements but the question is, and has always been, whether the playerbase would be willing to fund ongoing development for a game that would benefit from continued attention.There's no getting around the fact a game like this will never be made by the likes of EA, Ubisoft and Activision. In the unlikely event a major publisher did pick up the Blood Bowl license, it would be so altered to appeal to a larger audience that it would scarcely be recognisable.(It would probably be a third-person shooter with unnecessary overlong cutscenes featuring Griff Oberwald attempting to avenge the death of his family at the hands of Varag Ghoul-Chewer.)The game as it stands is really good for what it is -- a relatively faithful adaptation of a cult favourite tabletop game -- and with the recent announcement of the Legendary Edition, with its laundry list of fan-requested features, the future looks bright indeed for Blood Bowl fans.Recommended for: anyone looking for a great turn-based strategy gaming campaign.Not recommended for: the ""RNG is broken"" school of strategic analysts.

												I've been playing Blood Bowl for years and have done almost everything there is to do. I've become an admin of a popular league and have spent hours trying different ways to build teams. This is my view of Blood Bowl 2 from a veteran of the game.Blood Bowl 2 is Cyanide's recreation of the original Blood Bowl games under a new engine. The graphics and UI are great and this new adaption makes it much easier for new players to get into the game. The tutorial does an alright job of explaining the game and mechanics, even if it could be improved and may be a little too slow. People complain about the lack of variation in cheerleaders and crowd but really how much do you care about that? They complain because it's not in the game and when it is they won't give it a second thought. The thing that matters most about Blood Bowl is the gameplay. After a shaky start with some skills not being optional or not being in the game Cyanide has done a good job with listening to the community and fixing the problems (hard to believe I know). Some people have noticed some bugs but I personally have had no problems.While there is a notable lack of a good single player as the campaign is largely a long tutorial, Blood Bowl was meant for multiplayer anyways. In NAF (COL) there is a wide variety of skill levels and tv so it's very good for practice, however the best way to play BB is in a league setting and that's where most of my experience will come from. Find a good group of people and have some set match times and you will have a blast with this game. The biggest downside of BB2 right now is the lower number of teams and I hope Cyanide picks up the pace with releasing them but that doesn't detract from the overall gameplay too much. If you don't care about the graphics or ui and just want a wide variety of teams, then by all means go play BB1. However if you want a more pleasing experience then buy BB2 as it has an insane amount of potential once more teams are released and giving your support will only make it better.			",43,7,1,8,2,2,18

												Ah yes, Blood Bowl. A neckbeard's wet dream that features a fantasy universe coupled with a sport I pretend to like so my dad doesn't make fun of me. The moment I stepped in I was greeted with a much sleeker, easier to navigate menu and ui (compared to the first game). I went to create my team (Clan Neckbeard) and found a decent level of customization. If you compare the customization to something like an rpg, an mmo, or really a ""normal"" sports game, then you come up disappointed. However, compared to the original Blood Bowl, I would have needed a mod or two to end up with the same level of character customization. Upon creating my dwarf team I looked at the other 7 races. When reading reviews here, people seemed to complain about how Blood Bowl: Chaos Edition had 23 playable races so why are we down to 8. Well Blood Bowl originally launched with 8 races as well with Chaos Edition coming out roughly 3 years after vanilla launch. So yes, those extra 15 races were DLC; in essence the dlc is no worse than the original Blood Bowl except that all the dlc was bundled together a few years after launch for the first one.Hopping into the game is where you run into the bulk of the problems (which isn't saying much). Graphically speaking, the game is a huge improvement from BB1, however there are a few things I'd like to see changed. I would like to see more diverse animations (play a game with any race and you'll see all their animations very quickly) when blocking. Also, race-specific cheer-leaders and fans. The cheerleaders are all humans for every race which makes little sense. Also when a player gets knocked off the pitch he's beat up by the fans which, again, are the same 3 generic humans. If I'm playing in a dwarf arena, I want to see dwarves beat the crap outta some guy! After my game I found that there were basic endgame stats (# of armor breaks, injuries, MVP) but I didn't find the same in depth stat tracking I loved from BB1. From what people have said, there also seems to be little league customization, but I haven't tested that.I seem to notice a lot of people giving the game negative reviews for two reasons. 1)The reviews are old and they address problems that are no longer present in the game (such as no grid mode, no dice logs, and no singleplayer) or 2)people complaining about RNG. Yes this is a dice game and no matter how hard you try, no matter how amazing your players are, you can still get knocked down and die. That's the nature of the game.The problems I've found are minor there were no major bugs. There are some people that are salty their favorite race isn't in yet but just as with BB1 I'm sure they'll get released in decent sized DLC. At the end of the day, it's the same Blood Bowl I know and love and it's expanded its horizons to attract newer players to the series while still offering veterans their Blood Bowl fix. 8/10 would dwarf again.

												This game is a shame, I love Blood Bowl. I have owned the table top Blood Bowl since 1986 and have avidly played Blood Bowl Chaos edition and with the graphics, the smoothness of play and the promise of a better AI and more management tools this seemed like it would be the best thing ever. IT IS NOT.Blood Bowl 2 is at best ready for an extended beta-release, the number of game play bugs pile up by the day and Cyanide seems to have abandoned the support forums. There is no word on any of the many,many,many too numerous to fix bugs are being worked on and there is no acknowledgement from Cyanide that anything to fix Blood Bowl 2 is happening.Add that to the inexplicable changes to races/players, beefed up human catchers that have no cost increase, impotent Chaos Warriors and an AI that can only win if it stacks the die rolls impossibly in it's favor and this game is a sham that shouldn't even be called Blood Bowl.Add to that Cyanides ignoring of the LRB and their seemingly pointless tinkering at minor rules and gameplay instead of focusing on fixing the numerous bugs and this game mystifies as to why it was released.I want to love this game, but I don't and I find myself frustrated at something that could have been so good so inexplicably ruined. I think the only thing that could save this game is to take it out of Cyanides hands, they have completely lost the script.Unless you have never played any other iteration of Blood Bowl, or if you hated the other versions do not buy this game.UPDATE: I'm really, really trying to love this game, I've added another 22 hours of game play and if anything it is buggier last week and this week than it was before.Unlike other players I've never had crashes, just annoying game play bugs, but now the game is 'Black Screening' about 45% of the time. You can hear the game going on and see the cursor but the screen is blank and windows shows the game as 'Not Responding' it's been happening to lots of players and the BB2 support forums have multiple multi post threads about it and SURPRISE! No input from Cyanide at all.Game Devs: Read these reviews closely, this how you destroy a uch loved, highly anticipated game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastically fun.The tabletop game itself is a blast, and this is by far the best way to play it digitally.Haven't played Campaign, all of my experiences are online Multiplayer.10 Races available now, more in the future, Game is pretty solid, I haven't crashed once in my 66 hours.There are a few user gripes, but it is mostly aesthetic.Things like ""End Turn"" being in an awful location and the Grid have some gameplay impact, however they are being fixed by Cyanide, and can be mitigated by playing more carefully.Highly recommend this game.

												Recommended.I understand that there are a lot of negative reviews since in the beginning the game was a little unpolished. But with the patches and the trickle of team releases it is becoming a solid game. Very true to the board game. The graphics are eons better than Chaos Edition and the animations are superb. I like the cruching blows and satisfying feeling you get when succefully blocking and breaking the opponents armor.Also to all those that say Cyanide is milking the players by slowly releasing teams I really disagree. It tages an immense amount of time and money to make all the different animations of every team. They could of course have chosen to release the game with all teams having some static or default movement animation, but the charm of it is that every team is uniquely different in every way.If you need tactical help and team builing/leveling tips visit this site: http://www.bbpb.de/ ",42,7,1,5,11,2,10

												So, Bloodbowl 2 is good for a first time player. I came here from crendor and a meaningful sale of 50% off. So I came in here not expecting the best of the best. What I got though was ana aamazing turn based dice throwing stragegy game with an amazing theme. To me, it is one of the best turn based stragegy games I have ever played. From having roll of all skulls on a three dice turn or all defender down on a red roll. It is fun and infuriating at times. It took me a few teams to get a stragy going but after that the game opened it's legs for me. I don't know about the vets coming in but as a new player, I solemly recommend this amazing game.

												recently got this on sale after a friend told me how good it was, before even buying I made sure to check some videos and quickly grew to like the look and feel of the game, that entire first week I had the game I played it almost every day, and I loved it.I would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves strategy games and honest brutal fun, heck I normally hate sports and sport games, and I still love this brutal little take on rugby.

												Right now, blood bowl 2 is in a bad state. Not graphically, or in the sound department, both are pretty well fleshed out for what they are. Gameplay holds very stable, especially if you arriving from the first one. The percentages that it now displayed is unchanged from the old system Blood Bowl chaos edition did with the dice to a much easier to get d6 that was confusing to many players first starting.The issue primarily plaguing this game is its meta. This is a very well rough spot, for its role as fantasy football. You  play based on defined styles from the race you choose. Currently, one aspect of the team in question here has reached a nasty point of contention within the community. The defenders of this are going to tell you ""Play a different team."" when you encounter this team makeup. Normally, this is a fine aspect. The team in question has a means to do this, and its used to deal with certain persisting aspects of your team after the game. And losing half to three quarters of a team you spent time and energy into because of this matchup.Death happens in this game for some teams, death happens alot more for others. But when you get roaming kill teams to face that exist to ruin your game, rather then win, is it a good thing? And that is the big problem right now to why I can't recomend this game. Cyanide is starting to give the tools to make sure you can avoid losing your team to this, but you cant avoid it fully yet. If it goes through, i'd gladly change my review to positive. But anyhow, have a good day.If you are reading this, then you've either crawled to where it was vote bombed down, or looking to reviews. In which case either way, thank you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you’ve never encountered this series, Blood Bowl would be best described as fantasy American football. But not the version in which you pick your dream team out of the best players of today, but instead a league made up of the various races from the Warhammer universe. Originally a miniatures board game, Blood Bowl had a few digital iterations and today we have before us the latest one with a ‘2’ added to it’s title. At it’s core, this is a faithful adaptation of the board game. Two teams numbering 11 players fight over ball possession during 16 rounds (8 in each half-time) in an attempt to score by crossing the opponent’s touchdown line with the ball. Unlike the real sport that inspired the game, this nets your team only one point and there are no kicks afterwards. And probably the most important difference – fights are not only allowed, but are encouraged.While the six-sided dice and random elements might be integral to the game, you’ll still have plenty of ways to skew the odds in your favor and avoid turnovers that force you give up your turn (by dropping the ball or having your player tackled). The basic systems might seem complicated at the start and the game’s manual can only be read on the website. So, to get you started, there’s a campaign in which you lead a human team, Reikland Reavers, through a hilarious story of trials and tribulations of this once-great team and through which you’ll get to learn how the game works. Each match introduces one new mechanic, from basic passing to stadium upgrades. While the campaign is great, it’s tutorial part crawls fairly slowly because in Blood Bowl 2 the matches can sometimes take 20-30 minutes.Compared to the previous game, Blood Bowl not only looks fantastic, but there are no obvious problems or bugs. The atmosphere during the matches is ecstatic, partly due to the kooky commentating duo of Bob and Jim (an ogre and a vampire) who comment for CabalVision in a typical TV style, but mostly for the excellent art style and high detail of models on the field. It’s absolutely tremendous when your successful moves get replayed in slow motion close-up, while the audience’s cheers drown out the commentators. Blood Bowl 2 is a game that is hard not to recommend, especially if the idea of rugby… erm – American football featuring orcs, dwarves, elves and other Warhammer races sounds like a great pass-time to you, and you don’t mind getting used to a somewhat complex tactical system.Full review here: http://play-zine.com/2015/10/review-blood-bowl-2/ ",446,97,16,48,25,5,58

												I played 70 hours with BBCE and like 100-150 hours with my non-steam BB and BBLE. So let's cut to the chase....It is an absolute rip-off! If you have Blood Bowl LE or CE you shouldn't buy this. They sell the same game basically the fourth time but now we don't get a proper selection for races, but we get clunky controls and playability, irritating menu and worst handling I've ever met in in a ""tabletop"" game.I go back to BBCE and will try a refund on this. I was lucky it was on sale. Shame, this game really shouldn't exist!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything Blood Bowl 1 did right i.e. Customization, real time leagues, playing with a friend in leagues, ect. they ruined or just took out altogether, and everything Blood Bowl 1 did wrong they made even worse i.e. Broken dice RNG, team pros and cons not mattering at all, play styles that don't focus on the ball just lose, ect.I would stick with the first one, it has about the same amount of players and is simply the better game. Not to mention it's cheaper.			",144,20,0,58,66,3,79

												Never played Blood Bowl 1 and I feel most negative votes come from people that have, rating this game on its own it's pretty good, really like how the teams feel different and you can defintely not play the same as the elves as you do with the orks.Games are long which some people consider to be a bad thing but I really enjoy it since I can really get into the game. They have been releaseing new updates which have increased the number of teams which all who had the game got for free +1They clearly want to make this a good game and they are still working on it improving different features.The perma death and injuries system make this game much more strategic that one would have thought at first, decisions have to be made carefully. In any case there are offline leagues as well in case you just want to try out different teams and tactics without having to worry much about the players			",140,16,5,10,15,4,21

												Blood Bowl 2 is a game that wants to celebrate the nostalgia of the original tabletop version, while also offering players a little something new to go along with it. The aim of the game is pretty simple, players need to score the most Touchdowns!! Of course, it’s not as simple as that however, as there are increasingly-difficult teams standing in your way. Timing your run as well as creating the right situation to give your team the advantage, all while a timer is counting down, is crucial to whether or not you end up scoring those Touchdowns!! And lest not forget the repetitive failed dice rolls, which will be something that people will hate.That being said, the game looks great and plays well. I do recommend it to anyone, so long as you have a little patience and a handle on your temper, failed dice rolls will make you scream at your monitor.			",111,11,1,13,3,1,4

												I gave this game a fair go, really. I understand it's a dice game, I understand its random. However today this happened. My LVL6 Witch Elf, with sure footed, on elf turf to mitigate injury, died while going for it.Yes I had 2 Apothecaries because I was playing against Dwarves, however. Before I had the chance to use the Apoth the game crashed.Because this game is an unfinished pile of trash (and that's being kind).You still can't, in twenty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fifteen, log back into a match after disconnect.So I have uninstalled and will never play a BB game again. Even ignoring this situation, the game has a plethora of other problems, bugs, compatibility issues, connection stability etc.Currently as of the time of this review only 1200 (as if that isnt already an indication not to buy) people are playing BB2 at peak time. I dont play at peak time, neither does the majority of the planet. I'm forced to play EURO and US players from SEA and wait 20-30 per movement while the server catches up. Also if this causes a DC, you cant get back into your match. That is unacceptable. I'm not even going to get into gameplay and balance. Suffice to say all you need to do is check every single league leader board and see undefeated Chaos and Lizardmen on every one. Most of their victory's come from concedes by the way (you can check). Since nobody wants to struggle keeping players alive rather than playing the damn game. The perma death and injury system has driven away the entire player base. I enjoy an amount of randomness in my gaming, it is exciting. However this game is over the top. The amount of chance involved takes away all notion of a skilled player having an effect on the outcome of a game. You always do the most sensible stuff possible to succeed and still get ♥♥♥♥ed over by rolls. IF this game were more along the lines of X-Com, where a skilled player can have an actual impact on keeping important pieces alive, then I would continue playing. This game does not give you that chance. Your best players can die from the most simple and likely to succeed action. That is ridiculous and makes this game feel more like a chore than anything else.All that is left here are the bash team trolls. ""Can't think so we just hurt stuff."" See ya never.

												Oh how I wish there was a ""kind of"" option for reviews.I have nothing to say that hasn't been said before. The concept behind both computer adapatations of bloodbowl is brilliant, however both of these adaptations have problems that are large enough to be deal breakers for many people.Bloodbowl 1 has the worlds worst ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interface. Its so bad it borders on unplayable if the player isn't familiar or willing to spend the first 5-10 hours trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ they're doing. It's graphics are pretty crap, and it's a game that hasn't really aged with grace.Bloodbowl 2, for some reason, decided to only include like 5 races on launch, and then charge $6 for each additional race. Just for some perspective Bloodbowl Chaos Edition gives you 22 races from the get go. Coding AI for strategy games is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tough, because you need to be able to make the computer out-wit a player who is engaging in an inately cerebral activity. So instead of making good AI, the folks at Cyanide just made mediocre AI that gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t RNG and numerical advantages. All of that being said the games are still played by a bajillion people, and will be played by a bajillion people forever. Thats because if you can climb over the UI, shimmy past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, and buy the DLC on sale or something, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. Its an incredibly rewarding tactics game with all of the punch of a sports game, the story telling ability of Dwarfort, and a depth rivalling chess.So yes I recommend this game. I do it with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of caveats, because the game is not for everyone. However there are some of you that will fall in love with this game, and you'll join the ranks of steam users who have clocked 500+ hours.			",152,67,0,68,14,3,16

												Although when the game orginally came out, I felt cheated by Cyanide Studios. Having played 300 hours of Chaos Edition, the lack of teams was disappointing. I honestly felt the game had little to no hope. However, almost a year later, coming back to the game to find out teams have been added, and Legendary Edition is being released later this year, I felt compelled to try the game again. And you know what? It was better than I remembered. The new cut scenes and greater detail in the game allow you to get increasingly more emerged in the game. It was everything (well almost everything, lacking the Team Editor and the other teams) I loved about Chaos Edition, and added extras. However you can tell the game was orginally rushed to be released. Little details, such as a lack of stadiums (something which Blood Bowl has always backed imo!) and the only cheerleaders being zombie-esk humans in Reikland uniforms was disappointing, especially considering you can see updated skins of the cheerleaders from Chaos Edition, and previous editions, in the crowd  at times(the one that stands out the most is the Orc cheerleader). The little details they skimped out on annoyed me, but that may be because I enjoyed the previous games so much.So to conclude, if you have played the previous editions of Blood Bowl - hold out on buying Blood Bowl 2 until they release Legendary Edition. If you are new to Blood Bowl I would recommend getting Blood Bowl 2 before they add the rest of the teams to the game with Legendary Edition.			",126,27,3,26,30,8,41

												Personally I find the Warhammer universe pretty dumb, and sportsball really isn't my thing. But as far as turn based tactical games go, especially boardgame adaptions, this is a pretty fine game. 7/10 - would stomp on downed opponents again. Not a full price recommend unless you are passionate about warhammer stuff, but definitely a pick-up-on-sale for turn based tactical folk. Word of warning though, it's deceptively complex and tough to play despite how dumb it looks.			",158,34,6,28,70,4,53

												[Updated oct. 2016]UPDATE: I find myself going back to the game once in a while, when I'm not in the mood for anything too demanding, and I found it was time to update this... Because... I've given up now. Can't deal with my issue 4 (below) not being dealt with. Just totally inexcusable in my book.Still disappointed. Love Games Workshop worlds and games. Really liked the updated graphics, but the interface is the first disappointment... It's NOT intutive. I think it's fine with some experimenting or letting people choose other setups, but you shouldn't be forced to ""learn"" their new setup.UPDATE: I've gotten used to the interface, still not sold on it. Single player campaign is... very stretched out... and too short... How is that possible? Well it introduces one rule per game pretty much, which means that to players who know Blood Bowl you're basically playing one extremely long tutorial. And then short; because after the campaign itself you can only make single player leagues. No progression or different tournaments as in the first Blood Bowl.Then the REALLY big letdowns:1. 6 or so races? WHAT? And extra races at around 1/6 of the full price game per race is just outrageous?! When I found this out, I tried to get my money back, but you can only do that after playing a max of 2 hrs... So having played a bit more, well...UPDATE: More races are comming and free for all now... Ok... Should have been this way all along...2. Extremely counterintuitive setup of leagues. Why is there only one way to do everything. I mean... It's horribly set up. Really. Never seen a setup I had such a hard time figuring out how to get through.UPDATE: You'll get used to it, but still... really annoying interface :-)3. WHY can't you set up more than one player managed team in an offline league with computer teams. A lot of players asked for this as an update to the first game and they didn't introduce it in this sequel.UPDATE: STILL missing. Biggest letdown along with the next one!UPDATE: 4. No saves in single player during a match... You HAVE to finish an entire game in one session. No save at half time. I honestly didn't write about this in my first review, because I was sure it would be implemented in one of the first updates. So if you're not single... forget it. This game is not for you... Kids. You need to get rid of them if you want to play... The choice must be because ""they"" don't want people to hack save files, but... jeeeez. This only affects those that do not cheat. Cheaters will cheat. Those who have a life, can't play... Thanks a lot... In summary: Don't buy unless you are single, have no job, and don't mind starting the same match several times...So disappointed...			",159,17,12,24,10,4,33

												As a long time player of tabletop games related to this genre, I was drawn into this game by some fun videos on YouTube.I wish the general community was as fun as the people who play on YouTube...Pros - GW has a real knack for a sort of gallows humor and tongue in cheek style that somehow manages to be both dark and silly at the same time. It lends itself well to games that actually grew out of war simulations. The two narrators are entertaining, as GW characters are wont to be, and Cyanide I feel did a wonderful job capturing the flavor of the game.Cons - 1. The UI is clunky. There is no entirely safe way to plan your moves. Misclicks result in anything from having to start all over to having your player throw the ball across the field when you did not intend it. 2. The teams are not particularly well balanced. This goes back to it being a GW game. GW, for those of you now aware, stands for Games Workshop. This is a company that just abandoned a decades old wargame franchise seemingly specifically to spite a sector of their customer base they apparently considered harmful for their sales. We'll see how that works out. Meantime, Blood Bowl 2 sports a handful of the teams available in the semi-official (I.E. not at all supported by GW for decades now) tabletop rules. Skaven are all but unplayable. Chaos seem to rule the leagues based on the fact that they have access to an entirely separate set of upgrades that other races can only rarely access (mutations). Skaven can get them fairly easily too, but Skaven die in higher levels in truckloads with an armor value of 7 even on front line players. As the game rewards survival of multiple games heavily, Skaven and other low armor, high finesse teams find it hard to compete at higher levels of play. At least one private league now invites ONLY finesse teams into its league to avoid the devestation the high armor and high strength teams visit on their weaker cousins. There is no cure for this imbalance in sight. My experience with GW - players and designers alike - is that making the game balanced and competative is not really high on their list of things to do. Wonder if Cyanide can break that trend? So far, the answer is no.3. The graphics are pathetic. This game offered little in the way of graphics to begin with. It is a standard sort of top down view with very clunky camera control. But to make matters worse, players move about stiffly, often ending up somewhere other than where you aimed them only to slip into place like a loose block, and the handful of full screen animations that pop up typically sport part of one player poking through the other player because of bad positioning of the camera and/or models during the animation render.At one point the game reversed the team uniforms between my Skaven and the opposing Skaven team...?In short, just old fashioned sloppy graphics and animation work. 4. The community is not nearly as friendly as the YouTube videos that seem to be the main marketing arm for the game would lead you to think. Summary: Nice idea, but the execution is predictably pathetic as GW tends to just pawn its IP off to whoever is willing to fork over the money and let the chips fall where they may. There has never in the history of GW been anything remotely resembling quality control as far as their game rules go. They make wonderful miniatures and great game fluff, but horribly horrible games. And their company is quite obviously struggling because of it.In any event, I would definitely not recommend this game. The lack of balance between the teams and the clunky UI have left me entirely uninterested in continuing play, and like so many GW fans, the player base seems to be a bunch of rabid dogs whose main function in life is to convince people to play games with them by treating them like crap and pretending there's nothing wrong with the game's design or execution.   Caveat - There are those who accuse me of being ""Sausage fingered"". I seem to do well enough in pretty much every other video game I play though. I'm pretty sure this is just the typical GW fanboy reaction to anything negative you ever say about their games, but in the interest of fairness, there are apparently people who just LOVE the UI. I can't imagine why, and they are none too communicative as to WHY they think the UI rocks, but there you have it. Maybe my fingers turn to sausages specifically for GW games.			",13,2,0,4,5,2,3

												If you play Blood Bowl for the Multiplayer then you can ignore most of the negative reviews on steam as they all seem to be written by people who just wanted Singleplayer.For those who are focused on the multiplayer side of Blood Bowl, Blood Bowl 2 is a MASSIVE improvement over the first.  Everything from league management over team management to actual playing in leagues and competitions comes with better and clearer UI and is much more user friendly than Blood Bowl 1 with its horribly dated and janky interface.It comes with 8 races and comparing that to Chaos Edition is a little ridiculous as Chaos Edition was the 4th RERELEASE of the original Blood Bowl, the basic version of which also came with 8 races. If you are in it for the singleplayer you can still get basic randomized competitions and a story campaign featuring the Reikland Reavers. This campaign also includes a tutorial which means the first couple of matches aren't ""real"" Blood Bowl matches but ones with simplified rules. Toward the end the difficulty really rises up though and it's a neat story with a lot of memorable characters from the Blood Bowl lore.  All in all the Singleplayer is perhaps not as fulfilling as the offering in Blood Bowl 1, I can't really comment on that much because I don't play this game for its Singleplayer or GW's ridiculous ""lore"".One thing that Blood Bowl 2 is not however is a buggy mess like Blood Bowl 1 was for years. A fact that all the Chaos Edition fanboys seem to conviniently forget.			",140,38,0,44,17,4,59

												I got the game and i loved it (only got to for a few hours), however, now the game is simply unplayable on my laptop. this is due to not being able to change the resolution settings and save because for some reason, the lower my mouse goes on the screen, the further out of calibration the pointer in the game becomes and i can no longer click on things such as the save button in the options menu to change the resolution to even fit my screen. (also the only program i experience this with) I really want to play more of this game.....if my issues are dealt with in future patches, no complaints.			",48,1,0,5,0,1,28

												A game very hard to grasp and to understand, but if you like tactics games, sports and a funny violent medieval-fantastic universe, Blood Bowl is going to give it to you. Moreover, a lot of guide can be easily found on the net and will help you to improve your understanding of the strategy behind the game. Don't be fooled by the advisertisement campaign, this game needs to hold on tight to truly appreciate it. Even if being unlucky can be very very bothering, stay till in the end on the pitch and you'll see how the Blood Bowl is mannered. Most of coaches will give you advice, praise you for the good game and admit when they got very lucky (and will also apologize, event though it's Nuffle's fault) for injuring/killing your players.

												The game, while tactically very fun, is slow; opponent AI turns take between 1 and 2.5 minutes; end result is that I find something else to do while my (AI) opponent takes its turn.But that doesn't make it a bad game, it just makes it a slow game. The negative recommendation is related to saving.1. You cannot save in the middle of a match. Period. Combine that with the aforementioned slowness of the game (call it 4 minute rounds, and 16 rounds in a match), and you're looking at losing up to an hour of gameplay if you have to leave before the end.2. Having just played an aforementioned hour-long match (which I enjoyed very much!), the game simply did not record the progress. I was taken back to the Solo League screen, with the same opponent I had just played, and none of the gained stats.Such a simple concept should not be simply not allowed (saving a game), nor should it straight up fail to save progress in the rare instance that your progress is recorded. That's pretty silly.			",25,1,1,5,3,1,16

												I was pretty upset there was no offline/hotseat leagues. And there was quite the lack of creativity available for league customization despite them talking it up. I pre-ordered, then refunded the game and just bought it for xbox one, which now I have to convince my friends to buy it to play a a league.... it's pretty sad, but thats kinda what I expected after the first blood bowl. As long as you don't mind losing the pretty art etc, you can just play Fummbl online for free. (it even has a hotseat league mode) but you will need to know the rules to bloodbowl for things like leveling etc.			",111,17,0,33,28,3,30

Product received for free
												Great, fun game with a lot of customization and variety in terms of players and teams.So why is it not recommended? Because from experience it's Bethesda levels of glitchiness and whilst Bethesda generally has the courtesy to fix bugs and glitches post-release, Cyanide has neglected to fix the ""black screen"" crash where the game after running perfectly on a relatively old but powerful machine (i5 3570, 8GB RAM, GTX 670 can run Witcher 3, ArmA 3, Overwatch, Fallout 4 etc. on high settings very well) crashes to black yet you could still hear the game going on yet you cannot interact with the game. Whilst this is not an issue in most games, due to a lack of a midgame save feature for singleplayer and bot matches this results in you losing the progress you've made in the game AND the experience points (or in Blood Bowl terms SPP) you've accumulated throughout the match. This is incredibly frustrating and is not helped by the fact that Blood Bowl is a game based around dice rolls meaning that you may not get those rightfully earned experience points again during the rematch. Also noted is that against the bots, the bot's AI timer sometimes gets stuck on 0:00 meaning that the game is unable to progress as there is no way to force the bot to end their turn. Again it may not sound like a big deal but imagine playing a game of chess where after 30 minutes (and still waiting), your opponent hasn't made their turn and it just so happens that you were winning that game. Sounds frustrating? That's Blood Bowl 2 for you and it's unexcusable. All of these problems have been well documented by the community and reported on the forums yet these bugs remain unfixed despite over a years worth of bug reports. As it stands, as great of a game as Blood Bowl 2 is. I cannot recommend it due to its bugginess being on the same level of Bethesda's games at launch, and this is a turn based strategy game and not an open world RPG.tl;dr game is buggy as hell, fix up your game CyanideEDIT: As of the 26th of December, even after using unofficial community methods of ""fixing"" the game such as http://forum.bloodbowl-game.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=8004 or deleting config files as well as official methods of fixing the game such as updating drivers. The game still black screen crashes frequently. Again using Fallout 4 as a benchmark since it is a game that is widely known for stability issues. My experience with Bethesda's open world RPG was not as crash happy as Blood Bowl 2 (which is a turn based strategy game) and that was after I loaded the game with a lot of unofficial mods which affected the stability and performance of the game.

												This game needs serious work.  The whole system is flawed.  There is nothing intuitive about it.  Playing the game is cumbersome and, for the most part, boring.  The selection of teams is confusing.  The inablility to see what your players do makes them useless.  This is not worth spending your money on for at least two patches.  A bit it sucks is not sufficient enough to describe it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game. Most of the negative reviews I have seen are over simple stuff like DLC, and little things that are not added yet like a grid or player names above their head. If you like turn based games, violence, sports, or having 11-16 ""rogue like"" RPG players where your favorite player can die and never come back then you will like Blood Bowl 2. Easily can get 200 hours out of this game.			",69,4,1,12,3,1,2

												I, like many, was looking forward to the release of BB 2 for a long time. I didn't care about the marketing strategies being used with DLC/teams etc, thats just how games are sold these days, it sucks but uunless we all stop buying nothing will change. Anyway the game came out and i started playing and just felt deflated.....don't get me wrong, it looks great, the animations are fun (you'll turn them off after a few games!), the AI seems improved, the campaign is awful, so everything i expected from BB2. Thats the problem though, its exactly how i thought it would be, its just BB in video game form, nothing new or exciting, the continuing lack of 'random events' and 'dirty tricks' continues to frustrate! Within a few hours i just got bored......would i recommend the game, yes if you like BB you'll like this, but otherwise.....			",29,16,0,18,9,1,8

												After playing an Old World League Season, having a human team that managed to survive the never fail blocking, dodging and picking up of the AI, with only 2 losses and 3 deaths, my first game in the post season is against a Dark Elf team that supposedly won 9 games yet still has a fan factor of Zero and has 5 linemen with Guard (strength skills that they require a double on level up to get), and three other stat adjustments in the roster. My Ogre got a double and has block , I have a lineman with strength 4 and only two of my blitzers have guard.There is something seriously wrong with the level assignments of the AI teams and the always Zero Fan Factor means that supposed parity of the teams is achieved by giving the AI more skills and stat rolls to achieve a closer team rating which completely unbalances the game as they recieve up to 100 points in team rating and stats as against your up to 10 points of fan factor which gives you nothing.

												The following are the ONLY two features that aren't a step back from Chaos or Legendary edition:- Direct steam invites for multiplayer- Better graphicsThat's it. EVERYTHING else is a big step back from Chaos & Legendary. Tons of little things from the interface to the feedback to the camera that really start adding up (especially the announcers, holy crap did they become unfunny in this version).But most of all, the roster is a joke. A grand total of 8 races compared to the 20+ you get out of the box with the cheaper previousi games. New races are slowly being added...as DLC for $6 a pop. Maybe after 2 more years and $150 this game will be as good as Blood Bowl 1 is right now for $10?			",153,60,0,13,11,3,61

												So far Blood Bowl 2 is living up to all of my expectations and surpassing more then a few. First a word of warning to those reading reviews there are two bits of misinformation i have seen on this steam page and i want to point that out real quick.1. Blood bowl 2 does not have fewer races it has the exact same amount has blood bowl 1 so watch out for dishonesty there as they both started with 8.2. Blood bowl 2 does not have day one dlc the lizardmen and wood elf teams were not finished when the game was (also they are not part of the originial BB2 8 bringing the total to 10 whenever they are added)Anyways now that thats out of the way here is my take and first the good.•Graphically this game is a massive improvement it is absolutely gorgeous in comparison to the graphics of the rather aging blood bowl 1.•The UI though is bar far the biggest improvement and in ever way both the games menu system and the in match ui are simply astounding i think it would not be unfair to call it a 100% improvement over the originial where the UI was the most dodgey aspect of the game.•The information, this may sound odd but blood bowl one wasn't always that good at telling you what was going on. Blood bowl 2 gives you easy to find data and critical info like the chance to dodge or pass or catch.•The next big mention is the multiplayer in blood bowl 1 getting into and setting up leagues was a hassle and now it is rather seamless. •It is also worth mentioning this game performs exceptionally well in fact it strangely enough peforms better then blood bowl 1, i get a more steady framerate from it then i did from its originial at the time. (not to mention you can actually alt tab thank god...)•Lastly the attention to detail is really good, everything feels visceral from the animations to the quality work of the models and the envrioment.Now for the Bad.•There is some missing fluff, the biggest place i have seen this is in the lack of race specific cheerleaders. I would consider this a minor con as to be honest in all my years of playing blood bowl i rarely ever cared about cheerleaders they often aren't worth the investment. So i can understand why the dev team put less of a focus on them given that the playerbase largely ignores them. Its also worth noting you get to have your own stadium which helps to replace that home team feel that the cheerleaders sometimes provided.•I have also heard there is no visual progression outside mutations for leveling up players though i cannot confirm that yet  and that is about all the bad i have found.Now the iffy. •Bretonians instead of Goblins. It's hard to say if this is a good thing or a bad thing. On one hand goblins offered a unique style of play centered around cheating. Currently no team really offers that in the same way (except for the dwarfs but that is a stretch). The other side of the coin is the fact that goblins are not a competitive team but a ""fun"" team where as Bretonians are clearly a competitive team. •So im tossing this one up to opinion, if you wanted more competitive teams in the initial roster then goods news for you! If you were hoping for more ""slapstick"" teams in the roster then i am sad to say you will have to wait for anything beyond dwarves.			",143,20,0,26,23,2,38

												Well as a huge fan of of the original game it saddens me to not be able to reccomend BB2.Pros: Graphically much improved from the first game.Entertaining dialogues in the career mode even if it is over in a blink. Cons:Game is hard for the wrong reasons. The first one was hard because you were taking a bloody 900 rated team and bashing it into a 1200 rated team. This game is hard because you take your 1400 rated team and play a 1000 rated team and you watch as every.single. roll. goes thier way. I'm all for RNG and it adds a lot of complexity to the gameplay but whatever bonus there is to the ai rolls is absolutely infuriating at times.Its annoying to watch as your player gets tripped twice and you waste a re-roll, and then have the ai Magically move 6 players with no problem with a 33% chance or lower each move. To me this kills the original base for playing the game. Whats the point of spending time strategizing how to protect the carrier when the 1 opponant who magically gets by the 4 defenders ko's him and when i have the ai carrier completely surrounded, lone behold its like 50/50 if he actually goes down.There is an astounding lack of content for the price.Customization is at an all time low. Individual player customizations are only a handful and team customization is almost non existent. What could be considered ""customization"" is procedural stadium upgrades and additional dlc.If this title was 15$ I would say yeah give it a go, but as it's currently priced its a massive dissapointment. Some Ideas that would make me feel like I actually spent my money well.1. This game has a huge cult following.Open up the game to the steam workshop and let the players help you create the customizable content for the teams,players, and stadiums. Heck even have them be able to create entire teams and leagues as playing versus generated bot teams without a real world impact feel is something thats seriously missing from the first.2. If you do the above, run daily leagues that provide a chest or package depending on your final position that gives you epic loots to customize your teams/players			",28,7,1,12,35,2,7

												I came from blood bowl 1 so to me this is an amazing 2nd game considering how much they improved on the first game.I'll say right away i probably wouldn't have played it as much as i did if i didn't stream it for 2 weeks straight with some eager viewers that wanted to get into blood bowl or wanted to watch some of the random aspects that sometimes can make the difference between winning and losing.This game is hard, unforgiving and can be frustrating at times due to the dice rolling aspect and there is a decent amount to learn if you have never played a blood bowl game before but if you can learn the basics and enjoy the idea of lvling up a team, upgrading your stadium and managing what you think is most important to add to your team.That is a big part of why i like it, but the meat of the game is the matches where you setup your players to create tackle zones, protect ball carriers, make perfect throws that go past half the field or simply punch opponents into the crowd and watch the spectators kill the opponents players or who knows? Maybe they will get greedy and try to run a little further than they can so they slip and die from the fall.I recommend it because i think if you are into this kind of game and can get past the learning curve which is relatively simple if someone breaks it down for you then this is a really satisfying game to play both against ai and other people even if you are on the unlucky side of things sometimes.

												Blood Bowl 2 is a better version of the previous PC release in every way except number of teams.  The new UI conveys information much more clearly. An added campaign mode holds the new coach's hand with a series of games that gradually introduce the more advanced concepts of Blood Bowl.   The negatives I can see have nothing to do with the game itself.  Blood Bowl 2 is not an action game. It is a recreation of the tabletop down to the dice rolls.   Do not purchase the game thinking it plays something like mutant league football.  Also understand that while there are open leagues for matchmaking, Blood Bowl is not balanced for perpetual leagues with many players.  The structure of open online makes it very easy to make ""overpowered"" teams.  If you do play, your time will be better spent in player-organized leagues where you can learn the game and build up rivalries.			",119,14,0,15,12,4,23

												Great game. This coming from a veteran of the tabletop game, stretching back to the 1st and 2nd editions in the 80s.Played plenty of Chaos Edition, but much prefer this version. Amongst other things, it feels more epic. Thankfully we no longer have to play matches In an empty field or on a stupid boat!Also, I can get a random match always within seconds. True, the open league has its own issues, but that's another conversation entirely. With Chaos Edition I would have to set the matchmaker going and go off and do something else instead. More often than not it wouldn't even find me an opponent. Really frustrating.Sure, BB2 isn't  perfect. It needs more races, especially to keep the Chaos teams a bit more under control. Thankfully the new teams that are on their way should do that. Personally, all my favorite  teams are already in the game (apart from maybe Norse), so I can't really complain.Would like to see race/specific cheerleaders, and some variation on the crowd members when a player is surfed. Would also like to see player models develop as players earn levels. That was a nice touch in Chaos Edition. Overall, buy this game. There is a strong community, particularly in private leagues and will only get stronger with the introduction of the upcoming new races, plus the World Cup of course.			",16,2,0,4,6,2,2

												Blood Bowl 2! A game in the Warhammer universe and all about football, dice rolls, skill, LUCK (mostly this kind lady) and how best you can kill the other guy's team.Quite fun even for a person not entirely captivated by the Warhammer universe or even the classic version of BB.Teams are mostly balanced, with some being faster, others being stronger etc.Solid gameplay considering that there's a plethora of races to choose and start and yes sometimes the game does seem unbalanced.Campaign is fun, good story, funnier commentary by Jim Johnson the Vampire and Bob Bifford the Ogre!Multiplayer is even funnier! Although losing a player to a block or even a slip (going for it) sucks and sometimes you have another player that accumulates so many injuries that you HAVE to fire him.Still! Game is pretty good even with the downside of having paid DLC and *cough* the pay to play teams have some extra stuff. In the end it does feel balanced!In the end it is fun!In the end you do get to kill and score!8/10!!			",100,18,1,16,3,3,12

												I would deffinetly recommend this game but you need to keep in mind that you will rage sometimes with the RNG but it wil alsol sometimes help you, so it balances itself. You can always win, yet you cant ever be sure of victory. It's a lot of fun to learn new stategies and get visibly better. It's a little hard to start as it is the 2nd installment and it previously was (and still is) a board game so it has a lot of veteran players. You need to have patience at the beggining when you get destroyed. You need to calmly learn the game and be statisfied  with managing to make good plays, than forcing a draw and MAYBE, later on getting a win. I haven't played a lot of it yet but i can recommend it to someone who wants to learn a new and difficult game. In addition I find the community to be really great, every game that a I get a visibly better opponent and they notice my mistakes (as they also know im a new player from my Coach Level), they try to give me advice and are friendly. It's a big plus as the games may last quite long.			",162,30,7,21,20,4,18

												 I understand why so many people are upset due to the content/price ratio however cyanide is in the process of reconciling this, they have just announcied 4 additional free races to those who have already purchased the game. That is now 6 races added to the game with no additional cost to those who currently own the game. I believe that is a step in the right direction, they have shown they are not going to milk those who have bought the game with DLCs and it makes business sense as im sure they'd rather sell more copies than dish out 10$ DLCs to a small/medium size player base.With that said I have sunk a lot of time into this game so far and ive loved every second of it (well when the dice are in my favor). Blood bowl is a game of strategy, luck, character devlopment, and tears as you fall out of nuffle's favor. Some new players, inclusing myself when first picking up the game, may feel there is to much luck involved, but I promise you if you take the time to really delve into this game, read the strategies that vary for each race, learn how to devlop your team to play the game you want them to, you will find that the RNG adds to the exciment and fun of the game rather than limits it. If the prospect of a well thought out fantasy sports game interests you and you are the type of person that loves games with depth that require some work on your end to learn, you will get as many hours and more out of this game as I did.Now, in terms as to wether or not it is worth purchasing over BB1 is a personal choice. With a time tested game such as blood bowl that has been around since before I was born, I feel the only room for improvment is in polish. That is why I bought this game, that is why I play it over BB1. There is more content in BB1 at the moment in terms of races however that will not always be the case and the way things are trending you may be missing out on free content if you decide to purchase later.If you are conservative with your money and already own blood bowl 1, you might want to pass on this game for the time being untill more races are released. If you are a blood bowl 1 owner on the fence, now may be the time to purchase in order to gain access to the new races for free as well as enjoy a fresh take on the game you already love. If you are looking to buy a new game to sink a lot of time into and get lots of enjoyment out of, I cant reccomend this game enough.			",51,6,1,15,31,2,35

												FOR THOSE THAT KNOW BLOODBOWL:Better graphics than the previous version, much better interface.The tension when it slows down adn plays an animation when your armour gets broken is a really nice touch, since really gets you going ""Dont die, dont die, dont die etc...""Can normally get a game fairly quickly (less than 20 seconds) on the largest multiplayer) but the longer it takes the more chance the tema you face is either way stronger or weaker...I like the couple of rule changes for humans, was definitly needed.AI is much better, but still does not do 1 free move event, or act differently when its the 7-8th or 15-16th turn.FOR THOSE THAT DONT KNOW BLOODBOWL:Chess with randomness... Fun but very brutal. On a bad day even the best player can still lose...So dont take it too serious, and it is a very fun game.And now getting the 4 additional races free, shows that the devs are really doing the right thing.I hope they release items in the store that can make you characters look more unique. (2 types one that only you can see and ones that both you and your opponent can see;])			",138,22,0,56,10,3,40

												Game is great, looks fantastic, has that Blood bowl feel when you play it (like swearing on your bad dice rolls).Might have fewer races and teams than blood bowl 1 CE but the dev team is adding them, as well as enhancing the game with the feedback of the community (thanks for the grid cyanide :)Might still not be the PERFECT blood bowl game but it's pretty, and pretty damn close.+ Cyanide decided to give extra races dlc to existing PC owners so it's great.

												In case you don't know Bloodbowl is an infurating game originally originally on a board with tin soldiers as peices. It's infuriating because everything requires rolling dice and a 1 is always a fail and a 6 is always success... you'll be surprised by how many 1's you roll! And (quite often really) they will come up while you are doing something important... and salt will flow.When this came out I would have recommended it to new players anyway, but since the last patch I would say this game vastly trumps BB1 by cyanide. The only remaining niggles are minor and hopefully being fixed, with the up coming 4 new races being given to anyone who buys before they come out, now seems like a good time to get this game.It's not a totally faithful copy of the last set of rules and there are still some things they say they will add, but if you want that there's a free java client called fumbble that has a perfect copy of the rules. If you want to have fun and enjoy a good looking version of bb. this is it.			",8,0,0,2,0,2,2

												There has been a ton of discussion over whether this game is a step forward or a step back for the series, and I have come to the conclusion that it is actually a step forward. The graphical updates are much appreciated and after some support post-launch I think the game in general is the best way to play Blood Bowl in video game form. It's super fun and value for moeny for sure given how long each game is. The races included are pretty core, and generally, I don't find myself MASSIVELY missing any races from Chaos Edition for the most part. Furthermore, with the announcement of 4 new races, most of which are pretty interesting, and all of which are going to be free on PC, and the current DLC, both of which are good value on sale, the race pool is going to be pretty decent by the end of next year, with my only big miss being Amazon. Overall, if you want to play Bloodbowl, I think this is the new standard edition for PC. Chaos Edition still has it's advantages, but I personally would play this version for sure.

												If you've got a few mates and think you’d enjoy some friendly banter over a fun, sports-strategy game then Blood Bowl 2 is fantastic. It’s a pretty accurate digital version of the great board game launch way back when and if you learn to laugh at your misfortune and you’ll enjoy it even more (the game has a habit of seeming to deliberately undo your best laid plans with unlucky dice rolls, lol).The campaign is simple, but a good intro to the mechanics of the game. Treat it as an extended tutorial rather than the main feature of the game. The AI customisable single-player leagues are decent, but the AI isn’t sophisticated enough to try those desperate plays in the late stages of the game, and thus becomes a bit predictable. The multiplayer is where the real fun is to be had. There are a bunch of leagues you can enter and the community is normally made up of decent people (as with any game you’ll find the sore losers and those that just constantly complain about their “bad” luck… but for the most part people are friendly). If you can get enough mates together then private leagues offer endless enjoyment (and bragging rights)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bloodbowl's gameplay could be described as a Turnbased, RPG lite with elements from both American Football and Chess. Or as one of the most FRUSTRATING game ever... Until you actually figure out how to play. And this is where I think most people are at when it comes to Bloodbowl. They get a couple of Double skulls, and from there decide that the game is bull****. And than there are those who would argue that Bloodbowl 2 is not as good as previous Video Game versions. Which in all honesty is accurate. This game is indeed lacking in MANY options that previous games had including extra Online League Options, Singleplayer Campaigns, Races and various Thematic elements such as Racial specific Cheerleaders, differences in armor for higher level players, etc. However, the reason I am recommending this game is because dispite all of the downsides, it has one very big upside. Graphics.Now I know many are already thinking ""Graphics don't make games good! Gameplay does!"" And while that is most certainly true in many cases, it's a bit like saying that you shouldn't buy a new better looking version of Chess because it's no different.  The Gameplay of Chess is NEVER going to change, so in essence if you have the choice between a videogame adaptation that looks like crap vs one that doesn't, which are you going to get? Now I am in NO way disregarding the fact that the content of this game is not all that great in comparison to older Bloodbowl games, Especially in the Singleplayer experience. What I am saying is that the better graphics do make it a more enjoyable game overall. Now if you are someone who is interested in getting into Bloodbowl in general this is a very good jumping off point. The UI is clean, very few bugs, and the Graphics are pleasing to the eyes. Bloodbowl is an amazingly fun Risk Management game and Bloodbowl 2 is a great adaption of it. But keep in mind that buying this game for it's Singleplayer experience is a bad idea. But if you're like me who got it to play with/against friends and Random internet people it is most certainly worth it.			",62,4,0,6,10,3,17

												I've never played any previous Blood Bowl game, which means i might not be the guy you should listen to. But this game is really nice. The graphics look good, the UI is nice, animations beautiful and gameplay really addictive ( Unless you have constantly bad dicerolls ). Overall a great experience. My only significant complaints are that the race dlc are slightly overpriced, but since the developers are planning to release 4 other races for free ( if you own the game prior to their release ) it's not that much of a big deal. Another problem would be that if you buy this game, you're probably gonna buy it for the multiplayer, since the singleplayer isn't really fleshed out and the AI is not even competent most of the times.

												A game that is based around dice rolls, you may end up playing out a plan perfectly or the dice could say no and kill your favorite player. It's great fun when it goes your way but it punishes you so badly when it doesn't. Though the bad makes you value the good more. If you don't mind games based on dice rolls give it a try. I'm not a sports fan in the slightest, I don't keep up with any or even watch any but this game managed to keep my attention and I've enjoyed so much of it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a bit skeptical at first to recommend this game since it released with some issues, and those issues were not being fixed by the devs. But now they seem to have injected some kind of drug making them work super fast in order to make this a very enjoyable experience. Some might say that Blood bowl Chaos edition is way better because it has more races and such, but i find this to be more enjoyable since Chaos-editions UI was absolute garbage to be honest. This is like when films went from black and white to colors, sure the films itself might not have gotten better but its much more enjoyable with colors in my opinion.Keep in mind this game is not for everybody. It is in the sports genre, but it is wayyyy more tactictal than what you might expect.The cult following this game has is deserved, doesnt matter if you play chaos edition or this you just cant deny that Blood bowl is a good game.

Easy enough to pick up and there is a lot of depth to learn and master. There's nothing better than a solid game of blood bowl 2. Epic wins are fun and tragic losses suck but all in all it is a part of the game. There is just a degree of long term strategy that comes with the luck. I feel like I am coaching my team and i love leveling players up in different ways. Building them up for the long term and prepping for the future plays. Leagues where you know who you're playing seem super fun. 8/10 can't wait for new races!			",68,6,0,7,6,1,10

												Bloodbowl is a great game but let's face it, the graphics in the 2009 version were awful, even by 2009 standards. This has been greatly improved, and the UI has been slightly improved. Does that justify the high price it goes for (as much as 45 euros in some places) for a game that is otherwise lacking many of the teams present in the excellent Chaos edition?I don't think it does. 30 euros seems a fairer price for the amount of content we have. Yet if it retails for less in your part of the world, or you see it on a promotion i do recommend it. Like the board game it is based on, it is an excellent game which is tactically rich and equally rewarding and frustrating at times. It uniquely combines the tactical challenge of a sport, with that of a battle.			",335,45,13,77,33,8,109

												The game isn't BAD. But it's not Blood Bowl. Not in the shape that Blood Bowl players of decades know as Blood Bowl.Cyanide has made their own little uneccesary changes, because they know better than the rest of us. Thus creating a Blood Bowl that is gorgeous to look at, but it's not the Blood Bowl most players recognize.Not only have they done this, but they've done this without ever ONCE trying to explain WHY they do these things. Nor do they offer the ordinary fan an option to play with the standard rules of the game. So.. I regret having given my money to Cyanide for this 'almost but not quite BB' game.

												I do not recommend this game at all in its current condition.  Where to start... Firstly the game is missing 14 teams compared to blood bowl chaos edition. 14 teams!  That is more than half.  There are multiple bugs.  The developers have no idea what giving updates to the blood bowl community is, they are pretty much radio silent always!  MatchMaking is unbalanced and the only teams you come across are Dwarf, Chaos and Orc (all Bashy teams).  They is a campaign but nothing compared to blood bowl chaos edition where you got to manage a team from the start and progress them through many competitions till you finally got to the blood bowl!There are alot of minor issues that dont effect the gameplay but are still noticeable... like the fact i cant rotate the camera all he way around the pitch or that the only races that watch blood bowl are human peasants who all bought there outfit from the same store, and orcs who like to beat the life out of that drum!Until alot more content is added, being different teams, a proper campaign, more league options and bug fixes then i would avoid.The only improvement is the way the game looks.

												Cyanide is the developper. Took about 12 expansions for the first blood bowl to make a good game. Will need about the same for this one. Cyanide, release unfinished and buggy content and they almost never communicate. All in all they are very semi competent about what they do. The ONLY reason this game is semi popular is because its bloodbowl. ANY other generic IP or theme and this game would (and the first one) be a flop.			",51,7,0,15,22,1,41
