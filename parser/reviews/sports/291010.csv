												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a indie horror game.Your daughter is assigned to an asylum because of attempting suicide. Somehow she has gone missing and it is up to you to find her.At the beginning you can choose if you play as the father or the mother (no difference to game, just difference voices).Soon after the start you will realize that The Hat Man is nothing more as another Slender clone. You move through the rooms and try to find all pages (notes from your daughter) while the Hat Man is trying to chase you.The Hat Man is fairly slow and not a real danger at all. You can easily walk through the rooms and collect the pages. To finish the game it takes something around 30 minutes.The graphics are not great at all. The whole game is very repetitive, all rooms look the same.The sound is okay but the voice acting is really awful.The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is not scary at all and especially not worth 4,99€ (former price was 14,99€).Sounds 3/10Graphics 3/10Gameplay 2/10Atmosphere 2/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1591,617,71,238,229,30,272

			My review of ""The Hat Man: Shadow Ward"", a first-person survival horror game set in an asylum developed and published by Game Mechanics.		

Game: The Hat Man: Shadow WardGenre: Survival horrorDeveloper: Game MechanicsPublisher: Game MechanicsCopy supplied by developerThe Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a first-person survival horror game set in an asylum developed and published by Game Mechanics.STORYYou play as either the father or mother of Virginia Berry, who disappeared from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. As you go and investigate her disappearance, you find no one in the asylum and you start looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being chased by a shadowy figure.Unlike most horror games of this nature, reading the notes and discovering what your daughter was living through is more interesting than simply looking at doodles and drawings of the monster. Unfortunately, the plot really goes nowhere and is disposable at best for the game.GRAPHICSAs far as Unity games go, this doesn't stand out from the crowd. The environments are polished and I didn't encounter a single bug, but the rooms all look the same and it becomes really hard to navigate the environment. The design of the titular villain and the shadow people isn't really scary, and once you see them the built-up scariness disappears.GAMEPLAYSimilarly to Slenderman: The Eight Pages, you must move through the environment looking for pages while avoiding being caught by the Hat Man. You will also need to find some objects to open new areas and further explore the asylum. The pages are really easy to find since they make a noise when you are near them, and the shadow people can be ""defeated"" by hitting'em with your flashlight ""Alan Wake style"".CHALLENGEThe game is really easy to beat, and the antagonist showed up rarely and was really slow and easy to avoid.SOUNDThe voice acting for both the father and mother is hilariously bad, and that alone is worth playing the game. There is only one piece of music, and is the relaxing one that plays at the radio. There are also some ambient noises, and luckily no screamers or loud jumpscares.REPLAYABILITYAfter having beaten the game, you can replay it to unlock the 11 achievements that require you to beat the game as fast as possible and find and listen to all the diary pages.The game is creepy most of the times, but the boring level design, poorly developed ghosts and short length make the game feel more boring than it needed to be. However, I recommend this game for the voice acting and really cheap price to support the developers to create a better product.Story: 6Graphics: 7Gameplay: 5Challenge: 3Sound: 5Replayability: 4ENJOYMENT: 6FRUSTRATION: 3Follow me on Twitter: @nickygra97Subscribe to my channelLike on Facebook{LINK REMOVED}Check my official websiteJoin my Steam group ",532,126,11,40,24,4,34

												Holy crap, is this ever terrifying. From the moment you step into a generically rendered asylum following the trail of a missing whats-her-name, it's just a non-stop thrill ride of collecting journal pages scattered randomly around the repetative environment as though by some drunken anti-literate. You move from recycled room to recycled room with only your trusty, predictable, yet totally unnecessary flashlight to light the way, as the masterfully executed tension mounts until you are randomly accosted by a terrifying, low-res shadow something-or-other and accompanying generic shrieky noise.As your sanity ebbs away, you notice it's wearing a hat. A horrifying black screen mournfully informs you that ""he has captured your soul"" before you exit out of the game and uninstall forever. Truly, the fear may dig deep but the memories last forever.			",226,121,0,21,20,0,10

""THE SCARIEST GAME OF 2014""Oh boy, what a lie. This is exactly game for most of Youtubers and for little kids. Zero creativity, and besides that everything else is just stupid and repetetive like both above - Youtubers and 13 year old kids that think they are the face that runs the place. Enough of negativity right now and let's head back to the game. You have 3 options which will cost you same amount:A - 0,99€ - The Hat Man: Shadow WardB - 0,99€ - Nice tasty ham & cheese sandwich from gas stationC - 0,99€ - Year salary and work opportunity at magical place called ""Steam Quality Control Agency""Pick the A, B or C and leave it in comments down bellow. (Game itself is suppose to be generated and it is, but it works on repetetive basis so after few minutes you can clearly expect what will happen. Game is certainly not scary at all. There will be 2 joys out of all gaming experience - cheap trading cards set and 11 easy achievements so you can decide if it is worth. Expect nothing else out of it.)Bonus Point: Bologna SandwichRating: 2/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												One of the first items you get in the game is an axe. A strong, shiny, reliable axe. And what do you do with it? You use it to pass through a door and then you leave it behind!Seriously? Is that credible? You find a weapon in a terror game and you drop it? For the God sake, in the real life I would marry that axe if I could keep it that way. Nothing more to say.PS: The rest of the game is like those crappy freeware Slenderman games but also with a disastrous translation.			",230,92,1,32,22,1,42

												I'll be honest, I bought this game because it was on sale and had genuinely good reviews. Watching the trailer I didn't get the feel of a slender game. However once you start playing, that's exactly what it is. You go around the asylum looking for notes left by your daughter while you watch out for The Hat Man. So if you're a fan of slender games go ahead, but if you don't like them, don't buy this game. It was a let down.			",24,12,1,1,2,0,3

												Prepare to die screaming…or more likely laughing at the horrendously bad voice acting of ‘The Hat Man: The 20+ Pages’……wait….wrong game (and more on the voice acting later).  Alas, just as has happened with so many other indie horror games in recent years and with the advent of the Slender series, ‘The Hat Man:  Shadow Ward’ (the ‘for real’ name) falls victim to the same ‘collect quest’ gameplay  mechanic.  This means that you need to find a set number of pages from your daughter’s diary to complete the game.  Ultimately, that’s the basis of the game:  you either play as the father or mother in search of said daughter, who has gone missing from the seemingly empty asylum she was committed to which is now populated by shadow people/The Hat Man (BTW – the idea of shadow peeps is based loosely on fact and there are many documented cases, and even some decent movies, about people that have seen or had encounters with these so-called ‘Shadow People’).  Thankfully, you don’t just search for pages as you also need to find some other items to progress deeper into the asylum and defeat The Hat Man (who I guess is like the pimp of the shadow peeps) to get your daughter back.One of the more unique attributes of this game (though it’s been done before) is that sound is utilized to pinpoint the location of pages/other items you need by means of whispery voices.  Also, the sound design of this game isn’t half bad for being a budget title, with some of the sound effects/ambient music being pretty creepy in my opinion. Now as promised, I must go back to my earlier comment about the voice acting.  Granted, this game is super short and can be beat in less than half an hour, so you may think that voice acting wouldn’t be too important in such a game…..but it kinda, sorta totally is.  Essentially, it’s hilarious.  No, seriously, I’m not joking.  I mean, it’s so stupendously bad that it’s good (I don’t know how that works; it defies the human intellect to comprehend how that can be) but it’s true.  I figure most people will laugh at it, though some may actually want to cry at how bad it is.  And for all those 100% achievement unlock Steamers out there – prepare thine selves!!  There is actually an achievement for listening to your daughter reading the pages of her diary as you collect them.  Sure, this game can fairly easily be ‘100%’d’ and the aforementioned achievement is easy enough to unlock, but don’t go joy-puking your faces off just yet as I seriously believe that listening to all of the pages may very well land you in an asylum. I personally just barely managed to keep my sanity intact while unlocking this achievement, so don’t say I didn’t warn you.This game can be fun for like 2 hrs tops, but I wouldn’t recommend it at full price, even if it is a budget title. With decent voice acting, who knows, perhaps this game could have been terrifying.  As it is, it will likely be overlooked by most gamers, but it is somewhat interesting and good for a laugh….or cry, so give it a shot. ",138,20,1,3,3,0,1

												“The Scariest Game of 2014”?I know these marketing techniques and they usually don't influence me, but I still went ahead and bought this game for like 25 cents because, why not? One can argue that for the price any game is worth it, except The Slaughtering Grounds, but actually there's games that are pretty much similar or even better and they don't ask for a penny. With all due respect to the developers, this game is an attempt at being something and I can see it, but fails due to the large amount of bugs and many other problems. I'm really nit-picky so I will address a lot of things in this review that most people maybe don't have a problem with.When booting the game, I recognize the Unity launcher right away. Me and Unity games usually don't go well, but I can't judge a game by it's launcher obviously... Then the game boots up and a crazy amount of FPS makes me almost certain I'm going to have tearing issues, so I check Settings, only to find out that there's no option for VSync. I thought this was a standard in game options by now! Key bindings are pretty simple and I did try to change the inventory up and down bindings to my mouse wheel and it doesn't work so I'll just stick to the T and G keys, I had never done that, and it's terrible.Finally I choose Play, and I pick to play as the Father. Upon the first second of the game... there it is, the damn screen tearing all over the place. Quite hard to ignore but since most of the game is dark as hell, I give it a pass. So, I go upstairs, touch a book and the game has officially started. So the first complaint is, although I know a lot of people just skip it nowadays but, tutorials please. I had no idea what I should be doing and how should I progress, you can't expect me to rely on the internet to find out how to escape or kill a damn ghost that just clips through the wall and grabs you in the first SECONDS. Turns out I just needed to Zoom my lantern in her face and she dies. Then it seems I have to pickup... pages? Wait isn't this like that game where you're in the woods and... yes it is. You're pretty much lying if you say this game isn't a copy of Slender: The Eight Pages inside 4 walls because it clearly is. What it does differently is the fact that this is randomly generated, and it works well for the most part. You go right pass 3 rooms, and if you go back the map has changed. This is actually very interesting and an idea that I found to be wasted on a game like this.So you do get the book and those pages, and finally enter this sort of asylum, this is where you seek the pages that your daughter wrote, as this is some sort of dream that you got to save her from. Upon collecting the fifth page, when the little 5 green balls are lit now on my HUD (which I had no idea what they were for like 2 hours), the almighty, spooky and fearsome enemy spawns. One of the main flaws in this game is the so called ""Hat man"", because he's just laughable, he just floats and follows you trying to catch you. Which he will never do since you can outrun him easily. Then he despawns somehow. This is the whole game, or pretty much all of it. Then again I do say, the lack of tutorials make this game so much harder than it is, no one actually gives you any tips on how to evade the Hatman or even progress in the game. The journal pages do give you tips but I don't feel it's enough for the player to actually understand what he has to do. Just to clarify, the little orbs in the HUD indicate that a new item to progress in the game has spawned and is now placed in the random rooms, so you need to find 5 pages for each new item to progress in the game.Another complaint I have is, sound effects. You might ask, what sound effects? Exactly, there's barely any. When I die, playing as the father by the way, the sound of me getting caught is of a woman, what the hell. Also, the Hatman himself hardly makes any kind of noise, he doesn't even make a sound when he catches you...The Hatman spawns are literally the only thing in this game that makes it hard and infuriating to say the least. And when you get cornered there's no way to go, making it such a cheap way to make you lose. Since there's a lack of manual saving, you're only allowed to save if you find certain save points, but these are hard to come by and you will lose a lot of progress. Also, the worst thing is when you've made good progress and the Hatman literally just clips through the damn floor and kills you. That made me rage-quit this game so badly I actually was about to give up on this, but I still got to the ending because I like self-torture, and achievements.The atmosphere is... good! Despite the game being flawed to hell, having a not-creepy-at-all enemy that's just annoying and the lack of sound effects, the atmosphere does feel tense, and the feeling of not knowing where you should go because the game is randomly generated does give it a feeling of anxiety, since you never know what's on the next room, it could be the spooky scarecrow or the next exit. But please take note, a scary game doesn't need to have the brightness of the ocean depths. Don't rely so much in darkness to make your game scary. I hate games that are way too dark. I know horror has to be dark, but I like playing a game, not just hearing it.As for my final thoughts... The Hat Man: Shadow Ward, is it worth your time? Sorry, it isn't. With this formula there's so many more like this, and they're probably better executed, probably free too. I always wonder if developers read these reviews and reading what I just wrote would leave me heartbroken, but I have to be honest, Hat man is a poor game and I cannot recommend it. 2/10 ",381,120,11,7,27,3,10

												My daughter is missing. They told me not to come, but like I wouldn't come if my daughter was missing. But nobody is here, how could I get in the way if nobody is here? The setting is creepy, theres a fan on the wall behind the desk slowly turning. A painting lies in front of me. I feel drawn to it, almost as if in a momentary trance. I snap out of it, and head up the stairs. I walk into what appears to be a little girls room - maybe my little girls room.A chair is on the ground in front of me, it looks knocked over....I walk to the bedside table. A diary is sitting there, so I go to open it to read it.All of a sudden, the diary's pages start moving on their own! The world turns dark and grey as the book flies off the nightstand towards the door! Now THAT got my attention! I walk towards the door to leave. Locked....i must have missed something. I go to pick up the diary that is now on the floor. Theres voices and whispers all around me! Holy crap i've got to get out of this room!Then a poorly rendered silhouette with white eyes moves slowly towards me - but theres no where to run! This must be the first jumpscare!It moves towards me painfully slowly. It makes a very corny and poor audio quality screech as the camera shakes slightly, extremely un-scary.'He captured your soul!'No, they captured my ♥♥♥♥ing 19 cents.1/10			",634,129,20,70,81,6,109

												There is a reason this game is 19 cents (depending on what country you live in) I would label it as a ""So bad its good"" type of game The voice acting was so bad. I've seen better performance in a adult film. It follows a Slenderman pattern (such as getting pages and avoid running into Hat Man) but this game has a better story and explanation. 2005 called, it wants its graphics back. I watched Pewdiepie (I know what your thinking, Omg Pewdiepie? Really?) play this game when it was in demo stage and i must say the game looked better as a demo.However, i do appreciate the effort this game tries to give. My best reccommendation is to pick it up while its 96% off.			",89,3,0,13,3,0,2

												I’ll admit I maybe spent longer studying The Hat Man: Shadow Ward’s death screen than it deserved. But it so nicely summed up the game for me that I couldn’t help but appreciate that I was being handed a focus point for my review without even having to look for it.But let’s step back for a moment because it’s not just the death screen important here, but how you arrive at it. After scurrying through a twisting, self replicating maze of stock textures and out of place items, you’re inevitably caught the titular Hat Man in all his floating jack-o-lantern glory. And what’s this? He’s opening his mouth and- oh, I guess that wasn’t supposed to happen.And just like that we’re transported to a perfectly flat, perfectly bland death screen featuring three buttons, each drawn with the same ugly font and taking up almost the entire screen. I realize it’s a screen that didn’t need to have much detail, but what’s here is such a pitiful excuse for a menu I couldn’t help but laugh at it.I suppose I can give The Hat Man that much anyway; it made me laugh. First at the ridiculous voice acting that I want so much to believe was intentional. Then when turning around and laying eyes on what I think was supposed to be a terrifying demon but looked more like a blazing smile.And finally at the death screen, which I saw many times and eventually decided was a good enough place to give this game a rest. After all The Hat Man is just doing his job haunting this asylum, and doing it damn well at that, so I’ll just leave him be and go do literally anything else to try to forget this ever happened.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Here are my main gripes:Has potential, but I feel like I was ripped off when I paid 14.99 for a 250mb game. I feel like a 4.99 price tag would be more appropriate. The voice acting is painful. I'm pretty forgiving of things like this, but wow. It actually made the game less scary because some of the comments were very out of place and sarcastic. When you're doing a horror game, the feeling needs to be raw with genuine fear. How are we supposed to be afraid if you aren't? I don't feel like I have enough time to sit and listen to the journal entries. Whenever I try to listen to or read one so I can learn about the story, hatman comes and kills me. I don't know if this is a glitch or normal, but I can't learn about the story if I get killed every time I'm reading the journal. I really wanna know what's going on with the lady's daughter but I still haven't much of a clue as to what's going on in the asylum.Here is what I liked:Running around collecting pages/piecing together a story. Some folks feel like it's too bright, but I disagree. You can't have shadows without light. When the bad voice acting wasn't ruining my immersion, I was actually scared of the hatman and rushing through the asylum trying to find everything without dying. Though I wish he was a little less agressive so that I could have more time to explore and see the rooms/read journals. So with all of this being said, I'm still trying to complete the game. These are just my opinions for right now and may likely change.  ",379,188,4,91,76,4,48

 ""Hope is tomorrow's veneer over today's disappointment."" The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a first-person game developed by the company Game Mechanics with emphasis on survival. Atmosphere & presentation: + Occasionally the game succeeds to scare the player. o The randomly created corridors, rooms and items offer a certain replayability, but the multitude of negative points in the general presentation of the game decreases the motivation to play it again.o Solid sound effects create a partially threatening environment.- The player has to face only one threat in form of the Hat Man, which results in a rather low level of difficulty.- The A.I. and general collision system of the antagonist is poorly implemented, e.g. it tends to get stuck in the wall. - At the beginning the player leaves an axe behind, which negatively impacts the credibility of this ‘survival’ game. Characters & story: - Sloppy story telling. - No characterization of the protagonist.- No voice acting during the entire game.- Very short game that can be finished in less than 30 minutes. Summary: Hat Man does not work out as intended, because it has been released in an unfinished state. After 30 minutes, which it takes to finish the game, you will only remember the weak A.I., repetitive level design and sloppy story telling. Therefore, the advertising slogan 'the scariest game of 2014' can be considered a blatant lie. Achievements: Estimated time for 100 % completion: +3 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 11Multiplayer achievements: none			",204,69,0,61,5,0,38

Product received for free
Basic InformationTitle:  The Hat Man:  Shadow WardDeveloper:  Game MechanicsPublisher:  Game MechanicsGenre:  Atmospheric HorrorGeneral ImpressionThe Hat Man:  Shadow Ward is the dev team’s first release on Steam, but it has left an impression already. Indie horror games aren’t a novelty yet most try to stand out from the crowd and fail. Not this title though. Whlie Hat Man takes clear inspiration from the Slender series, it ups the ante by offering an equally interesting story and far more documents and items to collect at a very affordable deal. It’s more fast-paced too and you need to constantly be on the move while carefully searching the many rooms and corridors of the asylum backdrop in the game. The difficulty is also quite impressive, so it will require some trial & error. The graphics and sounds are more than decent, given the game’s budget and price point and the presence of both Achivements and Trading Cards, make this game worthy of any horror game collectors on Steam.Strong Points+ Interesting setting and storyline.+ Steam Trading Cards & AchievementsWeak Points- Unbalanced difficulty.- Short and with no replay value.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												So, I have to preface this game by pointing out that I was given this game for free by one of the only marketers that isn't an idiot in the industry, who handed keys for the game out free of charge to drum up press for the price drop and the free update.Ignoring that, the game isn't actually bad, but it IS something you've probably played before; this game is a slightly more involved version of Slender.If you weren't scared by Slender, or games like Slender, you won't be scared by this.This is half of why my review may or may not be something you should listen to, because quite frankly this sort of thing is fairly distant from what I consider my affair.You're chased by numerous ghosts and the HatMan, all of whom look like the bad guy from Ferngully. Also, you can find the credits to the game in a room, killing most of the atmosphere that's set by the idea that the game is based on a true story.Aside from that, the environments are very enclosed, dark asylum settings, so it raises the question of whether you'd get this for cheap, Slender for cheaper, or Amnesia/Outlast for a bit more than this.I do have to say if nothing else the game is actually reasonably priced when it's on sale for 20 cents, although five bucks may be a bit much.I'm actually a bit torn, because I don't actually see this doing too well outside of 20 cents to a buck territory, because the entire presentation is fairly amateur and ends up being something I'd compare to free unity games, but damn that marketer was nice.Can't say I can recommend this past a sale, because the actual content just isn't the sort of thing you'd usually see charged for.Also, for the half a person that cares, I think I bugged achievements so... There's that?			",379,32,7,19,21,3,36

												The voice acting was pretty decent, but everything else fell extremely flat for me. Cliche setting, collecting notes when there were a number of other more interesting objects in the world that could have been collectible instead. Poor optimization and performance. An atmosphere shattering ""credits room"" in the beginning of the game (in the actual game world, not intro credits). An unclear story, non-threatening monster, confusing layout, generic copy-pasted art. I could go on. Just a very mediocre effort all around. I'm not sure what the developers were trying to accomplish, but they missed bigtime.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid, low-budget first-person survival horror closely linked to  Slenderman: The Eight Pages , housing a fair amount of haunting images and thick atmosphere, evoking a handful of steady cold shivers and durable tension within its short run, mostly due to the eerie and restrained sound design.Your daughter has gone missing from the asylum where she was being treated for attempting suicide. Once you enter the vacant facility, investigating her whereabouts, you begin looking for pages from your daughter's journal while being hunted by a dark presence wearing a hat.The basic gameplay of finding a bunch of objects to unlock new areas for further exploration is quite easily comprehensible, yet it may be a fair disorienting challenge to obtain all 20+ pages since the randomly altering level design relocate the pages on each playthrough; though once you pinpoint the location of a page, whispery voices are in effect and narrowing it down become child's play.The stiff level design is utterly mediocre at best and visually it is quite dull, but the ridiculously awkward voice-over is the shattering winner to listen to and hence should have been left out. Also, the poorly written dialogue comes out far more silly rather than intriguing, and finally - considering the source material that is based on real events - the outcome turns out quite immaterial.At a discount however, coupled with appreciating solid scares, Game Mechanics' short piece of indie horror, regardless of being a Slender copy, earns a night's attention. 5,5 / 10			",293,91,5,3,4,0,2

												This game starts with a somewhat interesting concept. You can choose between a mother and a father, which so far, the only difference that it makes is that your death scream is different. You're trapped in some kind of demonic ward, or should I say, a shadow ward? This ward is always changing, so you have to keep moving forwards all the time. You gotta collect pages, too, like in Slenderman games, but way more, and a few other items along the way like matches and levers. You pretty much run between corridors, and now and then, you'll hear some kind of whispering, telling you that there is an item in a side room. If you miss an item and leave the room, just keep running, there is no point in going back, it probably changed already.The main enemy of this game, is the Hat Man, a being that from a distance kinda looks like a trenchcoat wearing guy with a hat, surrounded in a cloud of blackness and with a purple aura. Later on, he changes to something different, that's way faster and more persistent, adding a bit of fear to the mix. That being said, the problem with these procedually generated games is that, sometimes, it's way too random. And in this game's case, sometimes you're going to be able to finish the game in less than 30 minutes, sometimes it's going to take way longer than that. It took me around 30 minutes for a room I needed to spawn. I even believed my game was bugged. The game's atmosphere is kinda creepy at first, being chased by this creature that never stops. (Actually, he does, when you enter a certain kind of room, like stairs or the room with the pit)It's got some weak jumpscares, too, like a ceiling light falling, or a wheelchair moving. The problem is, after running from the Hat Man for a while, and after seeing the same rooms and the same jumpscares over and over again over the period of....dozens of minutes....It kinda starts to get old rather fast. It's quite a short game, and it doesn't offer much. It's really, really cheap, too. So, all in all, it feels stale, and it gets old rather fast, but I did find it fun for a short while. Maybe playing lots of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games myself kinda made me more tolerant to this kind of stuff, but, If it's on sale, why not? You could try it for yourself.			",431,92,18,35,32,4,27

												You made a game based on a really neat concept, and something which affected me deeply when I was young. However, you slapped this badboy together in a weekend, and in the first three minutes of gameplay have an immersion slap to the face by making a room filled with your developer credits and logo. The enemies give you literally no opportunity to react. This feels like a pre-alpha version of a game. Straw that broke the camel's back: The game is too frusterating to be scary.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off I'd like to thank the devs for a free copy of this game. I'd love to recommend it but in its current state I just can't. It has the potential to become a good, fun horror game. I could live with some of its flaws but some are just too major. First off: the voice acting. It's bad. Immersion breaking. Second, the map is basically a huge never ending maze of very similar, and the same rooms. But the biggest flaw, and the game breaking one. This could be a fun slender clone but the issue is that its just not scary. I only saw the monster once when I played and I was never scared of being killed. He's not fast enough, or dangerous enough, you barely see him. With some updates this could be a fun game, and easily worth the $5, but it just needs more difficulty and more scares.

												I played a game like this back in April, called Daylight.While that game seems to have had a higher budget, they both accomplish the same thing fairly effectively. The gameplay is quite similar.Basically you need to find the pages of the daughter's journal in a randomly generated hospital-shaped maze... which redraws itself.While you do this, there is a creature called ""Hatman"" who tries to catch you.There are also smaller shadow-people which can be banished with a flashlight.The catch is: Using the flashlight attracts the Hatman.Not a bad game, and it tries to do a few things that are quite difficult to do. Mostly get things to happen in the right order, with the player looking in the right place at the right time... without forcing them to.As with Daylight, the results are mixed. Mind you I am not aware of any game which has pulled that off without issues.A fun ride, if a bit short... which is good otherwise you'd become used to it.Don't look too hard at it and just enjoy the playthrough. Sort of like a made-for-TV horror movie.Popcorn optional.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This game is really like a Slender instead there are more pages to find. There is also a little advantage because the pages can be hear when player is near. Hat Man Shadow Ward have simple storyline and some other objectives to do, nothing special but when you consider very low price... it could be a good horror game for one night.

												If you were looking for a good horror game, don't even consider this game. Not only are the graphics absolute trash, but the whole game seems to revolve around collecting the remaining two pages in the rooms and finding items. Finding the items is an absolute nightmare and I only managed to find the crowbar, matches and a spike pit featured in the trailer video, all in one hour. That is literally how long it takes sometimes due to poor game design and repetitive room layouts. The room layout is so repetitive you easily lose your way and have difficulty even telling where you are, it's essentially a walking, searching and escaping simulator all mashed up into one. Not to mention the AI for the Hat Man is atrocious, since all it does is ""teleport"" to a location directly in your field of view, namely in front of you. He goes through walls and can't be shaken off, as he'll just ""teleport"" directly in front of you again when you have all five pages of the journal. He looks like some image taken from google and plastered onto a model and called the oh-so-scary Hat Man. As for the Shadow people, I never even encountered any of them. The only thing I'd seen that would even possibly be close to that was at the beginning when you click on the journal and a creature shows up to steal your soul, but I think even then that's just the Hat Man. It's a bit like Dead by Daylight, Slender: The Eight Pages and Vanish all combined to make this pathetic excuse for a game. You walk away and instantly the rooms have changed, making it impossible to find your way back. Some hints or even an explanation of what to do would be nice so I'm not aimlessly wandering around halls, running from the dreaded Hat Man, who's kill animation makes me want to throw up. Shockingly enough, the audio and atmosphere in the game was tolerable. Audio would get extremely repetitive, but the occasional radio playing badly done music was fairly creepy. Also a falling tile or light, whatever it was, was a good trick, but the novelty wears off really quick and you grow to expect it. Same for the mysteriously moving wheelchairs, although those can get you caught if you're unlucky (Or daft).So overall, this game isn't really something you should buy, especially at full price. If you're really that desperate to try it, wait until it goes on sale, that way you won't be as disapointed. I'm disgusted people say it's a quality game and recommend it, as a troll or not, because this is worse than Rob Zombie's '31'. And that movie was terrible. Really, if you want a quality game that still has the room changing mechanic, install Vanish on GameJolt, it's good and free.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A tense experience that behind some pretty cheesy and hilarious voice acting actually has a surprisingly interesting and well written story. It plays similar to that of a game called Slender except takes place inside an asylum in which you have to locate your missing daughter. I'm not usually a fan of these kind of games but this has my interest. Would be interesting to see what developers like this (real people) with a larger budget could produce as this actually has a nice layout, good design choices and an effectively tense atmosphere.

												This game has a scary atmosphere and sound effects, but voice acting is fairly cheesy (hearing someone say ""Hoooooolyyyy"" really takes away from the scare experience). The Hat Man is fairly slow and rarely seems like a threat. You have many vents and spots where you could hide from him, but I never had to use any of them. Game is fairly short (40 minutes to beat it my first time), so the price tag is questionable. Not worth it unless it is on sale or they fix the slow and buggy Hat Man A.I..			",54,25,0,4,5,0,4

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a must-have for gamers who love horror. I feel positively about most aspects of this game. First of all, the price. This game is very affordable at the price of £0.79, although I picked this up in a sale (£0.19!), and it is worth it! I feel this game is quite underappreciated for what it is. The plot of the game itself is interesting, but yet not very unique. A mental asylum is quite common to see in horror games, however, copying ideas can result in a better game overall (the way I feel about this game). In no way at all will I compare this game with other horror survival games such as Outlast or Alien: Isolation, but it must be said, this game is genuinely scary, what you'd look for in a horror game.I feel the way this game's layout is set is great, for example, the beginning of this game has a few doors that I myself thought you'd be able to open, but cannot. This can result in disliking the game or liking it even more. For me, this tactic doesnt mean the map is too detailed, and I like that. Many times I've played games that have had too many places to go to, when in the end, all I had to do was go through the main door. Adding details like doors that canot be opened helps prevent wasting time, which is great, getting to the next point of the story without wasting time or lowering suspense. Like I covered previously, the main obvious plot is not too unique, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all! Having a man chase you through a mental asylum is, of course, going to be a common theme. (Please note, the actual story to this game is rather unique, and the fact it's based off a real life story makes it all the more scarier!). The controls are easy to use, the game is not too basic nor complicated, and there are plenty of them (and they're rather familiar with other games). Graphics, textures are all fine, and the flow of gameplay compliments it well.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I appreciate games like these that are affordable, fun to play, not complicated and that give you a few hours of enjoyment. I'd strongly recommend this to people who enjoy horror games.

												I was frightened by The Hat Man: Shadow Ward the whole way through, it is a whole lot more than just walking around collecting pages. There is obviously something very supernatural about the asylum and combining this with reading the pages bit by bit to piece together the story of your daughters’ disappearance, you start to feel like maybe you have the same fate as her. Or maybe you are her.Check out my full review here http://imagengames.com/the-hatman-shadow-ward/ ",38,13,0,1,5,0,1

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is a survival horror game where you play as a parent trying to find your daughter in an insane asylum. Along the way, you collect items, pages from your daughter's journal, and avoid the Hat Man. At first, I was impressed with the graphics, sound, and voice overs. Once the game began however, my enthusiasm was drained to find out it was just another Slender style game. I was disappointed by this because the idea and concept of this game was so great. It could have become a great adventure, survival horror game, but by modeling the game play of a Slender game, it just becomes a ""spin off"" of Slender. I wouldn't abandon the concept at all, but instead work towards making a bigger game with the concept. As much as I like the concept however, I just can't recommend this game I'm afraid.

												Hat Man is scary!  It is legit creepy.  The only thing that irritated me were some of the mechanics in the game.  Getting stuck on the monsters with no where to go (like on Stairs etc).  If you want to know what this game is like, if you've ever played Slenderman (the original), it's just like that, in that you have to pick up papers (pages) to proceed.It just needs to be patched up a bit more and some of the 'player tested' mechanics adjusted, but it's definitely a nice little romp for cheap.  My livestream viewers were creeped out more than once.  The way you are stalked by the monsters has to be the most tense and excited I have been in awhile.If you'd like to watch me play a bit of the game.  Take a peek in the video below.

												Neat little first person horror game that plays kind of like Slender along with some key items you need to find in order to proceed with the game. It's short, cheap, and bitter-sweet. In other words, it's alright.The Bad:The voiceovers for the journal entries were a bit dull to say the least, and even one of the entries completely didn't match up with the text, sounded like a different voice actor/cheaper microphone.Opening doors and equipping items is like pulling teeth. For doors, you have to be extremely close, and your clicks don't even register half the time. As with items, there's delays and its unresponsive sometimes.Jumping is literally useless, and leaning is too slow and doesn't go far enough.The Good:You will probably♥♥♥♥♥♥bricks at least once in one of your encounters, luckily for you, I have the worst colon in the world, so that's impossible for me. I did jump at least once though.Eerie environments and sounds.Bad AI makes enemies unpredictably scary (Something kind of like Afraid of Monsters)The Objective:Your goal is to get about 20 pages of your daughters journal, slowly uncovering the mystery of your missing daughter at an insane asylum, with the enemies getting more aggressive the more entries you pick up. You also need to find some key items to proceed throughout the game. You can save your game on TVs, unlike Slender. You must also avoid the shadowy figures chasing you down every now and then, or they will glue themselves to you and eat your face off faster than you can say ""Game Over"". After you get the 20 something pages and do a certain something, you've beaten the game.Game isn't too difficult, and it lasted me about an hour with about 4 deaths.So if you're a fan of horror games (like Slender), you might want to give this game a try.

												""Victims worldwide have reported seeing this man peering into their homes, their bedrooms, their cribs, their cars, their lives and even into their souls!"" Now it's peering into your computer screen through this nice little Indie horror game.My first encounter with a Shadow person I was like, ""Wtf is that? That's not the Hatman, it's not wearing a hat!"" It didn't seem like much, so I just stared at it and then.....It ate my soul. This little kid with a black blanket over it's head continued to eat my soul for about 15 minutes until I figured out I had to collect pages for the journal lol. Once I figured that out, I moved on, searching the ward for more journal pages. The creepy atmosphere and sounds made me constantly do 360s with my flashlight thinking I was about to lose my soul the whole time.Overall, it's not a bad game. Usually games like this force you to play in a lower resolution than preferred, but this actually lets you choose. If you like creepy, suspenseful games that makes you feel like something is going to murder you wherever you go, then give this a chance.			",258,65,4,11,40,2,19

												The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie horror game, seemingly heavily inspired by Slender and similar games. You play as the father(or mother, depending on which you pick) of a young girl who was sent to an Asylum. You receive a message telling you that your daughter is missing and you decide to go look for her in the Asylum. Upon entering her room and opening her diary the Asylum changes, the diary explodes and the first Shadow person appears. You are now compelled to gather all the pages of the dairy as the games gets progressively harder with each page. Overall, the game is pretty graphically outdated(it's an indie game with a limited budget), but they were able to get the spooks pretty well(the SFX were nice, too). The voice-acting is either purposely bad or just bad, so it kinda makes it hard to get scared when the voice-acting makes you wanna laugh. There are some bugs and the Shadow people are pretty slow and you get rid of them quite easily. One of the biggest issues was the fact that upon dying I was cast back to the beginning, hence I'd recommend a way of saving the game or just more checkpoints. If you wanna get some creepy atmosphere going I suggest buying the game on sale, there are better titles out there, but it's still pretty solid.>I'd give it a 5/10>Pros: Spooky atmosphere, achievements, randomly generated map, allegedly based on real stories.>Cons: Bugs, inability to save/rare checkpoints, the enemies aren't that tough, voice-acting, short, graphics are outdated, the rooms look almost the same but it isn't that bad.Copy supplied by developer.

												The game feels nigh on impossible to complete. No way to escape the 'hat man' can't run around him and often forced into a dead end rendering one way death and the other.... death. I found out that you must find a crowbar or flatbar to get over spike traps. found it once and never knew what to do with it. Now I can't find it at all... Nah not a game i would recomend			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Quick Review-The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is an indie ""horror"" game that adopts many game play features from Slenderman, but expands on them to bring you a some-what-suspenseful-page-collection-puzzle-game, and far more fair to you then Slenderman ever was. -Detailed breakdown review- Story:  You play as either the father or mother searching for their daughter in an insane asylum, after stumbling across your daughters journal, the book is ripped asunder. You now need to puzzle your way through the labyrinth of the asylum and collect pages of your daughters journal and tools to help you progress to the next series of rooms.The voice acting is pretty amusing, it's just the right combination of ""expressive"" and ""emotionless"", probably first-time-voice actors. If nothing else you need to play just enough to hear some of the ridicules things they say. ""What the...? Now you have my attention"" Game Play: As I've already eluded too, the game takes the ""page collection"" and ""being chased by a noisy black figure"" from the Slederman series. (I'll stick that in spoiler tags if you're really that sensitive)I haven't played very many horror games so I won't pretend to well versed in the art that is ""scaring people"", I do know that whenever I play a scary game my whole goal is to keep myself from expressing it. This game succeeded in keeping me in suspense and catching me by surprise a few times.Potential key game play feature spoiler: after you start the game by finding the journal, you need to puzzle you way through a sequence of rooms that will randomly change, however to unlock a new area, you need to use a specific item to progress, such as opening a special door, or moving an obstacle.  Achievements: The achievements are fairly straightforward; finish the game fast (30 minutes is the fastest achievement), finish the game without saving, and then the rest are pretty simple or obvious repeat-to-get-this-achievement.Update: May 24, 2015. Ruh roh, it looks like three of the achievements are bugged, the counters for: Paranormally Active, Cheating Death, and A Good Book are broken and not adding up properly. This maybe fixed someday, but judging from the forums the achievements have been broken since at least May 1st 2015. Price: The Hat Man: Shadow Ward is priced at $4.99, I was gifted my copy by one of the developers (thank you!), the price is pretty fair, considering the effort put into the game. However you probably won't put more than a couple hours into the game. Conclusion: When it comes to Indie games, I tend to prefer to show support for up and budding game developers. This game might be a skip for most people, but it does have promise and takes a few steps in a different direction from the original inspiration.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update May 24, 2015:Update about broken achievements within the game.

												Will the real Slenderman please stand up?    A short while into The Hat Man: Shadow Ward - after your first, frustrating encounter with the title, erm, ""entity"" - you'll come across a room with the game's credits scrawled all over the walls.  In the thirty-odd minutes that I've humoured this game thus far, that's easily the most inspired and ""original"" idea which I've encountered.  And between the complete lack of footstep sound effects, the ridiculously fast ""walking"" speed of your character (maybe YOU'RE a ghost, too?), and the highly uninspired graphics and sound design, it's hard to recommend this to anyone bar the most hopelessly horror-addicted among us.     Maybe I'll bother to return to it again some day, maybe I won't.  I believe ""meh"" is a word favoured by the young'uns these days... Verdict: 6/10. (PS Did it really take THAT many ""game designers"" to make a game this ordinary?  I'd be a tiny bit embarrassed to be up on that wall, in all honesty...not utterly humiliated or anything...just faintly embarrassed.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like this kind of game where you run around in circles, go for it.If you hate games with questionable FOV, then dont pick this one.This is small budget game, with ""decent"" graphics, not really responsive controls, weird fov at 1080p, non-existing story/challenge.

												On sale for two gumballs. It's worth more than two gumballs.. I compare this game to some brainless arcade game, playing for a while before you figure out what you're supposed to do. I have a feeling there are no maps, but generated halls and rooms. I could be wrong, but only save points are memorable and safe. Just keep running.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Decent indie horror title. Sufficiently creepy, with perhaps an overreliance on jump scares and stingers. Reminiscent of the various Slenderman item collecting games that have been popular as of the last few years, but better than most.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
