												Okay, this game is pretty new and likely on at least a few people's radars. I've played a couple levels and probably 100 or so matches already, so I felt I would write an impressions review (mostly since there is a story of sorts, which I wont finish for a little while most likely, but when I do, I will amend this review as necessary).Anyway, this game isnt different in philosophy to Contraption Maker, Bad Rats, and so on, except that it is more enjoyable and definitely much more humorous. It does have a story as mentioned before. Basically you are an ex tennis champ who got hooked on an energy drink and it ruined your career and your life, so now, you are on a mission to free people from its evil influence, an influence that has spread like wildfire. How? Well, via your tennis skills of course. You will roll through themed levels (clowns, cops, etc...) using your service skills to try and knock out as many enemies as possible with as few balls as possible. There are obstacles that will destroy your ball, but others than will set off chain reactions that assist you in your endeavors.....and that is pretty much all there is to it, at least at the point I am at. btw....if you idle the title screen to get as many points as possible there, you will get an achievement when you hit one million points, lol.Anyway, this is what I consider a great time waster. Just have a few minutes? This is the game for you. Have more time to spare. Ditto. In fact, while I doubt this will be most people's game du jour, it will definitely serve to fill those voids where you dont know what to play, dont have a lot of time to play, or generally are just bored but want to play something. Actually a very easy recommendation for me. I give it a sliding scale 6-9 out of 10 depending on your state of mind, lol.			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												This game is very casual and possibly ported from phone (android/iOS).Its a very small game which would last at best around 10 hours of game time, it plays similar to angry birds except you dont throw birds around you hit tennis balls instead, so your challenge is to knock out all the people in the room using the least balls possible and obviously its not so easy and gets harder the further you get through the levels.Overall theres not alot to this game, its plays well without any issues, achievements are easy to gain and is just a casual bit of fun to enjoy and possibly best suited to those who like to play games on there phone/tablet etc ",2748,1067,103,260,364,26,439

												a fun Tennis themed Angry Birds' style game, i'll explain in case you don't know what is Angry Birds.you have to knock the people in each stage using tennis balls, you aim where you want to serve and try to hit all the targets with one shot or as less shots as possible to get high scores. there are many obstacles like glass who would ruin your shot or a pack of tennis balls that will send many balls flying in the stage to knock your targets, but of course just like angry birds, some stages will require that random luck to finish using only one shot. the game is cheap and its fun for sure, if you like angry birds type of games then there is a big chance you will enjoy this game too.

												7.7/10 - One of the Best and Most Rewarding Angry Birds Clones!For me this is one of the more interesting Angry Birds clones. Instead of shooting birds at your objectives you are smashing tennis balls in others faces! There are 8 different zones with 16 levels in each; bringing the total to 128 levels! This sounds daunting but I breezed through these in about 2 hours. Tack on another hour to completely 100% the achievements.You play as Pete Pagassi, an Ex-Tennis Pro who was forced to retire at the top of his game and report to rehab! Time passes and Pete kicks his dirty habit, set to return to the real world only to discover the whole town is now addicted to Explodz! Can you help Pete reach the top again and save the town with tennis balls in the face?Overall, really fun Angry Birds clone. Better than most. Worth $3-5. 3 hours of content tops.

YouTube™ Video: Tennis in the Face Preview (Steam/PC) 

			Views: 57		

			In this video, we show a preview of the upcoming game ‘Tennis in the Face’ for Steam. Video was Recorded and Voiced by The Hidden Levels one and only Manic Ado.		

I have attached a preview video covering the game and a brief write up.This game is very chill and casual. Contrary to the title making it sound like you're a madman running around smacking people in teh face with tennis racket.You are set in a position which you cant move and you have to aim and shoot your ball in which it bounces and reflects of walls in order to hit your targets. Your enemies at first are clowns, but then progresses on to Police and more!The game is smooth and very relaxing - it also comes with 15 achievements however the games difficulty starts to increase when there are more objects on the screen and glass which destroys your tennis ball and stops it reflecting.The game doesnt try to be anything special or stand out, although it does have pretty bright colors, funny humor and everything feels it works as it should.If you're after a fun game for a cheap price then definitely get it. If you're looking for something more spectacular then maybe this isnt the game for you.If you feel there is anything I missed or need to add, feel free to comment below.			",365,222,25,40,79,2,39

												Quality physics puzzler with a playful sense of humor. Think Angry Birds, but it's more about eliminating people on direct contact with your tennis balls (or exploding soda cans) rather than by falling debris, although that is an option as well. Seems like there are a lot of levels here, and you can extend your playtime even further by going for a crown on each level. The slow motion ragdoll effects after clearing a level are a nice payoff. This will be the closest you'll get to hitting a tennis ball at a latte and iPhone clutching hipster outside of your daydreams on the subway.			",4585,1875,212,499,796,54,768

												Tennis in the Face:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   You know, Tennis is one of those games that I am not…. let’s say, built for. Well, try to visualize a frog with a tennis racket in his hand… It is a bit hard to imagine, isn’t it?  Well, don’t! I have the answer for you. Just play Tennis in the face.Tennis in the Face is an action/puzzle game with great physics. You will be playing Pete Pagassi, who will attempt to save the city from Explodz, an evil energy drink company. You will start your quest, as all good Tennis players, in a metro. You will have at your fingertips the Oddingtong Metro map and all you have to do is to get all the necessary golden crowns to unlock the next metro station.Armed with your sensational and precise serve (hopefully, you make an ace), you will have to hit all characters in the level with your tennis ball or a can of the energy drink from Explodz. Achieve a chain reaction and knock out all your enemies with a single ball (sometime 2) and you will score the perfect game, set and match!A well-executed game which offers over 100 levels with nice graphics and catchy music. Very easy to play, fun and the difficulty increases with each level.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Fun Graphics-	Easy to play-	Over 100 levels-	Great physics -	Achievements & trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~  -	This type of game will always be a bit repetitiveWell, I know what I am going to play during each Grand Slam - Tennis in the Face!8.5/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

Great graphics and neat idea, but a couple of problems left me more annoyed than entertained.I picked up this game because I loved the graphics and art style, and I thought the game itself was a funny idea.  When playing it however... The first thing that struck me was the annoying fake physics applied to the ball.  OK, whatever, the game was still playable and I could overlook it, so I played on and was reasonably entertained til the 7th of 8 worlds or so.As you progress in the world and the difficulty increases, I noticed the game shifting and relying less and less on ""strategy"" and more and more on random chance and I was left with merely ""try throwing the ball this direction and see what happens"".  Which is partly brought on by the inconsistent physics applied in the game (falling objects, objects pushing other objects).  This ""Random Factor"" in the physics, as I call it, can be demonstrated by trying the same thing a couple times in a row, and seeing different results.  This becomes a bigger problem later on as you start relying on how objects simply fall, or how preset objects explode, etc.The PROs:+ Very cool graphics+ Great artstyle+ I liked the over-the-top ""story""+ Last ball trajectory shown so you can tweak it a bit+ A variety of baddies that behave differently+ A good number of levelsThe EH:~ Music got very repetitive, very fast.~ Wonky physics with the tennis ball itself.The CONs:- Random Factor.  The same actions will produce similar but different results when ""physics"" gets applied.  Which gets annoying as in later levels you need things to fall on other objects or blow up which throws objects in a certain distance, or other people to fall into others, etc, etc.- Inconsistent physics for objects in the game.- Less and less strategy on later levels, and simply more just throwing the ball all over til you see the effects and discover how a medal is done for that level.Overall:  It's a great looking game and I played it for a few hours, but ended up quitting due to needing to rely on inconsistent physics.  6 out of 10.Actual play time was approx 2.7 hrs.  The rest of the time was idling for cards and also being interrupted during play and was away from PC with game still running.  For someone to complete the game I'd anticipate approx 3.5 hrs or so.

												Many people might remember that we review Tennis in the Face on the ill-fated console, the Ouya, well thankfully it made the jump to PC, and I have to say that plays as well, if not better on this console, thanks in huge part to a the fact that this game has gamepad support. You might be thinking to yourself, why would they not have gamepad support on the PC, you'd be surprised.Now let's give you a little bit of back story, you are a disgraced tennis all-star who owes all his whoas to an energy drink called eXplodz. It is now your mission in life to use your killer serves to take out all opposition as you take revenge on the company behind eXplodz. You will have to make your way through town taking on the likes of clowns, cops, scientists,hippies, and more.The object of each level is to try to take out all of the enemies in as few hits as possible. Utilizing the platforms, walls, and enemies you will have to bounce the tennis ball to perfection. If you can do it quickly you will gain a crown for mastery of the level, and of course the more crowns you get the more special pieces you unlock.Graphically this game looks great. The levels are all clearly laid out, the HUD (Heads Up Display) gives you all the information that you need while not cluttering up the screen. There's also the fact that you get to see the outline of your previous hit's path. Actually to take it a step further even if you reset the level you get to see the previous hit's path, so if you are looking to get that perfect shot on the first hit you can take that approach, which is what I did several times when trying to get that crown.Here's the deal if you are looking for a fun game with plenty of replayability and you like physics based games, you are going to HAVE to have this game in your collection. There is plenty of game here, and the fact is that this is the type of game you can pick up and put down, and pick up again with very little need to learn the system again. There's also the fact that each level is only one screen so going through one takes almost no time at all, so there's no big time sink, well that is unless you get the itch and try to go through the entire game in one sitting. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.			",137,98,1,33,5,2,28
