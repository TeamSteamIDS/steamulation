												TLDR: half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥cash-in with no redeeming qualities, 1/10, do not buy, Codemasters should be ashamed.I really don't understand how Codemasters managed to screw this one up.Sure, they definitely indulge in milking old franchises (Worms, anyone?), but this game claims to be ""based"" on Colin McRae Rally 2.0. CMR 2 was/is an AMAZING game, a benchmark for rally games at its time that has aged exceptionally well. How hard could it possibly be? Take that game, port it to a modern engine, maybe nix a car or two and replace decals if you can't get hold of the same licensing deals, and you've got a great game, done!But no...This game manages to be so basic, so stripped down, that it barely even qualifies as a racing game, let alone something that should be mentioned in the same breath as CMR 2.Cars: CMR 2 had over 20 different cars. This game has 4. Yes, four.Courses: CMR 2 had 8 countries/courses. This game has 3. Yes, three... To make things worse, the Australia and Greece courses are basically the same gravel track. The Corsica Course is 100% tarmac. That's it. All races are in daylight, no rain. Compare that to CMR 2, where you had rain stages, night stages, snow courses, mud courses, hardpack and loose gravel courses, etc...Controls/physics: Pretty much any jump will send you into a barrel roll. There's a glitch that appears pretty often where while climbing, the car will suddenly ""snag"" onto the track like it's a piece of fabric, and lose all momentum. Wonder how many hours has been put into playtesting...More problems:- The cockpit view. MY GOD. You'll have to see this one for yourself... I'm dead serious, the Sega Daytona USA arcade machines had more detailed cockpit graphics! CMR 2 for PC came out in 2000 and it had a fully detailed cockpit for each car, what the hell happened here?- If you look at actual PC (not console) screenshots of CMR 2, this game does not look better in any regard, it actually looks worse... much worse. Much worse than a game from 2000...- Absolutely no pre-race tuning, which was a major part of CMR 2 and was pretty much obligatory to get good times at courses. But I guess it wouldn't be neccessary in a game like this anyway, where the courses are as varied as peas in a can.- At this point mentioning the lack of replays, additional game modes etc is pointless. This game would still be a steaming turd, with or without more content.Multiplayer: nope.Controller support: if you have anything more exotic than a 360 pad, you're out of luck as there are no remapping options.Please, DON'T repeat my mistake and buy this.

												It's not the same.This game is some sort of horrible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of one of the all-time great rally games, and a decimated, simplified for idiots, version for iphones. Why they couldn't just release the original is beyond me.The old menu is gone, instead you have the standard iphone menus, which are all the same. There is no way to choose your tires, or set suspension firmness or any of that, you wouldn't want to waste time on that would you?!, you want to click, and click and play! Because you're a dumbass who plays on iphones. Repairing your car is also a farce. And on top, to add the final touch, they've decided to throw out loads of stages. Why not?! Who wants to rally in the UK, or Sweden, or New Zealand anway? You also have less cars to choose from, just in case too many cars confuses you.It's still more rally than Dirt 2, 3 and Showdown though.			",4050,1574,184,467,683,63,676

												CMR 2.0 was one of my favourite games, that's why I decided to buy this 'renewed version' now.I don't know what happened, but this is not the same game anymore. The feel of speed is non existent, menus suck and are unresponsive, loader refuses to remember my graphical settings, so I have to set them every time I run the damn game... The game itself has it's own problems. Physics giving up shockingly often (the silliest example - I jumped really high in the air and when I landed my car stopped on the ground like it hit a concrete wall), cars feel like wagons filled with coal, fixing your car between stages is dumbed down beyond belief to please the average Joe consumer from America...3/10, for nostalgia sake :/			",118,29,0,4,6,0,10

												I don't often post reviews here but I thought I better with this one.This is NOT the original game, it is a cheap iOS and Android port that is missing half the features of the original game. There are missing stages, cars, replays, multiplayer, car setup, championship, missing menus, and they somehow removed cockpit cam from the game and put something that resembles a cockpit.The championships are non existant and the championship you play depends on difficulty, with only Australia, Greece and Corsica to choose from. They've removed Finland, New Zealand and UK/Wales.They have the original CMR 2.0 on PC already running on DX6-ish, why is it so much of a task for them to update to DX11 or lower and improve the textures/resolution? You're better off fishing the original out the cupboard or wherever and playing that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												tl;dr: THIS IS NOT A REMASTER OF THE ORIGINAL PC VERSION. THIS IS A PORT OF A MOBILE GAME. DO NOT BUY!so, the game sucks in almost every aspect, here's why:Graphic: probably the only good thing in this game. the nostalgia feeling is there, the game looks really like the old one, althought it has been rewritten in Unity. It uses most of the original assets and adds some realtime shadows, motion blur and sligthly better car modelsSound: awful. the car's sound is flat and boring. co-pilot voice has just few lines and also has bad timing causing them to be played too late or overlap each otherTracks: 6 rallies in 3 countries (Australia, Greece, France) spanning over 12 stages each (althought some of them are reversed). the tracks come from from the original game (so they're good) but they have been slightly modified to adapt to a mobile game: moslty, the road has been widen, but also, all the surface react the same way, there's no difference between tarmac and grass.Cars: only 4 cars. Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza '99, Lancer Evolution VI, Lancia Delta. the first tree handle the same way, while the fourth outperform each of the other in every way speed, accelleration and handling (which is completly unrealistic)Controls: bad. since is a mobile port, the game is not designed to take analogic input, so wether you're using a keyboard or a gamepad the experience is the same. the game also supports steering wheels, mine didn't work and i found complains on the forum that the steering feels digital even with the wheel. it's also very difficult to assign buttons.Physics: bad, very bad. you can clearly feel that the game was designed for mobile devices, the handling is very simple and braking is un-necessary. impacts are broken wheter you impact perpendicularly or just scracth something the result is the same: the car stops. it also happens to crash into invisible walls in the middle of the track or your car start to bounce around for no reason (especially the Stratos)Damage: broken. the car get damage even if you drive safely and slowly on a tarmac road. I would not be surpirsed if in the mobile version you have to wait for the car to get repaired or pay to repair it.Game modes: you can race on a single stage, a whole rally or a championship. the career is made of various championship, the first 6 just made of the 6 available rallies, the others mix the rallies in various ways but not the stages, so you'll have to do the same stages in the same order over and over again. the original game was similar but with different car classes and over 12 countries.AI: one of the worst example of the rubber-band effect ever seen in a game, and it's also way too easy completly lacking any challenge.this game it's a scam, they tried to make money on the nostalgia of the players with a very bad port of a very bad mobile game. AVOID even if it's free			",180,31,41,17,35,2,36

												(Traducción al español abajo) How to drown a good game into disgrace.Having the original Colin McRae Rally 2.0 since it came out, all I expected was to be able to play it fully in my actual machine without learning rocket science. Well, I have to recognize that has been achieved. You can play it... at least the parts you can...Megabazillion tracks... errr nope: The original game brings us 9 countries, (Kenia, Finland, UK, Sweden, Australia, Japan, Corsica, Greece and Italy) each with twelve stages. This rip only brings Australia, Corsica and Italy. By now, The game duration's been cut to a third.Megabazillion rally cars... errr neither: The original game places us behind the wheel of 24 rally cars, counting WRC, B group and various paint schemes. Here there are ONLY FOUR STINKY CARS. Content reduced to a fifth.Then, the controls. I'll agree Colin McRae wasn't the most realistic rally game in history (we have RBR for that), but at least you can figure out what is driving a WRC. Here, the controls are almost random. The car cuts gas in the middle of a straight without any reason at all, and the turns are divided into two: you did it or you didn't (There's no way to negotiate a drift)... Basically, I found out that I can't drive the car as I want (as in the original), but instead I have to learn how the game wants me to drive it.And then, the graphics... well, even worse than the original (the internal view is worth a shot, don't miss it), plus the scenary has been cut to a size that looks more like you're playing Gran Turismo 1.In a nutshell, don't set your hopes any high: It's an awful port, ripped everywhere, and almost unplayable.(Traducción al español) Como desgraciar un buen juego:Teniendo el Colin McRae Rally 2.0 original de la época, lo que esperaba era poder jugarlo completo en el PC que tengo ahora sin tener que andar haciendo experimentos. Bueno, hay que reconocer que eso si se ha logrado, Jugarse, se puede jugar. Lo que se puede jugar...Pistas a go-go... pues nó: El juego original nos permitía correr por Kenia, Finlandia, UK, Suecia, Australia, Japón, Corcega, Grecia e italia. Este rip no trae mas que Australia, Corcega y Grecia. De momento, la duración del juego se ha reducido una tercera parte. Coches de rally a go-go... pues tampoco: El juego original nos pone a los mandos de 24 coches, entre WRC, Grupo B y esquemas de pintura variados. Aquí no hay mas que CUATRO APESTOSOS COCHES. El contenido se reduce a una quinta parte.Luego ya está la cosa de los controles. De acuerdo que Colin McRae no era el juego de rallies mas realista de la historia (para eso está el RBR), pero por lo menos te podías hacer una idea. Aquí los controles son prácticamente aleatorios. El coche deja de acelerar de forma incomprensible en medio de una recta, los giros son una de dos: o entras o no entras (no hay posibilidad de negociar un derrape)... En resumen: me he encontrado con que, en lugar de conducir como yo quiero, tengo que aprender a conducir como el juego quiere.Y los gráficos... pues muy justitos. Comparados con el original son incluso peores (la vista interna del coche es digna de ver), y encima han restado profundidad al escenario de una manera que parece que estés jugando en gran turismo 1.En resumidas cuentas, no te hagas ilusiones: Es un port horroroso, recortado por todas partes, y prácticamente injugable.

												Colin McRae RallyYou hear that name and instantly awesome true Rally experiences come to mind. Harsh terrain, realistic and believable damage to your car as you make stupid mistakes, and a fairly competitive AI that makes it a nice challenge all-in-all.That isn't this game. This game is a mobile port. It isn't (at all) what it tries to advertise itself as. Handling is simplified, damage is merely cosmetic at best, the terrain looks horrible. Remastered is a term many low-resolution games use these days to try and bring these experiences to the modern PC, but Colin McRae Rally doesn't manage to do any of it.It lacks features that previous games in the series. You can't customize your car's behavior before a stage. Repairs are fairly unneeded as they don't impact gameplay, and fixing the ""engine"" costs the same amount of time as fixing the ""suspension"" or ""wheels"".There isn't much else to say. This game was trading on good memories of the Colin McRae series and it's just a cash grab. It's lame, it doesn't feel like a rally game, and overall it's a perfect example of what is happening to Steam's storefront where publishers and developers have no shame about what they try to do with their advertising.

What a ripoff! I thought that I was buying remastered CMR as trailer told me. But it was just a dream - a hoax. There are couple of elements from original CMR, for example Nicky Grist and couple of cars. Graphics are better than back in the days, and car handling seems gotten better. But where are all the tracks? Sweden, Finland etc..? Just single player without split-screen, that's huge disappointment and takes half of the fun away! Now we got achievements, three maps and four cars. No real championship, just tournaments. That is a ripoff, and shame to original series. I understand that this is just ported from mobile version to PC, but if I could get my money back, I would take that.  Colin McRae will be kicking in the grave when he hears about this piece of skit.  ",62,1,8,1,9,3,3

												Its pretty meh. Feels like I was playing a water down smartphone version of dirt on a pc . For the most part the tracks are all pretty simple and not very fun. IF you saw the trailer, they pretty much showcased all the cool or fun corners, the other 97% is just long boring straights that veer to the left or right. Driving in its self was pretty uneventfull and unfulfilling. Mariokart 64 was better driving game then this. Only a handfull of cars, very barren environments with the occasional weird stick tree or shrub. It was pretty boring to play. Save your money and buy DiRT on the next steam sale.

""HIT THE DIRT IN COLIN MCRAE RALLY - THE CLASSIC OFF-ROAD RACING EXPERIENCE.""Oh man, what a lie again. There's really not that much games that'll recieve red thumb down from me, but when it's happening it has to be total disaster. And so it is. Times changed since release of Colin McRae Rally, but trash still persists.Buying mobile game on Steam for 6,99€, is it crime or it is not? My grammar as well may be crime but let it flow. I won't be really that hooked up on the fact that it's mobile port if it at least have some similar traits to previous legend or at least some or just little bit of nostalgia. When you spend your childhood playing PlayStation 1 and one of the most scratched disk be Colin McRae, you'll really get mad when somebody ehm Codemaster states that it's classic experience.Game will last you under 5 hours. Races are easy, times are weak, visual and audio oh god terrible (doesn't matter that much to me), gameplay experience is zero, damage and repair is not funny like it used to back then and actual locations are whack. 16 easy achievements and trading cards are not even worth talking as something why it's worth to get this game.Bonus Point: Lancer EvolutionRating: 2/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

The ""AI"" is so hilariously fake. The textures are even more low-res than CMR2.0 Less cars and tracks than CMR2.0 which was released in 2000If you want to experience the classic game fully then getColin McRae Rally 2.0 + SilentPatch for it to work better on modern systems.orFor modern rally game get DiRT Rally.

												Like many others, I bought this game expecting a re-released version of the original with some graphics updates and without the hassle of getting an old copy to run on modern hardware. This is not that game.What we have instead is a stripped-down version with less cars, fewer stages and fewer set-up/repair options which was previously released for mobile devices. Between purchase and writing this review the store description has been updated to reflect this, but it still leaves a faint glimmer of hope that this might be something better. Don't be under any illusions  - you're paying to play the mobile version with better controls on a bigger screen.In fairness to Codemasters, this is at least a competent driving game. The cars handle at least as well as in the original, with noticeable changes between surfaces. Car damage does affect performance, but the scaled-back repair interface takes away most of the decisions in choosing what to fix between stages. There are only four cars available to drive (three of which must be unlocked by completing events), but they recreated as well as possible in the engine.Ultimately though, I can't recommend this. It may only be £4.99, but that still feels expensive for a cut-down version of a ten-year-old game. You would be better-off spending your money on a copy of the original on ebay and taking the time to get it working			",169,50,5,27,27,2,51

												Oh boyI sure do love ""HD"" remakes of old games that have marginally less pixilated graphics and take out well over half the content of the original game.Get it for $1 or less if on offer, if you're okay with 2-3 hours of mild entertainment at most.Beyond that, don't bother with this.It's a port of a phone game based on the original. Mildly reminiscent of the 1998 game, but not enough to be deserving of the same name by any stretch of the imagination.LIST THING LIKE WHAT YOU PEOPLE LIKE:+The handling is pretty decent with a controller+The system of car damage and how that effects performance seems to be fairly solid++gives an enjoyable sense of speed, exhilarating near misses and etc++++Ever wondered what it would be like to play 3 of the 1998 version's locations without a ridiculously low draw distance? Well you're in luck.+threw enough bloom and nice looking static backdrops at it until it looked marginally better than the 16 year old original. Lets give a big hand to all the hard working artists at Codemasters.+sound is adequate, though the co-driver's commentary would perhaps be more annoying if I wasn't blinded by nostalgia+still fun gameplay, but in a way that doesn't keep you from feeling disappointed about how minimal an effort was put into this-most of the positives are inherited from the original--this is a port of a phone game port of the original-Apparently steering wheels aren't very easy to set up for it---5 less locations than the 1998 original-all the stages within each location are all a bit samey (to be fair, also inherited)-not having 8 less cars than the 1998 original would have cost codemasters too much-no online leaderboards, no online anything---------no split screen multiplayer either----------------------no cheats for turning your car into a hovercraft-I don't know how they took all those touched up screenshots to have a camera angle that isn't straight ahead, because I sure couldn't move the camera at all.-I've played for 2 hours, already unlocked half the game content-what I haven't unlocked consists of 2 other cars and three rallys comprising of locations and stages that I have already played, but this time with the abritrary ""this is where the computer car would be"" icon that scrolls along a bar at the top of the screen moving a bit faster-----------doesn't play the playstation startup tune when the game is first loading (unforgivable oversight)-doesn't fetch the newspaper for you-It's not 1998 anymore-I'm getting old-you're getting old-you used to be beautiful-I'm just not feeling it anymore, alright?

												Do not let my playtime deceive you. I have played for 10 minutes and read countless threads in the games forum.I am very upset/dissapointed with Codemasters. I want a refund.CONS- This game is a port of a mobile game- There is no skill needed to play- Ther is no real controller support (Right trigger only accelerates on release of button DA FUQ?)- This is nothing like Colin McRae 2.0- At £4.99 it's grossly over priced (it's only worth to me is £1 max)PROS- None IMODo not buy this game, unless you want to play a terrible mobile racing game with poor controller support.

												Codemasters must be either running out of cash or just be plain stupid to remake this game. Sure, if they hadn't lazed out and just strapped on some ""better"" looking textures and cleaned up the audio I could have digged it. But this? No, just no! If you're gonna remake a classic game in this day of age, at least make sure to give it proper controls! It can be played with a 360 gamepad, with DIGITAL input only! That's just so stupid I have no nice words for it. Stay FAR AWAY from this even if it should be on sale, especially if you as me grew up playing the Colin McRae series of games, you'll just end up being sad and frustrated over this piece of garbage!
