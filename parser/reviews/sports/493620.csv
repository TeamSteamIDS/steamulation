												Let's start with this, I am an avid RL Disc Golfer.I've been waiting for the announcement of a VR Disc Golf game since I bought my VIVE. I am happy to report, that this is a very good step in the correct direction. The physics are pretty much right there. There are 4 different ""discs"" to choose from to help you with your shots. The courses are all ""digital"" and are pretty challenging. Sound and Music are also on point.If you actually play Disc Golf, it's going to take a bit of getting used to. Took me about 2 full rounds of 18 before I started to understand how to change my play to fit the game. The disc is about 6"" farther out that you normally throw so you have to adjust to that. Once you get that down, I was shooting Par in no time.I can't wait for them to add ""Leagues"" and Multiplayer in the near future. This is definately going to be a game for the Disc Golfer and the non-Disc Golfer. Great development team and a very promising future.			",218,31,7,32,22,8,34

												This game takes a little getting used to, but is definitely fun!  The disc flies like you would expect, but be careful trying to overpower it.  You don't have to go crazy to get a long flight.  The course is full of different ""weather"" and hazards that affect the disc and make it challenging and fun to compete against friends.  Once leagues (online play) is enabled, this is going to be a really good time.  I want to also mention that the camera follows the disc when you throw so it might take some getting used to.  Once you have your ""sea-legs"" it feels like you're flying through the holes.All-in-all a fun game and can't wait for updates!			",80,5,0,1,7,2,0

												I adore this piece of software. I'm an avid Disc Golf player afk and I get so much satisfaction out of this game. I find myself wanting to play a couple of quick rounds almost every day. The feeling of throwing the discs is quite good. I tell new players ""Find what works for you and do it consistently."" I tend to use a hammer-style throw (overhead) for the majority of my shots but that's entirely personal preference. You are given the option of a follow-me cam for the disc after you throw it but personally I prefer the stationary camera as it's easier to see your mistakes. Again that's personal preference and it's great that I have the option. There is up to 4 player party mode where a player plays nine holes and passes the headset. The party feature makes this game AWESOME when you have a few people who want to play. I can't wait for more courses!! (There are only two.) Lots of fun. Easy to play, hard to master. Runs great.

												This game is a lot of fun, and the levels are tough enough for it to actually be a challange between friends in party mode.			",75,7,0,10,17,3,30

												I'm way better at disc golf in RL.  You have to play this game differently to be successful.  It's not a simulation.  I don't like the TRON/digitial environment - need trees, grass, water, etc.   ",267,85,2,26,10,3,12

												One of the best games for the Vive!  When multiplayer is available it will be even better.  I really like the look and the music is perfect.			",9,0,0,0,0,1,0

												This game is one of the best games I have played for the vive, The simplistic controls make it a great game for new people experiancing VR for the first time.One of the best things about  VR Disc Golf is that you can change disc physics mid flight. This adds a depth of strategy for you to master.If you don't like the camera chaseing the disc in flight, you can turn it off, and play a more traditional disc golf game as well.The music in this game is on point as well, It really adds to the eviroment of the game.

												just brieflyas ive not played it long but straight away I can say this is  a game I will play regularly. You could say that some of the ideas such as lava could be anoying but then I suppose water on a real golf course is almost the same.The only thing I didnt like was the lava rising up and down, only one hole that I have played had that though.I can thoroughly recommend this it is priced very well . Lets face it try it if you dont like it go support .....request refund.But I wont be doing that . ",109,36,20,4,28,2,4

												Had a blast playing this with friends, taking turns.  All of us enjoyed it, both those who do and don't play disc golf IRL.  Controls are intutitive, music is awesome, and the levels are fun but challenging.  Highly recommended!			",79,10,5,10,24,1,14
