Early Access Review
								I played this game because it seemed like at least 50% of the developers had a beard.Was not disappointed.Pros:- Hilariously well done animations- Already quite a few different mini-game modes.- Smooth controls- Love the musicCons:- No online play yet. Will come later on though so hold your panties.- I think I yelled too much at my girlfriend10/10 would recommend my bearded friends again!
