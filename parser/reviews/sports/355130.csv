												First Impression ReviewSo I have a couple of hours under my belt in this new instalment and figured it's time to give you guys some feedback. I will update this later after a couple of full seasons.Is this game fun? Yeah I would say so. If you like Motogp then it does what it needs to (just).Is it much of an upgrade to Motogp 14? Nope, not really. Cosmetics and small tweaks only (so far).Should the die-hard Motogp fans buy it? Absolutely, it has a nice feel to it and obviously it is updated with this seasons riders and such. It is still very much lacking in features that other driving sims have, hell even other sport games. But for the motogp series, it is slowly getting better...very slowly though.Should casual players buy it? That depends on if they have any previous instalments of the game. If they have 2014 I would say no, wait for next year. It is another of those games that only get small adjustments each year so just buy every other one or grab it on a 50% sale later in the year. I do not honestly think It is worth shelling out all that cash each year for a casual player on a game that always seems much like it could just be a DLC to the previous year.Pro'sThe bikes seem to be a little bit more responsive this year in cornering(motogp at least), it is fun to leave some black lines out of corners and pull wheelies on the  moto3 bikes. Nothing you would really notice unless you have played motogp 14 within the last couple of days but it is there.Slight wind wobble on the camera at high speeds, that seems to have been updated for this year and gives it a more realistic feel.Custom bikes in career mode. It's not all singing and all dancing but it's about time we got this feature.Seeing dry lines appear towards the end of a drying out qualifying session is nice. Yeah it may be 2015 and this should not be a surprise in this day and age but it still gave me a little lip curl. Con's The AI seem to fall off very easily if you bump them. I have noticed this while giving the game a try on medium AI so I will update this a little more when I try out the pro settings a little later.It really isn't the best racing sim out there, it's more aimed at giving the motogp gearheads their fix for the year and making milestone some money. The same company also make Ride and the MXGP games and they are all pretty poor bike sims so dont get your hopes up for an amazing game.My rider looks way too shiny in the wet. Graphics wise this game is still pretty poor, I don't see much of a difference on last years edition and some tracks look pretty empty.Some strange sound effects... like crashing for instance, it just doesnt sound like it should.--All in all, Milestone need a good kick in the butt. Motogp still doesn't have a brilliant game like it should. If you like Motogp you will enjoy playing this game. It is not total crap like some would say but it is not much of an improvement on last year, just as last year was not much better than 2013. For me, it feeds my need for bike racing and as I said before, if you are a casual player, just buy it on a sale or every other year.For what this game is, i would say 8/10 this year. Milestone need to try harder next year though.Judged against other racing sims, pfft 6/10I will recommend for now--			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i crashed too much in this game, need to get used to the physics (RIDE + GP13 mix). marquez; ""with 2014 bike, I create that slide. Now the problem is that the bike creates the slide, and I try to avoid it""in my case, in GP14 i create that slide/skid into the corner, but now GP15 bike creates that slide then i crash, loli still prefer GP14's physics, but yeah its a good game overall... pros :- better graphics, effects, so on. but color is kind of strange in shadow (assen starting grid), & in the rain- AA is back but not great, 8x AA the jaggies still present tho- more detail circuit, but Laser scan circuit on Project Cars & GRID/F1 is more acurate- wet race is more easier & fun- tyre wear is more forgiving than gp14 on 5 laps race distance (online race) didn't tried on 10/15laps yet- trading cards :Pcons :- its Milestone, we need Codesmaster to takeover MotoGP- no steamworks- MotoGP bikes strange corner crash (eg: Brno turn5 right handed, PI turn6 siberia..) Moto2/3 is fine- weird start > gear one, i just pull the throttle 100% (tcs off), the engine seems to cut the power instead of wheely? the start isnt challenging anymore- the transmission doesnt feel seamless, just like RIDE's production bike- crash on wrong place & still got penalty (i dont have any intention to take a shortcut, doh!!!)- 1.5gb vs 4gb texture, dont notice any diferentupdate :- if u hosting a lobby, randomly freeze during the race still present (since gp13-14), if this happen on the long straight is np, but if in the mid-corner its disaster, ur bike go straight into the wall/speedtrap gravel or high side crash instantly!! (u loose the battle with other rider or even the chance to fight for the victory/podium at least) not happen in every race but can happen 1-2 times in single race... - uh uh one more thing, my question just got answered by the recent event (Assen race)i'd been thinking for a long time if this stuff really happen in the real race, but hey it does!! Its kind of failed 'superman' freestyle trick on x-games then stupidly hanging off the side of the bike sooo clumsy & nothing u can do really (need to wobble 1st, but u know what i mean :P). Moto3 rider Niklas Ajo shows stunning commitment, crossing the finish line on his knees after a spectacular save.. Happen a lot to me tho since gp13, but after fantastic Ajo's happening, its a big relief (i thought milestone was trolling about this) fiuh...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game needs more time when being able to adjust or make settings for the bike just before online race. As much time you get when being able to select a bike before online race.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far so good, Ive been playing these moto gp games since gp 12, and I gotta say this was worth the money. it has all the updated riders for 2015, you can finally customize your own team, and bike which is fun to play around with, and there is a big difference between the handling in all the bikes, just like in real life. The ducati motorcycles are known for there power, but they are unstable. and the suzuk motorcycles have good handling, but down on power.Overall Its a good good espically at this time being that its  a few bucks off original price.  RIDE was a good game but it had a good set of problems, even know there were more selctions of bikes the problems did not out weigh them. For instince the online racing has yet to be fixed from glitches, so after you play the story mode. (which will take about 60-70 hours) I was wanting to play in the onlime servers, but they were so glitchy, and there was only a total of like 10 people online so it was impossible to find a match. I was worried Moto gp would follow in the footsteps of ride, but I have NEVER experinced a glitch on moto gp 15, I had some timing problems when exiting the pit, but thats it.Good buy, would recomend espically for the price.

												Fun game, definitely better than the previous ones in terms of performance, looks and amount of bugs. Handling is also a bit better and it isn't as forgiving as last year's game. Apart from that there's a few new game modes but nothing really spectacular.All in all, if you already own MotoGP 13 or 14 I wouldn't consider it worth the £35 since you're basically getting a slightly less buggy and better looking reskin of 14. If, however this is your first Moto GP game, definitely pick it up. It has a really fun career mode which will keep you entertained for a long time and a bunch of other fun gamemodes if you get sick of career mode.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Big problem for me... I use onboard view and in moto 3 I cant see a thing through the near solid grey flyscreen. Basically its impossible to ride in this view. I have been using this view for years. So far this expirience has been terrible for me. Also the graphics are just as bad if not worse than the last motogp. Engine sound is terrible too... maybe slightly improved? Comparing anything of this game alongside the detail and sound of games like project cars its just terrible. I really dont know what to say! Milestone never help the people who have had problems yet give them the money for these games. I think most importantly Milestone are the issue here. Maybe a petition on Change.org mght start the ball rolling?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												MotoGP 15 is an exceptional bike racing game, after a few hours practice with a decent controller (recommend xbox one controller for PC) you can master the art of racing these wonderful machines. I know that I will be playing this game for a long time to come. There's nothing bad I can say about this game, it more than met my expectations. Fantastic job!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

MotoGP™15 is a one of the many motorcycle racing game and, as it has also proven in 2015 edition, it is almost certainly the best game there is of this genre. If you're interested in racing games, be sure to have a look.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:As you probably know, the point of this game is to race and, if you're good enough, win the race. With diverse customisation, you are able to modify your vehicle just the way you want. There are a lot of tracks to drive on and also games modes, including instant race and championship. Well, it's exactly what you would expect from a racing game.Pros: I can't go past the graphics in my review. You might think that the screenshots are much better than the actual gameplay (as publishers usually make screenshots look astonishingly good), but in this case, the truth is not far behind. On several graphic options, from low to high, the game looked good. The driving feels nice. I had some issues with controlling the vehicle (will be described in the Cons section), but when I fixed all the issues, my driving experience was excellent. There are 18 tracks in this game and, as I understood, all of them are also a part of the real 2015 championship. In case you need one, there is a pretty decent tutorial when you first start the game with the announcer guiding you through the game mechanics. Some AAA companies these days are obsessed with DRM, but that doesn't seem to be the case in this game. You can freely play in offline mode any time you want. Both your motorcycle and your outfit can be customisable with different colours, numbers and texts. There are also different weather conditions.Cons: The controller is a driving device by default and the game wants it to stay this way. When I make the keyboard the default playing device, this setting is reset every time I turn on the game. If you have a QWERTZ keyboard instead of QWERTY, as I do, you should know that this game detects Y, when you press Z. I had quite some problems with that, as the default braking key is Z and I couldn't even brake before I figured this out. As I've heard, there is not much difference from this game and its ancestor (MotoGP 14). Sometimes, bots fall of their bikes very quickly on contact. No biggie. No MacOS and Linux support? Come on, we're not in the 19th century!The final verdict:This game is awesome and, truth be told, I didn't expect anything else from an AAA game. Graphics are great, the feeling is great, the maps are great and controlling is great (after a few tweaks, if you have a keyboard). I had a lot of fun playing this and I don't consider myself the biggest fan of racing games. This game makes you excited when you play it even if you're not among the first on finish every time.Buy it if you can. You won't be disappointed.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

												Great Game, Great Physics, Great Graphics, 2015 Season Moto3 Moto 2 and MotoGP, where this one differs is you can run your own team, dev your bikes and come up through the ranks, and as awsome side note some of the Best riders have been added in 2 stroke mode and challenges and those things are awsome. there is still the grind of coming up through all the classes but the game play and feel of immersion is so good you just keep riding.So yes if you live bikes and MotoGP get this one it is worth the money i loved 2013 skipped 14 and adore 15 and seeing how the real 15 championship went down i love putting the cocky lil MM#93 on his♥♥♥♥♥every chance i get ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game  performs better the Motogp14 and the riders look alot better very simliar to RIDE. But its a reskin of last years game. the riding physics are worse then Motogp14. I think the worse thing of all is the tracks and environment, they look terrible, low res background and its just DATED really DATED. Play Project Cars and you will know what I mean about environment and tracks.Thank God for steam Refunds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game. If you had previous versions, it's the same game with rider updates. Want to go through a full week end of racing and have fun? Ofcourse you do. Does Milestone think the same way? Ofcourse not, because F*ck you, they got your money. You want an example. Set up your bike during practice and qualifying which happens to be dry weather. Warm ups and race in the rain. Different year, same problem. During the warm up, they reset your settings. Good luck finding these or trying to load these, cause they've been saved under dry. Now you don't have a template. 12 mins to set up or find the template again, no thank you. It's like watching Rossi raging because it's raining on race day and he has no set up, because his mechanic brought in a new bike. That always happens.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Jacko Rating 8.5/10The best yet in the MotoGP series!  Graphics, audio and gameplay opitions all exceed the previous versions and the physics are not altered too much but rather just tweaked a little for the better.If you have ever wanted to play a GP game on bikes then this is your best choice.  From the true to real life specs on all bikes and riders plus the TV style broadcast of the race this game gets as close as possible to actually having the opportunity to ride a real GP bike.Create your rider and race him up through the ranks of Moto 3, Moto2 and finally MotoGP along the way negotiating contracts with teams or now you can start your own private team to compete with the big boys.You are given rewards in the form of Photos of real life riders in action and HD Videos of the same as you win more and more races and level up.To sum up a very accessable game for newbies to the genre and has enough tweaks and new additions to keep us MotoGP fans happy with the purchase of the latest addition to the franchise.Nice Job!
