												I bought this game back when it first came out in the late 90's. Over 14 years they have left it largely untouched other than the player roster. Oh and they somehow found a way to add more bugs. It would be a good game if they bothered to update it. If you are looking for a cricket Football Manager you will left wanting. It looks and feels cheap and unloved. It was worth 20 dollars 14 years ago. Its worth $5 today. AVOID!!!!!!! Unless you are some type of cricket manager tragic and even then wait for a sale.

												If you love Cricket, stats and looking for that next star player then this is the game for you!I've played Cricket Captain since 2001 when my cousin introduced me to it and have loved its simple interface and decent match engine since then.  It has had fairly minor tweaks over the years as my original tactics used to dominate one dayers dont work anymore and of course 20/20s arent all that old.This game brings back memories...I played the first copy that I had to death and found a spreadsheet on an old usb that had stats for an England Captain game from 2000 to 2026 on it earlier today!  I've also bought a version that had Phil Hughes on the cover that I remember he averaged 65ish opening for Australia (might have been 2009?) as well as the 2011, 13 & 14 versions.  This is the best of the lot with the different game modes and a one-day engine that I haven't figured out yet (I'm only 30 odd hours in).There is a reason I keep spreadsheets with this game - it has 1 big bug....at the end of the season some players may disappear!  It's something that's happened since the first version and with Nathan Lyon magically disappearing and taking his 176 wickets @ 31 as Australia's only spinner with him in 2015 I certainly noticed (particularly as Ryan Harris just retired and I lost 1/2 my bowling attack in 1 off season)....it's a worry when Maxwell is your frontline spinner!It's sheer playability and the constant searching for that next great player helps to get over any quirks in the match engine as pretty much anything can be chalked up to it being cricket (still not sure how I got rolled for 50 in a T20 and then won the world cup only a couple of months later).Just like Football Manager you'll make attachments to players you've never heard of...I see from my original game Matthew Bulbeck played 176 tests scoring 6898 runs at 36.11 and took 754 wickets at 28.65 (I'm sure he wouldn't have minded that sort of career and I've tried with Butterworth and Faulkner in recent years to find a similarly performing left handed allrounder) while I had a regen, G Fuller play 207 tests, score 20155 runs @ 70.97 with a HS of 397 and 75 100s.  In this years game I'm only up to 2016/17 with Australia but Chris Lynn 19 tests 1459 runs @  54.04, Ryan Carters 21 tests 1314 runs @ 50.54 and Glenn Maxwell 17 tests 808 runs @ 42.53, 35 wickets @ 35.23 would be pretty happy with their new careers!

												took me a while to get into this years game(even though its really just an update). would have liked to see additonal features added which seem to be very slow in this series. however saying all of that, this is still a excellent game (and better than its competitors) and will hopefully like to seem more new features added next year			",11,2,2,5,58,3,14

												The best cricket management game by far. Those that have played earlier versions will be familiar with the gameplay. You take on a club or international team and try take them to glory. You get to select your team and control the match including field settings, bowlers and agression level of your batters and bowlers. Fans of cricket and sports simulation games should seriously consider this game. There's a thrill in guiding your team to the top of the table while discovering that new breakthrough talent.

												I've been playing Cricket Captain since ICC III (2007) so have been a little disappointed with the 'progress' of the game since then. It's been 8 years....This game is a little bit of an upgrade from 2013 as it's got better shot play, more field settings etc but still not what I was really expecting in terms of progress made on the game.For example, Cricket Coach brings out a new game each year with loads of new features after lots of talk with the CC community....Cricket Captain very rarely communicate and take on decent ideas from the community ever.For next years game, they will need to improve massively as now with Steam, the players of 2014 will be wanting more.

												Played most versions since IIC2. I'm still useless and lose far more then I win.Like the new interface and it's at last in 1920*1080 :)The best cricket managerment game by far.I've not had any of the problems that some other people have had so can't comment on those.One downside there is a lot of patches to come. @James just untick full screen in options for windowed.

												Not played this game since 2010 edition.  It's still as fun and addictive but with many improvements; especially in the UI.  There's a lot of satisfaction when you're able to change the course of match or dismiss a batsman with a change of tactics.I do though wish it could be played in windowed mode.			",57,14,2,8,30,3,9
