												A surprisingly fun game at a great price point. This is certainly the best chicken-centric VR game out there at this time. Makes me feel like a real chicken. I'm a chicken marge!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting and different. High replay factor. Easy controls and a different concept make all the difference here. Would give it an 8/10.			",58,22,2,1,23,6,1

												It's free and it's more fun than I would expect it to be being a game that consists of catching eggs. My main complaint is that some eggs will fall straight through the bottom of the basket.			",120,22,3,3,23,1,3

												A nice reflex testing game; wouldn't recomend it as paid game, so good call from the developer. Runs smooth and physics are fine.Only issue I have is later levels that increase the number Chicken shelves (Hmm, can't think of another way to describe that), places them further away where I'm hitting the wall. That's within a 2M SQ play area. That's not a moan but really some dev feedback too look into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
