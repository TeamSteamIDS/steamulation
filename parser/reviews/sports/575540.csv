												A lot of fun and shows a lot of promise.  The swing physics seem more forgiving than Gofl Club VR, particularly in the left-right direction.  I would describe it as more ""arcade-y"" which can definitely be a good thing.   I really liked how it would automatically select the most adequate club when placing you by the ball.  I found myself finishing holes very quickly because of this, rarely changing clubs from what it selected.  I did have to turn off the ball follow-cam though, as it can be a bit jarring, thankfully there is a setting for it.The 2 courses currently included are well designed and the graphics are surprisingly good.   I'm excited to see future courses.  If you want a quick, relaxing round of arcade golf VR Golf Online is an excellent choice.  If I was wanting to actually focus on my swing and try to improve it I would play Golf Club VR.  It's good to finally have choices!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this only because it just came out and the bugs it has should be easlily fixed.  It runs fine but the main problem is being unable to set up your position to hit the ball.  No mater how I start the game and where I stand, the ball is always placed in the same position to Tee off.  So I cannot swing or stand correctly because the ball is always against my computer desk when I need it farther out in the play area.  This is just one of the frustrating fixes that must be dealt with.  Another fix is putting,  there seems to be no aiming adjustment on the green, I can turn the putter in the direction I want the ball to go, but when I hit it the ball goes straight for the cup and misses.  The ball does not go in the direction I have the putter turned, even turned at a 45 degree angle the ball hits straight for the cup and It has the most unrealistic putting sound I have ever heard.  Still if they get these things fixed and improve fairway aiming, this game will get much better.  I hope they fix it soon so I can play.			",65,25,5,3,26,1,4

												Pros:Polished UI and feel to the gameCons:The worst thing about the game is that when you hit, the camera follows the ball which made me quite sick.  The devs should consider removing this or defaulting it to being off.  It is nice to see where the ball goes, maybe they could move the camera to a stationary position where the ball will end up? The game mechanics are just not there.  You can literally hit the ball 90 degrees from where the auto aim is pointed and the ball goes where the auto aim has it lined up to go, the only thing you really effect is the swing speed.After getting the ball in the hole you have an uncanny valley view of your avitar walking, then freezing and dissolving which is a bit odd.   The end of the hole guitar music that plays gets very redundant after a couple rounds.All in all this game has potential but needs some fixes. ",55,6,0,7,5,1,3

												As an avid golfer I found this game to be fun. Pretty good immersion for the VR. The biggest drawbacks have been listed by others before me. There is no understanding of yardage, no understanding of 'feeling'. That aside, if you go in to it to have fun, I think this game accomplishes it. While on sale at 14 bucks, I think it is a pretty good deal and offers enough content to make it worth it.Looking forward to more courses and refinement of the overal play style of the game.Good job Devs!
