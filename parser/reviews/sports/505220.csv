								Terrible!As a cricket fan, I was very excited to see this come to VR. Cricket defiantly as a sports game or simulation would suit VR mechanics well quite easily. However when i did finally get King Of Spin running, it was anything but cricket...Firstly, the ball physics don’t even come remotely close what it like in real life. The pace feels too slow on easy settings and in normal and hard feels more like a slow-medium pacer rather than a spinner. Another ridiculous example of how inaccurate the ball physics is the fact that nearly half the deliveries i faced were balls bouncing over my head! From a spinner! Maybe they confused Mitchel Johnson with Shane Warne. Have no idea how Warne himself could endorse a product like this.It's simply poorly polished and arcade style cricket physics. I got a feeling this was designed as a fun mobile phone app which they converted to VR without improving much and shipping it off... It's also quite buggy, incomplete (not even exit to menu buttons - have to close games each time), and it’s overpriced. This is 30 bucks and it’s an early access title, it’s one of the most expensive Vive titles available but what you get is simply rubbish.			",23,26,1,0,21,4,0

								Not sure what people are complaining about. I had an awesome time facing Warnie for an hour.It's early release so there are bound to be a few bugs.  Sometimes the fielders face the wrong way and I swear if my bat speed is too fast then bat and ball do not collide, but overall a very enjoyable experience for any cricket fan.Not sure if this is going to evolve into a full cricket game (facing pace bowlers for example), or if they are going to stick with just facing Warne, but either way its one of the best experiences I've had on the Vive so far (but I'm a cricket nut).I will add that on Normal and Hard modes the ball physics do seem to play up a lot more. Sliders wil bounce over my head once they hit the pitch etc. This needs to be worked on by the dev team.			",38,11,2,1,11,4,0

								AWESOME!!!! The emersion is fantastic! I actually feel like i am there! Granted the only bowler you face is the Mighty Shane Warne himself but WOW! I love this game and look forward to future content. I really hope we can get more bowling variety and that the field settings provide more of a challenge. I have though only played easy mode so maybe harder modes will provide that. A little bit of haptic feedback when i set myself at the crease and tap my bat on the ground waiting for Warnie would be nice too.Well my dream of VR Cricket has been realised in this very early release and first attempt and we all now know it is possible and a natural fit for vr. I so look forward to more!WELL DONE GUYS KEEP IT UP!!!edit: there is haptic feedback tapping the wicket i didnt have that first time around. It does need a marker around the ball becuase you can't see the seamstill haven't been caught yet not sure if you can be at this early stagefield doesn't change weather in easy normal or hard mode but facing Shane Warne is hard enough!

								I was so excited to find a VR cricket game, I bought this as soon as it popped up in the store. A $30 game endorsed by Warnie, this looked like it could be something special! Well, it is, but not in a good way.If you've played cricket IRL this is not going to meet your expectations, no matter how low they might be. The balls do not appear to come from the bowler's hand, they just seem to materialise in front of him. The deliveries are impossible to follow until the ball is about halfway down the pitch, and the bounce and spin are unrealistic and completely unconvincing.Warnie spends more time talking than bowling, and it can't be skipped. It takes almost as long between deliveries as in a real game of cricket. There appears to be no in-game menu, you can't cancel a game if you're not happy with the settings, you have to ride it out until the specified number of overs has been completed... so the UI is bad to the point of almost being non-existent.On top of that, it's got bugs. Even in the short time I played the game, on several occasions the fielders would not return the ball to the bowler, and then you're stuck. Not even a menu to use to cancel, you have to terminate the game completely and restart.A cricket game could and should be AWESOME in VR... but this game is little better than a mobile phone game, and a buggy one at that. Charging $30 for it is nothing short of extortion, I would feel cheated if I paid $5 for it.  Unless there are a LOT of MAJOR improvements, this game is not worth your time. ",73,26,6,3,21,4,2

								Really enjoyed this game, played it with mates taking shots to see who could take on Warnie. Good fun over a few beers, would be nice if the game has more features but looks like its still being worked on so cant wait to see what else they add.			",31,11,2,0,4,2,0
