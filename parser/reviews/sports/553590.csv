												God, I'm so out of shape. I just collapse when I reach 50 squats. Great app though. There's definitely a bright future in VR fitness apps. Not sure why this is the only one on Steam? Make more please!			",5,4,0,0,3,1,0

												Really fun game!  I go to the gym a few times a week but it was still very challenging, physically and mentally.  I kept thinking there has to be an end but seemed like it was going forever, the music and body shaped tunnels still haunt my sleep...I think a cool feature would be a spectator mode where someone can sit at the keyboard and be one of the gym goers in the background and lob balls at you to put you off, and if perhaps if you hit them away with your hand you get a bonus of some sort.  Just and idea to give it more replay value. ... and yes, my butt is bloody spectacular  ;)			",57,9,8,1,10,4,0

												It's just popping up and down.. how hard could it be?*2 minutes later*Oh, God!  The burning!  The burning!The game keeps lulling me into a false sense of security with an easy first round and then kicking my a- err.. calves and thighs in my climb up the leader-board.The only quibble I'd mention is that it's not immediately clear what the mechanics of the game are so you're likely to lose a few rounds without quite knowing why, but in retrospect it becomes obvious that you're doing inverted hurdles in a room full of telekinetic amputees...I admit I may have read a bit too much into the bench press animation			",34,11,2,5,9,1,2

												Damn this gets the thighs burning! Simple concept, well executed and the price can't be beat. Get it now! Note to developer: I'd be willing to pay for a few more features. Hope the new Vive Trackers will be incorporated (if available) to make it possible to enforce proper form.			",11,7,4,0,15,2,1

												Pretty good workout. Would like to be able to stop within the game rather than quiting the program. Also it would be nice to have some sort of work out tracker so you can see how many squats was done each day/month.			",25,15,3,0,13,1,1

												Simple game that works well.I didn't do squats previously in my exercise routines. No need for set up (we are already standing up), and it's well adapted to current VR tracking.The score, achievements, random pattern and overall presentation are an extra motivation.Having some profiles, history and graph would be nice, but I won't ask for too much from a free game.Currently I try to do 2 series 2-3 times a week:- One around the middle of my VR session, then a short pause to breath and refresh. Afterward, I play a calm game.- One at the end.For now the exercise is hard for me and the weather is cold, so I blow up well before dripping.I guess I'll have to stop doing that when it will be too warm.

												Do you squat? I didn't think I did. This game proved just how right I was.A fairly basic premise; keeping your arms raised and level, you have to squat; hold the squat for an amount of time, stand back up and repeat. What makes this 'game' good, is how its presented:Very chaotic. Very eccentric. Very computer. Very enjoyable. You're in a large gym-like room, with benchpress benches that have weights being lifted by nobody. In front of you is a track. A large structure emerges, not long followed by a weird, blob-like structure; the shape that you have to squat down into. While each structure is the same shape and depth (the position you have to get into, and how long you have to squat for), the structures may be joined one after the other, so you have to hold the squat for longer.Yes, this could be recreated with a friend telling you what to do/how long to do it (or perhaps a stopwatch), there is something fun about the mad and chaotic world this game is. And this is just a game about squatting; it pulls no punches. If you don't squat this might take a bit of time to get into, but it's certainly enjoyable. I'd love the devs to include other things too - there was/is a japanese gameshow where the contestants have to fit into specific shapes (rather than just squatting). This could - probably quite easily - be included in this kind of game.			",227,117,5,26,50,1,22

												Took a second to figure out that my hands needed to be in front of me, but once I got into the swing of things my legs started burning.  It would be great if there was a bit more variety, but this is a great idea so far!			",52,5,1,15,13,1,3

												This is _exactly_ what it says.  The only action in the game is to squat with your hands in front of you, hold it, then stand and squat again.By level 3 (~30 squats in) the walls are already moving pretty fast and you have to effectively jump out of your squat and straight back into it.  The game doesn't let you just stay in the squatted position, you have come up between walls which means if the walls are only a couple seconds apart you have to come up and go back down in a couple seconds.The game is definitely better than just doing squats without a game (games always make it easier to get through a workout), but it also definitely isn't anything more than just some very basic gamification of squats.  They have a leaderboard and some fun named achievements, but nothing else that I saw.If the game was paid for, the one thing I would request is making it so multiple users on the same steam account could play by switching names in-game.  I would like to be able to compete with family members around the house, but without an in-house leaderboard it kind of falls flat there.  As it is free, I don't expect any updates.
