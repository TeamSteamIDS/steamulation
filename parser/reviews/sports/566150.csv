												I haven't played any other VR bowling games, so have no comparison, but it seems like a fun game.  It's not a graphical wonder, but the physics seem real enough, and I like the ability to reposition yourself with the controller to give yourself the (very) important space you need to swing a ""ball"" without hitting furniture.Plus it's free, what's not to like about that.  Thanks devloper!			",139,40,10,6,41,4,4

												I'm going to leave a positive review because this game has potential. I love bowling, and this was really fun, but i would love to see this game a little more polished. I'm mainly talking about the stretched and blurry 128 x 128 textures throughout. Otherwise, a great time passer.			",206,55,10,26,40,5,24

												Horrific.As a 200 ave bowler... you can't call this a bowling simulation when 12-15 balls are gutter balls.  Suggestions to make this an instantly better game:1 - do NOT reset the play area between games.  Play again should mean play again... in exactly the same play space.  After spending a few minutes to get it oriented and positioned correctly... casually tossing the placespece definition out just because game #2 is starting is CraZy.2 - The balls sound horrible as they roll... like they have massive chips missing in them.  Interetingly, the rolls don't look to smooth either.  They appear out of round... and roll with a tiny jitter.3 - The algorithim for obtaining the swing direciton needs a LOT of work.  First, NO aiming information should be taken anywhere NEAR trigger release.  Releasing the trigger forces the hand to move to a different position... imparting wild deviations in ball exit direction.   Only use a large, averaged set of swing data for direction... and probably dampen/bias it toward perpendicular to the lane.4 - The ball should appear almost instantly back for the player to grab.  You get no points making players wait.  And wait.  And wait...  for a virtual ball to ""return"".  At least have it as a ""quick ball return"" option.  Perhaps combine this with item 5.5 - Set/reset pins VERY quickly.  Again, no points granted for going the actual speed of a mechanical device.  At least have it as a ""quick pin management"" option.  Perhaps combine this with item 4.Do all these things... and the game will be 5X better than it is now. ",94,101,5,9,90,4,7

												OVERALL RATING: 3 out 5 starsBowling at the Lake - FREEPeople who wish to claim they put this out: WhirlVFX 	 	VR bowling game.Played on an i-7 4.0 Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 1070 8 GB RAM, 2 TB 7200 RPM HDDPositives: Doesn't crash, fully functional bowling game.Negatives: Shots are not fully accurate,have to often adjust where your at to get the ball from the ball return.  Ball seems squishy when you throw it onto the lane (like a powder puff)The down and dirty: Jury is out on this one.  Its Free, always worth getting, but will I play alot, at its present state, doubtful, but if the devs keep working on it I see this getting better!  Thank you folks!Darkendone{LDH} ",377,85,11,27,60,8,29
