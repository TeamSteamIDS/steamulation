												I have had this game for several years, and have spent countless hours on it.  This is a text based sports sim, and the best one out there on college football.  Basically you run a D1 football program.  You are in charge of recruiting, the budget, hiring and firing coordinators and you can call plays during the games if you would like to.  The game even gives you some latitude on scheduling and player training.  If you are looking for an arcade game this is not for you, but if you like deep text based sports sim, this would be a good one for you to check out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are missing the dynasty aspects of the NCAA series, this is the game for you. While it currently still harbors some techinical problems, it is still a solid game. Pros+ In depth stats+ Ability to structure custom playbook+ Original BCS NC, 4 team, or 16 team playoff options+ Academic suspensions+ Shifting conferences+ Setting of depth chart and CPU in-game strategyNegatives- Basic coaching options- Occasional game crashes- Over-simplfied recruitingThe game can be as simple or in depth as you want. You can play an entire season in 20 minutes or several hours. The recruiting is good overall, however it feels a little bland at many times. But offseason activities are far better than any college dynasty game I have seen before. If you enjoyed OOTPB or Football Manager, this will feel a little more shallow as it isn't at that level yet. But it is a solid addition to manager sims and is worth playing if you are a college football fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a really great simulation of collge football. The only thing that currently holds it back is that the game was released right before the huge change over to all of the various spread option formations and philosophies that now exists in college football circa 2006. It is good that the developer is now beginning to provide updates to the game once again and hopefully this will be added in the near future.That being said I have heard some in the community for this game say that a new game is needed. The engine for the game is actually quite good and truthfully if they would provide an update that would make this game more comparable to current day college football I think really that would be all that would be needed to bring excitment back to this game. The current price tag for the game at $14.99 is definitely worth the price but just that one update would in my opinion bring about not only more sales but excitment back to the game once again.
