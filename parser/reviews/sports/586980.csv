												It's fun.You can explore around and do funny things.It's basically low budget GTA.It needs improvements and multiplayer.			",11,2,1,0,0,2,0

												Really nice open world arcade racer with the russian touch !!Yes takes place in typical russian city and bourgades, graphics are really nice and spicey, lots of little details here and there.Nice slight blur effect, nice textures and some cool music too.You start the game by just wandering in the city, grabbing any car you can, and then go do races. You earn cash and can buy cars etc.Overall game feels vibrant, colorish and is great in atmoshpere.Other great point : The price.What i would love them to add : achievements and trading cards, if you read devs, thanks.

												I think this is a very cheap and this game is very good for its price. This game is a very good russian simulator or maybe a russian Grand theft auto. Buy it if you dont know what do you want to buy. this is a very good but a littlebit stupid but good graphics, and good cars: lada, mtz more. BUY IT!For developers: give guns to this game (FPS guns, to the character like an fps shooter) If you guys put weapons to this game, this is going to be AWESOME!!!!!			",87,6,3,2,12,2,1
