												Meh, just meh. Doesn't even have an option for keyboard mode. You're better spending your money on Moonpies or maybe a bit of real meat vs virtual bulls.			",9,2,0,7,15,0,3

												I actually enjoyed this game, it's something different. It's like the Tony Hawk of bullfighting. I just wish there was blood. Now we need a sequel, Running From The Bulls. With the option to be the bull :D			",475,172,3,106,44,8,81

												Thank you for keyboard overlay.  Game seems fun, kind of a pain to figure out with keyboard.  I would say buy only if you have the controller to use for game.			",161,51,10,14,21,3,33

												It's very hard for me to write a Review about this game, because it is so bad it didn't even let me play!Short Review:The greatest Failure in gaming history!Long Review:When i first startet the game a bad animated intro with one of the worst sounds welcomed me. Becase it told me i could skip this with the B button on my controller, I connected it to my PC and pressed B, but nothing happend. So i pressed every button and every key on my keyboard until Esc eventually skiped it. After this intro i was presented with a loading screen, with usefull tips about the game. After one full minute of waiting i alt+f4'ed out of this hell of a game, only to give it a 2nd try.I disconected my controller, because the game doesn't support it and started the game again. this time i quickly skiped the intro and after 2 seconds the loadingscreen was finished with loading. After pressing enter the game showed me one of the ugliest main menu's i've ever seen. I tried to navigate through the menu down to the options with w,a,s,d but pressing the S key only quites this game.So i Started the Game a 3rd Time, skiped the intro and pressed enter to get to the main menu. navigating with the arrow keys worked, so i finally got to the options. I tried to change the controlls but it only showed me a picture of a xbox 360 controller and some text at every button wich told me what the button did and the only thing i noticed is that the only purpose of the A,B,X and Y button is to skip the intro or other sequences what probably tells you a lot about the game if about half of the buttons only purpose is to skip the intro.I couldn't change the controls, so i tried to get back to the menu but even this was harder than it sounds, i pressed every button but not even Esc could help me so eventually i had to press alt+f4 again.Starting the game again, skipping the intro, pressing enter to get to the menu and i started the campain. I promptly was confronted with a close up of an low poly version of an creepy looking old man and the options to set his name, the location, his skin color and eye color - because every good game needs character customisation.After changing everything to my likeing, wich where the same as default, because i had still no clue why this game needs these options i tried to start the campain, but nothing worked. I noticed that at the bottoms are controlls: up down to navigate through the options, LB and RB to rotate the model and B to Cancle. Ther wasn't even a button on the controller that would have allowed you to continue, so i gave up and tried Esc to Escape this Hell, but as always with this game: it didn't work! So i pressed alt+f4 for the last time and i'll let the game collect dust in the endless void of my steam library.			",93,23,3,8,9,0,12
