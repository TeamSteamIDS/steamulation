												Let's start at the beginning. When the buggy menu FINALLY lets you join a game (that is, if there are any available), you are dropped into what seems to be a waiting area where you can run around randomly. Then you click the join arena button, where it sends you into the g-ball arena, which is a giant sphere full of random things on the ground and floating rings in the air. That's it. No explanation, no tutorial, nothing. It seems they just expect you to automatically know what to do.Now, the controls. First, you can't change them in game. Second, the standard setup isn't too bad, but it's unresponsive and hard to figure out. For example, why the hell is the button to throw a ball the right click? To move the camera, you have to hold either mouse button and drag, however it too is unresponsive.Overall, I think this game really does have potential. The graphics and environments are nice, but everything else needs work. Also, it REALLY needs an instruction guide.			",69,9,5,5,6,0,1

												I got this in a bundle with 6 other games for $2.  As such, it was 33c for this game.I like the concept.  I like the idea of a sport in zero gravity.  Where this falls down is in the execution.  It is glitchy, the physics sometimes defy logic, and of course the result is a multiplayer game with NO player base.  It's dead.  I begged my gf and she played with me to get the achievements, but in hindsight the only fun was not the game but in making fun of it.  Like watching a really bad movie.  It's so bad it is funny.  If I played this with random players (if there were any) then maybe it would be less fun.Avoid this game like the plague.  Shame on the authors for tarnishing NASA and shame on NASA for not suing them over it.0.1/10 at 33c-100/10 at $3.99			",1512,673,63,204,237,16,336

												This game was developed in conjunction with NASA. In the year 2035 you are playing in 6 different glass arenas next to the planet Mars. The gameplay reminds me strongly on basketball, of course it's in a zero gravity environment.What it doesn't make it easier is that if you land on a wall everytime your view begins to roll. Altogether the controls of this game are very inconvenient. You have permanently to  push left mouse button to hold your focus on red ball. You can also use smash balls to disturb your opponent in scoring. But after a while you may get dizzy of these weird camera movements. And then there are these countdowns everywhere. If you score it countdowns, if a new round begins it countdowns, if the game starts it countdowns  and much more of that.I know: on NASA rocket launches I always liked the countdowns most...

												Horrible controls! And horrible camera thing! And gameplay that is too bad even for free to play!Don't buy! The game is so bad I can't even write a real review about it because nothing ever seems to work! The game is so bad you can not even boost the achievements because the controls prevent you from winning games!			",2037,892,95,313,282,21,401
