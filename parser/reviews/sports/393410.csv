												I got banned FOREVER within the game because I've written a review that shows the game in a bad light, as it is. Developer barely interested in fixing the game bugs and making new features. So, thanks for banning me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Simple controls, complex tactics, LOTS of fun. Great for just something to play when you are bored.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
