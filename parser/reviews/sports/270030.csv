												Several, and I mean SEVERAL choices of hats available for Snow Horse, whislt I do feel it would benefit from some sort of medieval helmet amongst the hats I still gotta rate the hat section of snow horse a solid 8/10.			",320,35,7,33,35,3,32

YouTube™ Video: SNOW HORSE REVIEW | DO MEME GAMES BELONG ON STEAM? 

			Views: 3,399		

			It's a game about a snowboarding horse. Is this what thousands of years of human civilization has come to? To check the game out on Steam, head over to http://store.steampowered.com/app/270030/ It's...		

I really don't recommend this game. It's extremely shallow, there's practically no gameplay, the novelty wears off after a few seconds, and you can experience everything in the game in under 10 minutes.			",210,29,3,36,42,5,11

												So good, most reviewers here on Steam have played the game for all of 10 minutes before making their conclusions. Yes, the game is that shallow. There is nothing to this 'game'. It's really not worth £4.31. I received the 'game' for free and I still feel like perhaps I should be refunded. You are a horse on a snowboard. The levels are stupid, the horse physics are stupid. The stunts are stupid. You'll honestly be bored of this is around 5 minutes.Click a direction and stunt button.Land the trick.Repeat until end of circuit.Move on to next Circuit.Put hat on horse.Put different hat on horse.Put horse on new snowboard.Back to circuit.Do tricks.Get bored.Turn off Snow Horse.Move on to different game.£4.31 would be better spent throwing your coins into actual snow and trying to find them again.Update: No price drop and the game is still just as bad. On top of that, the trailer and song make me want to gouge my ears and eyes out.			",287,31,29,8,18,2,10

												""Snow Horse is a simple yet hilarious game and I laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off playing it. It’s meant to be funny and silly and to make you smile. As Snowhorse’s developer, Kinifi Games says: “I'm so excited to share it with everyone! This game isn't to be taken seriously. That it exists is a joke in itself.” Well Kinifi Games, I can only say that I really liked your joke; it managed to make me laugh out loud on more than one occasion!""To read our full review, please visit www.dumeegamer.com ",20,18,0,0,1,0,1

												This game brought out a rage in me the likes of which I never expected to see from myself. I thought Snowhorse was a novel concept and that I was in for a fun time but that quickly went away because of how inconsistent this game is. The high frequency of seemingly random deaths very quickly killed the experience for me. If it wasn't so buggy this game would have the potential to be a really fun little game. If it gets fixed I think this game could be great, and I want it to be great. Until then I can't reccomend this game.			",154,71,3,11,13,3,22

												Snow Horse is likely one of the most unique experiences you’ll find this year. It has responsive well designed controls and plays like a hybrid of Cool Boarders 3 and the older style Tony Hawk games that were produced by Activision. This is a game best enjoyed with headphones, the soundtrack is really a star player in this frigid equine cast and I find myself leaving the game open just to listen to it while I’m working.The price point is good, and makes this game a great gifting idea!P.S. You can also make the horse wear a top hat.			",125,31,1,16,31,1,18

												There are few moments in the history of games, where you have to take a step back, and appreciate the majesty of a single moment that transcends gaming, art, culture, the boundaries of human imagination. That moment... is SNOWHORSE.			",89,17,0,11,11,2,12

												You're probably thinking... What the heck  is this?It's a game you must have! It brings me back to my childhood, playing snowboard games on my PS1. But now, it's a horse instead of a human snowboarding! Could it be any better?			",168,40,11,24,42,2,35

												""So...There is a Horse, he likes to Snowboard.""That is what I assume the pitch for this game was; and as far as pitches go it isn't bad.The snowboarding mostly works, though there doesn't seem to be a lot of correlation between what way your horse is facing and whether you crash or not.The controls are generally responsive, if uninspired. It is hard to see what the tricks buttons do alothough the stars show up which is neato I guess.I would also like fo there to be some downhill feeling. It all just feels like a flat surface that you are auto sliding down.Anyway, good horse game...okay snowboarding game.

			Really good start. This game has a lot of promise but I am not sure if it will get to a state where I would put more than a small amount of time.
