Early Access Review
								(EDIT: Recent changes seem to have made ZP a much more enjoyable game, with much less frustration and much longer games. Thank you, DEVs.) One presumes that most gamers interested in pinball have some degree of experience, so this review focuses on what makes Zaccaria Pinball what it is, and specific information on each table posted seperately. What all potential players DO need to be aware of is that these tables were produced 30 to 40 years ago as physical pinball tables by Italian designers, so few of them have been seen before in North America. This review will hopefully receive revising as needed.(A listing of far more information, as well as details on each and every individual table, will be posted on the Zaccaria Pinball discussion page. Hopefully, pretty much most of what people will need at this stage may be found there. This is only a small portion of it here. Thank you.)http://steamcommunity.com/app/444930/discussions/0/358415206080779382/http://steamcommunity.com/app/444930/discussions/0/358415206080766569/ZACCARIA PINBALL – CHANGES TODAY’S PLAYERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE OFLane Lights/NudgingAll of the Zaccaria Pinball tables came right at the cusp of the “flipper-changed lane lights” era, so none of them have this (now) long standard feature. This absence strongly changes the dynamic of the game, requiring the ball to traverse lanes far more times (for the average player), requiring more aiming skill and a different strategy. But overall, older tables will generally require increased skill.One aspect of the increased skill, as well as the lack of control over lane lights, is an increased benefit to nudging. This player is required by circumstance to play one-handed, with a controller. As it is far more difficult to accomplish substantially more actions with what amounts to just two fingers, I am unable to specifically comment on the effect, need, use, or advantages to nudging in Zaccaria Pinball. Others will be more qualified, and no doubt will be anxious to help. It should be safe to say that nudging is substantially more crucial in Zaccaria Pinball than in newer tables, or tables that originated in digital form.Sound EffectsThe original Zaccaria Pinball tables came at a time when sound was finding a more significant place in pinball. As such, even ZP tables that might be expected to have great sound, such as circus or military themed tables, may have almost no sound at all. And the several tables that bravely use voice acting may present largely unintelligible phrases. But a few of the later tables really do have great sound effects, and considering historical context, weak sound should not be considered a negative.The Dreaded OutlaneNow for Zaccaria Pinball’s dark little secret. Numerous tables present a strong argument of having been specifically designed to feed balls into outlanes. Many, or most (or all) players will have games where every ball leaves through an outlane, never having been touched by flipper. And they will be on the same tables. (This reviewer had one table quickly direct nine out of nine balls to outlanes during testing. But this extreme case may certainly be an anomaly.) Seeing the ball “ladder” up the slingshots into an outlane is one of the most distressing actions in pinball…and in Zaccaria Pinball is far from rare on several tables. Experienced players will see all the design elements, such as lowered outlane barriers and slingshot strength and angles, which encourage gravity to consistently act contrary to the design of a long-play table (and the wishes of many players.) Safe to say, identifying those tables by name is neither prudent nor necessary, but they are the minority and they do not attempt to hide. Please keep in mind that these tables were designed to be coin operated, so games of extreme length were not always in the best financial interest.CamerasWhile Zaccaria Pinball has wonderful control over camera views, there may still be some issues to be considered. This reviewer has been playing computer pinball in portrait mode exclusively for well over a year, and Zaccaria Pinball makes this incredibly easy. Simply set your monitor to portrait view through Windows, Zaccaria Pinball takes care of everything else instantly and automatically. But what this player found on two i7, Windows 10 laptops is that by using any of the seven default ZP camera views, left and right edges of all table were lost to the degree that outlanes weren’t even a trace on the screen, much less the outlane flippers that can be so vital. But the problem may be the solution: camera options.It appears that Cameras 1 -3 may be fixed, but 4 – 7 are easily modifiable. Since option changes appear onscreen as they’re chosen, select the camera in that four camera range that shows the view you prefer. Then change the FOV (field of view) setting to something around 60%. This should allow you to see the entire table, and further tweaking may provide even better results. (This basically emulates Fly Cam, which, if one might think adequate to SHOW the table, would be adequate to PLAY the table.)Options!!!	It may be safe to unequivocally state that there has NEVER been a pinball game that allowed the player such a remarkable degree of control. There are far too many selections to go into in detail, but the scope should be indicated. For example, this player likes to play Zaccaria Pinball with the background sounds of a tropical island, playing in the early evening during a thunderstorm on a tables that looks as if they’ve been played for many years and not cleaned (much like this player, in fact.) So that’s EXACTLY what I do. Or a more urban player may wish to play as if in an arcade (the default) or an airport, on a brand new, spotlessly clean table, sunny mid-afternoon. Players may change the ball to granite or glass. Or make the sound of the rolling ball or flipper strike louder or quieter. Changes can also be made to physics, but unless you have selected USER as game mode, they will have no effect. USER mode has its own leaderboard, but this player’s single experience was that the leaderboard wasn’t populated. (What would be the point of a leaderboard of miscellaneous and widely varied laws of physics? A 1% slant generated score compared to a 99% slant generated score?)Experiment with options. It adds variety, and it’s fun to see the capabilities (and in the case of Camera, players may have little choice.)TOP DOZEN ZACCARIA PINBALL TABLES (in one opinion)BlackbeltCircusDevil RidersEarth Wind FireFarfallaHot WheelsMagic CastleMexico '86Soccer KingsSpace ShuttleStrikeTime MachineNOT-TOP DOZEN ZACCARIA PINBALL TABLES (in one opinion)Cine StarFire MountainLucky FruitMoon FlightMystic StarNautilusRed ShowStar GodStar's PhoenixSupersonicUniverseWood's QueenThank you			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Speaking as a pinball table owner, I can say Zaccaria Pinball is quite an accurate simulation, although not absolutely perfect. Some aspects of the physics of the tables are being adjusted on an ongoing basis during early access, but the game is already in a state that I would say is virtually complete. The tables themselves are authentic tables manufactured by Zaccaria, an Italian company which existed between 1974 and 1988. On first sight they don't match up visually to later tables, particularly those of U.S. manufacturers who often market their tables with tie-ins from Hollywood movies. However, the Zaccaria tables do have a beauty of their own. Their characteristic style is representative of the popular cartoon art of the era in which they were made. Being quite old, the tables have fewer toys, ramps and rails on the play surface than you would typically find on tables from the late 1980s onwards. They also lack the l.e.d. display fields and more complicated rule-sets typical of later tables.For anyone too young to have encountered these tables for real, Zaccaria Pinball (the video game) is offering the experience of playing historically accurate and still highly enjoyable pinball tables on your computer (or other device), which is practically the only way these days.In terms of playability, these older types of tables can be less forgiving, and due to the simpler rule-sets, the games aren't as engrossing as many you find in Farsight Studios' The Pinball Arcade. However, you have exactly the same issue with the older electro-mechanical and early solid-state tables in The Pinball Arcade.Pixel Magic, the makers of Zaccaria Pinball (the video game) have done a superb job of rendering the game and it looks amazing. The only exception is the back glass, which looks a bit strange close up. The under-surface lighting, reflections from the table glass, and even optional fingerprints and scratches help to create the illusion of playing something well used and real. While it might not provide quite the buzz of some other contemporary pinball video games, it achieves a higher degree of authenticity and is still still very enjoyable. I have no hesitation in recommending Zaccaria Pinball.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
