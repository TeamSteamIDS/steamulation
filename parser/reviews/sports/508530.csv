												I'm bad at this game. And that's okay, because the soundtrack is pretty solid.No, shutup. You're bad at this game. No. You are.Here's the deal. Nod your head to the soundtrack.Move your guy around. Don't fall off the screen.Kick the ball. Nod your head to the soundtrack.Double jump.Don't hit the red squiggles.Get the ball to the stickers. (Or pro-tip. Skip the ♥♥♥♥ing stickers.) Get the ball to the goal.Laugh at how terrible everyone is at this game.Nod your head to the soundtrack.This game is hard.And it's good.Rub your wallet on this game.Rub this game on your face.Rub this game on your friend's face.Rub your face on your friend's face.You get the idea.

												HackyZack is a perfect example of a game that put game mechanics in the foreground. From the first moment that I played this game, in development at a gaming convention, I knew how it would turn out. It was fun. The first level even. The controls and movements just feel right. Actions and physics are tight. As you play the game you see all of these new mechanics added. The developers do an amazing job at introducing, challenging, and then layering these mechanics. At first the game seem super hard, but you quickly learn new techniques that allow for you to complete the most difficult levels and get those seemingly impossible-to-reach stickers. Easily one of my favorite games. I can sit down and play a couple levels or spend hours trying to get one of those stickers. I recommend this game to anyone. There's a level of fun that can entertain a diverse audience. 10/10			",3,0,0,0,0,0,0

												HackyZack is a challenging experience that quickly becomes addicting as you progressively get better at the game. Tight, intuitive controls give you a level of flexibility in approaching each challenge, especially if you're going after the optional ""stickers"" you can collect in each stage (which in turn, unlock new characters to play as, each oozing with personality). The combination of figuring out each stage's puzzle while performing twitchy platforming results in a rewarding feeling each time you finish a level.The visual design is beautifully simple, with lovely pixel animations and ""chillout"" kind of atmosphere. Music is wonderful and does a great job at setting the tone for each of the various worlds you'll be playing through.If you love precision platforming that requires a tactical approach, then you'll surely dig HackyZack.

												Fun game! Takes a lot of skill and concertration, so not really for doing a level everynow and then when you have 5 minutes of free time. Some levels you'll need to execute in perfect order with perfect timing.			",215,26,5,17,23,0,21

Here is the thang with HackyZack - it is a fantastic addition to any gamer's library that values hard-as-nails platformers that really require that twitch skill. I find it great fun in small bursts. No, I'll never finish nor master this title. I love the artwork and the music. The controls are great - I played solely with a controller. It is brutally difficult, but fair.The idea is definitely fresh and at least the early levels are fun and seem well thought out.			",561,162,5,75,79,8,72

												Very fun game with great controls. Buy the soundtrack while you're at it. It's also great!No complaints about gameplay at all.Have unlocked all playable characters and achievements.My only suggestion involves the level selection. Would love to have a return to level select from the pause menu that would take you to the level select screen for the World that you are currently on. Also, having the page turn to the next/previous world if you go past the first/last level of the current world instead of looping through the levels of the one world.			",1129,341,46,107,57,14,107

												Another Indi Classic!If you're a fan of fast paced and challenging platformers, this is your game. As I'm writing this review I've only made it to world 3 and continue to love the new mechanics that are introduced at the start of each world.Not to mention the soundtrack is incredible. It makes missing the damn collectables much less frustrating because of the smooth downtempo sound.			",114,15,2,5,7,2,11

												Be warned, this game is very challenging.That said, it's very fun, addictive, and I quite enjoy it myself, though i can rage sometimes at it.I've been following the dev for a while and it's really awesome to see this come to fruition, and it's definitely worth the buy!

												This is a high-skill platformer. It may take a lot of practice to get any good at playing it, and I'm not nearly there yet, but it'd probably feel badass to be at that level.In the meantime, the chill music helps keep me sane after I've failed a level for the twentieth time. Luckily you're also not required to play the levels in each world sequentially, so you can hunt around for an easier stage if you're really stuck.As a platformer the controls are responsive and it feels good to move around, but the focus is really on manipulating the ball in each stage, which has its own physics and of course operates independently of the player character. So the challenge comes from not only learning to maneuver your character around the stage but also from directing and timing your kicks of the ball to precisely move it where you need it to go. It's a unique concept to build a game around and brings something new to the genre. Worth a shot.			",176,27,6,26,22,1,39

												I've followed Zack on twitter for as long as he's been showing tidbits of information and development updates of this game, and I'm beyond satisfied with the finished product.Pros:- Doesn't take too long to complete- High skill ceiling- Lovely music- Great feeling when you complete a level in one fluid string of motionsCons:- Personally, I wish there was a way to stand still and kick the ball, as opposed to moving all the time- The bumps in difficulty feel kinda rough (World 2 of the 5 I've played managed to give me the most trouble)- Can't back out to level select if you want to stop playing a level, you must go to the main menuOverall, I look forward to much more time spent in this lovely little craft and would hope you decide to support the wonderful developers behind it as well. Cheers!			",416,124,7,54,40,1,32

FULL DISCLOSURE - I'M A PLAYABLE CHARACTER IN THE GAME...And I love it. From a purely objective (which is the opposite of HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE, eg, my review) standpoint, it's got super tight controls, a fantastic mechanic (dat hacky sackin' goodness tho) and the art direction is absolutely fabulous with charms and inspirations straight out of the 90s. The music is chill as F which is a wonderful juxtaposition to the VERY challenging gameplay. Oh and also, did I mention that you can play as me in the game? Easily worth the cost of two coffees from Starbucks, for that alone.Don't miss out!Lots of love to the Spaceboy Games team for all their hard work on this gem of a platform puzzler hacky sack simulation computer entertainment video game!

												This game is perfectly beautiful and righteously awesome. The gameplay is super tight and very well thought out. the sprites and color pallette are just the best. It can be quite difficult if you're trying for the collectables.			",251,77,0,23,15,2,16

												HackyZack is a platformer that provides the satisfaction of figuring out how to approach a problem, and then trying to perfrom the solution over and over and eventually managing to pull it off. Lots of fun. The controls take a bit of figuring out as the movement keys and direction you're kicking keys are the same. Still a wonderful game.			",105,52,1,12,8,0,8

												I first saw footage of HackyZack at PAX 2017 on twitch, when they were having their Q&A and previewing the first couple levels. It definitely intrigued me in the originality of the game. After beating HyperLightDrifter recently, I needed more colorful intuitive indie games, and this one did not disappoint. Also has a bumpin' soundtrack!			",16,1,0,1,0,0,0
