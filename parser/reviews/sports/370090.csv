												I am so happy that we have got not only an american football game on pc but that we have devs that are open to any suggestions you make. The game is fun for what it is and the game will be fully moddable in the future just basic mods available now. For now don't expect a full simualtion football game just expect a fun arcade style game in the vein of Tecmo Bowl with an innovative passing feature that can only get better with time. Support this game and lets see it grow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright so, lets all keep in mind this is not a Madden game.With that out of the way, lets begin on what this game currently offers, plans and needs.Keeping it quick and simple:1. Passing is rough, its much easier to run currently as they can basically pick you off quite easily 1 on 1, as you can on defense.2. Running is very fun, however they need to add some of Maddens ideas such as, Hitstick, Stiffarm, Spin and overall more balance towards all running styles Offensive and Defensive.3. The rubberbanding that currently is in-game will I am sure be fixed sooner later, however it really causes some issues when your playing the game, mostly on offensive side however it makes it rough to make plays on defense aswell.4. The AI on passing is amazing, AI QB's are very accurate and this not only causes issues because they can just bomb it everytime if they wanted, they can hit their screens very quickly on the move with 95% accuracy. This should be looked into as it can unbalance the game in serious need-to-win games.5. Fantasy draft and other goodies that are planned to be added would make this game have so much more to offer, I hope they release a huge content patch in August like they have planned as this game has so much potential being one of the only Football games on PC and new.I recommend this game because I am a diehard football fan, however if you easily are butthurt over AI kicking your teams butt, you may want to avoid this game currently and look it up after a year or so of patching.Might have been a little to early release, but we need to support games that we like, specially rare Football ones. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First off I would like to say that I think the passing mechanic is the best innovation to the football genre in over a decade. I just wish that the rest of the game was as well fleshed out. Don't get me wrong, I've had fun with the game, but it feels like it should be in early access or a promotional tool to get a kick-stater going and not something being sold as a finished retail product. Also, it's awesome that this game supports Xbox One controllers.For me it just has too many issues to recommend it at $20, which puts it in the same class of competition as games like Rocket League and SuperMega Baseball. But at a discount it is worth checking out but bear in mind it does have a few glitches and bugs here and there.A few of those that I've encountered are: I've had multiple instances of kickoffs out of bounds resulting in touchdowns being awarded to the AI. I've been rewarded touchdowns on successful two point conversion tries. Dropped lateral passes aren't counted as fumbles. There are some ballance issues with certain teams being pretty OP (you can easily run for 1,000 yds a game with Seattle). The A.I. throws far too many interceptions (I've had as many as 12 in a single game) and takes too many sacks (I've had as many as 39 in a single game) on higher difficulty levels.I hate having to give this a negative review. I think this is a great starting point, the dev has some really good ideas, I'd love to see him get a serious backer because with proper resources and a team he could make an amazing game, but this isn't a $20 product. Again if you can get it at a lower price, you should give it a try, just have level headed expectations. This isn't a Madden-killer yet. Maybe in 2016.Here is my detailed review of v 2.0 featuring video footage of the kickoff touchdown glitch. Most of what I say in it still holds true though a few of the gameplay elements such as defensive line shifts have since been patched into the game)

												An awesome football game!  Great AI.  Beats Madden by letting me control exactly where I want my pass to go with a cursor.  If you're looking for a footbal game on the PC then this is it.  Being able to mod the roster and players makes it endless fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not into Football... or Sports at all. But It is quite fun actually!The Devs are listening to the Community, that's a big Thumb up reason for me!Controlls are quite good, and the Soundtrack as well. If you love Football and simulation this Game is worth a try!And it got Cards :-)*RECOMMENDED*			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'd say it's less ""simulation"" and more ""Tecmo Bowl""... And that's not a bad thing. This is a budget title, and it shows. The graphics, animations, and audio (namely the commentator) are terrible. There is a serious lack of depth, with each game in the franchise mode feeling like random exhibitions. But Axis Football 2015 shows a lot of potential. I dare say that I actually enjoy the passing system in this game over modern day Madden titles.Overall, the game is pretty fun. If it should go on sale for $4 or less, I'd highly recommend checking it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love football and was excited when I saw there was an American football game on Steam. I stopped playing VERY quickly. The play selection is basic at best, the control is stiff and janky, the menus are glitchy on high resolutions, the visual presentation is on-par with games from 2007, and the sound assets are absolutely horrible. There's no crowd noise, no music and the announcer sounds like a 1940s radio announcer with really bad, cheesy lines. The only redeeming quality I can think of for this title is the aimed passing, which is neat. Don't buy this game just because you're jonesing for football like I was.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Updated* With more play time I have come to realize this game is great for what it is. Didn't experience some of the bugs others have mentioned. Little hard to pass but I've gotten use to it. I actually like the fact I can throw away the ball since I have control. Overall its playable and works for what it is. Yes this game needs a lot of work but with more support it'll get there. Don't buy this and expect a Madden or 2K experience. If you buy it make sure you read the description and see what the devs are planning. They know its not where we want it to be so no need to tell them. RIght now this game has LOTS of potential but needs the support to help it develop and grow.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was very excited for this game being the first 3d american football game on steam but i was dissapointed. I bought this game thinking it was a buy once and thats it but after asking the dev he says it will be yearly (like madden) the stroe paged metioned new graphics and a franchise mode (dont be fooled this wont be till the 2016 version another 20$) the season mode is terrible and basic and there is only to modes that and a quick game. the physics are terrible and graphics mediocre .If this game was a buy once game i would recommend it because of all the great ideas they have but if you want the better features you will have to wait till the 2016 version comes out (another 20$) i am very disapointed.

												Axis Football is the only american football game on steam. It is created by a small group of developers, and is not a complete game yet. If you are looking for a madden or 2k experience then you may be disappointed. The great thing about this game is that it was made for the pc with the ability to pass with your mouse. The developer is also taking note from the community suggestions. There are already some roster mods for nfl/ncaa teams and more mod support is underway. I would buy this game to support it and see what it can become. Pros+Only pc game on steam+Easy controls dispite the fact passing will be weird at first+Developer is listening to the community+Mods+Teams with wacky names at the start+Nice little community that is starting to growCons-Not finished yet entirely -Animations are a little weird-Graphics are weird (but who really cares?)-Many features to be added.All and all, I would recommend this game to anyone that hates how EA is screwing with madden nowdays and is willing to support this game.

												Ok I’m fully supporting these devs because this is really the only way that we are likely to get a good football sim on the PC.   EA has exclusive deals with NFL and NCAA and will never port to the PC.   MS is trying to make make exclusive deals with 2K so that they can have sports games exclusive to xb1 and MS10.  In addition It looks like MS is trying to start yet again their own distribution network for the PC that will only run on xb1 and MS10.I don’t like this environment where you are being forced to buy a console or upgrade an OS just so you can play games.  If you are like me and don’t like the way this is going then you need to support indie developers like this who are really trying to make a difference.With that said I have played this version and it is rough when compared to titles created by EA and 2K.   Lets face it those guys have massive resources and they get massive support from the console makers as well.   This developer is small with very little recourses and no support from valve which is a shame.   If valve and steam want to continue to remain dominant on the PC platform then they need to be supporting projects like these as much as they can.And If you want a good football sim on the PC then you need to be supporting these guys as well.  Even with limited resources this dev has done an outstanding job with what he has had to work with.   They will have a 2016 version coming out in July and I have seen the improvements they have made.   They are still not where they need or want to be but they are making great progress. If they continue to make the same progress over the next year that they made this past year then they are well on their way to making a really good football sim.I understand that everyone wants it to have NFL and NCAA teams represented in the game.  Well they have that covered in the upcoming version.  The devs have opened this game up to Mod support and modders have already added uniforms, graphics, logos and rosters to match both NFL and NCAA teams.  So day one you will be able to download that content and play with you favorite team.Bottom line I am not affiliated with these devs in any way.  I did not help with the mods and I did not receive any free software nor would I ask or except any free copies.  I simply want everyone that enjoys playing those other games on the consoles to support these guys.   I understand that it may take a few years with the current size of their budget and the size of their dev team.   They need our support if they are going to make this game better please consider buying this version and the 2016 version when it’s released.   You can go to youtube and see the progress they are making.   2 thumbs up to Axis football keep up the good work guys.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Like many reviewers said, this is NOT MADDEN.  It's a solid Indie effort which currently highlights a great aimed passing feature.  Pros:- All 'official' pro cities represented but for obvious copyright reasons, I thought the dev was very clever with each team name.  You will have no trouble identifying each game team's counterpart in the big leagues.- As mentioned before, the aimed passing feature- on easy, the AI is too easy but seemed to get challenging on the harder levelsCons:- On all levels AI needs a little more beefing up.  Have AI adjust to player's preferential play style during the game which would force the player to quit using plays that 'always work'*Rather than list the below items as 'Cons', I understand the game is still being developed so...Needing:- At 1920 x 1080, I feel the status bar gets 'in the way' of the view during the receiving portion of a kickoff or punt return.  A way to alleviate this would be to get dev to move the bar down a little bit.  Have not tried lower resolutions- Color blind features needed - namely for the ground 'target' circles. Being partially color blind myself, I have gotten used to noticing the circle during passing plays but still have a hard time seeing the target circle when about to recv. from a kickoff or punt.- REAL time 4 qtrs of play.  Maybe have a mode where one could do a quick game (the way it's set now) then have a more official mode using the official clock times- Some of the Madden features for being able to throw off blockers - hitstick, etc  Maybe a quick view change once a pass or kick is caught or after a ball is handed off where one could look from the player's POV while running the play after the catch or hand. *OR*- Keep the same view since I get that you want 2 players to be able to share the same screen (friend at a friend's house sort of thing) then maybe slow the game down a little bit.  I think all the AI players noticeably all run around the same speed >> FAST.  Greater variability on each individual AI and player controllered players so that some run faster, some slower.  Some defenders block and pass rush better, some don't.  etc..  By slowing the game down some, a player can read the defense a little more, maybe find the holes to run through.Otherwise it's a FOOTBALL GAME FOR THE PC!  I think it's worth it.  If you're tight with the money, maybe hold out to see what the new 2016 version will be about.  I bought in now because the dev needs to earn a living too, and so I gladly supported his efforts for this 2015 edition and will most likely shell out some more moola for the 2016 version.  I'll become a 'lifer' supporter if I see great improvements in the 2016 version because that's usually a good sign that the dev is in it to win it! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look around do you see any other Football games on Steam? Nope...That's enough to show support and see if this Dev can create a great football game franchise for PC.. The game does need work but the passing is fun. I recommend it for any NFL fan.. It is sort of like an arcade football game right now so just don't expect Madden. This is the very start of an original franchise lower the expectations a little and hope Axis can deliver on their promised features.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
