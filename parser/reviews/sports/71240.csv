												It's an anomaly these days for a game to reel in such an emotional response in the player only to pull a bait-and-switch when you least expect it. I was kept at the edge of my boat seat from the moment the SEGA logo lured me in, I was ready. My heart was on the line along with the monster bass that swallowed my jig whole as he failed under the dock as guitars seemingly from heaven itself pounded away as did the giant fish. I turned rod leftIT'S COMING NEAR I turned rod right COME ON ALMOST THEREIn a brief moment of glory the monsterous bass was lifted on to my boat, seemingly putting it on the edge of capsizing. THIS ONE'S HUUUUUUUGE!I ranked in my tears and felt the bonus of time rush over me. Thank you Sega, thank you.			",142,19,2,20,3,0,2

												Better fish AI than in CoD Ghost!Never owned the full game on the Dreamcast, but had the demo. I played that demo for hours. Now i finally got a chance to play the full game and it didn't disappoint.  Currently frustrated with the tournament mode. I do very well in the lodge area, but the bridge is brutal. The water in the bridge area is very deep, so you have to use sinking lures, if you don't reel the lure will just go to the bottom, if you lure fast the fish won't bite. This makes it very hard to catch anything in this area and just ends up costing me the tournament.  So be prepared to rage and scream at some stupid virtual fish to bite your f#%&ing lure!

												This game really caught my attention.  A fishing game that no others can match on the comparison scale.  The gameplay offered by SEGA Bass fishing has serious buoyancy, and you will not mind sinking hours into it.  I had one hull of a great time learning all the mechanics inside it.  I really wish there were morray like it.  The amount of time I lost just getting so in-depth with this game was a bit crappie, but maybe my time control is just a fluke; and there really is no need to be steamed about that.  And I just failed to keep my head above water.I recommend you try this game, don't leave it up to salmon else.  This game will seriously have you hooked.			",223,35,31,12,45,0,14

												Game is not that bad, but the analog controls using the right thumbstick on the XBOX 360 Controller seem a bit odd when trying to simulate the feel of turning the crank on the fishing line to reel in the fish . Has the tournament mode from the original Dreamcast Edition. This version of the game don't have any of the graphical glitches like the original SEGA PC release did back in the day. Kind of short and lacking in content but its still not that bad.Still prefer Fishermans Bait on PS1 if you have the console and have access to the game :)			",276,99,12,30,29,4,26

												Games like this are what make SEGA arcade KINGS!Take a niche concept to begin with (fishing), narrow it down to a ridiculous level (Bass only) and then polish every bit of gameplay, sound and presentation until it shines like a new ferrari and is more addictive than crack.For people who enjoy fishing in real life, this game is pure bliss. And even if you're not into fishing but still love other arcade classics from the turn of the century, this one stands proud among them.			",77,15,1,3,6,1,4

												This used to be a good game, but because of overfishing you can now barely catch anything right now.  What makes it worse is that now Sega has post some restriction on when you can actually play this game.  If I am correct you are able to play this game between June 5 and July 4.  After the so called fishing season, the game is locked.  Complaining in Steam Support has not helped me at all.  Buy it at your own risk or wait until the fish population is stabilized.

												That game you like? Yes, that one. The one that you sorted into favorites in your steam library. It's terrible and objectively so. Okay, that game's actually subjectively terrible, but only in the light of SEGA Bass Fishing™. SEGA Bass Fishing™ has lore so deep and replayability so seemless that I am literally dumbfounded by the now gleaming short comings of every other game ever created. Like Atari games of old, anything played after SEGA Bass Fishing™ will now appear as a waste of time and a thing of the past. Which was wasted. Because like, it was time you spent playing something other than  SEGA Bass Fishing™.			",258,54,11,27,9,2,30

												Classic Sega game.  But it's instantly clear that this game was made for arcades. The timer adds a little challenge but since you can continue your game with the press of a button after the timer has run out there's no point in having it there to begin with. They should've removed it completely, or should've made a different mode for it for those people who do actually enjoy it.. Then again, console ports weren't treated the same as they are treated these days so I willjust forgive them ;)And besides, the port isn't really all that poor, it still holds up but the control scheme is also classic Sega and makes absolutely no sense. But, it's playable with a little practice.If you're a fishing fan, you basically have no other choice. There aren't that many fishing games out there. But Sega Bass Fishing would be a solid choice.

												Man this game brings me back to the days when I was a kid and the entramce to walmart was a cool place to check out! Got this game as part of the Dreamcast collection in a bundle for $1 and this game alone made it worth it seeing as I probably spent more than $20 on it as a kid.But the game has the  Original mode which has the tournaments and other modes like practice fishing and then it has the arcade mode that puts me right in the nostaliga of growing up in the 90s and early 00s without having to a spend a buck every coupe of minutes. This game is just clean fun looks the same as it did and how it should considering its a game from the 90s I play on a game pad and the controls are easy but the game still has enough of a challenge to make you want to play it though it can and does get boring after a while I would say it would be a fun game to play for you and a younger kid even if you don't really like fishing this game is still enjoyable.

												This game reminds me of Bill Dance meets Cabella's. While most definitly not Cabella's, it does have that feel to it, as a more inexpensive alternative, I would recommend it if you enjoy sports fishing games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Think fishing is boring? Think again.You probably got this game just by buying the Dreamcast Collection and never tried it, but maybe you should! The fish AI is kind of infuriating at times (though I guess that's just realism), but this game has that Sega arcade flair to it that can make even fishing a thrill ride. Give it a shot, you'll not be disappointed.			",230,72,5,12,10,2,12

												Nostalgia shades on! I remember sinking so many hours (and lures) in this game when I was younger, and this is definitely a very good port of the original Dreamcast version, but admittedly I was used to playing an earlier PC port so the Dreamcast controls felt a bit off.Okay. You fish. For bass. Sounds boring, right? Wrong. This game holds up so well and has definitely stood the test of time. I have tried other fishing games but none have ever captured the original magic. Graphics... who cares? It still looks pretty good even by today's standards. And then there's the music. All the original tracks are there and it was like the ultimate blast from the past.... Surprisingly, I haven't lost my knack for a game I haven't played in several years. So... that's something?Normally I try to write a balanced review and try to find something I can complain about, but... I can't on this occasion. Simple premise, great execution, great soundtrack... okay, maybe one thing. A few extra game modes would have been nice, such as a challenge mode, but that's hardly a real gripe when this is reliving the nostalgia of my childhood.Love fishing? Go for it. Even if you don't, at least you don't have to contend with real-world weather to haul in your big catch.One final note... it's gonna be a BIIIIIIIIG ONE.LOWER THE ROD!			",86,17,0,11,12,0,6

												A wonderful fishing game that really brings you back to the Dreamcast system. The controls are the only obstacle of this game. The gameplay is awesome because you can catch a fish every-time casting out. It has a single player campaign that lets you catch alot of fish for the Tournament standings. There are really big fish and little ones to be caught but all will be a challenge if you dont know how to handle the reel right. The graphics are great for this type of game. It puts you in control of everything and lets you see into the water to catch the fish you want. The music in game is old school and fun. The overall game is great and if your into fishing this is a must buy when seeing it on sale. Ive loved playing it in my spare time and I know you will too.			",3029,1131,139,313,429,33,475

												A ten year old trolling simulator. Playing this game is on the same level as a madden game from a decade ago. It does nothing unique and kind of feels pointless, I can only recommend this game to the very small number of people who regard this game in high nostalgic esteem. Fishing is a minigame and should be an aside for games like Breath of Fire 4 or Sonic Adventure, the latter of which is a magnificent example of a game from that time period that still holds up.

												good fishing simulation game, but this an old game, if you love complex fishing, don't pick this one. the old reel fishing and fisherman's bait on PS1 is still betterthe game just about > select lure, select tackle point, and reel> u get fish, then only 2 option fish or miss,> turn down , turn left, turn right, reel and hold> after that they measure your fish > and repeatall modes different only in time of playing> arcade mode, play with limited time> original mode, (or i can say) championship mode/career mode total 15-20 minutes per stages  and you can get sonic lure from here LOL > practice, yeh practice, try some lures and different placesI'm not recommended this game because, it's really simple game-and repeatable, but I admit the game still good as port from old dreamcast.

												""Just as exciting as real fishing! So basically, terrible."" 5/10I imagine this game is a lot like fishing while sober. And that's not a good thing. I don't even want to go fishing when I'm drunk, let alone when I'm sober, so you can imagine how I feel about this gem. It's almost as if the creators of this old Dreamcast game wanted to see if they could actually make fishing less exciting than it already is. Well, if that was their goal then they succeeded with flying colors. At least with real fishing you have the satisfaction of wrestling and eventually catching a real live fish. But here? It's barely a challenge at all. And wrestling with a 360 controller or keyboard looks awfully stupid. And I'm not sure about any of you, but I've gone fishing a few times, and it sure as heck wasn't easy.I know a lot of people here have strong feelings for this game dating back to their formative years when the Sega Dreamcast was the best thing ever invented. And that's all fine and dandy. God knows I love a lot of terrible games simply because they bring back fond memories of days since forgotten. But I never played this game when I was a child, so I don't share the same feelings for this steaming pile of nostalgia. Pick your lure, cast your line, and catch a fish, that's really all there is to this game. And I know that's what it's supposed to be, being a fishing game and all, but I mean, come on, give me a little more of a challenge.Okay, well, I guess I could see this being somewhat fun in the arcade with a fake fishing pole and an artificial reel and whatnot. But on the Dreamcast or with a 360 controller or keyboard, this game is just terrible. You may get a glimmer of fun out of it when you reel in that first fish of yours, but shortly after that you'll be shutting it off for something more challenging. And I dare you to make it to the end of the 'regular mode', because it's painfully long and repetitive. The only redeeming quality about this game is when the announcer yells out 'Fish!' when you first catch one, much like the announcer in 'Mortal Kombat' yells 'Fight!' before every match.
