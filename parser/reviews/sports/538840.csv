												I've enjoyed my experience in this game thus far. It reminds me a lot of I am Bread since they both are humorous game about traversing through an environment with a ragdoll-like protagonist. It's a little more linear than I am Bread in the sense that there pretty much only one direction to go, but this allows the player to get into a groove where they can just move quickly across the map without having to stop and figure out where they're going.The only game mechanic I have problems with is electricity. In one of the earlier levels there is a cut cable that will kill you if you touch it while it's sparking. I've found that it only kills you half the time and it seems to work at random. I'm not sure if that's because the game is in 2.5D and I just so happen to its side or what.My only suggestion is that an option be added that lets you free both of your hands without losing. It would be fun to propel yourself upwards or catch yourself if you start to fall off of a tower.I can tell the developer really cares about this game and isn't just some hack trying to make a quick buck. I look forward to future updates in the game, as well as future projects from the creator. I think you've really put your best foot forward with this game, great job.			",218,40,4,24,22,3,41

												Great Game, as many have said already, it's like a combo of Mount your Friends and I am Bread. I love the fact that this game is done all by one person. It's already more solid then most tripple A games. However, grabbing things in this game is quite annoying. I mean I was stretching for things, the plus sign comes up and I let go of the bumper and he lets the arm fall then I let go with the other hand and bing bada boom I'm at the start again. I think I said ""grab it you ****"" about 374 times. Also grabbing onto bars and then not being able to reach the next one because you grabbed the other side of it was awkward to deal withAll in all, solid game, love it and I'm glad this guy's body is flexible enough to go through bars.

City Climber is a short but very entertaining physics game. The music is catchy, although loops a little on longer levels and the controls are well implemented, allowing both controller and mouse input depending your preference. I like to use the mouse as it allows precise movement of the arms, left and right mouse buttons control grip for their repsective hands.The game isn't very long, it currently has 14 levels which are somewhat replayable due to a speed runners leaderboard and also a challenge mode which has 3 challenges spread across 30 stages (3x10). I wouldn't recommend for anyone looking for a lengthy experience but it has allot of charm, is well polished and the controls are allot of fun to grapple with.There is also a character customiser where you can change the colour of your character and also add various headwear such as pirate hats and spy glasses, these are unlocked as you progress through the game.There is multiplayer support, the story mode (14 levels) has a co-op mode where two players each control an arm. You need two controllers for this, one can use mouse whilse the other uses a pad. There is also turn based party play where up to four people take turns to plough through the levels in a hope to out pace their friends. It's a nice addition to have multiplayer in the game and it adds some replayability.All in all I recommend the game, it's cheap and chearful but could benefit from some workshop support.

												This game is amazing, you can even be a ninja climbing... well. Trying to climb a building to save a kitty. The Co-Op is very fun, although be careful that the other is done before you try to grab the next step, this game is great!!! And cheap, I recommend this, for anyone			",38,4,0,3,8,0,2

												Cool idea, a 2.5D climbing game (3D graphics, but you're basically climbing in a 2D space).However, one thing ruins the game for me personally; as soon as both your hands are not grabbed onto something, the game is over, wihout giving you a chance to catch yourself.This makes climbing a slow and careful procedure, which is weird for a game running on a timer scoreboard.I'd give this game a 4/10 in its current state.I'll still recommend this game, as some people may not be bothered as much as me by this one problem.

												This game has a slight learning curve, but once you get it, it's a lot of fun. Found myself laughing a lot at the sheer silliness of it all. Great for a SP challenge, as a fun little game. Or there's some good modes for MP here too. Plus the guy developed it all on his own, and I play games from entire teams that aren't this good. So he get's props for that IMO.Some gameplay if you want to see it in action:

												I hate to have to give this game a downvote but, my experience with the game (no matter how little) was horrible. The climbing was attrocious, the random and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t areas where if you hold on it falls off, and the absolute abominabal way the ragdoll gets stuck everywhere. The controls are terrible the way you have to move him about with a mouse is ungodly bad and broken. The levels are incredibly short and never seems to amaze me. I hate giving this game a down vote but please, this game is just not worth 7 bucks nor if it were to be on sale.			",55,6,3,2,4,1,0
