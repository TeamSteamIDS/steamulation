Early Access Review
								Amazing twitchy game. The game is based on bringing an orb from the center of the map and throwing it in the other teams goal, located several platforms away. Doing so gives you a seed which you plant on the platforms to provide powerups. All players are provided a rifle which propels players shot, both teammates and enemies, which, when used properly, leads to an very interesting gameplay. The developers are very forward sometimes join games in progress, which is nice and helps make the small community better. The only negative is the small community, which is something I hope goes away over time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								If you like LAZORS, Flying through the air and balls, you'll love this game. Action-packed game with constant battles for the ball and land possesion. Never a dull moment with this game. Form a group with some friends, start a team, develop tac-tics and play agains the people of the game, or sign up for the frequent community tournaments. Or play by yourself with whoever else is online. Cool consept, amazingly well executed, awesome design and great gameplay. Really cool game, loads of updates, still in alpha and still the best game I've played in months!Not enough people own it!			",181,22,4,14,14,2,15

												With an already fantastic concept for a game, the developers of this have put so much effort into polishing its mechanics to perfection. With tight and satisfying movement, wonderful controls and very focussed design, this has the potential to be at the top of any list of arena shooters. It has a few major flaws however, chief among which is that it is quite badly explained and it takes a very long time to work out what is actually going on. It also has the incredibly unfortunate issue of having almost nobody playing it any more, which is a darn shame considering how amazing this game can be. You can still play it with bots, but the AI is too stiff to last more than a few matches before becoming boring. That said, the feeling of movement alone is what compelled me to keep playing for quite a while longer than the bots deserved. Annoyingly, its only major flaw is something of a vicious cycle; there aren't enough people playing it, therefore nobody will play it, making the whole thing worse. At the time of writing, it is on sale for next to nothing; I urge anyone reading this to buy it, get a few friends to buy it too, try it out and share it as much as possible. Even if it isn't to your tastes, the best thing that can be done for this game right now is to be shared.			",270,36,3,18,42,1,28

												A seriously great game, FPS + ball sport + hackslash + jumping.Negetive points, no popularity... i dont know why but no servers see the face of more then 4/5 people.If this games gets a bit attention this might create a chaos in the field of MP games.Everything is okay but a little graphics and in game effect/function/item tuning might turn up the heat a little bit more.I can spend hundreads of hour on this cheap game if there were only more people playing it.

Early Access Review
								So I really liked this game when it first came out. One of my friends got a 4-pack during the free weekend and we all played a few hours. 3 days later the community was dead and there was nobody on any of the servers. I've been thinking about why this happened.First of all,  the player has only 3 weapons- the projectile weapon (rocket launcher), the railgun (sniper weapon), and melee. Out of the 6 plants that players can plant on captured platforms, only the turret and the ramp are useful in most situations. This severely limits the player's playstyle and makes the overall game less interesting.Secondly, because the three combat options are hitting a fast moving enemy with your fist while moving very fast, shooting a fast moving enemy with a projectile weapon with a tiny area of effect, or sniping a fast moving enemy without any sort of scope there will be a huge skill gap. New players will have a very hard time actually doing anything, so they won't want to stick around. The only way to get better is to practice.This brings me to my third point; you can't practice because there is nobody to practice against. Most of the time, there are zero players on. The only time anyone is on is for the weekly dev game and the occasional password-protected tournament match.Also, a lot of the maps aren't much fun to play. The only good maps are the ones with ball spawn areas that are much lower than the goals. Putting the ball spawn lower down makes it easily accessible from multiple routes, making it harder to camp the ball. It also makes it easier to defend because the ball carrier has to climb all the way up to the goal. On a flat map, one team gets to the ball first, camps there, and can easily hold off the other team while they send one player to zip across the map with a powerup and score instantly over and over again.To the devs- I still think this game is very promising. If you can update it to make it more diverse and suitable for multiple playstyles and narrow the skill gap, then get it featured on the store frontpage with a sale you might be able to build a lasting player base.

												What a wonderful game, but the sad fact is the community didn't stick around for too long.Epigenesis is a very interesting title. It's a sports game mixed with fast paced parkour FPS. The goal is simple, you go to the center of the arena to capture a ball which you need to take to the opposite side of the arena and score goals, after each goal you get a seed which is used to set up boosters, defense systems and turrets to fight alongside with you. When you plant the final seed on the opposing hoop the game is instantly won.The title looks alright for the most part and maxed out it runs almost perfectly, apart from some slight FPS drops when the action gets too fast.The arenas are built so you have to jump around platforms to get to where you need to go and sometimes the jumping is really tough to control, sometimes you miss your mark and sometimes you go overboard.The game has a single player mode which has five arenas to play through and you can choose how many bots are on the arena on your team and on the opposing team. This game is great and is a ton of fun too, but there is one major flaw and that the game is completely dead. Unless you have a friend to play alongside with you except to play solo only. The game alone is still pretty fun, but with people it would be even wore fun.I would love to recommend this game to everyone, but unless you have a friend willing to play this with you, there's no point in buying just for solo play as you will play through every arena in an hour.Final Rating:5/10 - Buy it if you have friends who play itIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on why you disliked the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

Early Access Review
												Epigenesis	*Note: The game is in early access and is still being worked on. Everything said in this review is subject to change.	           Epigenesis is a first person frantic shooter. The game was released on Steam as an early access game on November 1, 2013. Now you would expect an early access game that's only in its alpha stage, would have some issues but believe it or not, this game is pretty well set. This doesn't mean that the game is perfect, there are a few issues, but nothing that stops you from enjoying this game.	So what exactly is Epigenesis? Well its a first person shooter, but it has much more than your average shooter. Your main goal as the player is to grab the ball and throw it into the other teams gate. This then gives your team a point, as well as a power up. Power ups add let you modify the map. You can do all sorts of stuff including adding another path or causing a tornado. If somebody has the ball and they fall over the edge, but don't manage to pass it to another player, the ball resets. It is also possible to intercept the ball from the enemy. This makes the person who has the ball have a reason to score quickly. The game also has pickups which allow you to be more mobile. Now, if you have the ball, you're all set for the most part. Your main problem is not jumping to your death. Trying to shoot the enemy players when they have the ball is quite difficult. I found that using the rapid fire weapon was very ineffective, however, using the rail gun, I was able to get some shots on people. The game, currently, only has two weapons(as of 12/7/13). This is a little disappointing because a variety of weapons would add a variety of strategies. The rail gun itself does no damage, it can either push or pull somebody if you land a hit. The rapid fire gun is your damage dealing gun, but it's very difficult to hit somebody. The player can move quickly and unpredictably. This is both good and bad. Its good because it keeps you safe, but, its bad because if your shooting you had better be a good shot. This does add challenge and excitement to the game, especially when your able finally get a connected shot. 	Epigenesis adds different froms of challenge and fun through its unique maps. The maps are made up of a variety of floating square surfaces and building tops. You jump from panel to panel, trying to reach the ball first, usually is located in the center. Some maps offer launch pads which send you flying across the map and onto another panel(picture above shows a player being launched). This can be used as an escape route, and offensive route, or just extra fun. When you grab this ball, you can't shoot, so you have to rely on running. With the multiple pickups and launch pads, you can make your way to score a goal with no problem, that is until somebody gets a good shot on you and sends you off the map. But, if this happens, the ball and you simply re-spawn, after a short countdown, at the designated spots, and you continue playing. 	The game only has one game mode(as of 12/7/13) which is to grab the ball and send it through the enemy’s gate. This still offers plenty of fun and hours of entertainment. Eventually though the same thing gets a bit old, but I feel that the developers will add more, remember the game is only in alpha. There is one problem that puts a damper on things, the lack of players. The game allows for 5v5 matches, however the biggest I have even been involved in is a 4v3. This, however, is not a permanent issue. I have only seen three servers on my game, but once the game is closer to actual release, there will more than likely be plenty of servers, and people. Most of the time I am able to get into a match that is 2v2. This does restrict what this game truly has to offer. If you have ever played Quake you will know that more people equals more fun. The developers were trying to make their own “Quake style” game. 	Epigenesis is something you should look out for. Unlike these new shooters that have been the same for the past 5 games, this game is unique and contains countless hours of fun. Since the game is only in alpha there are still many more advancements that can take place in this game. The good part about it being an early access game is that the developers will listen to the community and respond to what players say. If you love fast paced games like Quake, or just want to try something new, Eigenesis should be on your wishlist as soon as your done reading this review.for more great reviews visit http://kingsjelly.tumblr.com/ ",103,4,9,6,18,1,6

Decent game with a poor community.Epigenesis is, in the world of science “the unfolding development in an organism, and in particular the development of a plant, fungus or animal from a seed, spore or egg through a sequence of steps in which cells differentiate and organs form”. Basically we’re talking about how plants grow.Epigenesis in the world of games however is a very different beast, but no less fascinating. It is a five-a-side sport of the future that blends basketball with bright, Tron-like neons and couples it with grotesque, map-devouring plants that can also shoot lasers. Yes, your sudden curiosity is deserved. Okay, It is time to discuss the most important things.Goal: The goal of Epigenesis is to take the ball from the middle of the level and throw it through the goal that is on the enemy’s side of the map. Simple, huh? Doing so will cause you to be sent back to your side of the map with a seed of your choice to go and plant somewhere on the level. Plants can only be planted on a platform that is either connected to another platform with a plant on it already, or your starting platform. You will win the match when you are able to plant a seed of any kind on the opponent’s starting platform.Weapons: Weapons are non lethal in Epigenesis, and will instead push or pull people depending on your setting in the customization screen. You can also punch people which will send them flying, and will also take the ball from them if they’re an enemy. This can be used to your advantage by pushing enemies off of platforms and giving your team a boost while they are in the air.Jumping: Instead of just simply jumping, there’s a few differences to it in Epigenesis. It is possible to double jump at anytime, and there is even a chargeable jump that you can do at any time, and it is even possible to double jump with charged jumps as well.Maps: The maps that you will be playing on are basically a lot of platforms that are floating in the air along with larger platforms that allow the planting of seeds. Differences between maps are generally just the layout of the platforms, but some have mechanics about them that others don’t such as jump pads that will send you flying from one platform to another, or even a tornado that appears that will lift anyone up who passes through it.Powerups: Spread out on the maps you can find powerup spawners where you can pick up a one time use ability. You can save them to be used any time and there are three of them for you to use. A hook ability lets you shoot out a line that will attach itself to the ground around where you are aiming and will drag you to that spot. The speed boost ability will give you a sudden jolt of speed that will send you speeding away in the direction you are facing. A repulsion ability will bounce away all enemies that are surrounding you.So it was not that sweetening the game at every turn, this game has one terrible drawback, not large community.Summary: Therefore the question arises whether you (read: me) should buy this game?Yes, it definitely is worth the price. And if you have friends who are happy to play with you, persuade them to do the same.Also, this game reminds me of the animated series, that calls itself Galactik Football, which of its time I loved.

The arenas aesthetically resemble something out of Tron but play like something out of Quake.

And when I say ""dead,"" I don't mean ""there are a few full servers,"" I mean there are two or three people playing the multiplayer at any given time. It's disheartening, because playing against the AI only provides a challenge until you're out-thinking and out-pacing them, and with a complete lack of single-player campaign, its appeal only lasts for so long before you're wanting something richer. I only got to play a single match against real people, and it wasn't even a full house -- there were four people (two on each team) with the other six slots filled by AI. I'm sure that if I'd gotten to play more of the multiplayer component I would have enjoyed Epigenesis way more, but unfortunately, that's what often happens with Early Access titles: people play them obsessively for a few weeks or months and move on, and then when the game comes out nobody is still playing it.THE VERDICTEpigenesis is a strong case for why e-sports doesn't necessarily have to be entirely composed of the likes of League of Legends and Unreal Tournament. It is, unfortunately, a product of the all-too-common disease I have taken to calling ""Early Access Syndrome,"" in which a game's community is essentially non-existent on official release. I'd stay away unless you're buying the four-pack with the intention to play with other people you know, or are content playing against bots -- not because it's a bad game, but because the community just does not exist.

Early Access Review
								This game is awesome. If anyone has played Halo Reach, Halo 3 or even just watched Red VS Blue, chances are you will ahve memories of Grifball. This is Grifball on steroids. This is everything you wanted out of Grifball. This is the Grifball standalone. But dont just think of this game as Grifball, this game has more potential than your mother ever thought you had. This game is early access so there are some bugs and some things to be improved such as including East and West US dedicated servers (This is being worked in but is hard as the game is based out of Europe). When people hear ""Early Access Game"" they think not ready or not enjoyable or possibly not even interesting. This proves those people wrong. The amasing thing about this game being Early Access is that it can only get better and go up from here.			",121,6,3,4,5,4,2

												I selfishly want to recommend this game just to try to get more people to play to actually experience what it could be because I really liked the idea and feel. But, I cannot.I became enamored with the game over a free weekend. The sparsely populated servers with people as new and clueless as me made the game seem fun and the three-something dollar price tag appealing. I bit. Over the course of the next week or two the population disappeared. But I was able to learn the nuances of the game and navigate the not-steep, but completely unexplained, learning curve thanks to spotty appearances of other players. This made the game seem fun all over again. Over the following weeks I became comfortable with the game and really enjoyed the few times another human was actually on a server. Some players were better, a lot were as lost as I previously was.But in the end, I never witnessed a game larger than 2v3. Morning, noon or night. Any day of the week. Any server from West to East to Europe to Asia. There just isn't people playing this game. Perhaps some games just shouldn't be open betas or 'Early Access'? People were done and bored before it had legs. Or perhaps other issues are really holding it back.The learning curve isn't hard but requires other players to actually learn. There's documentation of what items do or how to prime your two jumps. But nothing about the useful ways to use the items, tactics to employ, using momentum from items/jumps/enemy fire, etc. All things you can only learn with a live enemy. And I still feel like I only really learned how to play 1v1 and what tactics to use in that situation because that's all I ever got to regularly.The devs have an idea of what they believe gameplay *should* be like if you read around the web some. In the perfect world all the servers would be 5v5 and somebody would be playing ""goalie"" and people would pass the ball. Combine those Ideas with the game that really does feel smooth and man that sounds great!But the dead community means you'll rarely see 5v5 or in my case; never. I tried to play ""goalie"" in a 2v2 after I had read about the concept on a forum. But it's just not a logical choice to do when you aren't realistically going to stop many chances.And passing? That would make the game that much more interesting but the speed of the players (especially once powerups are planted) makes that a colossal undertaking to time correctly. And because of this, nobody ever expects a pass. I never witnessed anybody else even attempt one. I could go on and on. Its a great concept that is fairly polished and fun in theory. But has a dead community and suffers from a multitude of other problems. I could never recommend it even at the price I paid much less it's regular price. My twenty-plus hours of play consists of maybe five with other players and maybe three of those five hours was ""competitive"" play rather than goofing around. The vast majority of my play time was spent alone achievement hunting. The bots are awful.If it gets lots of people suddenly, better maps (another issue I didn't delve into), and one or two other things I forgot to whine about... And it's like $0.99USD. Consider it.

												It's hard to play this game because of the lack of other people who play it. But that one time, when you find a server that has 1 or 2 other people on, and you join it, it is some of the best gameplay I ever had. The game has an interesting gamestyle, almost like  basketball, but with low gravity, and guns. Something great about this game is that the guns don't actually kill you, they just push you, causing you to fall off the edge. This face-paced game, despite the lack of players, is very fun. I'm almost always smiling, or laughing when playing this game, there just needs to be more people who play it.			",74,8,1,4,3,0,2

								Top notch game if you like hectic twitch shooters combined with teamplay and a hint of strategy. Fast paced combat with a hitscan railgun and projectile based rocket gun in a low gravity platform environment where one wrong move and you fall to your death. All of this mixed with the ball scoring gameplay and the seed system, allowing you to shape the battlefield with various types of offensive/defensive plants and give your team passive bonuses.Devs are great guys and always open to suggestions, and organize a night where they all come on to play with people on Sunday nights. The game doesn't have a huge playerbase right now which is why servers are often empty, but it definitely deserves a chance.Oh yeah and its £6.99, so you can't really lose.			",414,50,2,44,28,5,47

			Video created on version: 0.158 Epigenesis: Impressions In this video take a look Epigenesis, an early access indie, FPS, platform sports multiplayer game.		

This is my video impression of EpigenesisThe game features some interesting mechanics, some beautiful graphics and good sound design. It has tons of potential, but for the time being, the community is virtually non-existent. as a multiplayer only game, this is a big problem.I have to be honest and vote no for the recommendations for the time being. Hopefully in the future, I can change that vote, as i hope the community will grow and thrive			",1483,525,23,180,133,13,163

												I find this game to be fun, however the lack of variety in maps can get a bit boring.The AI is very derpy on easy mode, to the point where it just jumps off any platform it can find, and the harder difficulty AI isn't any smater either. I have noticed, however, that the AI tends to take a very linear path EVERY TIME and there is no variety in the movement whatsoever, so calling the opponent and AI seems a bit too generous.The graphics are okay, but they aren't spectacular. This game isn't the best compared to most other football-like games, but it's still worth a go if you like feeling superior against an AI that seems like it's been programmed by a 5 year old who thinks he's entitles but you're just like ""ha, no"" and push him down because the TV remote is yours and he goes off crying to your mum with them fake tears and your mum patronises him and you're just there like ""oh, what a wonderful life"".Epigenesis - Like taking the TV remote from a 5 year old.

												First person future sport type game that plays smoothly and is a lot of fun - but as with many online multiplayer games, you probably need to bring your own teammates and opponents rather than rely on pickup games as the game servers usually seem pretty empty.The game is well designed - it is easy to pick up and play, and the concept is very simple - grab the ball and get near enough to the enemy ""basket"" and take your shot. The opponents will be trying the same thing, and using their weapons to try and knock you you off the platforms before you get there. While you are carrying the ball you can't shoot back, and have to rely on your teammates clearing your path, or maybe a lot of like and well timed dodges.The weapons in the game don't do damage they just push you, and there are a few variants - long range, medium range, and area/explosive types can be chosen at the start of each game, and you can switch between two modes for each as you like (in a more focused/powerful attack, or in more area affect but less impactful attack). You also have two different jump/jet pack modes - double jump and charged jump, that are attached to the weapon choices, although this could be annoying if your preferred weapon mode is attached to a jump mode that doesn't suit your playstyle). This leads to some fun and frantic gameplay where at any moment seemingly on the way to a certain score you can go flying into the air and have to try and spot a landing, or maybe quickly try and adjust your aim and launch a ""Hail Mary"" before you get too far from the basket before falling to your doom (and then respawning a few seconds later). Scoring a goal gives the scorer a seed to plant, which has three options to chose from, out of a selection of bonuses such as putting down a mortar or turret, a ramp making it easier to move towards the enemy basket, or a shield that covers most of the platform (possibly some more that I didn't notice). Each option also has a side effect of boosting the team stats a bit - making you jump higher, run slightly faster, or have more control while in the air. While an interesting addition that can significantly affect the later minutes of each game, it does seem like it makes games tend towards being more one sided as it means the team that starts well and scores early get more advantages, and are more likely to keep extending their lead.

								When I still lived in the UK, about a year ago I went to the gadget show live (big gadget convention based on a tv show). They had this thing called Make Something Unreal 2012 where they invited people from universities to make games using the unreal engine. The finalists (there were four) were having demonstrations and they set about 16 gaming pcs up for us to test the game. It was in really early alpha at that stage and it still is alpha, but of the four games there was no doubt this was by far the best. I voted for this game by Dead Shark Triple Punch (awesome name) and it won the most votes in the end. If I were to explain it, it'd be something like, sport basketball of the future with low gravity, genetically engineered plants that give you bonuses the more goals you score, jetpacks, fast paced awesomeness and guns that don't harm but knockback. graphic style is kind of like super moday night combat, or team fortress 2.

								Awesome game. Even though it is still in development and I only played it for a few hours on the free weekend event, I found it really fun and it gave me an amazing Quake feel. Do you remember those Quake maps filled with jump pads and death pits? Hell yes! The major problem I have with Epigenesis is with my ping, wich can be a pain in the *ss when I'm playing against people with 5 to 10 ping while mine is varying betwen 57 to 70. Besides that I can firmly say that every play you do in a match, whether it is a well timed jump, pushing somebody off of the platform, scoring for your team or whatever else you manage to do right, it is all super enjoyable and even when you do screw up it can be fun while not being heavily punished for it. Unfortunately I missed the sale :( but next time it'll be a sure purchase ;)			",254,44,4,33,16,0,22

								Firstly, it's in fair shape for an early access, and it's had a good update history, so don't be scared away by that. It does start with some wonky graphics settings, but after adjusting them it looks and plays pretty well, and many of the astetics (like the hideous alpha-style menus) will likely be fixed as more polish is added to the game.Now, onto the game itself. It remindes me a lot of a ball game mode from Unreal Tournament concept wise. It essentially uses shoot mechanics in a hoop and ball game similar to soccer (football), however it leans more heavely on the sports side of the shooter-sports hybrid. It is a high flying, high speed, and it does suffer a bit from a lack of feedback on landings and jump hieghts, but that forces you to pay attention to both the game and the platforms (I'd recomend using the highest FOV settings to help), as falling to your death is a constant threat. There are a lot of deep mechanics and power ups that make this game very strategic and competetive; It probably has the potental to compete with CS:GO's competitive scene. Over all, I would recomend this to someone who dislikes CoD style shooters but enjoyed the interesting gamemodes from old competitive games like Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike, and Quake Arena.

The game is easy to learn but the reason i wouldn't recommend this game is the fact that the servers are empty...

								Quake III +Rugby - the contact because everyone is armed with futuristic Weapons.  A good place to start for people new to first person shooters, as it will give you an unobstructed view as you learn to lead moving targets, and where to aim when you are also moving.  There's plenty here for more advanced shooters too.  You will need to formulate strategies against a continuously moving foe in order to advance the ball and hopefully, eventually score. For the defending side its a matter of preventing the other team from scoring, and gaining control of the ball for your team. There are several different races to choose from, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages all of which need to be taken into account as you advance the ball or try to take it from your opponent.The game can be played either solo or online. If playing solo you will be playing the lower level games against two bots and will have one bot as a team mate. If you play online you will be matched with players of similar ability to the degree that is possibe (during off hours there may not be a very large pool of people available and the ability levels of opponents may become quite disperate).I can't say that this game will be for everyone, if it becomes available for a free weekend then definitely give it a go, or if it goes on sale and you are a fan of FPS and of team sport, then definitely drop the cash for this one.

								I'd really love to see this game finished. Cant wait for the community to become bigger. Otherwise, a game with very interesting mechanics. It involves taking a ball and scoring it. Its something like rugby, but with guns. You can score airshots I believe, just like in Quake/TF2. There are also power-ups in some locations where you can pick up and use them to your advantage.

								(Be in mind this is early access)I hope you are good at parkour and avoiding hitscan bullets, because thats what this game is. You have 3 ""weapons"" to defend yourself. A area of effect launcher, a ""sniper"" weapon, and your fist, which can knock a player halfway across the map.The launcher is easy to hit people with if you are close or they are coming at you, moving though? Forgot about it. The Sniper is good if you can hit people with it, but as I am not a sniper, I cannot say anythingYour fist seems to be the overpowered hand of god though, as you can instantly knock people out with it if they are even slightly erring. The object of the game is to get a ball in the middle of a bunch of floating platforms, and throw it into the enemies net, sounds easy right?Not really, as this game is not newbie friendly, the older players will rofl stomp for every time, until you get better. I used to play this game all the time on a different account, but I could never get very good. If you DO buy it, stick with it until you get good.But if you CAN parkour (theres lots) and you CAN aim (lots too) then you should buy this game, but for the ordinary person, I would not recommend it. Be in mind the devs are really active and update a lot. Since it is early access it will get loads better.I give it a 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I had fun watching the vids and couldn't wait to play it!When I first learned how to play, the controls were easy to understand and the playstyle really interesting. The graphics and the sounds effect on the game are without a doubt amazing. All the sound effect on this game makes us feel like a badass. Strong music with violent effect really feels awesome!  The biggest issue of this game, which puts this game with a score of 8/10, is the community. In fact, when I bought the game and wanted to play online the community was inexistent. Not even a single server had 1 player in it, I was playing alone on all of those servers. Watching all those vid seemed like the game was HUGE, but really it's not that big and in fact one of the smallest community I have ever seen. Hopefully, the community will grow and we will be able to play a real 6v6 match.Despite the fact that theres not a bunch of weapon variety, this game is fun to play with all the weapons. The maps seems ok but I couldn't really appreciate it at there full potential since the lack of the cummunity. Seeds how ever, are an amazing aspect of this game, making the maps customizable and also allowing player to create some fun strategies throughout the game. In the end, the game is really promissing, really fun to play. But the only way to really appreciate the game would be having a larger community. I recommend this game to any fps player who love a challenging game.			",107,16,5,9,5,4,14

								Not fun. The jump is extremely delayed, even once you figure out you charge the jump, it doesn't always go right away. It jump when fully charged seems to change in how high it boosts you. When you use the thing that boosts you up, you cant jump even though you use a jetpack like thing?  I haven't played it much but in a game where movement is so important, the difficulty i had moving around made this not fun during my time playing it. I'm a fan of twitch shooters but this game just isn't fun.			",73,10,1,4,20,0,10

								If you fondly remember Ricochet then you will feel right at home with Epigenesis, a graphically-modern future-sport with much much more.  Two small teams bouncing around platforms, struggling to pay attention to the other players as the beautiful maps distract so easily.  Then you see some plants popping up on platforms around you as players start scoring.  Hold on, plants? in a future sports first-person shooter?!  Yep and they are what makes the game something really truly unique.  Each plant provides actual physical objects that either buff such as speed boosts, air control, shields, they provide new ledges (actually changing the playing area), turrets, mortars, and more!  The game already feels really unique as you could coordinate a variety of different team playstyles but I am just imagining even more plants and drooling at the mouth with the variety! The sweet juicy variety!This game is really original and fun it just needs more players!  Get on this weekend, log in to a server.  There will be tons of people playing on Saturday and Sunday for sure!  You will NOT be disappointed.			",245,43,4,31,34,1,50

It must be haunted.. If you're reading this.. I probably didn't make it either.O c t .  6    They're coming for me .. those monsters .. I cant stand the silence anymore .. I just want it to end .. Oh no! Th-they're com-coming..! Help M-me!  Plea_ ___ s //_ e!BUT SERIOUSLY ITS A GREAT GAME.			",62,5,2,7,3,1,10

								While SmashBall is about having nerves of steel and fulfilling your chosen role, Epigenesis is more of a thinking man's game. It's strategic action, it's truly a sport with original (as far as I've seen) game mechanics, and it avoids feeling like a team deathmatch that has Those-Objectives-That-Mean-Nothing. Pick up the ball from the center and throw it through the enemy's gate, and you earn a seed to customize. Bring it safely to an uncaptured node, and you will earn a team bonus and a structure of your choosing.Personally, I prefer ramps with an air control team bonus (Option 2 of Loadout 1) so that my teammates and I have vantage points, can advance across the field faster, can dodge and pursue enemies better, and avoid falling as often. And I really want extreme air control with ramps everywhere, so I focus on the objective and work with people. That way I can separate myself from multiple pursuers if I run back to my side of the field, take a ramp, and change direction to fool the remainder who anticipate the ramp getting used. Oh, best part yet? Take a seed to the enemy's gate with a neighboring node under your control, and you will instantly win the game for your team.Fun? Yes. Recommended? Yes. I'd join the official Epigenesis group if you're looking to buy it; a little community effort and a few new friends should help keep your games full and interesting.			",74,9,0,11,1,0,1

												At the time of writing this review, I've put little more than an hour in to the game, which may not be much to some people, but that hour was probably the most fun I've had in a game in quite a while.I'm going to start off with the bad though, and end on a good note.Hardly anyone is in the servers is the first issue, now to me, that's not much of an issue because I bought a 4-pack and play with friends, but hardly anyone else has joined the fight with us. There is a single player mode however, so if there's not people on you can battle against AI.The second thing somewhat bad is the controls, they feel a tad unresponsive at times, including jumping, but other than it being unresponsive at times, the characters do control mostly smoothly.Now on to the good.The graphics are pretty good, and I can run it at 60fps without turning much down as far as detail. Although I do have more than the recommended PC specs. At times on larger, more detailed maps, it will dip down in to the 50s or 40s, but it doesn't last long.The idea is good, and pretty well executed. It's kind of like Super Smash Bros. without the percentage building up, and in a 3D environment + basketball. You have weapons that knock people all over the place, including in the air, off ledges, and down in to the abyss. You also have a goal, which is to get the ball and throw it in to the enemies base (or hoop) and get points, the enemy is doing the same of course, so it leads to a pretty even match.Each map is timed, if you get more points than the other team by the time limit, you win. HOWEVER, that's not the only way to win. Every time you score a goal you get a seed, which you can use to plant something that can help you and your team out, in the set positions you can plant it in. If you, or your team plants every plant in their spot, you'll also win by that.I got this game while it was on sale, and got the 4-pack for $2.49, but I would highly recommend it regardless of the price. All in all, this is a good game if you've got friends to play with. If not, you may get bored of fighting against the AI all the time, but it still offers and enjoyable experience if someone joins your game, or if you join a game in progress.			",232,41,4,16,38,5,22
