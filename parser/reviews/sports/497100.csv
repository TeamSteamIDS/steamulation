Pros: PriceEasy achievementsFunNice musicNew stages are being addedCons:Music stops if you are on the same stage for a whileAchievements only unlock once you exit the gameMouse glitch at the end of some levels (but can be easily fixed)Conclusion:  I'm an achievement collector and this is basically why I bought the game, but I don't think my money was wasted, as I played the game for about 3-4 hours which is good for the price. So overall, I didn't regret it, thus it's recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros-Game can be for the first few levels-Easily obtainable achievements for you achievement hunters!-Currency systemCons-The game lacks any motive and or drive to keep playing.-The shop for currency is lackluster considering that there are only three items.- Wonky physics-Levels lack difficulty-Game breaking glitch where the game locks your cursor in the middle of the screen preventing you from going to the next level and the only way to avoid this is to ALT+TAB out and in which is a downside to anyones expirence old or young!Overall I think this game could be fun for kids under twelve or for a quick buy to waste some time getting achievements or trading cards, but, I have to say this game didn't quite hit the mark for me. So no, I don't recommend this game.			",62,3,0,1,7,1,0

												Plain old terrible.Major issues as others have stated. Music randomly stops. ZERO options. Want to change keys? Nope. Want to lower the god awful music (when it's actually playing)? NOPE. And my favourite is the cursor randomly not working. Having to alt-tab to get my cursor back just to hit ""continue"" to move to the next level. Just terrible.ONLY redeeming quaility is if you want easy achievements. 1 per completed level. Even for $1, not worth it.			",459,91,8,48,67,7,87

												Crazy Fun FootRock Could be so much better but is lacking in a lot of locations to make a recommendation fopr even a dollar worth it. The game has a Sound Bug where the song will end and will leave you playing on a silent level wondering why you did not shut the game off sooner. In 30 mins of play I Cleared about 60% of the levels. If the game had some type of Leaderboard or some type of reason to collect coins other than changing your jersey I might have recommended the game but in It's current state I cannot Recommend this game.

												At its core, this is a third person runner game.  It's a game where you collect coins, dodge football players(also being one yourself) and try to get to the end of each level.  And there are loads of levels.  Controls are easy, A and D keys to go left and right, respectively, and SPACE to jump.  There are some levels that made me do a double take.  Is it worth the less-than-a-dollar-on-sale price tag?  I think so.  Also don't let the football theme throw you off if you're not big on sports.  This game is sports themed cosmetically, but I don't know if I'd call it a sports game.I did a let's play of it.  Have a look if you'd like.

												this is a fun pointless game.no really its pointless you don't get points and you only collect coins so you can buy a blue and purple shirt. total cost 750 coins (250/500) and yes 1 coin grabbed = 1 coin earned, at about 3-10 coins per level.knowing this i still had fun its kinda like a bit.trip runner or turbo pug just not a sidescroller.the point of the game is to run a field goal as you jump and avoiding random stuff. there is no story but i suspect this is what Al Bundy dreams about.There is a bug that locks your pointer to the center of the screen when you beat a level but tabing out or hitting the windows button and bringing it back up fixes it.achievements don't register until you close the game. just putting this here for people who this may bother.

												FootRock is an alright game for achievement hunters. It's not too fun on it's own if played for any reason other than achievement hutning, and while not plagued by bugs or issues with physics (something too common in 60 cent bargain bin sale games), this game just isn't fun beyond the achievements you gain. You finish your achievements list after only about 1/3 of the total game's levels, there are no collectible-related achievements for coins. This means that all you have to do to 100% this game is progress through the levels without worrying about the coins along the way, which makes some levels substantially easier.I'm recommending this game solely on the basis that you're playing it for achievements or completionist prestige, if you are, this is a pretty fun game to play, again, I didn't feel frustrated or jipped on a lot of my deaths, and knew what I did wrong and how to correct it. It's worth the <1 hour you will put in to finish the achievements list.			",836,243,20,102,123,7,117

												A tablet game that has a feeling of wanting to do more.There is a lot to dislike here, but it is rather charming.left and right, jump, are the only controls I came across.Some variety in the enemies and obstacles.Art style is simple and goofy.Could be LOTS better...but could be way worse.
