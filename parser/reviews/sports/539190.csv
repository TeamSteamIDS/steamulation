								This is by far the most fun I've had in a VR game. It might not look that graphicly appealing at a first glance, but don't let looks fool you. I like the minimalistic style as it lets you focus more on the gameplay, which is very well suited for VR. It could be described as Rocket League in VR.I've been testing it for a week or so before the steam release and I keep coming back to play it again. I hope more people will find this gem as it is multiplayer only.			",2180,887,96,281,337,34,371

That is because there is so much more than I was anticipating.This game give me the same thrill Rocket League doesI WANT MORE CHALLENGERSSniped the ball from goal (still proud)I got mopped up by the developer (super humble nice guy)SLAM DUNKED THE DEV (once)With my new found skills mopped up some poor guy wanting a sports ball get awayScared my SO in the room due to flexing and beating my chestPlease buy this game and meet me in the arenaDON'T BE SCARED OF MY HOVERCRAFT GRENADE LAUNCHING PROWESS ",118,12,1,9,3,1,1

								This is a fun competitive game.It is relying a lot on the skills of the player, and requires you to learn how to correctly judge distance and angle needed to shoot with either bombs to knock the ball in another direction or to slow down opponents. You can even shoot the ball in a curve by adding rotation to it, which enables you to do awesome tricks to bypass your opponents defensive positions.This game is a lot of fun, but requires others to be online, so I would encourage you all to get it so we can get to play all the time :DThis game does not depend on graphics to be good. It doesn't have the graphics of a AAA game, but it does have the fun factor and replayability, which is really all that matters. I would say this game is easily worth the price tag			",168,43,4,17,33,3,24

								This game is simple to learn with many small features that add up to a great experience. It  has the cockpit view to mitigate sickness. Out of a few dozen people I've played with there were no issues of motion sickness. The dev added options to change how your pod looks in case anyone might feel uneasy.I like the skill-based play: you can curve the ball to pass to teammates or shoot or simply to get rid of it so you won't be force-respawned by the opponents. The physics-based gameplay definitely makes the core of the game.  Your grenades can be used for a variety of purposes, all for the purpose of aiding your team in scoring while preventing the other team in putting the ball in the goal.    Most of the gamplay is exploding hte grenades near hte ball to make it move, since there is no gravity.  The game can get hectic, in a good way, fast, with people racing for hte ball, others trying to slow them down and preventing them from scoring.    - Your grenades can be used to hit your teammates to give them a speed boost.   -  Grenades can hit opponents to slow them down.Grenades can redirect other grenades upon explosion and can redirectthe ball, too.     - Grenades that hit an opponent with the ball will force the opponent to respawn.    - There are big yellow boost balls to either make you move faster ormake your shots faster (both grenades and the ball).     - There are 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 options.     - There are no AI bots as the game is quite dynamic (not a simple FPS-like point and click) and would require a dedicated AI person to achieve a worthwhile experience.I have quite a few hours in this game during the beta phase helping out, though I have bought three copies (two to give out and one to give to my brother).  It's a fun game and I'd highly recommend people pick this up for some great entertainment.The dev is also working on more environments and possibly different game modes (more than 2 teams perhaps?).

								Very fun and can get heated! Only problem is organizing games but dev has suggested match times and has integrated discord making it simple. The developer Hypergolic Games is amazing and is the most active I've ever seen as far as consumer engagement. A+ wish you the best buddy			",106,42,3,35,35,2,51
