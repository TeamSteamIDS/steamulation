												Great game, similar to FIFA but for Lacrosse. Quite difficult to defend but it gets much better with practice. Really fun game overall, would recommend to anyone!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a Lacrosse player myself, I found this game to be a blast. I spent most of my time on career mode maxing out my shooting stat and smoking the hell out of goalies. This game, atleast in my opinion, shows the guts and such of the game of Lacrosse. Now I do think its a little over the top on the hitting, considering straight up flattening someone isnt legal all of the time depending on where you get them at. I find this game to fit as a fun past-time and just a sort of ""chill-out"" game.Thanks for reading my crappy review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NOTE: I value opinions of those on the opposite side of the fence, but please don't delegitmize a sport that has a college and professional scene. Try to be respectful and avoid debate about the popularity of Lacrosse vs another. There is a group of people who enjoy the sport, let them enjoy it. Now for the reviewAll I can say is WOW ....and what the f@#k am I doing?I know absolutely nothing about Lacrosse so questioning the integrity and authentic nature of the game is something I can not do. Most experience with Lacrosse is going to a game at my University to flirt with a girl.PROSColor Commentery, it's not Mike Hogewood or John Madden but it's better than what I was expectingCreate Your own Player, Team, Coach, Referee, League and More!!!!Career and Coach modeEasy to learn controls, its basically EA's NHLGreat Graphics and DetailAchievementsController Support]BOTH [where its up to you to decide if its a pro or con]No Offically Licensed TeamsThis is obvious but, difficult to grasp the concept of the game for a newbieRequires Internet Connection to LaunchNo injuriesCONSPersonally, been experiencing poor optimization. Frame rate drops and things of that natureAs far I can see, no tutorialDon't Dare Try Keyboard ControlsAnimations often glitch, IE player celebrating will clip through the goal--More Detailed Review and Video Version Expected Soon!!!!-- ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have already put 37 hours into this game since getting it early. So I am going to try and make an in-depth tutorial. I was a backer for this game when the crowdfunding campaign failed in the fall of 2013, as well as when the crowdfunding successfully was achieved in 2014. So, I have been waiting for this game for awhile, lol. I fully recommend this game! It captures the realism of lacrosse and for the first legitimate lacrosse game ever, EVER, it well exceeded my expectations. The graphics I have seen on youtube are amazing, I have a weak machine so I have the equivilent of xbox or Playstation 2 graphics, and still have put already 37 hours onto the game. So if you have a weak PC do not be discouraged, I still think it is a great buy. PROS: - Realistic Lacrosse, AI responds as they would in a real-game. - Good shooting animations and controls- Commentary is basic, but good- AI is hard to beat! I played on Sophmore difficulty (2nd easiest of the 5 difficulties) and I still barley can win at times.- A good amount of scoring, but not all games end 20-18, sometimes lower scoring like 6-5. -THE BEST PRO: To me, the customization in this game is unreal. If you like creating players and Teams, ORDER THIS GAME NOW. It is my favorite part of any sports game and this one makes by far the best creation-centre. CONS: I think many of these wrinkles will get smoothened out in the next game and/or updates.-The game has no indication when quarters will end! There should be a beep or something when there is 5 seconds left in a quarter. All of the sudden, the play stops and the quarter will end. - The sprinting is♥♥♥♥♥♥ you get short sprint bursts which then regenerate after a short time.- Glitchy celebrations, players run through other players and the nets- The goalies can make saves, but sometimes when they let in goals they look like blind vegetables- Defense was really hard to get at first, learning what buttons truley did what. - No tutorial to teach basic lacrosse rules or the gameplay (Like I said, defense was hard to learn)- Apparently, no customization to players after career mode beginI would give this game a 9/10, I love it so far and the thing is I give it that grade and THIS IS THE FIRST LACROSSE GAME EVER! Many more to come with better improvements!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
