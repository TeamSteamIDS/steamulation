												Pretty good game , similar as footbal mogul 2014. I gave it a positive but then again it's for people who used to love playing browser football games.			",612,165,40,80,76,7,121

												I'm really glad I got this game. It is effectively a simulation based on plays. It's highly addictive (I'm not even a football fan, and got this game not even knowing what half the positions do.), There are massive amounts of customization options, but it's still quite nice and simple. And it's great being able to make your own plays. Those who know the game much better than I do will have a blast! Good work guys! c:Also, made randomly made mumbai a team. And yes, time zones do apply in this game :P			",15,3,0,10,39,0,20

												Just too stupid.  The idea is that you're the GM and Coach.  At the easiest level of difficulty ""fan"", the super bowl winning Patriots, can not afford to resign even half of their free agents.  The game, like many straagy games, is about resource management.  'Can I get by with some rookies at key positions that I can pay less while keeping some higher priced veterans?' or 'Do I trade Gronkowski so I can afford to resign Brady?'  But with this bit of bio-hazard it doesn't matter what you do; in short order you'll be left with a 24 player roster of middling talent because the finances are squeued.  Just no fun.

												I quit because my team kept having 0 in attendance for home games even though my financial settings are always in line with teams of similar fan loyalty and avg per capita income. And since I can't seem to figure this out my profits will always be a small fraction of every other team and building a competitive team will be impossible. They need the option they had in the Baseball Mogul franchise where the computer would set the prices for you. Simple fix. Would probably take them five minutes to implement. Lazy idiots.Edit: I decided to give the game one final chance. I set my tickets prices ten dollars below the next lowest team's prices and this helped. I averaged 6,000 in attendance, about 10% of the league average. Something has got to be broken with the financial system in this game.			",5,0,1,3,10,0,0

												After 40+ minutes of gameplay, the only thing I do not like, is the fact that when you launch the game, the game tries to open the browser to access a web page. It is annoying a little bit. But the game so far, seems pretty good if you are into manager games. Will come back with a more detailed review after i continue playing the game for a little more and explore all the features. For now, it looks like a decent game.			",361,118,13,34,67,4,62

												Now I'm not a football fan. The most I enjoyed it was sitting around the Sega Genesis, playing Madden '96 with my brother, our uncle and our cousin. This game reminds me of those good times.No, you don't control each individual player in real time, but you manage the team.Hire free agents, fire losers, develop players who are under potential, and you fill the positions (though sadly, the game has a little trouble with concepts like Ironman positions such as Tight End/Defensive End, much less moving your Tackle into Cornerback because you're an imbecile like me who wants to try crazy things).You choose the ticket price, the concessions, and when game time comes you can either let the game simulate it or you can run each play yourself!At the end of the season, you get your earnings and your Draft picks. It's awesome!All in all, I've stayed up way too late and gotten way too into my 1983 Miami Dolphins and their (by 1986) talented and very large offensive line that can safely get scrawny little Dan Marino 6 yards running up the middle against anyone. Except the Bears. That... that wasn't pretty. Let's just say instead of Isotoner gloves, in my world Dan Marino sells Rascal scooters. :(At $15 (list price when I reviewed this), I think Sports Mogul, Inc is a little optimistic. (Or maybe they're pessimistically expecting only to get sports junkies.) However, I got this in a $0.99 bundle, and honestly--remember, I'm not a football or even a sports fan--feel like this is the best deal I've gotten all year.If you can get this for under $10, you're getting a great game at the right price.

												I like the game so far. I haven't played similar games until finding Football Mogul and Baseball Mogul but so far I find myself pleasantly surprised.			",2,1,0,0,2,0,1

												Pretty nice what the developers came up with this one. I doubt this game was created for everyone to enjoy, so if you are a football fanatic, I would definitely suggest you try this game.			",5,5,0,1,3,0,1
