												I will admit it is very nice to see some sports games on Steam, and while I wasn't expecting a whole lot (I paid a whole 3 bucks for the game) I started off really enjoying the experiance but that turned quickly.First, it does look like a nice game. I ran it at full everything and it never saw a chug or hiccup. The lighting was done well and you felt like you were actually boxing. Fighting in Russia saw snowflakes and in Vegas tonnes of flashing lights.It's the little things that get to you after grinding the career mode. Firstly, it's a grind. If you win the first belt quickly you will need to replay the same tournement a few more times to earn the credits to level up your character to stand a chance in the later stages. But by the time you've done that the game's terrible AI flaws are very apparent and you won't need half the stats.Start with a block, jab until your stamina is gone. Block and repeat. You have no actual need for uppercuts/crosses at all. No matter when you knock someone down, you get the same animation as they teleport to the middle of the ring and all replays have what I can figure as sneaker shoe sounds. This is boxing, not basketball.But the MAJOR gripe I have. In BOXING you knock an opponent down 3 times... TKO. Real Boxing doesn't have that. I knocked one guy down 5 times in ONE ROUND...... That alone makes me not want to recommend the game. They spent more times working on the giggle of the breasts of the ring girl then googling how Boxing is done.			",459,91,8,48,67,7,87

												Well, er. Boxing fans don't exactly have a whole lot to choose from when it comes to Steam games, do they? The truth is, until the Fight Night series makes its way to Steam, this is the best we're going to get. The unfortunate thing is that the ""best"" isn't really that good. GameplayThe game plays very similarly to a dumbed-down version of... You guessed it - Fight Night. Fighter movement is controlled with the left stick whilst the punches are mapped to directions on the right stick, or alternatively the face buttons. Left and right shoulder buttons are used for the high-low modifier and block, respectively, whilst tapping the right shoulder button lightly allows for a dodge. Both you and your opponent have a health and a stamina bar. Big punches such as uppercuts do more damage but drain more stamina, whilst jabs … You get the drift. Dodging a punch successfully results in a Matrix-like slowdown that allows you to get a solid counter-hit in for extra damage and less stamina. The fight goes on until one person knows the other person down and they stay down for a full 10 seconds, or a decision is reached at the end of however many rounds you set it to. It’s the bare bones for any game that tries to call itself a boxing simulator, although the aforementioned issues prevent it from really being a good game.  Poor dodging system - Real Boxing only allows you to dodge in a single direction (i.e. you cannot influence the direction you’re dodging), so the only thing that’s required of the player is timing. The problem is that the dodge comes out so slowly that you literally have to press it before the opponent’s attack comes out. It turns the skill/reflex-intensive dodging system of Fight Night and turns it into a skill-less guessing game  Poor high-low system – Since there’s no high-low blocking system, holding the block button will block both high and low attacks. What’s worse, unlike Fight Night, where punching the head does more damage whilst punching to the body does less damage but drains more stamina from the opponent (the so-called “money in the bank” approach in boxing), Real Boxing makes no such distinction. It’s almost pointless that they bothered to include body punches at all in this game.  Button-mashing - You can get through the entire game with button mashing. At no point in the game did I feel that throwing one particular punch was more effective than throwing any other. I beat the first opponent in the game the same way I beat the last opponent – mashing.  Shallow career mode – Literally has you fight one opponent after another, earning cash whilst buying upgrades. Rinse and repeat until you become the supreme champion of the universe or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every so often you’re allowed to do a “training mini-game” in order to increase your stats as well. Speaking of which…  Tedious mini-games - There are 3 training mini-games, each improving a separate stat (strength, stamina and speed). Unfortunately, all three are essentially glorified quick-time events, and very easy. It’s incredibly repetitive and tedious, but necessary in order to improve your boxer’s stats  Poor multiplayer implementation – Purely online matchmaking. No local multiplayer or even the ability to host a game against a friend. I can’t comment further because quite frankly I never got a game going.Overall, the issue is that the game boils down to a skill-independent, button-mashing affair. I’ve figured out the secret to the game. You ready?If opponent has worse stats than you – Mash anything. You can’t lose.If opponent has equal or better stats than you – Hold block. Wait for opponent to drain his stamina, then mash anything. Rinse, repeat.PresentationI have to admit that the game does look quite pretty for an indie title. Character models look realistic, even if the models are fairly bland. Supports 1920x1080 resolution, which is nice. Sound effects are adequate. Sadly lacks any real music outside of the nauseating entrance music that plays when your boxer walks towards the ring. A single commentator is present for the game, and whilst it’s a nice touch, he appears to only have approximately 10 lines and uses them all at the wrong time. Be prepared as he calls every one of your uppercuts a jab and a complete one-sided pounding as the “Fight of the decade”. Overall ImpressionI’m an indie gamer at heart. Because of that, I hate games like this. I hate that games like this exist because it’s an example of an indie game making a strictly inferior version of a AAA game like Fight Night and dumbing down all the mechanics and depth whilst hiding behind the fact that it’s an “indie” game. Indie games should never, ever be strict downgrades of AAA games. Unfortunately, as I said before, us Steam gamers looking for a chance to practice the art of the sweet science aren’t exactly spoilt for choice. This is the best boxing game on Steam right now, and if that’s what you’re looking for then I would recommend you give it a shot. For everyone else though, stay away.			",1140,477,42,159,142,13,199

												Do not be put off by all the negative reviews comparing this game to Electronic Art's Fight Night series of games. Fight Night is a AAA Sports title created by a developer who has a long history of developing boxing games, and it costed 6-times as much as this game. Of course Fight night going to be better, but that does not mean Real Boxing is not an enjoyable game worth it's $10 price tag.Real Boxing Is more arcade than simulation, and there is not a lot of depth, but the action is fast paced and the multiplayer mode should be entertaining for hardcore boxing fans, at least in short spurts.  The single player career mode is basic, and there are not all that many different characters to fight against, but the mode exists. There are options for editing the appearance of your boxer, but you do not seem to be able to edit your boxer's name, which is a little bit annoying.Aside from that, there are also the standard training mini games that you would expect to see in a boxing game. These mini games require you to press the right-stick in a certain direction in time with the on-screen cues. As you might guess the mini games become repetitive very quickly (but so did the mini games in fight Night).The in-ring boxing action is not very simulation-like, but it's not exactly the mindless button-masher other reviews make it out to be.  You can throw all the punches you would expect (using either an anolog stick or the buttons) but there is no option for using dirty tactics such as headbutts or low blows. You can grab and clinch your opponent, but only when your energy drops below a certain level. Blocking is done with a single button, and it automatically blocks head or body shots as needed. You can also use a perfectly timed press of the block button to slip an opponents punch, creating a slow-motion effect allowing you an extra moment to throw a counter punch. There is no bobbing/weaving. There is no way to take a knee if your getting pummled, and there is no option for switching from orthodox to southpaw stance.Pros:- Fast paced action with easy to pick-up controls- Decent looking graphics and presentation for a budget title- Online multiplayer boxing matches- Commentary is repetitive but sounds good for an arcade boxing experience- it's the only (somewhat realistic) boxing game on SteamCons:- Boxer movement/footwork is not very smooth- Small roster of characters - No real world boxers- Short/uninspired single-player career mode- No matchmaking options for the online multiplayer modeThe bottom line is that it's not exactly a great game, but it's the best boxing game I have on my PC. The game will not have much appeal for most gamers, but hardcore boxing fans will probably find it fun being able to swap leather with other players now and then. It's not Fight Night Champion, but it's actually better than I had expected it to be.			",513,111,16,44,115,14,61

												Sluggish, bothersome, stuttering...and that´s the nice things.No really.. the pace is so slow you think the fighters aren´t moving at all. The animation is standard at best, stuttering and ugly at worst. Also the ""career"" itself is a joke, with tournaments aligning one fight after the other, with just marginally different fighters/animations.That you have to ""buy"" nearly everything from customization to your skills is the bothersome part.Can´t really see much good about this game, except that the low price is fitting to its quality.

												REAL BOXING- This may not be Fight Night but let's face it, EA Sports has all but abandoned the PC player with no sport titles except FIFA, what about Madden, NHL and Fight Night for PC, oh well.. I have this boxing game (REAL BOXING) on my iphone and I enjoy it, here on the PC version they have removed the micro transactions and given you the ability to move around the ring which is something that feels added because that part of the game just seems a little sluggish, there are no Muhammad Ali dancing masters here just flat footed Rocky Balboa type club fighters. But I have to say this is the best ""PC"" boxing game I have ever played and will gladly support it in hopes we get more Boxing games on PC. The graphics are good, the game supports both keyboard and controller inputs, I like that you can adjust the number of rounds and length of rounds.  There is a quick fight or a career mode, in career mode you can customize and train your fighter to improve his attributes, (although you cannot rename them* UPDATE- The Devs say you can rename the fighter when you create them, click in the box with the name and retype the one you want), there is also multiplayer which is nice and I look forward to. I do not care too much for the in game music or the lame commentator, however the punch sound effects are decent.  I would like to point out that although the Ring Card Girls do seem to have nice physics for their breasts the game really could work on Presentation and Fighter Damage. I would really like to see the DEVs work on and add various cuts, fighter fatigue, some swelling, better footwork, corner men working on fighters between rounds, camera men outside the ring, better fight commentary, a in the ring referee, and ability to change fighter name and face. I will say that I did have a great 12 round fight last night that was very close, I knew this going into the last round and was worried, I did win on points!  I am really hoping that the DEV Team continue to update this game, there is some great potential here and a wide open market for it, now if we could only get someone to make good hockey game! So if you are on the fence I would say get it, it's your best PC option for boxing right now and a decent game for the price. This game screams for the STEAM Work Shop- let the modders go wild and shut EA down!			",318,20,5,20,39,3,47

												It certainly contradicts the title of the game, ""Real"" because at best it is an extremely basic arcade boxing game. For those looking for Fight Night comparisons, you'll be bitterly disappointed and probably not like the game.For those looking for an arcade boxing game to play at times with friends, you might like this game.This was the first game I used my Steam Link with, so with a friend I had fun playing this. Its quick, its really simple & easy to pick up, and its guaranteed to make a few laughs if with company. The enormous downside to this game, is that mostly everything is dreadful. Boxer customisation, commentary, physics, not to mention the single player aspect doesn't have a storyline. But I mean honestly, for £3.99 on steam your not looking for an AAA game. I purchased the game on a deal so it cost me 20% of its ""now"" price, so with all things considered and the price that I paid I am fine about that. But the reason I am giving this a thumbs down rather then a thumbs up is because of the Developers ridiculous game description, which in essence is a complete lie.  Vivid Games describes it as ""ultra-realistic"" with ""incredibly deep gameplay"" with a ""comprehensive career mode"" which is an absolute joke. If it wasn't for me being such a huge boxing fan and the lack of boxing content on steam, I would have completely skipped this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a big fight night fan and this is not it, not nearly. Thank God it's only a fiver because this game is not a step back but a long long jump back from fight night champion which was released in 2011. There is about an hour of enjoyment here if that, until you realise how lacking it is. It's basically a button basher with no thinking whatsoever. I've had a few online fights and even though the first couple of fights I beat the guy senseless and knocked down my opponent I lost on points somehow, I think when punches are blocked they count as an hit. I quickly realised that if I spam the counter button then it's an easy win. It's only a fiver but I still feel i've been ripped off. If you buy this then after an hour you will realise it's money wasted. Shame because I would love a new good boxing game to play.			",31,2,1,1,3,1,2

												Not sure whether or not I can recommend this game. It's simple but if you have time to kill there are other games more enjoyable than this. It's also really easy to just farm attributes in the beginning of your career. Just don't proceed to win the first championship and continue doing solo matches. Then bulldoze through the three championships.			",177,58,4,34,22,2,19

												Vivid Games mainly specialises in gaming apps for smart phones. Real Boxing is such a game (its sequel with its Rocky homage could be pretty cool and probably a more refined version of this game) which sports an arcade style boxing game that can be a good pastime if you are patient enough to wait for your next AAA game on your wishlist until its released or receives a substantial discount.The problem is that Real Boxing was not a good pastime for me. I hated the frequent FPS drops, the mindless grinding that is needed otherwise you simply cannot complete the next tournament. Visiting the gym to increase your stamina, strength and speed is possible after every 5 matches (only participation counts; winning these is not mandatory) or you can spend your hard-earned credits to increase your stats right away. So, you go to a quick match then quit after 5 wins or you repeat the same tournament you have already completed - rinse and repeat.The simplistic menu design and the overall gaming experience clearly indicates this is a mobile port. There are, however, better games than this and perhaps picking its AAA equivalent is a much, much better choice. Real Boxing is not necessarily a bad game - it just does not have anything to do with real boxing.			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												I'm torn on how to review this game.If I consider it as arcade-ey, it's absolutely passable.  I might even recommend it to a friend who is into the sweet science.  If, however, I consider it as a boxing sim (which I think is how it's trying to present itself, given the title and promo material), it falls far short.While the graphics are decent, that's about it.  There just isn't much to this game.There are three ""tournaments"" which will give you completion and credits.  Credits can be used to purchase some upgrades (not many -- think ""lower the stamina cost of your jab"").  You can also play training minigames once every five fights to gain a few points in each of the three (just 3) main skill categories.  If you fight above your ratings, you'll be slaughtered.  If you fight below, you'll be doing the slaughtering.As for the fights, again, there's a good deal of what I'd consider necessities for a sim completely absent.Blocking is all-or-nothing -- if you block, you'll block all punches, regardless of where they're aimed.  No covering your midsection at the expense of your face, no getting your hands up and leaving your body exposed.  Which, I should mention, isn't a huge problem, as there's no practical difference in where punches land.  An uppercut to the midsection is equally as damaging as an uppercut to the chin, and neither will have any long-term bearing on the fight (e.g. no laying into body shots at the beginning of a fight to wear out an opponent).Though the scorecard shown at the end of a fight has 12 rounds listed, fights always last 3.  Rounds are 1 minute long.All in all, if you're looking for what's essentially PunchOut with a less interesting cast of characters and improved graphics, this is probably worth your time.  If you're looking for a sim, trying to be light like a butterfly and sting like a bee, applying that sweet science all over your opponent's face, look elsewhere.4 DQs (afaik impossible in this game) / 10 TKOs (afaik impossible in this game)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

YouTube™ Video: Real Boxing - let's play & first impressions 

			Views: 1,982		

			This is my first impressions of Real Boxing by Vivid Games S.A. Enjoy. I also posted my review on steam. You can read it here - http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032161980/recommended/296770/		

It's not the most amazing looking thing but overall the game looks good. The sounds of punches landing and that sort of thing is satisfying. There is supposed to be bruising and stuff on characters who take hit's. But I didn't notice any of that. Maybe the Australian version is censored or I need to select it in the options.You improve your boxers stamina, speed and strength by complete mini games (the skipping, speed ball, hard bad stuff). You basically just have to press key's in a certain sequence. I think it's supposed to get progressively more difficult at high levels. Then you fight. You can do quick fight (which just pitted me against the same AI opponent repeatedly), tournament for a series of fights or online vs other players. I didn't wait long enough to get matched for an online fight so I haven't seen what that's like yet. Also I'm sure you're supposed to be able make bet's using in game currency on matches but I couldn't find anything like that.Beating up your opponent and knocking them out is fun. Initially I just spammed the exact same punch repeatedly and won matches without a problem. But in career mode it was starting to get hard by only the second match.I think this game could be a lot of fun because it look's like it might be really challenging to beat the career mode. And I really like the sound of the online mode. Might be really good to vs. some friends. You can punch people over the internet. The $10 price tag is pretty good.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			",184,27,1,19,6,3,21

												Well. I generally do not like to diss on the product of other people's hardwork; viz-a-viz negatively criticize a developer's game, but only if I smell a single drop hard work's sweat in the same zip code of the 'product' I am reviewing.Let me give you a little background, I have spent more than half my childhood playing fighting games on my good old ps2 and the other half I spent tending my sore thumbs after over-playing Fight night games from EA. With that said you might think I'd compare this game with the Fight Night series but to be honest this is not even a half arsed attempt to make a proper clone of that game.Anyone wanting to try this game, I'd stop you right there and rather suggest you to try the old Fight night series of Ps2 or Ps3. Off course you'd be downgrading graphically but fighting game's are not just about graphics. The Fight night games of Ps2 will beat this game hands down in every department - other than graphics off course. Speaking of which they aren't really that great to begin with here.The Good :┼ The game is on PC. Cheaper than buying an used Ps2 and Fight Night CD's. ┼ Get to pounce a HHH / Kofi Kingston lookalike.The Bad┼ Everything.. it's not even an early access game and it has a lot of bugs including getting you and the ai opponent stuck in a groggy state for an entire round and no keys would work - not even the Game pause / ESC key.┼ A bad re-skin attempt of Fight Night games, the developer must be in the wrong industry, this is NOT the iphone/android game-app market.The Ugly┼ Even if I forget every OTHER ugly thing about this game, which includes - but is not limited to : lack of customization for characters, lack of country flags / nationalities etc etc .. despite all that.. the ONE most annoying thing about this game is that it reuses the theme music from Falling Skies (not the game).. albeit a remixed version.. a very annoying remixed version.┼ My Rating : 1/5 NOT RECOMMENDED  Nuff said..

												As a pugilism game, Real Boxing exists in a category all its own, and not in a good way. It isn't realistic enough to pass as a sports career simulator, nor is it fake enough to pass as a Punch Out! clone.Boxer customization is limited to the same two character models (tall troglodyte or small Asian) with varying skin tones, hair styles and tattoos. You can buy your character different gloves and shorts, but they're expensive and with little variety. Facial animation are so limited that you can barely tell apart the winner of a match from the loser. The round card girls range from a dead-eyed blonde to a dead-eyed brunette. The training mini-games are uninspired run-of-the-mill rhythm challenges sans the music. The fighting physics are rough, with knockout animations totally unrelated to the type of punch that provoked them. When more effort is put into the bosom-giggle physics of the girls than the fights themselves, you know you're in trouble.There are some good details in Real Boxing. Its fight mechanics are very easy to learn. The ring environments look very good. Career Mode is limited to only 27 fights in 3 categories, so at least it's a very short commitment. And you can't beat the price. All of Real Boxing's many defects would be forgiven if at least the game was fun.Vivid Games seems to be doing well with this franchise on mobile platforms by doing a Rocky tie-in. I wish them well. I believe eventually they will make a great boxing game, but Real Boxing isn't it.			",316,96,21,34,29,6,40

												Boring and repetitive. And it's not challenging at all. It doesn't matter how good your opponent is: if you have the higher stats, which you can easily increase by training in some tedious minigames, there's a certain strategy that you can use that will always grant you the victory, without a single exception.

												This game is awesome! I've been waiting for a boxing game to come to pc and I'm so gald one finally did. Don't listen to the reviews that say it's bad. Those people are comparing it to a AAA title (Fight Night) which this may not be, but it for sure wont dissapoint. To me this feels like Fight Night Round 1/2. The controls are nice, gameplay is fun and come on who hasnt been waiting to KO someone on the pc? For the $9.99 asking price that is more than fair for what you get. I hope they will maybe add workshop to this title, that could get interesting. Please give this game a chance before you write it off based on some reviews from people that expect to get miracles for $10. FN will cost you $40-$60 and the cost of an Xbox or PlayStation. This is $9.99 and ready to go. Trust me, try it and knock some b****es out :D			",157,12,3,22,8,2,13

												this is just an iOS port with enhanced graphics.  controls are basic and lacking giving not much depth to the gameplay.  there is no parrying and dodging is wonky since it's activated by a tap instead of any leaning system like traditional bob and weaving in boxing.the single player is not well paced forcing you to replay easy fights so you can upgrade your character for the next level of competition and aside from that the progression is 3 basic tournaments; beginning with a group stage first (7 fights) where every one is fought once and then a finals final 4 elimination bracket for your last two.while others may say that there is not much more to boxing i argue that there is a lot more left to be desired.

												I tired to like this game, but it's just not good.  Pros --It's a boxing game on the PC-It doesn't look terribleCons --The controls just feel bad.  They're clunky and the dodge block system is basically one button.-There isn't much to the game.  A couple tournaments and quick fights and that's about it.-The in game mechanics are just clunky and it kills the game.If you want a good boxing game, just go get one of the old Fight Night games.

												Real Boxing is not a bad game but it has its fair share of flaws.Let's start with the customization.You can choose from about 10-15 different hairstyles,sneakers,trousers and tattoos.I know this is not a Sims game but it would have been nice to have more customization.Another lackluster part of the game is its singleplayer experience.You can only win 3 belts.For each one you need to fight a number of opponents then qualify in a 4-man tournament to compete for the belt.It gets boring extremely fast and because of the lack of diversity you will feel like you fight the same guy over and over again.The game has only 3 arenas in which you can fight..again not much work done here.Your boxer has 3 traits.Speed,Stamina and Strenght.You can improve those by playing 3 minigames for each one.It's a nice addition to the game and helps with the repetitivness aspect of the singleplayer.You can also buy 2 additional perks from a total of about 8..again not much to choose from.The actual gameplay is actually fun and rewarding.You feel every punch and it has a nice clinching mechanic,giving you health if you win the clinch.Even if the game is fairly easy,you can enjoy it.Real Boxing is a fairly decent game in terms of graphics but it has a weird way of registering punches.Whenever I watched replays of me knocking out an opponent,the jab/hook or uppercut didn't even connect most of the time.After awhile you will get bored not because the gameplay itself is boring but because the opponents have only three or four ways of falling to the ground or getting up.Even the music never changes which becomes annoying.Also after two or three matches you will probably just mute the commentator because he reapeats the same stuff over and over.It's a shame developers didn't put much effort into this game.Overall I wouldn't reccommend Real Boxing for the price it has and even at a sale I would put it last in any list.You can enjoy the game for a few hours but it's lack of...everything makes the game not worth your money.If you are looking for a few hours of fun you can pick this up but if you want a longer and more engaging experience you can get that for the same price or even cheaper.

												This game baffles the crap out of me. This is a sub-Knockout Kings level boxing game. This is a sub-Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing boxing game. This is a modern game made on modern hardware with modern sensibilities and it has literal decades of boxing games to learn from.Instead you have no create-a-fighter, pointless training games, a career mode that's just a linear procession of fighters and boxing with no impact, bad timing and no actual flow.Nothing about this satisfies, and when you're talking about the fine art of bludgeoning someone into unconsciousness with your fists, that's an accomplishment.

Only Fun For a While, And Not Very ""Real""- While the game does well in certain aspects to make the game fun and interesting, such as the counter system and the AI being challenging at the start of the career mode, it seems like there isn't much else to the game once you have played it for a while.- The customisation options in this game are very limited as you can only change the accessories of your character, not the features of your character itself as you are given some pre-determined templated to use.- Graphics look good on the highest settings and the sounds dont vary too much, pretty basic to be honest.- The combat mechanics are simplistic for the punching, however when it comes to the movement of the player it is quite awkward and it sometimes feels like you are moving along a grid and your character jolts which looks odd.If you pick this game up for like $1 then it may be for it but other than that i wouldn't really bother with it.

												Where to start with this game??? Game play is boring same maneuvers  over and over the character models are all the same; with the exception of a few tattoos, mustache and other bodily augmentations. Its like the developer just followed a simple default template. Dodging needs work. Moving around the ring is not fluid. The graphics are good, not great some rough edges around the character models. AI is repetitive and it becomes easy after a while, too easy. All achievements are attainable. I purchased this game to give it a shot. At $5 its worth a try, if not wait till it drops even further maybe a $1 or so. Don't expect awesomeness. Purchase @ your own risk!!!3/10			",712,225,17,21,59,7,73

												For a mobile port this is pretty good actually. has these settings every graphical feature nearly. AA up to 4xMSAA with 2xbelow that and High/Low FXAAAF up to 16xVsync on/offFX on/off Shadow Quality L/M/HGame Details  L/M/Hgamepad works good. has either face button striking or right stick striking. the movement is a little janky but its not gamebreaking unless you are a bit nitpicky. its obviously not going to be as good as FIght Night but like i said for a port of a mobile game it is surprisingly well done.i think a lot of reviews are beating the game up cause its not a AAA 60$ chocked full of content game but thats really an unfair expectation when this game is 10 bucks reg price and 7.99 on initial release. for the price its worth it and plenty of fun.besides isnt this the only boxing and or fighting game on steam or even PC that isnt either drawn with crayon or full of superpowers. not sayng its great just cause its one of a kind but untill PC gaming gets a real AAA boxing or MMA fighting game you wont find anything better than this for what it does.

												I'm an amateur boxer. I've been in three amateur fights and even though it's not a pro fight I have to say this game isn't like real boxing. Basically whoever has the higher stats wins the fight. And you can't increase your stats while you're in the ring. Only outside when you train in the gym. And the training simulator is pretty bad too. If you want a good boxing game this isn't it. Find another one that's fun. If you want a realistic boxing game. Fight Night Round 4 or FN Champion are good ones. This wasn't that fun and I'd have to give this game like 5/10. The only thing good about it are the graphics. The game is very repitive. Like when you get into the ring the guy always says ""this'll be a fight to remember"" and the walk in intrance is always the same besides different music that you don't get to pick yourself. And the collision from gloves to the body isn't as good as Fight Night. Also the online doesn't work, at least not for me.			",23,10,0,2,14,2,0

												Don't get me wrong, but the game misses one very important word in its name - Arcade. It is Real Boxing Arcade.It has its fund playing with friends, but as a boxing game it will disappoint every single Tyson/Mayweather/Klitchko wannabe.Punch block counter, that's all that matters, your opponents movement does not even count. Oh and there is boring level up through repetitive training mini-games. And once you level up of your skills, all of your 3 skills that is, then the fights with PC are just pure boredom.One Grumpy Russian score - 6/10 when Vodka is shared aplenty during a soirée with your friends.For more reviews join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ogrreview/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, you can't customize your player so much, can't even pick the name.You can train him in-between fights (or pay to lvl speed, endurance and♥♥♥♥♥♥ like if you are paying for steroids), and then go on tournaments to earn belts.The training system consists in pressing buttons on marks, wow, so much real.So yeah, got it in a bundle, wouldn't pay even 1USD for this.

												Real Boxing, unfortunately, fails to deliver. I am not talking about the gameplay. I am not talking about the blood graphics. I am not talking about the commentary. I am talking about a combination of them all. The commentary especially is repetitive, though they do change ring announcers after a match, so that's a good thing. The Career mode simply has a series of matches where your pre-selected character goes though in order to receive the belt. However, the matches are simply too easy, though I do agree they scale from belt to belt and from match to match.The Training system however, is rather fun. Sure, it's a simple rythm mini-game, but it does give a nice addition to the game.I would only reccomend this to boxing fans that want to try out a different angle at the sport. However, since the graphics actually look good (minus the blood) I do hope for a better Career Mode for this game.			",156,29,1,36,5,1,11

												The fact that this is a handheld/mobile port is frighteningly obvious. While there is a lack of boxing games on PC, this game is not up to standard. The animations are very poor and the gameplay is poorly thought out. Career mode is very skinny with three mini-games that you can only occasionally use to train your boxer, and the title fights are insanely easy on the first circuit and insanely hard on the second circuit. Progression is really repeatiing the same low-level circuit until you can get enough cash to boost your stats to survive getting hit in the next level.The fighting mechanics lack any flow or depth. You cannot throw combinations, so boxing is simply a matter of tapping the jab or hook button. Blocking is a one-button affair, and while you can punch through a block, you don't have enough stamina to exploit it. Hit reactions are awkward - punches don't connect to the opponent, so if the opponent is staggering, your punches are sure to miss, which is very unintuitive. The counterattack system seems like something nice, but it's really just an opportunistic slow-mo which is botched by the lack of fluid fighting.The characters are all the same. There are no distinctions between boxing styles, so it's really just a slugfest. It's disappointing to see a ""Real Boxing"" title feature nothing that makes boxing real.Some other huge flaws:* Clinch mini-game has no timer. You can clinch for the entire round.* Getting up from a KO immediately goes into the fight, allowing the opponent free hits before your controls are live.* No three-knockdown rule. The AI is generally unable to come back and gets knocked down right away, but there is no way to win by TKO.In a nutshell, winning the game is merely based on when the AI ""forgets"" to block rather than any tactical gameplay.
