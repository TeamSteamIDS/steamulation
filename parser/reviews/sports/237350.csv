												If you look at this game and think ""Oh, a sports game, sorry, not interested"" then I have some fantastic news! You couldnt be further removed from reality. This is a strategy game, a balls to the wall, suspenseful strategy game with 2 incredibly rare and unique elements!First and foremost is the fact that this game features exactly ZERO RNG. This game is about rules. And there arent many to learn, making it fast to pick up and play. Learn these rules, embrace them and victory will soon be yours.The other unique feature is that this game is a simultaneous turn based strategy. That means you and your opponent plan what will happen during the next few seconds and once both of you have prepared your strategy, it plays out in real time.If you were to combine the behavioural analysis of a game like Poker with the incredible forethought and planning of a game of Chess, then layer a visually stunning robo-handegg skin over the top combined with a robust and reliable netcode spine... well then you would have the glorious achievement that is Frozen Cortex. If you are a strategy fan and want to test the limits of your brainpower, this would be a fantastic place to start.Oh, did I mention that the games do not require both opponents to be present at the same time? Turns can be planned at any time, which allows all of those with busy lifestyles to play a turn or 2 when they can, with no penalties for being unable to commit to longer timeframes.All in all, this game is a triumphant follow up to the incredibly well received Frozen Synapse, and I could not recommend it more highly			",124,29,0,37,23,4,50

												I would really like to recommend Frozen Cortex (FC) to everyone, but sadly I cannot. The game still feels as if it's still in Early Access, or at the very least missing some main features. People who enjoy strategy games, don't really care about graphics. Frozen Synapse (FS) would be a prime example of that; the graphics are very simple, so Mode7 spent most of their resource on the gameplay and mechanics; which turned out great. However, for this one they spent more time on graphics, effect, and cinematic camera. The 3D view at the end of a turn is terrible; half the time it's facing some weird direction, and you'll end up watching the results again almost always, there is also no way to turn it off. The gameplay is pretty decent, there aren't as many options as FS, so it's more newbie friendly; rules are few and straightforward, within few games you'll get them all. Although, it's missing basic options like, ability to wait a few secs and then throw, or ignore the ball so some other unit could pick it up. Which can be so annoying, because it can be so useful  deriving a better strategy and it would also deepen the complexity. Also if you are familiar with the FS's clocks feature, then you'll dislike FC's, it's very inaccurate, and basic. There are also some odd incidents where game doesn't play as expected. I’ve also had times where units would just let an other team’s player pass right through, or not do what I tell them to. Sometimes the turn wouldn’t end even if the ball carrier’s plan is finished, then he would just go straight to score, and get tackled. The procedurally generated maps can be faulty at times. I've had few times, where the offence would be closer to the ball, but they would have to go around some block as their path is blocked, so defence can easily get to the ball earlier and score.Single player campaign is well done, and different AI do play differently, hence it's not repetitive. The good thing about the multiplayer system is that it's the same as in FS, but that's the bad thing too because it's lacking features it was in FS. Even though they may not be that important, but you would think that Mode7 would learn something from their previous games. Mode7 is quite famous for their terrible community involvement, so that was kinda expected and I won't hold that against them. I have never seen them actively respond on the forums.Sound wise, nervous_testpilot did it again, it's fantastic. I'm sure you've heard in the trailer, and don't need any convincing. I do notice it breaking when I try out my turns, but that’s probably a bug and might not be the case for everyone.To wrap it up in a pretty bow or whatever, it is a good game but it's not a complete game. You'll probably enjoy it, if you like the idea, or this genre. If you enjoyed Frozen Synapse, and can live with the bugs, then it’s your game. But if you cannot decide just yet, I'd wait it out and see how Mode7 responds. Hopefully, these issues are solved in the future, I wouldn't hold my breath though seeing Mode7's track record.

												Before you read this review, let me tell you that at one point I was number 4 in the world rankings. It's an awesome concept, but never lived up to it's potential because the devs abandoned it waaaay too quickly and relased an unfinished product. (in terms of what was promised in the kickstarter) They haven't even updated in over a year. Maybe if they didn't change the name and aesthetics in the middle of development, things would have gone differently. MAYBE.They then have the BALLS to advertise their another game in the news section. (smdh) I don't think I'll be supporting Mode 7 anytime soon, what if they just abandon it too? (which I doubt because it has a bigger fanbase, but STILL what IF? do you want to support what ifs?)I want to recommend this game so badly because it's actually really good.The gameplay, graphics, and music are wonderful. Single player is alright. Muitiplayer works fun but it hardly have people online (http://steamcharts.com/app/237350#7d) they should've already done a price drop on this game, but I really think they don't want it to strive. And before you say oh well maybe its the community. No we all really wanted this game to do well. here's the proof http://forums.mode7games.com/viewforum.php?f=35&sid=55072932fb8abf1c7197722346601e2ethey haven't even post on their own forums in over a year.So at the end I leave you with thisGood game, terrible execution.edit - 6/23/16at $3.74 wouldn't hurt to try it, maybe it'll finally have people playing.

												Being a football (American) fan and a Madden player for 20 years I wanted a different type of football game. I couldn't find anything outside of an emulator for a football type game. I researched Blood Bowl and while it seems cool, it just doesn't suit my style of strategy and sport simulation. I bought Frozen Synapse a year ago and had a lot of fun playing that title, so I felt this game could be a great mix of tactics and sports feel.With this game, I am able to release my inner coach mind into my team of 5....robot athletes. The visuals are really good, and the gameplay is good, for an early access title.The game modes for single player are AI skirmishes which are fun, and challenging but limited. No story or career mode, but I am sure there is one to tie in sooner or later.The multiplayer is way off....line?. No one on the servers.Correction: one player was on and invited me to a game, played 1 turn and went offline. I was so excited to play against a human, but never got the full blooded chance, yet. The best thing about this game is the strategy to fully control every robots pattern, without the Madden dogsheetery to come along with it. I am happy with the purchase, and will put in well over 17 hours (1$ an hr) to make this game worth my money and time. At it's current state it's a 7/10. With a story mode and more customization options it can easily be a 10/10 title. If you like Madden and/or FS you will enjoy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Fantastic follow up game from Mode7. Future sports football-esque simultaneous-turn based strategy game.Right now the mechanics are great but my experience with the pre-Steam release was plagued by player inactivity. So far, on the first day on Steam, there are more people playing Frozen Endzone than I've ever seen since I pre-ordered it from their website, so the Steam release has certainly fixed the population issue.The game is in REALLY good shape for an early access title, and you get two copies when you purchase it. Must buy for strategy fans or fans of Frozen Synapse!			",168,18,2,22,10,2,25

												On my 4th game ever I played the 3rd ranked player in the globe. It came down to the final play and as I committed my turn I thought I had it in the bag. As the play unfolded and I watched my enemy's robots effortlessly swat the ball from my runner, I realized there was a complexity here I hadn't appreciated. While the game came down to the final play, it wasn't really ever that close - my opponent had boxed me in and there was simply no way out. I love a game that makes you believe you can win until the final instant, only to realize that the depth of tactics ran far deeper than you had anticipated. Is this game for everyone? No, probably not. But it deserves more folks playing online and giving it some life online. It could use a bit more polish, but I'd rather have a great idea with good polish than a good idea with great polish.			",16,8,0,3,1,1,4

												Oh well... Frozen Cortex. I really like this game. It all started so good. Good reviews, early access fuzz. Marketing an alternative-future-sport game is hard and the developers knew that. In a bold move to cut all string attaching them to real life american football, they changed the game name from Frozen Endzone to Frozen Cortex. The confusion started... But well.... after the confusion, Cortex suffered from many game breaking bugs, totally ignored by the developers. It seemed like they stopped believing in their product to succeed. Multiplayer community ceased to exist shortly after. Near the release date, game was fixed, but a few of promised mechanics was cut down or not implemented at all. Frozen Cortex is a full game, don't get me wrong. But it all left a bad taste in my mouth. In the end, it's a very enjoyable turn-based tactical game, bearing resembalnce to american football... only played by robots. It's polished, great looking, the soundtrack is astonishing. But remember, multiplayer is non-existing at this point and the developers addmitted that the game was a commercial failure.  Nevertheless, you will have a lot of fun with single player. Just give it a chance :-)			",369,59,13,36,35,4,57

												I greatly reccomend this game.Its very accesable with tonnes of replayability. Customization of leagues, purchase op robots, smart AI. This game has many features that you'd certainly enjoy.I bought this game without having a clue as to what i spent my money on. I got in, and played the toturial which, i must add, was very intuative and helpful. After completing the toturial i went onto knockout mode adn chose the easy AI. At first I couldn't beat them. But after 30mins of playing I was able to enjoy the thrill of murdering robots. The smell of oil is good.This game is NOT about sports. Its strictly strategy. So if you like strategy, you'll love this.Give it a go. :D			",82,7,6,9,29,1,14

												The movement of your players matters. Run or Pass the ball? Plan it out on your tactical board. How much time will you have in this turn? This is easier to determine as the posessing team since you have an advantage in dominating the course of the game, nonetheless the defending team may have good insight and read the game.This is a simulatenous-turn game with an abstract play field. The geometry of the field is your playground. A plan worth 5 - 10 of your minutes thinking about it is compressed into a 5 - 10 second exchange that will reveal your success.This is the tactical 1v1 game I have been looking for. One one hand, it has the benefits of being turn-based, like board games typically are. On the other hand, it's based on the advantages of being a computer game which is reflected in the wonderful UI as well as in the rules and in the mechanics. I enjoy the tactical depth of this game very much.			",58,10,1,5,2,1,11

								I've been playing since the Beta (Dec 2013) and I love this game.  The game is like a simultaneous turn based rugby/football game similar to Blood Bowl with less blood and simultaneous turns instead of alternating.  One of the game modes (handball) has been improved to become theFull Match game mode which makes it have a great feel of a rugby / football game.  I like how they implemented the stats for the players and announcers (no voices for them yet though).I think they'll be adding apperance customization but as  of this time, there is none which is my only regret.

												This is a decent idea that could have been so much more. If it only had some small details like the ability to train your players in certain attribuites and/or level up your players. The basic gist is that this games lacks customization and control over your team and players. There is also next to nothing in terms of help. There is nothing at all that tells you what the equipment you can buy even does, if anything.			",82,23,3,21,70,4,42

Early Access Review
								Frozen Endzone (possibly soon to be Frozen Cortex) is a brilliant new type of game from Mode7Games.  It mixes sports with the turn-based action of their previous entry into the market, Frozen Synapse.  Players plan their players moves, can plan opponent's moves to see what will happen, and then submit their turn.  Meanwhile, their opponent does the same planning process, and then after both players have submitted their turn, the game calculates and displays a result.  Best part is that you never have to be online at the same time as your opponent!  The game itself has simple rules.  You score points by running through bonus zones or getting into the endzone.  Players must advance the ball each turn.  Once you run the ball, you cannot pass it again, aside from a free turn at the beginning of a possession.The blocking works well, with whoever is stopped first getting to block any moving player.  Players within a certain range will intercept a ball, and players within a certain range will chase after and tackle opponents.I enjoy both major modes of play, Full Match and Duplicate.  Full Match involves 18 turns of play, with turnovers changing possession, and touchdowns causing the game to restart in the original position with the teams swapped.  Duplicate is almost an 'extra point' type situation, where the offense is trying to score and the defense just to stop them - possession changes count as ending the play and then the match restarts with the teams swapped, and whoever has the most points wins.They're still improving it as we speak, and working on a single player campaign which sounds amazing.  This is a must have for anyone who has an interest in sports and loved Frozen Synapse, and is worth a try for someone who is a fan of either sports or Frozen Synapse.			",73,23,7,18,55,2,45

												I wasn't sure about this game. I thought it may be very slow, basic and simple. How wrong was I.Basically, this is a game in which you are trying to get the ball to one side of the 'field' to the other, while your opponent is trying to stop you and get the ball to the opposite side. Sounds simple enough. The way you do this is quite unique. The game is split into turns. Every turn, you tell your robots (which look stunning, just like the rest of the game) to run or throw the ball. Your opponent does the same. When both are finished, you hit the 'play' button and see what happens. This is a great way to structure a game. Personally, I am a big fan of having a more chilled out, relaxed approach to the game. But there is more to the game.When it comes down to it, this is a strategy game. You need to work out where you think your opponent will move, try to intercept their throws, tackle them, and just generally get in their way. There is an extrordinary depth to the game, and is very easy to spend hours at a time trying to fine tune your tactic. There is only one very small issue I have with this game, and that is that even when you are playing against the computer, you have to wait for it to complete its turn. I don't know whether this is just to make the game seem like you are actually playing against another person or what, but I personally would prefer to not to have to wait. I want to see what happens next!It is a game which is very easy to get into, but very hard to master.A sports game on the surface, a strategy game at heart, an overall package that is, for me, very hard to beat. There is nothing like it, in a very good way.			",121,22,6,39,43,4,44

The team editor is broken so you cant change the nema or stats of your players. Some times the game fails to render icons during the matches. There is also no way to affect the starting positions of your players. That means that custum players are meaningless because you migh end up with your blockers on the end sides and runners on the scrimmage line.

								Simultaneous (""WEGO"") turn-based games create a very specific kind of tension; you lock in a plan, and then have to sit back and watch the poop hit the fan, hoping that you guessed correctly about your opponent's moves. Frozen Cortex offers that tension in a digestible, clear-cut format without a lot of the fuzziness of more complex simulations. Your available actions at any given point break down into just a few reasonable decisions, so there's less temptation to agonize forever than with something like Combat Mission, or mode7's own Frozen Synapse. The sports mileu makes for a good pretense to have a rigid set of comprehensible rules. (Ironically, while Synapse was much like a more modern and fatal take on the Maxis classic RoboSport, Frozen Cortex, which is ostensibly about robots playing sports, is a different beast with its lack of ordnance.)That great tension can get to be too much for me in multiplayer, so the recent addition of more robust singleplayer content has been a boon.

								Frozen Cortex is simple, clear, and yet infinitely complex. With the fantastic artificial intelligence system and randomized playing fields, even single player games are constantly keeping me on my toes and learning more and more about the game systems.As someone who did not get very much into Frozen Synapse due to its complexity (facing / direction being vital elements), Cortex has instantly captured me by providing the same level of depth with simplified mechanics. As Ian Hardingham explained in a recent video, Cortex is based off a simple premise - ""If you are standing still, you control the space around you. If you are moving, you are vulnerable."" Mode 7 has done a fantastic job in creating a modern, fast-paced strategy game that keeps you guessing with every play.In addition, the music is fantastic. But I'm pretty sure everyone on this page knew that already.I would highly recommend this game to strategy lovers. It's an excellent take on the genre that provides a breath of  clarity many modern strategy games seem to lack. Frozen Cortex is clearly a labor of love from all involved, and in my opinion, surpasses and improves upon Frozen Synapse in every way.			",186,26,6,11,6,2,21

												This game is excellent. It's a simultaneous turn-based sports strategy game. Which is to say, it's a lot like... NOPE, can't think of another one.It's more like Frozen Synapse or other simultaneous turn-based combat games than anything else. I see a lot of comparisons with Blood Bowl, which, given the rules of the game, is understandable, but the nature of gameplay is VERY different.In addition to the more visible difference of simultaneous turns, Frozen Cortex has no RNG involvement once gameplay starts. The fields are randomly generated, but everything in the game plays out consistently. If your player is in position to block an opponent, the opponent will be blocked. There are stats, but they don't apply as percentages, they're fixed modifiers.As much as the devs have added small touches to distance themselves from the real sport, the basic goal in a match is a lot like American Football. There's an endzone at each end of the field. Your team's endzone is behind the opposing team, and you want to get a player into the endzone with the ball. Along the way, you can also pick up additional points from lit-up ""score pads"" placed around the field. The score pads only give you 2 points each, while a ""goal"" (touchdown?) for reaching the endzone is a comparatively large 7 points. This makes goals the more important focus, but in close games, hitting an extra pad can tip the balance in your favour.The online community is relatively small, but the nature of the asynchronous gameplay allows for matches to be played over long periods of time. You don't need to be online at the same time as an opponent in order to play, and with options for email notifications, you don't even need to log in to check if your opponent made a play while you were at work (or playing something else). Most of the people I've met in-game have been friendly and helpful, and I've learned a lot from a few people more experienced than myself, as well as passing some of those lessons on to others.

YouTube™ Video: Frozen Cortex: Let The Action Begin! 

			Views: 125		

			Today I check out Frozen Cortex from Mode 7 Games. This is a cool turn based straegy game with a future sport setting. Very fun!		

Frozen Cortex is a surprisingly engaging and complex strategy game. Based in a sort of future sport you have to work out a way out play your opponent. When your players are moving they are not able to attack other players but they can tackle the ball carrier for example. So you need to watch the lay out of the map to try an position key players to just block access. Set up points to intercept any potential passes and of course set up so get the ball to the goal area. Each turn starts in a planning phase you plan you move and keep adjusting it accordingly until you are happy then lock in your move. The game then shows this is nice action sequences until an event of import happens such as the ball being picked up. There's a lot to think about every turn which makes each plan critical. Trying to read the map to work out areas the ball cannot be thrown too because of obstacles or players, trying to control area on the map while also attacking and defending. It's pretty great and I'm really enjoying it!			",334,70,4,49,75,9,62

												I want to recommend this game, but I can't.  I want to LIKE this game, but I can't.A deep, rich strategic experience in a novel format (i.e. future sportsball)?  Practically auto-sold on this game.  After playing through the tutorial, I get the basics of how to plan turns and such, so I move on to the Basic League.Here's the thing, though:  this game does a terrible job of explaining itself.  I know how to move my bots, but not why I should.  It takes me a couple games before I realize that the goal of the game is less ""get the ball in the end zone,"" and more ""figure out what your opponent isn't going to expect or counter, and do that,"" but I STILL don't know how to reliably gauge what are good options or plays.  Half the time it feels like whatever I simulated during the Planning Phase doesn't work out -- bots don't block like I expect them to, or (more importantly) chase the ball carrier like I expect them to.   The bots have half a dozen stats that aren't even mentioned in the game tutorial/help (nor shown in the tabular Free Agent view).  I still don't know what the hell ""Halt"" does.Undeterred, I move on to the regular League, hoping that will give me more options for managing my team between games.  But then I discover that I have the worst bots in the GCL, and my salary cap goes up by a paltry few hundred dollars per win while the free agents' ""expected"" salary shoots up by over a thousand dollars per game week.  So, I'm basically stuck with my starting lineup of losers and mostly-losers, facing off against teams with all green (positive) stats -- my bot tackled an enemy bot who literally shrugged it off and walked past because his RESIL was maxed.   I'm playing a game that appears to be about outmaneuvering/out-thinking an enemy when I am unable to estimate the outcome of a play and don't even really know which plays are good ones, AND my guys are the worst bots in the League?  The only way out appears to be to grind losses until I get better at understanding how to make the best plays possible with my awful lineup, and after 15 losses I don't think I want to play anymore.I think part of this could be made better if there was a better strategy guide to the game, but I didn't see anything like it online.  There was a section of Mode7's forums devoted to Frozen Cortex, but there was nothing useful there.  It's a shame, the game seems like it has a great depth of strategy to it, but it's too obfuscated and inaccessible to new players.			",36,30,0,13,2,2,2

												Game seemed OK. Took a few hours til I mostly won easy standalone missions.Tried single player campaign. Mostly won the first few. Then it seems impossible. Can't improve players stats. Cant figure out how to earn money to buy better players. The other teams are faster, tougher, stunned for less time etc. Then its not possible to win. The interface is confusing and no guides or docs exist. uninstalled.Forums are dead. No support.			",14,6,1,7,2,2,21

												tl;dr — Simultaneous-resolve turn-based sports game. If you like(d) either Blood Bowl or Frozen Synapse, check it out. If you're looking for a game that you can play with friends over long-distances that doesn't take a lot of time or emotional commitment, check it out. Mode 7 does great work, and nervous_testpilot's soundtracks are always top notch.If you hated FTL or Binding of Isaac (or any of the games I mentioned above), you may want to pass. And if you're on the fence, check out Northernlion's preview of it. He gives a good idea as to what the game is like.And now into the nitty gritty.All in all, I would recommend Frozen Cortex. It's highly addicting, really fun, and the games are short enough that you can play one on a break or with minimum time commitment. Bonus, it runs on my toaster of a laptop. The controls are snappy and responsive with no noticeable input delay, and the interface is simplistic and clean. The background designs are gorgeous, in that whole cyberpunk future kind of way, and it's fun to see my old friends from Frozen Synapse making a return as coach icons.That isn't to say I don't have my gripes with it, however. Overall, the game is not new player-friendly. That isn't to say it's not fun, however. It has a learning curve that is relatively short, but steep, and hopefully players will go looking for assistance when they confront their frustrations rather than making smear posts on the forums.Frozen Cortex can be absolutely rage-inducing at times. If you've ever watched (or played) sports, you should already be aware of the feeling of watching a good plan come crashing down. It'll happen. More than once. Get used to it.Once a match starts, there is no RNG. Let me repeat that: there is zero RNG. People will complain that the enemy blocks you more than you block them, but it's a matter of using the tools you have available. If you know what you're looking for, you will never be blocked the entire match. Plain and simple.However, there are RNG elements to the game. The pitch design is randomly-generated from a seed. Feasibly speaking, half of the map may be cut off from passing routes; corners may be entirely sectioned off and unavailable. End zones may have only two available avenues of ingress—and both of them may be blocked by the other team's defenders, with no way to pass them other than by risking them intercepting a pass.The robots you have to choose from to upgrade your roster also appear to have randomly-generated stats; again, probably from a seed. In some modes, it appears that the opposing team's stats may also be randomly-generated, going from either junior varsity or the monsters from Space Jam.My main gripe about the game is that the ""standard"" difficulty should not at all be considered ""standard."" It's really ""hard"" mode. You're given a team of tired, limping robots and expected to pull wins out with them—with better robots available based on your performance. So if you can't pull out a lucky win, by the time you get to Week 4-5 of a Knockout season, you're in hot water, especially if (again) you get a pitch that the more maneuverable opposing team can better take advantage of.In a similar vein, why the developers consider Knockout mode to be the ""primary game mode"" puzzles me. The other teams in that mode are not single-elimination (they come up with some nonsense about how money's tight, so if you lose *at all* the season's over, GG no re).Meanwhile, one click over, there's a much more ""normal"" season of 14 weeks, then a two-week single-elimination playoffs. I highly recommend this mode over Knockout, especially for starting players. The teams are on a more even playing ground, you can manage your money and hire better robots in greater numbers if you know how to bet, and the game doesn't automatically send you back to square 1 if you make one mistake.I find the match length rather short, furthering the ""roguelike"" moniker that if you make one single mistake (which may come down to a coin flip, even in the best of situations, if RNG just happens to stack that way), you will likely find yourself in an unrecoverable disadvantage. Furthermore, since we're human and the AI is not, one error often leads to another made in haste and frustration, while if the AI makes a mistake, it coolly carries on. This is why I said if you hated FTL or Binding of Isaac (or similar games), this one may not be for you. There *will* be times that you're put up against overwhelming opposition with no way to counter and a pitch that hampers your every move while the other team goes trolloping around. And you will lose. And if you're on Knockout mode, that's the end of your season.But then there are the times you get it right. The times you land your blocker right in the runner's path and he kicks a robot in the gut, catches a pass, and lobs it back across the pitch to your runner on the far side, who squeaks out an easy and uncontested 11 points in a single run. There will be the times you'll punt it away only to run up and sucker punch the guy who claims it in the jaw. Those moments are priceless.Last but not least, I feel like the tutorial is incomplete. This may be intended. There are parts of the interface that go unmentioned that can take a lot of the mystery out of the game, for better or worse. For example, the movement node is filled with color if the intended move can be completed without risk of any other players coming to block them. Nowhere is this mentioned in any of the tutorials I have seen as of the time of writing this review. It means that new players are going to get frustrated because they don't know all of the tools available to them, and that's not even factoring in the simulation mode that Frozen Synapse players are already familiar with.But all that complaining aside, I still recommend the game. It takes a bit of figuring out what modes you enjoy most, but once you've got some practice down, you'll be throwing long passes with the best of them. Moments of rage pillowed by hours of fun.Bonus: You get two copies when you buy it, so do yourself a favor a bring a friend along for the ride. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								Highly recommended. This is Mode7's second game. It continues along the same path as their previous game: Frozen Synapse. It's a simultaneous turn-based strategy game, both players take their turns, then the game plays out their turns simultaneously, and they see the result. The previous game, Frozen Synapse, took this idea to warfare. It was a somewhat difficult to grasp, rather complex game that was also incredibly tense and rewarding.Frozen Endzone captializes on the lessons learned from Synapse and focuses. It doesn't quite dumb it down, though there are less options. It simplifies in the service of clarity, and provides players with a limited toolset that allows for a wide variety of strategems.Forget the aesthetic of sports, it is just that, aesthetic. It's a reason to present the tactics available. This is absolutely not a sports game. This is a strategy game, in the vein of Chess, digitized for the modern era in a way that's not possible with physical board pieces.Each player controls a team of robots, and each of those robots has a unique set of stats that govern how fast they can run, how widely from where they stand they can block, how widely they can intercept, etc. One team starts with the ball nearby, and must pick it up before the turn is over. A turn ending occurs at an event, such as picking up the ball, throwing the ball, catching the ball, turning the ball over, or when a specified length of time occurs. The rest of the offense (that didn't go for the ball), can wait in place, allowing their block radius to have meaning, or move as much or as little as desired (they can also wait, THEN move). The defense spreads out, or converges, or whatever they feel necessary. Their objective is to ""block"" the player with the ball, catch the ball instead of an intended receiver, or force the offense into ""punting"" by throwing it to the ground somewhere.The player with the ball has two choices, he can immediately pass the ball, anywhere not blocked by a ""high"" block. He can try to get it where another player can catch it, or throw to the ground, hopefully at an adventageous position for his team (or at least not too advantageous for the other team). He cannot pass backwards. Alternately, he can run, and if he does so, he cannot pass again until a turnover occurs. If he runs, he must go forward at least (3?) blocks in a specified time period. The rest of his team can block, if standing still. He either makes it to the end zone, a period of time elapses without making it, or he is tackled, and loses the ball.The period ends when a team moves the ball, held by their own player, into the opponent's endzone.What's thrilling about this is how quickly the tables can turn. I was cautiously moving my offense up the field, passing the ball. I saw an opening to ground the ball near the endzone and pick it up with another player. Unfortunately, I miscalculated the distance, I realized that player was about to get blocked, and saw an opponent near my endzone, unguarded. I scrambled a player there, but it was too late, one endzone to endzone pass later, I lost.This probably sounds complicated, it looks it, written out. But really, one 5 minute tutorial and it should all make sense.I have not yet played much, but I'm already hooked. Highly recommended.			",353,94,12,41,24,6,73

A Paladin’s Review: Frozen Cortex. No Friends Allowed In The Endzones.Genre: Simultaneous Turn Based Tactical Sports Strategy.Developed & Published by: Mode 7Platform: Windows, Mac and Linux.DRM: Account Login for Multiplayer. Offline Mode Available for Single Player. Steam.Business Model: Base Game + Optional Tiers. Copy Gifted By A Friend Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSimultaneous turn-based Frozen Cortex is about a futuristic spin on football. It’s a mix between American Football and turned-based strategy. Teams will have a planning phase to decide the strategies and a playing phase to see the outcome of what happens. Each team has five robots that battle it out to get as many points as possible within 12 turns. All robots are controlled by either players or AI and follow their commands to the letter. Score as many points possible within a short period of in-game time and you win. The majority of the focus seems to have gone into the multiplayer, with a ranking system and ease of access to get a game going between friends or strangers. There’s a reasonable if somewhat shallow single player campaign that can tackled as well. But I wouldn’t get Cortex just for it. Single battles also exist if you happen to play offline and want to fight an AI opponent. They added, post-launch, a new mode called “Cortex Manager”. It’s a complex simulation of a league season where the player is tasked with managing a team. For the most part, games play out in about 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much time players spend in the planning phase.Strategy TalkEvery game plays out in 12 turns. Sounds simple enough, but there’s a decent amount of complexity to keep it from being boring. Points are scored by either getting the ball into the correct endzone (7 points) or by getting the ball to special pads (2 points) randomly placed around the field. The field itself has randomly generated obstacles that change the routes you can run and pass the ball around. These obstacles can block player movement, trap a player in a corner and prevent the ball from being thrown over them if it’s high enough. Each turn has two phases: the setup phase and action phase. The setup phase is done on the player’s time. During this phase, the player can plan out their next action(s) as they attempt to figure out what the opposing player will do. The action phase is where the assigned actions will play out and the results shown. The home team gets the ball and has three passes per possession. When they run the ball, they can no longer pass it until the next possession. When making moves, the players can be positioned, sent in any direction they want and paused in a certain place for a period of time. However, the turn lasts as long as the ball is being run or until a robot catches it, gets tackled by the opposing team or the ball is picked up off the ground. Long throws will create a turn pause when the ball is halfway to its destination. Robots can’t tackle other robots unless they’re carrying the ball. They can only block opposing robots if the original robot is standing still and the passing robot is within range of their block zone. If a robot intercepts or tackles another robot for the ball, they will be immune for a short duration to allow for a running or throwing play. After a player gets the ball into their endzone, the team’s positions are set back to the original places and the next team gets to take the ball first. The end zones and teams swap places every time there’s a score. By the 12th turn, if the losing team has possession of the ball, the game will continue until they score a goal in the endzone or they lose possession. Otherwise, the game is over.MultiplayerMultiplayer in FC has a ladder you can climb and four casual modes of play. Random stat robot teams, duplicate robot teams, standard games and quick matches. Standard games let you set your own team up from the multiplayer customization menu. Getting into a game is quick and easy, whether it’s with a friend or stranger. There is basic chat support for conversing with each other. Play-by-email is also supported. You can even load previous games you’ve done and watch them again. Frozen Cortex’s multiplayer community has all but died 10 months after the game’s initial launch. You might be able to get a game or two during prime time hours but the rest of the time it’ll be quiet as a tomb. Which is unfortunate and makes getting FC for the multiplayer not a winning proposition. It’s why I’m largely conflicted over whether I should recommend this or not. If there’s no one to play it with, what’s the point of buying it in the first place? PC Settings, Bugs and YouTube IntegrationOptions are a bit of good and bad. For resolutions, the game gives you fullscreen on or off but when Fullscreen is activated, it goes to Desktop Borderless mode. There’s a quality slider which manages all of the other related settings, allowing it to be set to minimum, low, high and ultra. Ultra is incredibly resource hungry and doesn’t quite work on Linux or systems with low amounts of RAM. I myself had framerate drops running while running ultra. I would say that high is good enough to not need ultra. As you’ll only use the mouse and a few keys while playing, there are no key rebindings. Controllers are supported I might add. FC also includes notification options, three different colorblind options and other miscellaneous settings. Multiple audio sliders are here including master, SFX, Music and Main Menu Music. Of course, you’ll turn music all the way up to maximum, right?Final ThoughtsThe game of Frozen Cortex is fun to play and an interesting take on futuristic Football. For someone who has never had much interest in the sport, FC is a bit of a surprising title this year. It has at least a decent amount of tactical depth in matches and the manager mode to keep things different every time I played. So, the game itself is worth playing if you can get friends to challenge against. But that’s the trick. The multiplayer community is small and getting smaller by the month. I’m also not sure that the developers will keep supporting it outside of keeping the server online. Even if the server does go down, there is an offline mode but I don’t think this game is worth getting into if all you’re ever going to do is challenge the AI. Plus, the occasional bugs and crashing that occurs is a bit annoying to deal with. The story isn’t anything worth experiencing either. But the game mechanics are solid. So, there’s my opinion on Frozen Cortex.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com] ",242,50,2,39,45,3,56

												Okay who isn't a sucker for Robots in ANYTHING? Seriously?Frozen Cortex explores this with a slight twist on American Football. You control all the robotic players on the field in this turned based strategy game. Never knowing what your enemies move will be. You must guide your robots to dominance over many turns. What makes Frozen Cortex really riveting is developing a strategy and seeing it unfold. Rather that be success or devastating failure. While the rules are simple as is the playing the game. Planning the right formation or pass takes mastery over time. With a plethora of customization options, from teams to map editors. Frozen Cortex has everything one would want in a sports game. The only issue I ran into while playing the game was excited clicking through some replays and missing them. Did I mention the friggin robots?I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												If you loved Frozen Synapse then you probably already own Frozen Cortex - if you don't then go buy it. If you didn't like Synapse then you probably won't like Cortex - you can likely just ignore it.For those who do not know the first ""Frozen"" game (which fortunatley has absolutely nothing to do with the movie) here come some facts:Frozen Cortex is exactly what the description tells you:""A hard-hitting simultaneous-turn-based tactical game from the creators of Frozen Synapse. Defeat your opponent’s plans on a randomly-generated playfield in this brutal futuresport.""A simultaneous planning, turn-based strategy game of right positioning, reading or predicting your opponent's moves and a constant back and forth between risk and reward. All that packed in a futuristic, football-esque battlefield where robots are the athletes and you are the coach. Plan your moves, simulate your opponent's moves if you think you know what s/he is about to do. And think about what your opponent thinks you think that s/he thinks... No dumb luck involved except if you come across a bug once in a while. (those are being reduced patch by patch, they really put some work into it after release!)If you are uncertain wether this is for you, there are plenty of gameplay videos out there and you probably just need to watch one or two in order to know wether this might be something for you or not.

								I bought this game together with a friend who loved Frozen Synapse, I however never was able to get into that game. With this game it is different. The vibrant colours and the amazing animations make this tactical game a nice view for the eyes. The music of the game is as the music of the previous game. The game is turn-based and requires your input every round. You do not however need to be playing the game for the entire round. You can do a few turns in the morning before work / school and come back after to finish the game.The gameplay is solid. After playing through the Tutorial levels the game can feel a bit weird to the touch, but after a game or two I really started to get the feel of the game. I started making good passes and blocked some amazing runs made by my friend. After starting a game versus a more experienced player I learned some tricks.You are able to create your own team and give them names and stats. You give negative stats to get points so that you can invest positive points into your teammembers. In the future you will be able to change the looks of the players, but now that is not possible.I recommend this game if you are looking for a good tactical sport game. The turn-based system is nice if you lack the time to play a lot of games, but dont forget that it can also be played in one sitting. This game is going to receive more changes so be sure to check them out.			",211,61,3,38,35,3,58

								Honestly. I think the game is great. defo going to be one to look out for. love playing the game and enjoy winning. A few ideas to bounce off to you guys. Maybe some more customisation in your players and equipment. maybe voice commentators to call the game while playing. give the real time feel that your in the moment.  I also notice that their are few ammount of turns to play during a league match. try to change it but didnt work. maybe have your players earn like expericance points for like tackles and touchdowns. to boost you players skill level. just seem point to keep buying players that are better later. maybe a sub bench and like injuries to the robots, like body detachment or cpu melfucation. give it yet again a more real like at how the game is played. considering there robots they will pack more of a punch then humans. also.. a suggesting. maybe have like the traps or trap doors in the game. like a robot can get push down a hole in the floor or player gets on a emp mine.. and fumbles. just suggesting. but still i love the game and it as alot of potentail. can't wait to see the full game release.

												It's a good game and I do recommend it, but I have one criticism: the online multiplayer.The game is set up so you can take effectively as long as you want to plan your move. You can start several games, which can last days, and just enter your move in when you feel like it and go away while you wait for the opponent to make their move.The problem with this is that inevitably people forget or get bored waiting, and I'd always start games with someone only to have them make one move and never be seen again. I get that the point of this game is that you can spend time carefully planning your move: but there needs to be a way to keep people online for the duration of the match because in my experience, once one player logs off, the game will never be finished.At least, this is what the game was like when I first got it. Now there are only ever a couple of people online at a time and they never accept game requests. Probably people got frustrated and just stopped playing the online version.Having said all that, the single player mode is good, there are options for single matches, tournaments and a career mode, and the AI is pretty good (at least compared to me). If I remember correctly, I got the game on sale, and I'm not sure its worth nearly £20, so maybe wait until its a little cheaper.			",52,17,1,4,9,2,3

												A solidi turned based football game that makes you think moves out ahead of time rather then just focusing on skill. I do like the various modes in question, and the announcers add some life to the game, even if there's frustration on some difficulty at times due to the nature of the game in question. Definitely better for those who like strategy games with a human on human element. For more information and gameplay:

												Strategy was actually rather lacking.  Most of the novel features don't seem that novel or important to the core gameplay.  The core gameplay itself is rather boring or poorly executed and confusing.  The window dressing of managing your team and its repair could be a saving grace, but is not in this case.  Game does not succeed at being a strategic game, nor as a management sim type game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For a game that spent what seemed like an eternity in this static state where nothing seemed to get fixed (with turns taking up to 2 minutes for AI to make simple decisions, massive lag (the game still lags occasionally, but it's rare and not every turn like it was in Early Access), dead multiplayer and limited singleplayer features and a crap tutorial), they did an AMAZING job in the end. Somehow, some way, a recent patch fixed everything wrong with this game. When it was released from Early Access, it was still a game lacking in many features, but then one day, a smorgasbord of features and bug fixes was added. I didn't even really have hope after a while because it felt like the game went nowhere for a year, but this is its final form. It's practically almost perfect. It's multiplayer is bustling whenever I'm on, but I don't really play it, I just play the single player. I'm not far in my season, but the season/franchise mode finally brought a reason to play single player. And it's really good, albeit suffering from ""don't-know-what-to-do-itis"" due to a lack of a good tutorial about what to do. The AI doesn't take painstaking amounts of times to decide to move 3 pixels: it's rare that the AI takes longer to take a turn than I do. I'll recommend this game to anyone, a BIG switch from barely 4 months ago.			",109,20,9,5,11,4,22

												I have been looking forward to this game for a very long time and it finally went on sale and I grabbed it. However, I'm so late to the party that this game is pretty much dead.The single player campaign has potential as a team manager-style game but if you want to actually direct your players you'll be in for a long wait because the AI takes forever to make a decision. This is especially frustrating when the only move is to pick up the ball that's two steps away, but it takes three minutes to come to that conclusion.The online multiplayer seems to be this games primary way to play, but at this tail end of it's life, there's noone left to play against.The match finding system tells me that I should be playing a multiplayer game in the next 60 seconds, but has so far failed to find me a match EVERY TIME.Would have been a great multiplayer game in it's day, now there just aren't enough people wanting to play and it's just too darn slow to play single-player.

												We're getting there. The game is a lot of fun to play and editing your team works on both Mac and Windows now. Singleplayer has been added. It's fun inside the matches but there needs to be more depth added to the actual league modes to make them more interesting. The game has improved by leaps and bounds since I wrote my previous review. Honestly, if I could get a game going more often and saw some active multiplayers leagues going I'd consider anything else a bonus at this point. The league functionality appears to be on it's way as there is already a button for it, there just doesn't appear to be a way to organize/create one at the moment.We're probably in the 7.5-8 status with the potential for the game to become a classic.The soundtrack is really strong, but you probably already read that in other reviews.

												Well thought out. Simple. Easy to understand, decently complex. Matches are short, but the planning is long. For the first few hours, then Frozen Cortex becomes obvious, easy, and dull. No personal investment in your team because you just buy better robots instead of developing ones you have. Once you've basically figured out what to do the AI is too easy. Playing human players really doesn't change the level of engagement, at least for me. It did not feel satisfying to win or frustrating to lose to another human being.			",26,5,0,17,13,1,20

You can grind for a long time and finally upgrade, but again, not fun.The story seems irrelevant. There are no story choices.The core gameplay is good, but there's a lot of ""he knows that I know that he knows that I know I can't run here or...""

												I actually bought Frozen Cortex on accident prior to Steam's newer return policies, and was stuck with it. I put off trying it for months (definitely DON'T consider me part of this game's target audience.)I finally booted it up today, and enjoyed learning how to play the game. I actually was a fan of Frozen Synapse (despite not being particularly interested in a sports translation of that game) so the mechanics were a bit familiar.I'm trying to stick with it despite throwing my hands up repeatedly. AI seems frequently to (A) run straight in to your guys, thus giving up the ball or (B) hurling the ball in to some far distance of the arena (even straight in to the end zone quite frequently). This kind of nonsensical lack of actual strategy heavily impacts the game as you really have to constantly think about what bizarre things the AI will do to try and take advantage of the sport's lax rules. It's not even really the AI's fault; this is simply what the rules of the game lead to as it's better to take a chance flinging the ball towards your goal line when things get tough.In short, the sport they've invented here is missing some rules. Watching it isn't exciting, and playing it feels more like a test than a game as you're fighting to keep it from degrading in to just throwing the ball huge distances and seeing who picks it up first.You could do worse it seems - I think the team behind it probably worked very hard - but an element of fun seems to be mostly missing. Just seems like the title they used to kill time until Frozen Synapse 2 is in full swing.			",62,6,0,5,4,1,6

								I completely enjoyed Mode 7's predececessor, Frozen Synapse, and it's nice to see the team deliver another blow to the strategy genre. However this around, they boldly tackle (no pun intended) a new concept, sport.Sport? Does that work with strategy? Strangely yes, It does completely! Whilst it is only currently in Beta, I would love to see the direction this game takes, as in its current state it is already fantastic. The soundtrack has to be one of the most calming aspects of the game, to mellow you out from a stressful loss. It still reminds you, it's only a game. The ambience in the game for such a competitive sport and game type is contradictory, but at the same time compliments it.I praise Mode 7 for sparking up the strategy genre back for me, as quite franky, the genre started to get dull.

												This game is basically a mixture of the dev's previous game, Frozen Synapse, with Bloodbowl.  It's a simultaneous turn-based strategy sports game with a lot of depth to it.  The aesthetics are nice, the soundtrack is amazing (I seriously think it's as good if not better than Frozen Synapse's amazing soundtrack, and the soundtrack tier of this game is totally worth it), there's a lot of customization for the teams, and the gameplay is challenging and satisfying.  I'm also a big fan of being able to take your time to plan your turns and continue your game whenever you want.  Even though the game play seem fast and brutal, you have all the time you want to come up with devious strategies and then see how it all unfolds.  What's even cooler is that since it's turn based and you can come back to your game at any time, you can have multiple games with various people going at the same time.			",287,35,3,52,21,1,51

												First of all let me just say that for heavens sake buy the soundtrack tier! I expected greatness from Nervous Testpilot and he delivered. Excellent stuff!Oh, the game is good too! American football meets Frozen Synapse = Frozen Cortex. It has many same elements like simultaneous turns, arenas with walls, mind games etc, but the mechanics are very different. The limited options that the units have makes the game less about the individuals and more about how you work as a team. You need to have a game plan, not endless patience simulating every possible move the opponent might make.When you really get down to it, i don't think Cortex has as much depth as Synapse did, but it's okay - Cortex is a different kind of breed and requires different kind of thinking. And it still has that ""Yes!!! Just as planned!"" joy to it.Some may have wanted this to be Frozen Synapse 2. Why? It doens't need sequels, its already an excellent game with little room for improvement. And it hasn't aged one bit. I'd say play them both! This dev makes unique tactical games and deserves our support!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually really like this game which is odd because I normally have trouble getting into strategy games. Frozen Cortex however is a cool idea of taking a turn based strategy style game and giving it a sports theme, which to my knowledge hasn't been done since Bloodbowl.It takes the notion of having many different ways to score ranging from super easy to complex, making you think out your moves even more than ever. Frozen Cortex also has a simulation mechanic that allows you to simulate plays before you commit your players moves. And random generating maps create different matches everytime, unlike other strategy games where veteran players memorize the maps and know where to plant characters everytime on that particular map.And it also has many Sports elements as well. You have team customization, individual player stats, season modes, even the ability to a create a pitch and play on it. and even better, it actually has a single player story. and its surprisingly good. I've never seen a story in a sports type game before.but my favorite feature is the cinematic camera, that makes things look so cool to see individual plays. And it also has a ""watch full replay"" mechanic at the end of games that allows you to watch a whole match play out in the cinematic cameraIf you're looking for something different from strategy games, give this game a try			",389,77,2,41,23,5,75

												I like this game. Don't let the sports facade fool you; if you like turn based strategy, this game has a lot more depth than first glance suggests. Full disclosure: I was on the closed beta, so I've had more direct contact with the devs than your average player. My perspective may be biased. As a fan of Frozen Synapse, I was expecting more of the same this time around. The first couple weeks of testing showed promise, but the sports theme turned me off, and the absolutely brutal AI made it difficult to enjoy. They've since tuned the AI and match settings to be more accessible at the beginning, and even more ridiculously difficult at the highest levels. The real breakthrough for me came when I started to understand all the rules of combat. It IS a strategy game first and foremost, with a sports veneer. Winning is downright satisfying, since you know you'll never be handed a cakewalk. You start to accumulate tactics and tricks that give you little advantages here and there, and that depth is where it shines. The game becomes yours. The waypoint system is polished and intuitive, the graphics are clean yet pretty, and the cameras and animations are very satisfying. The music is excellent. There is a story that pops in and out of the single player leagues; you can engage with it, or skip over it as you see fit. It's interesting flavor, and gives depth to the coaches, but not mandatory. The multiplayer features are robust, and it's nice to be able to take as much time as you want to make your moves. Player-organized leagues. Multiple simultaneous games aren't unusual, so you'll never have to wait for a game. Email notifications of pending turns, YouTube auto-capture and upload... nice polish features. It's a tight, aggressive strategy simulation that's easy to understand quickly, and has room for complex plans and tactics. I think it's worth taking a look, if that's your style of game.

								The AI could use some serious optimization (it should not take 20 minutes to do a turn), and it's not really an American Football game (no backwards passes? what is this?). But it's simple enough to pick up quickly while being deep enough for fairly complex strategy, and anything that hits that balance is worth a gander.

Moreover, team rosters cannot be edited - mousing over any players who might be 'replaced' wipes them blank, and wipes any potential placements blank, too. Meaning that you end up with a team of blanks every time you try to edit.I've tried blitzing gfx down to minimal, running it in a window, rebooting, having nowt else going in the background, turning wifi off, turning wifi on, ermmmm... verifying game cache... But, basically, it's knackered. WILL NOT RUN on OS X. Big disappointment, particularly (duh) as I spent my food money on this! OOps.

												There's so much wrong with this game I don't know where to start.-Blocks only work if you're standing still, so you can't ""tackle"" other bots.-AI will always move to counter to your plan, no matter what you do they will predict it.-Interceptions are the only way to stop a catcher standing still. If your bot moves in to stop him, he'll be kicked away.-Interceptions only work when they want to. Sometimes you're not in the path of the ball and you intercept, sometimes you have 3 guys infront of the catcher and they let it past.-The AI will hail-mary as soon as they pick up the ball and because their bots are so much faster than yours, you will never be able to stop it.-No team development, just replace old bots with better ones.-You can't afford better bots even if you win every game. Which you won't.-Can't pass after making a run.-The only way to win singleplayer league is through passing onto point zones. Any run you make will be blocked.-You won't win singleplayer league anyway.+Playing against a human might be fun, at least their bots will be as dumb as yours.Seriously, buy Blood Bowl instead. It's got more depth, actions work how they're supposed to, you develop your team instead of just replacing them, RNG may be a factor but at least you know why something didn't work.

So many times I ploughed through that game only to declare the universe as being intrinsically unfair as a simple mistake cost me a good hour of careful planning, only to have to start over again. The illusion is that next time I'd get it right. I'd shield the doors earlier, or make sure to stock up on extra missiles, or avoid saving the crew of a ship on fire. The futility of the game combined with the (somewhat illusory) sense that I was in control kept me coming back. It was only when I could get through to the end of the game regularly that I finally lost interest. Which brings me to Frozen Cortex. Frozen Cortex is what you get when you cross American Football with Frozen Synapse - which is in turn what you get when you cross chess with guns. I really enjoyed the idea of Frozen Synapse, but I never could fully immerse myself in it (Hell is Internet multiplayer...) I haven't had that trouble with Frozen Cortex, already rocking up close to 30 hours of game time. The funny thing is that there's really not a lot to Frozen Cortex. The entire game consists of short matches, with each player controlling 5 robots on rectangular arenas populated with various obstacles. It's simple enough to grasp, simple enough to control, and a tiny mistake can undo hours of meticulous planning. Any given match can be thrown away from incorrectly guessing what an opponent would do, and that makes knock-out mode all the more difficult. Because the games are so short, minor mistakes have those major consequences. Screw up on your own offense, and it's virtually guaranteed to be game over. Misread your opponents and it can be similarly difficult to come back during your own. The game's annoying habit to ""pause"" the turn halfway through a touchdown pass can often be just rubbing it in that you didn't realise the opponent had that option open, and there's nothing to do but slam the PRIME button and hope there's still enough time to recover. And there are many ways it can cost you. A slightly mistimed run means a key player is knocked out. Throwing to a player too close to an opponent gives them no time to act before they are tackled. Passes that get intercepted. Having your player slightly mistime an interception. Moving to the wrong side of an obstacle. And of course, all these are compounded with scoring pads littered throughout the arena. They are only worth 2 points (compared to a 7 point ""touchdown""), but a good run can cross several pads at a time. One particularly bad example was a robot that could just sneak around an obstacle for an unguarded heavily-padded run to the end-zone. It's that futility that like in FTL: Faster Than Light keeps me coming back. I didn't see that play. I'll be mindful of that next time. It's with that attitude I've been able to beat the game on season mode (and opened up interesting variations), but haven't quite gotten through a knockout comp yet. The game is cruel, uncompromising, punishing, and that's what makes it such a rewarding experience.			",295,51,6,43,26,3,44

												Conceptually, the game is very cool and innovative. It's interesting enough to have a decent single player experience. However, because multiplayer is simply a dead/dieing community (most people I have seen online at one time is 6-7 people), I cannot reccomend this game, as the replay value is very limited. If you think you might enjoy it, pick it up on sale (50% discount or higher).			",80,11,1,20,15,1,19

												I've got to be honest, I love turn-based strategy games, but I don't like this. I simply don't have the patience for it. It's Words With Friends meets American Football.The client user interface is clunky. There's an IRC chat room frame. You can't quit games. Only the pre-rendered cutscenes are fluid. Everything else is actually quite clunky. There's also no time limit on turns, so you're waiting around a lot. It can also take a while to find a multiplayer game. In single player, the AI takes a good while to make up its mind about what to do.There's a reason the basic tier included a copy for a friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is not worth the money. On the Pro side it is a cool idea with a sleek polish that makes you think a cross between football and robot wars. What you get is actually an AI who will always guess your moves, ALWAYS. Even if you wait for it to finish it thinking and change all of your players to different patterns and plays the AI somehow is never left at a disadvantage and more likely than not will come out on top thanks to its superior omnipotent guessing skills. Also starting off you are given bots(players) who are 4/5 all negative in skills....negative. So prepare to play season after season of losses or barely scrapping wins until you get enough to buy decent players and actually enjoy any sort of gameplay.I thought hey maybe all this is just because the AI is terribly coded and the online play will make up for it. Well here is to 3 days in a row logging on and searching for a game to be told no one online wants to play. For the price of decent mid range game I expected a lot more. I would not recommend spending money on this game.			",179,23,2,36,38,5,64

												""Hey guys, what if we took a radical far-future setting and aesthetic which we've already developed extensively through our previous game, the intellectual legwork done to create a convincing yet unique narrative context, aswell as a more refined persistant faction-type upgrades system and oodles of customization options, and made it about SPORTS.""I'm glad to see they'll be returning to Synapse for a sequel, and I think a lot of the things they tried to do here are actually pretty cool if a bit cringey, and hopefully they'll be able to develop them into full-fledged and functional features for the real game.Bought for OST, do not buy without extreme sale unless you like robot stop-motion football, in which case jump off a bridge go nuts.

A Rather Frustrating PVP ExperienceThis is a GREAT GAME!! But I've down-rated it?Frozen Cortex is one simple patch from being an incredibly good, strategic, turn-based, futuristic sports sim. Bloodbowl meets Speedball; US Football meets XCOM. Poker meets electronic Chess! And this has no RNG - winning is all about second guessing your opponent.There's a unique twist here as well, not only do you 'lock' in your own moves before your turn; you also get the opportunity to program in your opponent's too. And he / she is probably doing the same.You both then get to see how the play might unfold based upon your own strategy and that which you've ""anticipated"" for your opponent. Then you COMMIT and watch the playback.

			Views: 18		



So why the downvote?Well, there's an option to play games a turn at a time. So you can play one turn today, and come back tomorrow for the next. Kind of like play by mail. Put there I assume to compensate for the times when not many are online. Sounds like a good idea? No.With the multi-player PVP community what it is *cough*, you'll often find you take healthy lead, and the other player simply logs off. The next turn ... never comes.I said there was no RNG. That's technically incorrect. Winning a match is just as much about your strategic brilliance as it is hoping you get lucky with an opponent who is willing to stick around for a full game.

												Frozen Cortex is an interesting concept game, but it is far from a fully realised management experience. So much is missing from the single player league part - from a proper, nice interface to any kind of sensible development of players.If you want to try the concept and perhaps have a go at multiplayer, go ahead and buy it. If you want a fully fledged single player experience, don't.			",11,8,0,10,9,2,30

												I will admit that it is a very unique concept. Simultaneous turn based ... robot football. Which I believe is a great concept that worked well in their other game Frozen Synapse (simultanous turn based strategy game). But I felt it didn't work too well in this format. The animations are nice but everything still felt slow and outdated. Also I felt the camera control and angles are not the best.			",45,7,1,8,3,1,13

												I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!If you're a sports or strategy game fan; or both, this is the game for you. It has a slight learning curve that might send some running, but if you're willing to learn the ins and outs of the game and your patient, you're going to find a very fun, intense, deep strategic sports game (set in what looks like a cyber punk future). Not only is the game great, but the devs were cool enough to give 2 copies of the game if you want to play a friend. You can play LAN against a friend or challenge people online, the game even has a play by e-mail feature if you and you're opponent don't want to stay at the computer all day, while you wait for each other to make a move.I'm very happy with my purchase. The game does have one bug that I hope gets fixed. If you run the game on easy mode and then try to upload your game to youtube, it crashes all the time, the same if you just want to save the replay locally.			",117,30,1,35,34,3,53

												I don't really have anything to say about the game in detail that will improve anyone's insight with regards to purchasing, but this game was a breath of fresh air. Very interesting concept that, gameplay wise, was a pleasure to play casually. Unfortunately, the player base numbers and decision to not do multiplayer leagues made a main part of it redundant. Also the single player campaigns don't really do enough. The career manager mode just doesn't pick up with any discernible speed and in all honesty, I found myself preferring to just keep playing single games with balanced teams.Great game. Such a shame that come actual release, the train came to a halt and no one really knows about it now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- No hot seat mode to play with my family on my minix tv box (Windows 10 + mouse). - The game runs too slow (minimum graphic settings).- Too many options I can understand when I try to start a new custom game. Settings for custom game looks like was made for programmers.- The game crashes when AI player is thinking. I didn't finish any game. And the AI thinks up to 5 minutes.- I don't think turn preview is good idea. I spend too much time to test my turn before prime and that calculation is annoing.- This game was made for Frozen Synapse users whos spend hours for each turn and it's not funny when you have family and just want to relax with beer and to play legue with friends and family. I mean one does turn and the rest of players can't see what he doing. We play Civ and Heroes in the same way.So this game need to be reviewed and improved if it have to be attractive for most of people.[Updated: 23/12/2016]Please guys, let's create the game more attractive for us players. I can apply micro transactions or to pay again for updated version. It's worse when you want to play but you cannot.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think game has a lot to offer and is very interesting take on stategy games in general especily thier multiplayer aspect. I have played good few hours and game kept my intrest well matches last aproxumately 20 minutes so it is easy pick to play one match during some spare time. I have made video review of a game that talks more in detail about it's features You can see it here:

								Been playing this game since the first public beta back in December 2013. Being a big fan of Frozen Synapse I knew I had to give this a go. At first I thought ""There is no way this is going to be better, it doesn't even have any guns! How is it going to be more intense?"" I'm glad to say that I was immensely wrong. This game takes everything great from Frozen Synapse and takes it to the next level in every way. Don't let the slow pace fool you, this game is very intense. Loading the outcome of your turn to see if your opponent saw through your plan or not is a really intense.Seeing your game plan work out and successfully fooling your opponent and running across the endzone line is one of the most satisfying moments that I've experienced in any game ever.The fact that you always get two copies when you buy the game makes things even better, so grab a friend and get going. This is a game that I highly recommend! If you have never played Frozen Synapse or any other similar games, I encourage you to give this a try.			",263,39,15,18,26,4,53

												I'm a big fan of Frozen Synapse and FS Prime so I thought I'd give this a go. It's the same kind of gameplay but my immediate reaction was that it looks like american football which instantly leaves me cold. This may seem like an unfair reason to give a thumbs-down but that's my personal opinion. It's like Mode 7's ginger stepchild, I see no reason to choose it over FS, FS Prime or the upcoming FS2 (which I'm very excited about).And no trading cards?			",328,120,1,15,29,4,75

												I was fooled into buying this game by the publisher, not realizing it was early access at the time I jumped at buying a sequel to Frozen Synapse. This was before steam refunds so I was stuck with a buggy empty ""game"".Not really saddened to hear that nobody is playing it and that it was a commercial failure despite the fact they're trying to sell it for almost one hundred euro.

												Out of the 3 hrs that it said that I played.  I was only  able to play for 15 mintues . Multiple crashes to desk top and system reboots I guess that counts for playing time.  I hope they fix the problems its seems enjoyable game when I was able to play. Do not recommend.			",14,1,0,1,2,1,10

												I got this game by donating to the Yogscast (https://www.humblebundle.com/yogscast-jingle-jam)Sadly I didn't have so much fun with Frozen Cortex as I have with all of the others... the tutorial was confusing, I spent a while even trying to locate the tiny ball, the AI took an age to calculate their moves and when I tried to re-watch the entire match, the game just crashed.The game crashes at the end:

Early Access Review
								Update: well, it looks like they rolled out their first update few month after the release, but nothing really changed. They renamed the game and that's basically all we got. Oh, and some camera update. You may downvote me, but the truth remains and it stinks - this Early Access sucks and may never be finished.Original: Unfortunately, I was really hyped for this game and swallowed the Early Access hook easily. Well, I shouldn't have. It was fun at first, despite some bugs, poor optimization and strange predictions. But since the launch of Frozen Endzone in Early Access program, the game did not receive ANY updates.It feels like the beta is dead and developers bailed on it. Maybe I am wrong, who knows, but the community does proof this point: player activity of Frozen Endzone dropped dramatically and there are no more than 2-3 players online now.And that's my point. Even though the game has some potential and can deliver fun, alas, it is dead at the moment. If it does resurrect and the developer will continue to work on it, we might receive a good game. Not great though, because few mechanics here are broken, but that's a whole different topic.			",149,21,2,15,8,1,16

								They did not give me 2 frozen synapse complete packs.  The purchase description says you get a frozen synapse complete pack with the mega tier.  Then it says for the ultimate tier, you get everything in the mega tier PLUS a frozen synapse complete pack.  That means you get TWO of them.  I contacted steam support and they said I only get one frozen synapse complete, no discussion or offer of refund.  So I guess they have trouble reading english.  There are plenty of others ways to get games than from steam.  And is this why we support the developers like Mode 7, so they can lie and steal their customers money?  I supported this game with a green light vote and kept my agreement of purchasing it if steam made it available for purchase.  I would rather deal with Gamestop selling me used games as new, because they let employees open games and play them, then reseal and sell them as new.  At least they didn't rob me of an agreed purchase.  There is a reason your customer support has such a high volume steam.  It's because of you, the developers, and publishers have shady business practices.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								A surprisingly fun strategy game from Mode7 that takes a few steps to split from what one would normally expect in a strategy game.The big draw is the simultaneous turns, which really builds a new metagame and there is a lot of satisfaction in correctly reading your opponents moves, or mis-directing them of your intentions. Being able to sim out possible scenarios, it's possible spend 2 minutes setting one turn up, only to be deliberating for an hour about the next; the best part being that either is fine thanks to the multiplayer system. An elegant 'correspondence' style multiplayer means that you input your turns actions, commit and go check out any other active games you have and input turns for them whilst you wait. Notifications pop up to inform you when new turns are ready to be played and it's a very nice and relaxing approach to the format. Beyond that, the visuals are nice, soundtrack top notch and is made by talented developers, so I am looking forward to seeing the future life cycle of the game. Lets hope more people pick up on this and really get the community booming!			",113,15,1,25,5,3,16

								Loving this game. There are some unique, interesting tactics that come out of both game modes, and after mostly playing in the beta I'm excited to see the effects of individual stats for your robots.Also really looking forward to starting up some leagues with friends. Great game to play if you're busy with work, as you can just leave the window open and take your turn when possible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Simpler than Frozen Synapse. The turn based system feels very clunky at current beta. UI was improved, but still not as sleek as I like. If you love strategy and tactics, there is no reason you should pass on this title though. If you're impatient, don't buy this as the pace is slow.			",279,49,3,23,15,3,35

								Great soundtrack and a very fun strategy game. If you like Frozen Synapse you'll probably enjoy this. Only thing it needs is a solid single player mode and some more players online. I find myself logging in, taking my turns, and then quitting upon finding out no one else is online currently.This isn't always the case but it can be discouraging and it'd be great to have a single player campaign to play while waiting on a game.
