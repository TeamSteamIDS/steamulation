												If you gonna make a mobile port game, don't forget that WE CAN'T BUY ANYTHING IN GAME!Seriously, I bought a new ship for 40 Red Crystals, and that was too expensive already, considering that We drop like 2~3 crystals per stage, and I already started with 30. But after one single stage my ship got damaged, and I had to wait 20 MINUTES for life regen!!! Or pay 1 crystal (which I didn't have) for quick regen. Great game: play 2 minutes, wait 20 for another round!And you also can't select/confirm options with the controller. I'm using Xbox 360 controller and I got to use mouse to click on boxes that appear in game. The controller only serves to maneuver the ship left and right while you're ""racing"".Dont buy it, untill they port it correctly. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have won this game in a lucky drawing. Firstly first picture is wrong, there is not such thing as ""Striking a shattering blow against devilish Robot"", that is Episode 2, which looks it was planned to be added, but since the game is no longer at Early Access and is showing at many bundles now I don't have much hope for it. The game is almost 50/50 for me, if devs will introduce next Episode(s) I would be more then happy to change my mark to possitive.This is an arcade game.Advantages:-good optimisation-runs under Linux-trading cards-nice graphics (and nice girls)-crew and upgrades (although only 2 ships to choose from)-enjoyable but difficult at some times-optional grinding levelsDisadvantages:-short (my time is time it took me to end the game - see also beginning of this review)-leftovers from flash/android platform like time waiting, premium crystals (although devs ware able to remove all microtransactions and crystals are nicely introduced into the game)-there could be far more content (like different guns, more ships, maybe artgallery) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
