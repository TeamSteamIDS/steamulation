												To gamers who wants to try this game. Please 'o' please don't listen to these imbaciles giving a negative reviews of a proper racing simulator. Starting things off, there is currently no way you could enjoy a proper racing game without investing time to set it up first. Look at those negative reviews, they barely even scratched the iceberg with 0.2/0.5 hours of gameplay? I've been playing a lot of racing simulators so I know my way around setting it up.Now, ehem, this game is a lot for a free game. Heck you get all 4 licensed for not a single penny! They put a lot of effort in this game, especially in the FBB I love how it feels, how the car slides, how you lose grip when you hit a curb. The graphics is by far descent. I'm playing with n i3 and a GTX750 and I can run it max, talk about optimization. The AI is just wonderful, clearly a large amount of effort was put into this. (Now I think you're saying why are they saying the AI is bad? Well did you actually think those players are good? Food for thought) Bottom line I say, if you have a gaming steering wheel you got to try this out. I know you have interest in simulations since you looked this up, I know too you are more capable than these fools that complains just about everything. And to the Devs, well done sirs and madams well done.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I actually don't get it why this game has mixed reviews! Only %68 why? The game is free, actually completely free. it has better ai then Assetto Corsa for gods sake. I hope this game gets good reviews and updates. If you have questions Ask me below :) Pros It has wheel setups, choose your wheel and game helps with the setup. It has decent AI drivers. (After many many many updates Assetto Corsa still doesnt have good ai drivers at all) Cars are fun to drive.  Can use the stick shifter and shifting light for G27. (After many many many updates Assetto Corsa still cant use the shifting light!) Couple tracks + Couple cars. Optimized good. Can run the game at max 1080p60fps easily! Decent simulation - racing game.Cons Graphics are a bit old. i actually dont care that much I cant make it show the map in race mode Brakes seems to be overpowered. Cars can slow down suprisingly fast. Engine sounds etc. lets say not the best but still playable :)Edit: Pros and Cons edited for easier reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An awesome simulation racing game but you arcade racers out there better buckle up too. Why? Because you can adjust the options to turn this into an arcade racer! Please do not be the one to look at a few negative reviews and then not get this game if you like to race you would be missing out on a lot. I even adjusted the keyboard controls and its completely playable PLAYABLE ON A KEYBOARD!So for everything I have tried in this game including the night time racing I would have to give it a 10/10 I mean its not that often you get a game this extensive that is ACTUALLY FREE! You read that right FREE meaning NO MICROTRANSACTIONS! The devs deserve the rightful praise of this game because of what they have done.Thank you if you read this review in its entirety.

												Limited content - but EXCELLENT content. No F2P mechanic, it is a small game. A few cars, and a few tracks. This is a legitimate free game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's basically a demo to Stock Car ExtremeAlso, why are people saying the controls are bad? Just go to the options and fix them, this is not a new concept!EDIT: Change the camera with home, insert, page up, page down, and end keys... Why are people struggling with this?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As soon as I loaded this game up, I knew exactly what I was in for. Developed by Reiza Studios, the same folks behind the excellent Game Stock Car 2013 (Extreme now) and Formula Truck 2013 series of games, this is pretty much the same thing, but on the Brazilian stock car circuit. While not familiar with the Brazilian circuit myself, I thoroughly enjoy the aforementioned games, and anyone else that is familiar with those will feel right at home as well. This is mainly the reason that I am able to write this review with such little play time on this at the moment! So on to the gameplay! Once you're behind the wheel of either of three different car manufacturers (for now anyway), you'll see the familiar gMotor 2 engine used with these games, from the HUD to the ever-so-lovely shift/rpm gauge. Of course, these can be turned off (thankfully), which gives you a more realistic sim experience, if that is your cup of tea. And yes, you can change the view from the default cockpit! This is found in the Options > Display menu. There are a multitude of other settings that can be changed as well, from the number of cars seen on-screen at once to graphical settings. Most gamers with mid to high range machines can naturally max out these settings, as the graphics are not quite up to the same standards as Asetto Corsa and the likes. But, to me anyway, they look pretty good right out of the box, so to speak. This can also be said for the car handling physics, which are the same as other entries from Reiza Studios. And that is to say that they are some of the best that I have experienced in any racing game to date. Again, those that have played the games I mentioned know what I am referring to.In summary, if you've played the other games Reiza has offered, you know what you're in for, and will feel right at home once you're in the game. If you're even remotely interested in racing games that are more of a simulation, then you should definitely give this a try. And heck, even if you don't like racing games, give it a try anyway. After all, how can you go wrong with a free game, especially one of this magnitude. What are you waiting for, add it to your Steam library right now!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is an amazing Racing Simulator. The controls are quite nice and smooth, even with my crappy old racing wheel. Graphics are OK, they aren't PS4 standards... They feel... 2010'ish, but still pleasing to look at, it works for what it is quite well. The customization and options are unbeliveble! You can change a lot of stuff to your liking, even on the camera, it's the first racing game i've seen that you can adjust the angle of the third person camera, its really neat!The game suffers a little bit on the HUD department tho, kinda barebones and there isn't a map, like other racing games usually have (unless it's hidden on some option menu i havent found)... also, the menus aren't the most intuitive and user-friendly, you will have to spend some time to fiddle with the options to find what you need, but when you get everything set up to your controller, it will be a blast!Some people seem to have problem playing with the keyboard, but since i played with a racing wheel, i cant say... even tho the game has a lot of options, with some patience, you probably can make any controller work fine!If it had multiplayer i would gladly pay for it, it's a really nice game!

												I can't really believe this game is free. I'm a big fan of Reiza Studios for their other sims (GSC Extreme and FT2013) which I have since their original release (before it was on Steam) and this small team gave us some of the best sims for years with those titles. And Copa de Marcas is no different, it's a great sim of a cool racing series with accurate models and tracks.If you are looking for a true sim, look no further. Try this game and look for the other titles from Reiza Studios as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only after 1 hour I can recommend this game to all people with Touring Car expierence or equalent PC simulation expierence.The game offers the complete Brasilian Touring Car Championship for free, but be aware, to be competetive youll need a few hours each track to find the perfect car setup.

												Excellent for a free title with 4 cars and 6 tracks. It's basically a mini version of GSC base on the rfactor engine. All those people who rate this down should understand there's a difference between racing sim and racing game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Recommended only if you don´t already own Race07 or rFactor (or you are in love with the depicted brazilian racing class).Pro´s: - runs on a potato- 6 tracks to choose from (all brazilian)- sounds on par with Race07 & rFactorCon´s:- dated gfx (on par with Race07 & rFactor)- no Nordschleife- no MP- cars feel frustratingly easy to drive ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this game before its steam release and it made me fall in love with pc racing games. It doesn't have much content, However it is essentially a free demo of Game Stockcar. It runs on the same engine that GSC and Rfactor use. It is amazing quality for a free game so I would suggest to anyone unsure about buying games like rfactor or GSC play this. It is the perfect introduction to the 2 games and their interface. One of, if not my favourite free game on steam			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I had a quick go, no driving aids no adjustment to wheel settings yet and still found it drivable. So don't listen to anyone who says it isnt! Lots of understeer and poor line, but thats because i havent got a feel for the car or changed any settings yet:(Sorry for no sound on the video, I don't know why shadowplay didn't record it)


YouTube™ Video: Copa Petrobras De Marcas 

			Views: 367		

			Quick demo of game (no driving aids) no sound (im not sure why shadowplay didnt record it)		

It drives well, good FF (though i havent adjusted to my taste yet) and an extra series of racing for my collection that I didn't have previously. Looks nice enough, though it isn't RaceRoom or Asseto Corsa and the like, seems a bit older maybe like rfactor? - notsure as i havent played that ether). Sounds are pretty good on the car i drove, nice representation of Intellagos but beware the added chicane just before pits! Great for free, many thanks to the devs.6.8 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
