												This is a unique air hockey inspired game. The gameplay is fun. The characters are amusing. It is apparent there is much replay value to this game.The gameplay is great. Each opponent you face off against has a special shot they perform once powered up. The opponents you face in the beginning don't have very tricky shots but the shots of later opponents are very intense and hard to combat. You can play a variety of modes against each opponent. There is a simple duel mode in which you battle your opponent up to a certain amount of points. There is also a bet mode in which you can bet up to a set number of coins on the match. A survival mode is also available where one strike against you results in the game being over.The unlock system adds complexity to the game. Mallets and pucks of varying abilities are able to be unlocked. In fact you can unlock the mallets your opponents use to unlock their shots. There is also a leveling system in which you unlock different coin boosts for the particular modes.A couple minors gripes I have are the lack of multiplayer and some annoying quirks of the characters. When you score on characters they perform the same action upon every point you win against them. So their catchphrases can get old quickly. However, you can just play a different character upon getting too annoyed.Overall this game surprised me with how fun it is and I feel I will be sinking many hours into it.

												Well i saw this game and my first immpresion was ""OH they made a new STAR WARS game set in the cantina on mos eisley about shufllepucks"" (it was the dancer that tricked me).Anyway i was wrong but someone on the development team must be a STAR WARS fan,i mean look at the dancer pure STAR WARS anyday and the same can be said of what a few of the others characters look like to.Anyway i must say i love this game its such an easy game to get into but it will take a while to master it and get used to all the games little quirks.You start of having crashed into the desolate planet (and you completely wreck your ship) that the cantina is on and from there you proceed to the only building in sight which happens to be the cantina.To get of this rock you must play shufflepuck against the inhabitants of the cantina and win,therefore earning coin to buy better pucks and other equipment and in the process also earning medals and also the right to buy profile pages on the competitors.Now you need to buy all these to challenge the characters to a shufflepuck duel to earn their spaceship piece and therfore get back home to good old EARTH (think thats where you come from,never do you take your helmet of so anyone could be under there even good old ALF who knows).The graphics are good for such a small download and so to is the music and the only thing that lets it down is the story-there isnt really one just to earn the spaceship parts and leave.I like this game most because like most of my favorite games of late i just found the time passing by whilst playing and then going ""OH IS IT THAT TIME ALLREADY"" and it is just so addictive it has that one more go factor thet pulled me in.Still i cant get STAR WARS out of my head even when i think of this game but never mind.If you want a game that will slowly but surely creep under your skin with its addictivness then buy this game as HELL it did that to me.

												Air hockey in an alien cantina with a gazillion levelups and powerups... nice game but I can't shake the feeling it's better played on a tablet with a touch interface instead of on pc with a mouse.EDIT: After playing it for quite a while well... it's really grindy if you want to max everything out but to actually finish the main game it isn't too bad if you find the underlying mechanics fun which I do. It's really satisfying to achieve perfection vs the diverse oponents and their various playstiles if you like the basic air hockey gameplay. Just be sure to play it as little or as much as you want and don't go overboard and it's a really enjoyable experience.			",2198,857,88,271,225,28,362

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is a great animated 3D air hockey game.  The game is controlled via the computer’s mouse. You have to hit a hockey puck with the aim to knock the hockey puck past the opponent’s site (and to get the puck when the opponent knocks it to you). In Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe you have a modern, colorfull design, 13 opponents on 5 floors (with different looking rooms), more than 40 gadgets and equipment and and and. This game is perfect if you just want to play a bit alone. The game saves itself so you have nothing to do when you want to quit the game. You can level your own character (about 200 levels!) and there are over 350 missions and 120 mini quests you can do. If you really want to collect all achievements and to do all quests you can spend much time on that game. I would buy it always again.			",224,60,10,20,8,0,13

												******UPDATED******After more hours into the game and all floors unlocked I have to say the game becones unfair with ai using their powers as much as they like and to get any thing is a major grind. I am talking about Star Wars Force Collection grind, I would hate to see the f2p mobile version. Sadly I can not recommend due to those things.Do you like pong? Do you like Star Wars? If you answered yes to both then this game is for you! Though not set in the Star Wars universe the universe you are in is very Star Warsy even down to the cantina music. It's got a cute charm to it. Before you dive into the trenches of this game be warned first, this was originally a phone game that was free to play with in app purchases. No no, there are no IAP here, you buy the game once and that's it, but you can tell because you have to grind and grind and grind to get anything. The graphics really surprised me knowing that this is a mobile game, though it could use a little AA, it's very pleasing to the eyes. The music is hit or miss after hours of grinding your better off playing your own. The matches are short and sweet lasting only a minute or so but they are fun. You can unlock different power ups and upgrade your paddles and puck slightly. The only thing missing from this game is online play, that would be a blast to play your buddy in a pong like game.

												This is a port of an iOS free-to-play-with-microtransactions game.  It seems that the only thing that has been changed is that the microtransactions have been removed.  I wanted to relive my Shufflepuck Cafe days, not have to grind for hours to get the different types of currency needed to buy upgrades and new levels.  The game looks and plays well enough, but it's so obviously a port of a microtransaction-laden game that I just can't recommend it until the devs cut out some of the ridiculous grinding.

												Normally being a fan of more action-like games or even shooters, I am surprised of how much this game draws me in. The characters are interesting and way more multidimensional than characters in other games that are supposed to be ""main heroes"", the gameplay itself is fluid, fun, and there are a lot of things to earn and rewards to get that will keep you going.I can't recommend this game enough and I am surprised how much I like it, given how it was a ""curiosity-buy"". I am not disappointed :)Buy this.			",226,57,13,37,7,0,18

												Sufflepuck Cantina is a cute little casual game about air hockey simulation, ideal for playing in small doses. What it does it does perfectly with a smooth mouse response and clear and intuitive controls.Long story short, you play as an astronaut stranded in a distant planet inhabited by a bunch of freaks obsessed with air hockey. In order to get them help you to fix your broken spaceship you need to make youself a name as an air jockey player and beat (a looot of times) the 13 opponents. You start with a basic mallet and puck and the 3 beginner opponents, and you must grind your way up to the rest of them, their special mallets and pucks and some other unblockables, such as concept art, pieces of background for the diffferent characters, etc. Each enemy has their own mallet and puck and a special move, but the concept of the game is always the same.Some people have said it resembles Star Wars Tatooine cantina aesthetics, and it does indeed. There's even a ""Twi'lek"" girl and a guy cosplayed as Han Solo, and every alien is very Star Warsy, so if you like the saga then you'll probably find Sufflepuck Cantina attractive to the eye. Most defining trait is the grinding, which many people have complained about; there's no ingame purchases inherited from its former app game nature, yet you will need tons of ingame currency to buy everything, from access to more challenging enemies to new mallets and its upgrades. As there are only 13 enemies and the only mechanics in the game are the short, intense air hockey matches (no other minigames included), this may get repetitive after a while. You can, however, buy your classic coin doubler upgrade, which I recommend you to do first thing (there are a couple upgrades for the puck to give you money when it hits the table and the mallet).Also the lack of multiplayer really damages a game like this one, which could use it to add some replayability and extra fun. However, the developers are considering to add it in the future if they get funding, and you can read about it in the Steam forums. I had this game on a bundle so I will definitely be investing a couple bucks :p + Cute design and characters+ Addictive and tons of unlockable content+ Polished and responsive controls and puck behavior+/- Some people may find the grinding annoying, while others (like me) may find it catchy- The concept gets repetitive quickly- No multiplayer (although it could have it eventually)- Some will find 10€ is a bit pricey due to lack of varietyAfter playing for 6 or 7 hours I say it's a good game, fun and with a fair amount of content, but it can get old quickly. If, like me, you are a sucker for casual games and achievement hunting, you will sure enjoy it. If you are looking for a more hardcore game, I would advice to avoid this one, specially at full price, as some will consider it to be a bit too much for what it offers; I had it in a bundle though, so I am more than happy with the value. I totally recommed it if you get it on sale and enjoy some good old casual gaming.			",671,182,22,74,66,8,130

												An OK little game to remember the original game from the nineties with some flaws that cannot be overlooked.Clearly designed originally as a free-to-play (an insame amount of challenges, in-game achievements requiring 50+ hours of gameplay and more than a thousand matches to win, different sort of currencies, XP, slot machine, etc...), these mechanisms only strenghten the impression of a lack of content.Which is sad, because the grinding slowly kills a game that had good efforts put into it (there's decent writing, overall good controls, balanced AI). This should be a lesson to game designers: forcing the player to put more hours than he normally would have only makes him/her notice the little things that are wrong (repetitive sound design, aberrant mallet behaviour on some occasions, too many menus...).If you are bent on 100%ing games, just don't buy this one, the time you will have to spend is not worth it. For the others who might enjoy a few arcade air hockey matches, you can spend a few bucks when the game is on sale.			",293,200,1,44,28,1,29

												I hate Shufflepuck. The original game that is. Whenever i heard as a kid that droid go 'Njyy Njyy' on me when it scored on the Amiga version i wanted to throw that (expensive) monitor through the window.  It did not get any better on the misc. linux versions where the motionless poker-faced Tux the linux penguin would own my♥♥♥♥♥and take numbers while maintaining a stony faced posture worthy of Clint Eastwood. Now this game is different for us slow pokes as the system is such that there are a lot of missions to do which in turn enables an enviroment where it's possible to learn to be better (and get different equipment and special shot abilities) while collecting misc stuff. And suddenly it works.  Best shufflepuck game ever.  Kill the others with fire. this is the only one worth playing.			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

Beyond that though...wow...this is the worst case of mobile F2P grinding garbage I have found on steam. You will absolutely want to find a cheat tool or something to give yourself more currency. This is really shameful. It expects you to beat every character a few hundred times to really fulfill every goal. You'll lose interest completely by the third match with each of them. I paid about $1.21 after selling some cards and using a coupon and I still think it was a bit of a rip off.			",500,122,11,54,26,6,76

												Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe mixes the music and setting of the Star Wars cantina scenes and adds shufflepuck to it. And what do you know, it works surprisingly well.What's there to tell about shufflepuck I hear you say ? Not much really. I think we all know how it works. But this game allows you to play it against aliens and by putting power-ups on the field to aid you or your opponent. Winnings allows you to level up which results in you gaining XP more often. There's also other stuff to collect and win like coins to buy biographies of characters or better pucks. You can also scratch tickets if you feel lucky and try to gain (more) XP and money that way. Completing certain challenges (i.e. buying 10 biographies) and mini-quests also reward you with XP and money.There are many opponents to challenge, and several floors to unlock. The higher you go the more difficult your opponents will become. It actually becomes really challenging about halfway through. Wow.The only downside to this game is that the money you earn after each successful game is just not enough. It literally takes hours before you're able to buy a puck or a set of biographies. That, and you'll be playing against the same opponents for tens of games. So it's also a variety issue really. Hopefully this gets fixed with a patch as I don't see a sequel appearing anytime soon (I mean, what more could they possibly add ?). Frustrating and it makes the game a little less fun to play.Despite those issues Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe is still a fun and worthy addition to anyone's collection and I'd definitely recommend it.[Rating: 74/100]			",1658,633,69,221,194,16,225

												The game didn't look like much when I picked it up in a bundle, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.  I'm currently up to the second floor out of five, but you can unlock the new floors with their new opponents in any order(except for the fifth, which might require all of the others to be beaten by the looks of it).This is the first video game adaptation I've played of air hockey, and it feels great.  Opponents can be challenging, but so far they haven't been unreasonably hard, with most of the difficulty variation coming from their specialty shots.  There are credits that you earn by playing and can be spent on biographys to give backstory on some of the other players, and also new paddles and pucks that have varying effects on the game.The visuals are great, and the feel of being in that specific cantina that was obviously a large inspiration for the aesthetic here is very well developed.  The game is also only 65 MegaBytes, which is amazing for a game that looks like this, so no one should ever have to worry aobut download caps or hard disk space when buying this.Edit on difficulty: The higher levels do indeed get significantly harder, with oponents moving much faster and in a less predictable fashion, so there can be plenty of room for improvement.

You have a lot of things to do off the table and it doesn't get boring if you like shufflepuck. This game is for people that liked the original game and/or like shufflepuck for what it is. The biographies are nice to read, but they won't make up for a decent story driven game. Play the game for what it is and you get a lot of very good gameplay :) It's even addictive once you get into it ;)Recommended for everybody that likes shufflepuck and/or loved the game Shufflepuck Cafe! At a sale price of 2.50 $ I'd recommend it to everyone that likes a mildly challenging sport game with a lot of 'side-tracked' activities :)			",3257,1343,120,377,423,37,486

												Quite a fun little game. You are a space travler who gets dumped on some remote planet and must rebuild your damaged spacecraft. You accomplish this by playing many many games of what I would call air hockey. Tons of puck and mallet upgrades to purchase with crez ( in game currency). Plus all your opponents offer you several missions which unlock lots of urgrades and special shots you can make with the puck and mallets. Visuals in the game are very vibrant and colorful. Only played for a short while to get my card drops but I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual game to play.			",2086,880,81,241,292,20,353

It has a quest system (matches with specific modifiers) and player levels which means that you have an incentive to continue playing.

Also looks nice and is playable with the Oculus.But the very hard grinding is annoying, and the AI opponents are apparently able to use their special strike more often than you, sometimes right when the game starts, even when not enraged. Also, there is no option for turning off the bonus/hazard coins that spawn on the table.1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must play			",125,9,17,13,9,0,6

												I've been told air hockey isn't a sport. But despite that I found this game to be charming and easy to play. Basically you go around playing different people games to get parts to replace your ship that has crashed on some planet and you need to build a new one to get home. For a game as simple as air hockey the graphics are really nicely done. And the cast of players different with their own play styles and charm. You have to unlock parts of your opponents biography to progress through the game.  As you go up to nicer floors the competition also gets tougher to beat. There's 3 game types duel, bet, and survival. And the missions each character will give you are missions of the survival variety. Although I genuinely enjoy playing this game it fails to give you a unique variation of missions / quests. In later missions it might change the puck you have to use but the developer could have had missions where you were forced to play with a mini mallet or puck, maybe some style of collect the most coins, just a missed opportunity to make the challenges more than ""beat this player in survival mode for X amount of goals.""This is my go to game when I just want to play something casual. If you're an achievement hunter be warned that even though it's got plenty missions and goals and all that good stuff this game is a grind. Don't expect to get everything in 20 hours. Heck I've already spent well past 60 hrs and I'm only at some 75% completion. Multiplayer is also something that could have been a good addition to this game but perhaps in a future sequel the developer might consider it. If you see this game in a sale I'd recommend picking it up. It's something to do when you're not looking for something casual and pick up for a couple minutes at a time.			",460,285,7,85,41,7,68

A lot of characters and plenty of additional options and features (mallets, pucks, achievements, missions, challenges, etc.) add surprising depth and immersiveness to this rather simple game. It adds unexpected complexity and addictiveness to a rather menial game. The graphics are also super nice for an air hockey game. Especially the NPCs are really nicely designed and come with distinct personalities which makes them quite likeable. Unfortunately the sounds are too repetitive and they may get annoying. If I had to hear one more ""ohnonono"" from Furry I would've probably broken the screen. The worst thing about this game is the lack of multiplayer. I mean, come on, it's air hockey, imagine how cool multiplayer would have been! Leaderboards can never compensate. If it had multiplayer, it would've been a great game. Otherwise, it's just good.

												This game is very simple, but yet surprising.  You're basically playing shufflepuck over and over again against various opponents trying to save up enough cash to buy spaceship parts.  But each player is unique in the different special moves they do and the games are surprisingly challenging and faced paced as you make your way up in the world.There are also ""missions"" that help you to earn a lot of coin so you don't have to play shufflepuck for years to beat the game.  Plus, you get to learn about all the strange characters.  I like this game and it's many, many nods to Chalmun's Cantina on Mos Eisley -- though you'll have to mute the song after an hour or it will drive you insane.			",55,23,1,10,28,4,14

												[TL;DR -- An unexpectedly addictive and beautifully presented game, well worth the $7.99-$9.99 USD price-point in my humble opinion.]Though not a regular player of Arcade games, I thought I would make a foray into the genre when I picked up the newly-released Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe (SCD) for $7.99 USD. The game consists of playing Shufflepuck (essentially air hockey) against a series of increasingly challenging opponents to win points and money (known as ‘Credz’), ultimately in order to build a new spaceship to return home to Earth. Although a fairly simple premise, the game mechanics are well executed, and the opponents are sufficiently diverse to keep the game interesting and fresh as you progress.The game takes place in a five-level Cantina, where Shufflepuck is the key form of entertainment for patrons. The graphics are crisp and polished, with each area of the Cantina having its own style. There are indeed no loading times, and the player can seamlessly travel between each level of the Cantina via an elevator. Four of the levels are populated by three opponent characters each (with the fifth level devoted to a single ‘Boss’ opponent), as well as bystanders and props. The activity in each area is sufficient to bring the game to life, but is subtle so as to not distract the player.Each of the 12 regular opponents have unique mallets and pucks, as well as unique ‘special moves’, which the player is able to obtain and use as they progress through the game. The different special moves employed by each opponent adds greatly to the challenge of the game, as the player must adapt quickly to avoid defeat, particularly when required to face a series of different foes in attempting to complete each character’s ‘mini-quests’. The Shufflepuck matches are challenging, particularly those which require the player to concede no points over the course of the match. There’s a genuine sense of achievement in a flawless 15-0 victory against a difficult opponent.As the player progresses, more points and Credz are amassed, as well as Tokens. Points are used to determine the player’s Level, which provides bonuses, as well as to rank the player amongst their friends and the global playerbase. Credz are used to purchase items from the Store, such as puck and mallet improvements, as well as the biography of each opponent character. Tokens can be exchanged for points or Credz via a ‘prize machine’, which involves a random-chance card-flipping interface akin to a slot machine, and may be subject to bonuses derived from your Level. The character biographies are well thought-out and consistent, and provide a back-story to the player to explain some of the feuds between characters the player will notice during the game. SCD does not have a narrative or story arc in the way that many FPS or RPG games do, however the character dialogue and biographies do a good job of filling that void, bearing in mind the context of an Arcade game.All-in-all, I am very happy with my purchase and got a solid 20 hours of entertainment before finishing the core game missions. No doubt it would require many more hours to achieve 100% completion. The game is executed to a standard well above what I expected, indeed well above what I would expect of any new 3D game at the $9.99 USD or below price-point from an independent game developer. I would recommend to all, but particularly those who are fond of Arcade games. This game is fun, challenging and accessible, and at less than 100MB download, you’ll be able to jump into it almost immediately.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great remake of the old Shufflepuck Cafe from the late 80s. The gameplay is simple and fluid. The graphics are nice and unobtrusive and working well with the atmosphere the developers tried to create: the game now takes place not in a Cafe but a Cantina on a desert planet - very reminiscent of a similar establishment in a certain wretched hive of scum and villainy. Even the music fits.The game has recieved some sense of progression. The cantina has multiple floors and you need to earn credz to purchase access to them. The patrons you can challenge all have little quests (which basically require you to play even more shufflepuck), unlockable background information and eventually you can earn their special equipment and skills.In a way recommending it is like recommending Pinball: can you see yourself playing the same thing over and over and over and having fun? If the answer is yes, then yes, the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended.			",204,127,0,73,35,3,64

												Yes, it's Shufflepuck Cafe.  In 2013.How MUCH like the original?Well, I keep doing the thing where you'd smash the puck, only to have the baton or whatever it is called get in FRONT of the puck, and then I move backwards to reset - and smash the puck into my own goal.  That happened on the original, and it happens here.The 2nd floor has a good remix of the original tune.Now, there are extras - you have to collect parts of your spaceship and thus play a lot of games vs. the characters, rather than just get to Biff via playing various others.  Also I haven't seen my favorite, the character who'd get drunk gradually and then you'd beat the crap out of him because he was WASTED.  Oh wait, maybe he's on floor 2 - maybe he's the insect that is at the bar there.The little guy with the eyes is named 'Furry' and he is essentially a cat. There are biographies of each type, and quests.The ONLY problem with the game is there is no Paranoimia cracktro on the front.  Felix Schmidt's music on that is brilliant and I kinda wish it was in the game somewhere.Also, yay this was in the shop so I could buy it.  I never saw, or was given the option to purchase, the original, in stores or elsewhere.Yes, I like this game (:			",299,123,6,52,39,5,98

												8.4/10 - Shufflepuck. More fun than saying it 3x Fast!In my world this is called Air Hockey, but most Air Hockey games suck... so smart move with the rename! However, this is the best ""Air Hockey"" game I have ever played for sure!I really dig this format as opposed to the classic tournament style. You basically challenge people in the room to various games. Once you earn enough cash can rep you can move to the next floor. There are lots of opponents and floors along with 30+ special features to unlock. The actual gameplay is fluid, very challenging and you can choose between a variety of modes. I keep coming back to this one because of its fun gameplay but I rage quit after almost every session.Worth $5-10; lots of replay value!

												Okay, I have to say that whenever I make reviews I try REALLY hard to find a way to recommend the game or show it in a positive light. So, first off, if you like air hockey games, then get this game. It can be very enjoyable and has a long life span. This life span, however, is allowed because of one critical feature.It's all about the grind.OMG the grind man. If you are like me, and used to grinding, then this should not be a problem.I primarily have been playing this game for the cards so I can also unlock (the super insignificant chance of) booster pack drops. I have to admit, this is the first game that I have purchased and am seriously considering not playing to get all possible badges. I do not like air hockey THIS much. I've read reviews that this was originally an app game, and that makes sense because I've played other air hockey games for the touchscreen. That works REALLY well. I don't know if it's my mouse sensitivity (I play on 3200 DPI with +2 acceleration {whatever that means; it's REALLY sensitive}) or if I just really, really suck at this game, but the grinding for me is taking especially long. I don't know if I can do it.Here's a taste of what you have to go through:There are multiple floors in the cantina, each with new, harder opponents than the previous floor. On the first floor, there is a small alien dude who keeps periodically saying: nonononono, and I want to stab him so badly because it is so annoying. There is a dancer alien girl who I haven't played yet, and there is a robot bartender. Cool.You play the bartender, and let's say you win 4 points to 2 (it is first to 4 on the first floor at least) in Duel mode. You get around 100 or so currency points. A new puck costs 5000 points. A new mallet (the thing you hold) costs 5-15 thousand. Seriously. WTF.Also, you can unlock biography codexes for each character, and after ALL the biographies of a character are unlocked, I'm guessing you unlock that character as a player(?). The tutorial explains that you will get their paddle and their unique skill. For example, the robo-bartender has a really annoying dodge shot skill where it will bank left or right and suddenly then go straight. Did I mention that there are 19 (NINETEEN!) biographies for the stupid robot?!Oh and did I also mention that all of the biographies (except the 1st one, I believe) cost 500 points?That's at least 9000 points. OMFG.If you are proficient in this game, it should go by pretty fast, I guess. If you arent, like me, then you will hate this game.There is also a gambling feature that I feel is seriously trolling me. You unlock these gamble tokens that you can use to reveal face down cards, and the bonuses are nice, however, if you reveal a skull, you lose everything you've revealed (including the tokens you spent). I swear I have gone 2 consecutive prizes ONCE, every other time, the skull is second to be revealed. I want to give this a recommendation, I really do. But I just can't, so this will be my first non-recommendation.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was never a big fan of this game back in the Amiga days, when it was merely Shufflepuck Cafe. Now the joint has been upgraded to become a Shufflepuck Cantina Deluxe. The core gameplay is the same, PC air hockey, and while it is extremely simple to play, it's anything but simple to beat the majority of your opponents.Now featuring upgradeable pucks and mallets, along with the ability to acquire special shots (so your opponents are no longer the only players with tricks up their sleeve), the game now offers quite a bit more to tweak the core gameplay. There are also more opponents, although the difficulty level ramps up a lot more steeply than it did in it's earlier Amiga incarnation. Acquiring the necessary credz to purchase upgrades isn't limited to just beating your opponent. There are also collectable credz (as well as experience points) on the air hockey table itself, plus there is some kind of alien fruit machine available to try your luck on, in order to win extra credz and experience points.The Cantina itself features 4 floors, with 3 opponents on each floor. As you earn more credz, you can purchase access to the other floors, where tougher opponents and greater rewards await you. There are also other items for purchase, such as concept art and biographies (in 18 parts) of each of your opponents. Purchasing these all help towards your ultimate goal, acquiring enough parts to repair your spaceship and return home.This is a strangely addictive little game that is perhaps a bit pretentious in it's execution. It's almost like the developer wants people to think it is more than just air hockey, as if that alone wouldn't be enough to interest people. The bottom line is it IS just air hockey on the PC, but that isn't a bad thing, many of the best video games are due to their simplicity. That said, i only purchased this because i had a coupon for it, bringing the price down to £1.75. I think it is a good and i do recommend it, but only if you get one of these coupons or if the game goes on sale. At £2 it's great value for money, but at the full £6.99 price i don't think i would be recommending as much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great concept, lovely environment.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of variety in the first few levels of the game, and I doubt that changes later on.  Nothing is really enticing me to progress.  It is a fun casual go-to for some shufflepuck tho.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=acceptable 5=lovedGame design: 3/5  It's just shufflepuck.  It's done well but it is mostly the same thing over and over.Tone: 4/5  Great atmosphere for the story and game style.Personal skew: 4/5 I don't know many games that revolve around shufflepuck, and I've enjoyed this one.

												For some reason, this was an incredibly addictive game to play. Nice gem in the dust. I mean, it's virtual air hockey, kind of hard to go wrong with that. But this game made me get annoyed, made me jut my hand in the air from victory, and other things associated. I'd definitely play this when I'm bored, or like as a mood booster. The only downside is that it's a little grindy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
