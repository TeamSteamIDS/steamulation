												I'm sorry but I can't recommend this game.I think the graphics are good enough, the game options decent (career mode, quick play and online) and customisation options are nice as well (once you unlocked them by playing a few games).What I dislike are the controls and the physics which are by far the most important aspects of the game. Issues with controls:Playing with a controller felt clunky and not intuitive to me so I mainly used keyboard & mouse controls. You always control all 4 of the poles at the same time which may result in unwanted shots on your own goal if you hit your own player while moving the mouse. I would like to choose which poles to move at any given time so I can position my defense while attacking with the middle and attack poles for example. Hold buttons 1 and 3 to move pole 1 and 3 or hold button 4 to move only pole 4 for example. There could be issues with keylocking keyboards but maybe there is a way to implement something like this. The expert mode kinda tries to do this but only seems to work with a controller.*EDIT* With the latest update (v1.03) some changes addressing this issue were introduced. While I haven't gotten to test them out myself (still waiting for a demo to avoid the buy-refund-cycle), they seem to be a step in the right direction. At least the developer seems to be involved with the community and striving to improve the game.Issues with physics:The ball behaves weird and the hitboxes sometimes feel a bit odd. It doesn't feel like the ball is truly rolling around the playing field and it sometimes gets stuck, diverted or slows down without an obvious reason.I really wanted to like this game and waited a long time for a game like this but this just isn't it... yet. It sure has potential and I will gladly give it another try if it gets updated and improved but for now I will have to get a refund. Asking price (at least with current 30% discount) would be fair if the game wouldn't have the issues I mentioned. Unfortunately I can't enjoy it in its current state. :/A demo would also be nice...

												Foosball: World Tour:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This game sends me back to my childhood! I actually used to have a Foosball table in my bedroom (“Baby-Foot” in French - go figure!) and used to hold tournaments with my close friends. Boy, this was fun!Foosball: World Tour is a casual Football game simulation where you play the world game (Football) on a specifically made table with four rods on each side of the table: 2 rods in defence, 1 rod in the middle field and one rod for the attack. The aim of the game is to score the most goals against your opponent on the other side of the table.  On the single playing mode, you will be able to play in 20 different locations around the world. Each location will have a certain level of difficulty (from easy to master), different types of table (French, Retro and more) and different type of balls.  You will have a variety of objectives; it may be the first one to reach 10 goals, or you may have 10 balls per game and whoever scores the most goals win the game.At the end of each game you will be awarded up to three stars; accumulate as many stars as possible and you will be able to unlock trick shots, such as snake, pull, tic-toc and pin shots. You also can customize your foosmen from Mafia to Hotdogs!It will take you a little bit of time to get used to the controls regardless of whether you are using the gamepad or the mouse and keyboard. Whatever you prefer to use, expect accidentally score plenty of own goals for your opponent, which can be a bit frustrating! The graphics are decent and you have a good soundtrack.Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Fun to play-	Unlock trick shots-	Single and online mode-	Good soundtrack-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls will take you time to master-	No Single player tournament-	No trading cardsFoosball: World Tour is a fun and competitive game; it will no doubt bring you some great memories!7/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.
