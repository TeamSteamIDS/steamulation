												PROS:*Good weapon variety*Good enemy variety*Good boss variety*Good environment variety*Freedom to explore, though the game is not quite an open world*Exploration is rewarded*Kind, helpful, and involved developer*Virtually free of bugs, at least in my experienceNEUTRAL:*The game could use a few more puzzles to break up the usual gameplay*No real replay valueCONS:*Enemies are sometimes bullet sponges and do not have health bars*A few locations could use an extra checkpoint*Direction in the last third of the game can be unclear*Ammo among weapons is shared perhaps a little too much*One missable achievement is a little unfairGAME LENGTH:A completionist should require 6-7 hours.  Those who just want to finish the game might be able to do so in 4-5 hours.SCORE:7.2/10I am the sort of gamer who, fearing scarcity, hoards useful items and ammo in anticipation of difficult battles or the end of the game.  Unfortunately, one can never be sure if the particular game that he is playing is the type that rewards that strategy or the type that does not.Spaceport Hope does not.I hurt my own enjoyment of the game by using the primary gun (weak and overheats, but has infinite ammo) 95% of the time outside of boss battles.  If you buy this game, I strongly recommend that you do not hold back as much as I did, though you might want to hold on to the rocket launcher and beam weapon ammo for bosses.I also waited until quite late in the game to explore the other planets, assuming that there would be some barrier to progression and that the plot would take me to them eventually.  Again, learn from my mistake:  most of these planets are totally unrelated to the plot and free to explore, often containing a health upgrade, new weapon, or both.  Visit them as you see fit.If I hadn't made these mistakes, which were based on assumptions I made because of my experiences with other games, I would have been better able to enjoy the weapon variety.  Besides the starting gun, there are 11 weapons to be discovered, given, or created, including a flamethrower, machine gun, grenade launcher, and the curving beam weapon seen in the trailer.  Some of these do share ammo, so using it all up on one weapon may make another unavailable, but ammo can be found sitting in the environment or as a drop from enemies, albeit a little too infrequently for my tastes.There is decent variety among the enemies as well.  You'll find classic enemies that try to walk into you or shoot at you from a distance, but you'll also find ghosts who can fade out and reappear at your location, eels that randomly shoot off electricity or charge at you when you get close, machines who hide behind armor if you shoot them too much, aliens that leap into the air to try to crush you, and more.  The most noticeable problem with the enemies in this game is how much health some of them have, which is ironically more noticeable because enemies do not have health bars.  I acknowledge that my poor choice of weapon may have had something to do with this, but there are enough enemies (some of whom can become invincible for a time) that I don't think that I would have had enough ammo for the other guns to deal with them all anyway.  These bullet sponges can make some areas tedious to pass if one tries to kill them all, so I recommend running past them when appropriate.  At least they don't respawn until one moves to a new area.Bosses are also varied.  There's a boss who shoots at you as you platform your way up to his arena while lava rises below you, one who can only be harmed once you've charged up some pylons on either side of his arena, another whose projectiles must be knocked back at him, and many more.  They all look different and have a few different attacks and none of them comes across as unfair, though the final boss is considerably harder than any of the others.  But the game does feature 3 health packs that must be used from the inventory and totally restore health, so the final boss is manageable even if one is going for the achievement for defeating him using only the starting weapon.  If you want more of a challenge in general, I recommend that you avoid using the solid beam weapon against the bosses, as it makes very short work of a few of them.With a water world, lava world, labs, a prison, and more, you shouldn't tire of the environments, either.  Additionally, the enemies and bosses all seem to fit their environments, so there will be no moments where you are pulled out of your immersion--at least what little immersion a simple 2D platformer/shooter has to offer.To conclude the list of positives, I want to point out that the developer (at least the programmer, who talked to me) seems like a great guy.  I had some questions about achievements and he offered clues one-on-one to help me out as well as edited my save file so that I could get a missable achievement without having to re-play a large portion of the game.  (That achievement pertains to the lockpick, an item used for two doors but which can only be used once, that you can find in the level where you have to assemble a ship.  The game indicates neither that it can only be used once nor that it is related to an achievement.)  We ended up chatting a bit about other matters and he claimed that the team plans additional content for the game.  I have only praise for him.As for the negatives that I did not already cover:1.) At any point, you can press 'H' to see your objective.  In the last third of the game or so, I often had no idea where to go even with that objective.  For example, I did not know where to find the council.  Even if I had known, I would have first had to find the place that unlocks the door to the council.  It was only because I stumbled upon this place first and saw a cutscene of the door opening that I knew where to go.2.) Checkpoints, which save the game and are the only way to heal besides using one of the three health packs, are usually spaced apart fairly.  But there are a few areas where another would be appropriate.  For me, the most notable absence of a second checkpoint was on the lava planet.  There should be one around the place where one has to platform past lava geysers to get an item, then platform all the way back to the beginning of the world.  I made it with only 1 HP left.I also wish that the game had more puzzles.  There are a few at the moment:  one involves determining the next number in a sequence, one or two involve adding the right numbers together, and one involves figuring out how to get a bunch of lights activated at the same time.  Simple as they were, I enjoyed them and they served to break up the usual gameplay.  But I recognize that this game is fundamentally a platformer and shooter and that the average buyer probably does not expect them, so I don't hold this against the game.There is also no real replay value to the game, which doesn't bother me, but may bother other players.  However, one shouldn't expect too much from a game that is $8 at full price.For its variety in every category, rewarding exploration, and helpful developer, but also for its bullet sponge enemies, occasional lack of clear direction, and ammo limitations, I give Spaceport Hope a 7.2 out of 10.

												This is a fun game, with a good atmosphere, tight controls and a good variety of smart-ish enemies.There is a story to follow but you are free to take your ship to one of several planets and explore. Some of them require a certain item that you must find or buy first to be able to safely go there.There is no controller support, which is unfortunate for a game like this. It does work fine with xpadder.You start with a hand gun with unlimited ammo (although it does overheat and you have to wait a few seconds for it to cool off). I found another weapon about 10 minutes in to it. After 4 hours i have 4 weapons.The enemies are not the standard 1-2 hits to kill. They (and you) have HP, not hearts. Some of the early enemies are taking many hits to kill (you can't see their HP.) The enemies do have simple AI and do more than walk back and forth.Given that a screen with 3-5 enemies can take a little while to kill, the checkpoints seem a bit far apart for my tastes, but I'm not very patient with redoing content. Because of the distance of the checkpoints, for me at least, the fast action seen in the store page video is just not realistic. You can't jump around getting hit as much as the video shows without constantly running back to the last checkpoint to get healed. It could get faster paced once I find more weapons, but so far it is more of a careful crawl to make sure I survive to the next checkpoint. This is especially true when you also have to go through a long series of spikes and moving blocks.The checkpoints are my only real complaint about the game. It might be better if the enemies dropped some form of HP.The bosses are on the easy side.Once you get a ways in to it, there is a suprisingly large variety of enemies, most of them unique in one way or another.Overall it's a pretty nice game, and worth the price.Edit: I finished the game in just under 7 hours. The checkpoint spacing was not as bad as it seemed early on. They are a bit sparse in the beginning areas.The bosses remained fairly easy all the way to the end. The final boss took me three tries, and I was one hit away from doing it in two tries. No boss took more than three tries. About half of them I killed on the first attempt, and I'm not especially good at boss fights.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 About Spaceport HopeThe plot is an excuse - early on, you run afoul of The Man and go to jail - never comes up again. Medical supplies are tampered with, but no one mentions it outside of The Plot, and the planetary government doesn't seem to care. There are 2 dudes who mess with you regularly, and you aren't ever sure why Odds are good they work for the big bad, but that doesn't really get confirmed one way or another.An epic sci-fi themed MetroidVania. A huge hand-crafted world packed with 13 unique bosses, a gripping story, and tons of enemies, Spaceport Hope is the ultimate test of gaming prowess. Release Date: 16 Apr, 2016 The GameplayNone of this matters, you are here to run, jump, and blow [expletive] up - and, oh lords, can you! You can control quite a bit of where you go, both on the ground and in the air, the jumps feel good, and while some jumps are a little tricky, none of them are frustrating (the game tends to fall on the ""too easy"" side of things in it's platforming). Biggest difficulty is keeping yourself under control while firing (all your guns have kickback that will move you a little. When using a rapid gun, like your main one, this can add up if you don't pay attention). Also, you input gets cut when you move from screen to screen. For example, you may cross a screen, stop dead, fire at an enemy, and be knocked back into the previous screen - this can get frustrating. Also kicks in after cut scenes - holding the firing button as the boss loads won't let you start firing the minute you get control, you have to re-press the button.  The LevelOn the ""blow things up"" measure, you do have a lot of options, some of which are very fun...but you probably won't use them. Firstly, you can win without ever switching out the main weapon to fight. It's hard, but do-able. There were only a few bosses that even made me think of switching up. Further, there are 3 types of ammo, so you don't really want to use all of the guns you are given. Ammo isn't exactly hard to find, but it can be a big deal if you run out of one type (and it isn't hard to do so, with certain weapons). For example, you get a rocket launcher, a ""frag"" gun, and a grenade launcher - all use ""red"" ammo. You will almost never use the frag gun - it's half as powerful as the rocket launcher, and there just aren't that many times when you want to put out a massed number of weak shots. The Pulsar is twice as powerful as your main gun, but you'll mostly use your main to conserve ammo. If you want more oomph, you'll go to a better gun that doesn't suck ammo like a kid at a soda shop - the rocket launcher, for example, or the Ultimate Destroyer. Same problem with the Wave Gun and the Laser - too much ammo eaten for the damage dealt.Don't get me wrong, a lot of the guns are fun - a lot of fun - but you just aren't going to have the ammo to play around with most of them a lot of the time, and when you Need a special weapon, the rocket launcher is almost always the best bet, unless you have side case - using the Hydro gun to shoot through a wall, for example, the Grenade launcher for indirect fire and traps, or the flame thrower to burn a bone pile. All in All  Spaceport Hope is a good RPG Game!8/10 From MeSweep	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite platformers are the ones that let you loose in a great big world to explore. Metroid gives you planets, Castlevania gives you, well, castles, Shadow Complex gives you a valley, and so on. If you ever played the Knytt games, they might have actually been the best about making you feel like you were on a grand journey. Spaceport Hope might not have the polish or the depth of the games I just listed, but it's a solid adventure that's big on the joys of journeying and exploring.You play Cole, the one competent adventurer on a peaceful colony world that produces medicine. A routine delivery to Spaceport Hope goes bad, and it's up to you to uncover the dark deeds behind it. There's nothing groundbreaking about the story, but it serves as a very effective driver throughout the game, keeping you bouncing around the different planets and closing in on a satisfying showdown and resolution. There are a number of planets to visit, and many of them are actually not essential to progress. You can travel to any of them at any point, though you may need special items to pass certain roadblocks.The core gameplay is extremely straightforward. Your character doesn't gain any additional abilities and starts with a double-jump, so aside from finding key items, you're going to be looking for guns. Spaceport Hope has 12 guns you can find, spread across 3 archetypes. The green ammo guns fire rapid energy bolts, the red ones fire explosives, and the blue ones do constant damage like with fire or lasers. There's some neat variety among them, like a homing plasma gun and a rocket shotgun, so you'll definitely want to scour the planets for them. You won't need to look for hidden walls or secret passages, though... the exploration is all a matter of checking all the side paths and areas, and remembering which doors you need to return to with the right key.I didn't find the music or the sound effects very memorable, and the weapon sounds in particular are pretty underwhelming. The rest of the presentation is classic pixel art, with some real love shown to the environments and enemies you encounter. That really helps open the galaxy up and encourage you to explore every corner of every world to see what's there. As you get further in you find more and more connections between the items you collect and the barriers you run into, and as the exploration angle clicks so too does the fun. There are NPCs to talk to and shops to purchase from, which round out the worlds and can give you further reasons to keep poking around. Spaceport Hope doesn't really do anything new or exciting for the genre, but it's a solid couple of hours gallivanting around the galaxy, and I can always use more of that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
