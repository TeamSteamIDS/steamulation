												I can honestly say that I have played better games, but I will tell you that throughout my years of gaming I have never come across any developer that was as quick and determined to fix a flaw for a customer as these guys! They worked on so many different solutions and stuck with it until they found the culprit and was able to fix the game for me to finally play it! That in my book warrants two thumbs up in my book. Customer service isnt dead after all!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No, Witcher 3 and Skyrim it isn't. But the game doesn't take itself so seriously as to aspire to such hefty goals to begin with. It instead has the goal of simply having fun with the action/adventure genre. I would likely recommend this game for parents who sometimes struggle to find appropriate content for their kids on Steam (like I do). And it's kid-tested, as both my daughters (age 8 and 11) gave it a play. The graphics may not be spectacular, but they are as colorful and inviting as a Saturday morning cartoon. The characters are likable, and fully voiced, which adds a nice touch. The blood-free battle system is incredibly easy to use, requiring virtually no technical skill. The fairytale story is simple to follow and goals are easy to understand. Overall, it's an entertaining (though a tad oversimplified for the older set) game appropriate for all ages.

												For the LOLs!!!I have been thinking for quite a while whether I should give this one a thumbs up. Actually I've been thinking so hard about this review that I couldn't sleep well at night and dreamt about this game XDTruth be told it is quite crappy at times. Voice acting is so off it is funny!  Same goes for the script, even though that is intentional by the devs. (Just think about those crappy B or even C movies that are so bad they are fun again)While the game does run stable and never crashed on me, there are some glitches. Most annoying one is the Archer, as whom you start playing. Sometimes it just won't hit, especially when your target is close to a tree or in a partly covered position as are enemy archers at the beginning of the 2nd area. However it is not too much of an issue, because enemies don't do that much damage and there is quite an abundance of health items.Graphics are nice to behold and go easy on the eyes. Quests are always clear, including objective markers on the map.Overall I can recommend this game on a sale, when you are looking for something crappy yet strangly enough entertaining in a funny way (or maybe it's just me and my way off humor!).

												Uncertain why are there so many short and negative reviews,complaints about the game crashing, unable to start etc...Had no problem at all.Gameplay is rather smooth and fluid.Graphics are bright, colourful and well drawn.Dialogues and short-scenes are actually well done and entertaining.Switching between campanions to utilize the playstyle in different situation or encounters.Stationing the meleer behind a bush, using the archer to shoot the enemy archer and lure the others towards the bush for the meleer to engage.Having a fine time, although there are minor issues with crosshair and aiming being the archer.Achievements require replaying the characters to attain.Starting the game in Hard mode gives more experience per enemy,does speed up the process of getting enough skill points.It is easy to attain every skill achievements individually by playing carefully for the first three maps, using the heroe's initial skill such as Aimed Shot and Thunderclap, gather Experience skill to 5-7 points and saving at intervals.with enough Skill Points to level up the furthest skill, max out the skill individually by reloading the save and allocating the skill points.Understand the story missions are rather short and few, could use more updates and expansions to widen the game.Could easily be a greater game,which is a pity.Initially just thought of purchasing for the purpose of Achievements and Trading Cards.Now I do feel its a proper buy.Recommend to play if the price is low.

												I received this game for free from Free Games. It is a comedy action RPG featuring an archer Alesha, a staff fighter Dobrynya and a sword and shield fighter Ilya who decided to band up together to help the nearby farmers and villagers with wild animal and bandit problems. This game is easy to finish, with an estimated playtime of 10 hours provided skillpoints are not used until a game save is made and the save is used to obtain all the 3-star achievements for each character's skill. Combat is simple and easy for most of the game where each character's normal attack is enough to defeat most enemies. Some of the fights get a bit more difficult where Dobrynya is at an obvious disadvantage against archers and sword and shield enemies who can strike very fast and slow him down. Most of the skills in all 3 characters are also not very useful, with only a few skills that are really needed to raise to 3 stars to win certain types and groups of enemies. Furthermore, when the other 2 heroes are following the controlled character, their AI could be better in helping to defend the player from enemies attacking them from behind. Quests have sufficient variety and humour. Although all quests have objective markers shown clearly on the game map, some quests become impossible to progress and complete due to faulty NPC AI pathfinding. Graphics and soundtracks are decent. Recommended when at discount or bundle offer as the game has a few bugs that might be annoying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You basically have a fairy tail start, the archer and hero Alesha has come out of retirement because bandits attacked him and he turned them into pincushions. (A sentiment I can respect, being an avid ranger/hunter/marksman/bowman main in other video games.)He goes to get the help of his two other friends Dobrynya who fights with a staff weapon, and Ilya whom fights with the bread and butter: sword and shield.Gameplay: Each Hero has a different fighting style, and a set of talents they can choose between while leveling up. Experience is granted from kills and completing quests. Just a pro tip right now: You cannot unlock all of the skills to max in a play through, so choose wisely. (ACHIEVER NOTICE if you're going for the achievements, save up your skill points before you spend them. Then save before hand and then reload to get the achievements. Also there are tons of auto saves, so even if you miss something you can reload the level you missed.)


Skill Tree. You can get the achievements easy by saving up skill points, saving them spending them all and reloading.

As a whole, I didn't find the game to be too unpleasantness, for the first hour or so Three Heroes is very entertaining! But then you start to feel like somethings not quite right... It starts with the awkwardness of the controls. Don't jump... just don't. it slows you down, the only time you'll use it is if you're stuck on something. Also you cannot move and attack (which is agony for someone who loves to kite in video games).Lastly the music gets a bit repetitive (so I turned it off), and the voice acting is borderlines awkward and annoying, and awkward and funny. It's right inbetween.The 3d models are rough around the edges, and one of my favorite effects, is when you use a special pole vaulting animation with Dodrynya, when after he launches himself HE RAGDOLLS when he hits the floor. It's hilarious, I love it!


Hey guys, no swimming allowed.

Conclusion: So here's the thing... I've played some games which are right in between being good and bad and I decide I think they're bad because they weren't interesting, or had mechanical problems which took me out of the game.This game is definitely in between, some mechanical things should be ironed out. But It's clear the developers are actually trying. Each character is distinct and different and has different controls. (And making a whole 3d game as an indie team? it's pretty uncommon to make a game which feels like it came out of the Play Station 2. Most indie dev's will make an RPG maker for the hundreth time, or go a pixil art so they don't need to 3d model or program as hard.Kudos to  Cats Who Play for actually taking this route with their game. It won't appeal to everyone, some people will probably hate their game. But as long as I can recognize the good with the bad, I enjoyed my time with the game, it didn't over stay its welcome, and if you're looking to support an indie dev, go ahead and give Three Heroes a try.Thank you for reading, as always I'm Atratzu and I approve this review.

												MOTHER RUSSIA. HEROS OF RUSSIA. This game is a cultural history lesson on Russian mythology. or Slavic to be exact. The Mother land is under attack by bandits and ruffians and well just badguys.  Starting with the archer hero Alesha you join up with the other 2 heros by doing missions and learning the diffrent fighting styles of each hero. Illya is a sword and sheild kinda guy and Domrynya is a ''shaft'' its is called, user. Collect weapons and items in true RPG style sence and level up the heros to fight and get rid of the filth in the Motherland. Full of missions/quests on maps or areas to complete with lots of story. Switiching between heros and using their unique abilities is key to some of the missions. It makes it puzzle like sometimes. A little gimic with the usage of 3 main characters. I like. They will kill and maim all bandits eventually. They shall find a way .... I think that that cool part of the game is the cultural story of telling you or giving you an idea what these Slavic myth heros were suppose to be like. The music is on que with the cultural and diffrent but enjoyable and the graphic art style is well artsy. ''Comic '' like. This isnt all dark and grimy like The Witcher or Darksiders solo RPGs. Its a good intro for upcoming video gamers like my own 10 year old for exp. Thel get into it and learn how these games work. I enjoyed it and I think if your a fan of Gilgamesh or Hercules mythology with a Fable like feel. GO FOR IT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game plays horridly but other than that... not too shabby. The world and object design is above par and deserves a better combat mechanic, at least with the archer you start of as. If you got a kid that's just happy shotting at stuff that's hard to hit... we'll hopefully that's just a phase he'll grow out of soon.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
