								As an Archer I have hunted for a VR game that let me pratice my real life skill without forcing me to jump around like a madman getting tangled in my headset cord. Sky Sanctuary is the best Archery game to date it will give you a workout without having to fight with your cables. It looks good and phisics are well done the viriaty of games is good and will keep you entertaned the 2 main parts are archery skill and Katana skill. If you like Archery and or sword play this is just what you want! its not another green goblin killing game it all about skill and practice it will give your body and mind a workout!

								Tight little package with Dev promises to grow even larger expanding out to other Islands in the future with even more activities.  At the moment you can move anywhere on the main Island - play around with fireworks and taiko drums, sit under Cherry Blossom trees admiring the gorgeous weather, put out some candles, throw some shuriken and smoke bombs - basically just explore and fool around in a large area.  The main focus at the moment is the two available activities of blade slicing and archery.  Both feel very solid at this point.  I kind of see this as an oriental themed version of The Lab - with more themed activities and locations being added overtime.  Hopefully this will continue to grow into as addictive an experience as The Lab was :)			",398,130,14,22,66,7,22

								Got a little time in on this game.  The graphics are quite nice, and I enjoyed setting off the fireworks.  It's a fun game I can get into for ten minutes or an hour.As of now, there are some problems.  Some are minor.  Some juddering here and there.  Nothing too bad, but it was annoying.  Also, the robot talking between games (like when you finish with the katana and just want to start another round) takes too long.  Some of the physics (especially with the katana) seem a little off.  It knocks wood down when it should be cutting.  But the biggest thing for me that will keep me from playing this is that the grip buttons are used to pick up and drop weapons.  Which means while in the middle of shooting the bow and arrow, it could suddenly change hands. This happened frequently.  Go to draw an arrow and I'm suddenly holding the bow in my right hand instead of my left.  It completely made it difficult to play and frustrated the heck out of me.  If the devs fix this, I think it would make the game a lot better.Overall, I'd recommend the game, but it's Early Access, so there are some issues that I hope to see improved over time.

When to buy and when not to buy?If you don't like reading, check out our video of this review:Cas & Chary on YouTubeSky Sanctuary is a beautiful archipelago where you can play all kinds of different Samurai mini games. As the game is in early access, there are only a few things to do at the moment.  Japanese wood cutting (Tameshigiri)  Bow and arrow skill training (Kyudo with 3 modes)  and there is a sandbox zone where you can use/try out several Samuari weapons like Shurikens and smoke screen balls.You are also accompanied by a floating robot head (a cute one) and besides this you can explore the island where there are all kinds of little fun details (easter eggs) to discover. This is a nice touch.What we likeWhat we like is that every mini game is competitive as it has a global leaderboard. Right after playing a game you see how your ranking is. The mini games also take practice to master, which is something we like a lot in games. Other things we like is that the setting is beautiful. The graphics and soothing soundtrack gave a peaceful feeling. It's nice to just explore the island, but I'm guessing after exploring for an hour, you're done.Our recommendationHowever, because of the current content, we don't think the game is worth paying 12 dollars for. We think it has potential, but there are other similar games out there that are free. Like The Lab and NVIDIA VR Funhouse.We would only suggest buying this game for the following reason: the devs say that they are going to add new activity zones & islands. It is not entirely clear what kind of activities they'll add next. But what is clear to us is that their goal is to listen to the community and add what they would like to see. What we personally would like to see is an activity where you can battle enemies with the weapons, so you an truly test your skills as a samurai. If they add something like that, we would definitely rate the game higher. This is why we recommend this game right now, but it might change in the future.So if you think the game has potential as well, we do suggest buying the game to help support the developers into making this game how you want it be. If you are looking for a full game with a long playtime. This game is not for you at the moment. ",61,28,1,1,13,5,2

								My Specs: 16 Gigs RAM/AERO GTX 1070/Intel Core i7-7700k @ 4.7 Ghz.HTC VIVE PlayPositive review because the game is ""good and fun"" BUT THIS MAY NOT BE A GAME FIT FOR ALL.Read everything please. And the video is just for a glimpse of the game and not my great game play. ;-)This game is a competative sword slicing, bow weilding, target and skeet shooting game at the moment of release with a promise of more to come. It has leaderboards. Over all the game ran smoothly on my PC. The graphics are pleasing but cartoony. The game play mechanics are fairly easy to understand in theory. Where the game goes a little south for an older more casual player such as myself is hitting the targets can be a bit challenging for a lot of reasons. My video below will have my gripes and complaints as first time play always produces for me. Physically this game gives me some pain in my wrists and shoulder area the way I have to hold the bow and arrow to get a strong far shot off and swing the sword at awkward angles and a bit higher than I am tall. They need adjustments to lower height a bit according to the player height. And adding a practice area that calculates each persons accuracy to compensate in a way that would be fair to all players trying to get on leaderboards would be welcome too. I was getting worse the more I played doing the slicing. Things were happening fast so maybe I was way off on some swings but not all. And that is my main issue with VR leaderboard games. Most young people will do well and some of us older folk, short and super tall won't have a chance. And then you have to get a ceratin score to unlock other levels. A much higher score than possibly you can get in ceratin events. Don't get me wrong. The game is not bad. Hardcore folk, young and physically fit individuals will certainly have a blast with this game. It is well done but needs to be tweaked on the targeting of the sword I think. As I stated I was getting worse the longer I played. And they may need a super easy mode for people who are not going to do that well but still want to have fun and get some exercise but still get to try all the levels. That is just my thoughts. This is a sure buy for those patient to learn and can physically handle the challenge.Video will be viewable at 1080p/60fps after it processes. Maybe 1 Hour from review post time. Enjoy.

								WoW! This is a quality game, with amazing atmosphere and excellent stylised graphics.The little piece of Japan lets you Wield a sword, Fire arrows, and throw ninja stars.. plus let off fireworks (I only wish there was an option for a dusk night mode to watch the fireworks, I can see the fireworks as a game of itself).There is useful training and in game instructions, and some fruit ninja style slashing of straw poles. The archery has 3 different modes of targets.. Skeet Shooting chickens, single targets, and moving targets.And this is early access, I can't wait to see what else appears.. I would definitely recommend the $15 as you will get a ton of enjoyment from this game.  So glad there was no shooting, we need more games of this calibre.. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I was Lucky enough to get to play this before the official release. The Setting is magical within minutes you feel like you are walking around a garden in Japan. Beautiful Pink cherry Blossom falls from the trees while soft traditional Japanese Music plays. Even if you didn't want to play the game you could find peace sitting in the garden meditating and relaxing. The Games themselves are a Bow shooting game or samurai sword game.Both take practice and patience to master and because of the slow pace that this game installs you find yourself not rushing to move on. If you are competitive you can try to make it to the top of the leader boards.With other areas under construction in the game this could grow and grow to be a good investment. What other game currently offers you swords, bows and a meditation retreat all in one?Its on special at the moment so grab a bargain			",60,23,1,0,14,3,1
