Early Access Review
								Mechanically, this is very solid. It is simple and fun, with everything that happens feeling like it was the correct result (this is important in a paddle game).It has one major flaw. The room size retirement is completely unnecessary, and yet it makes the game unplayable. I am rating this positively since it lists that requirement on the store page.In my 2.2x2.2 meter space all items of the menu are easily reachable. The main gameplay (volleying the ball) works perfectly as well. The only problem is that every single mine spawns outside the play space. That gives a hard limit on how far I can get because sooner or later (usually within ten hits) the ball hits a mine that I can't deal with.Giving multiple room options (possibly with adjusted scoring to compensate) would make this game far more approachable.Edit:After writing this I thought to myself ""What if I could reach the mines? All I had to do was shift my z position forward half a meter (thanks SteamVR Advanced Settings!) and I could reach them just fine. My high score is now 160 and I worked up a serious sweat.The ball still sometimes gets shot outside my play space, but for the most part the game works great just by offsetting myself forwards.Edit 2: According to the Dev's response, the playspace can be repositioned via the touchpad. I have not tested this however.			",400,131,10,37,78,3,65
