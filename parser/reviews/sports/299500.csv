												Got a key a little while ago from a bundle i bought over a year ago. I thought i would give it a go as i used to quite like snooker. Glad i did as it's a very fun and polished little game. It is very easy to pick up and play for someone like me that knows the rules of snooker and have played it a bit but am also a pretty rubbish player:) There are lots of tournaments to enter and credits to be won. You can then spend them on upgrades, different cues, auto-chalk and the like. The AI is pretty good, doesn't cheat and does make mistakes. Obviously it gets better the further you get in a tourny but the difficutly is nicely curved. The graphics are good as are the sound effects. A special mention goes to the crowd. They ohh and ahhh when you miss and pot a difficult shot you'll be met with a cheer. You'll even hear them cry 'go on my son' and cough. And too much noise will be met with a shhh from the ref. If you like snooker even a bit you will enjoy this game. It's addictive and fun. I recommend picking it up on sale at least. Oh and it has pool too.			",901,309,69,118,127,7,188

												As a huge fan of regular snooker, both playing at amateur level in my local club or pub and watching and enjoying top flight competition – I am disappointed with this dreadful attempt to bring snooker to Steam.Immediately this game is presented more like a final year project and the short-falls are painfully obvious from the get go.- Full of bugs- Balls appearing in pockets mysteriously- Child like understanding of the rules of the game- Zero ability to finesse shot choice- Ball physics give little to no satisfaction, with the side / swerve / spin apparently just included because it should be.I can’t recommend this even for the €2 in the sales – it is truly dreadful and frustrating.Playtime: 57 minutesRefund Requested			",125,17,14,3,15,2,21

												for me having played the real game and having tried many other so called snooker/pool games have found this version simply brilliant. Yes there are the odd blip, like not being able to move around the table when white is in the 'D' following a foul. so here is my negative list;Multiplayer very difficult to find players - I would recommend setting up a dedicated data base that shows when people are active that way we could dip in and out. Develop an a web snooker league through steam. I have started a group so if you play snooker please join.The 3 miss rule, this seems wrong my understanding is player can hit an object ball but chooses not to then miss is called. not being able to travel around table to see all anglesa change of referree and maybe a comentary?so not a lot wrong really the points above are basic and could be rectified especially in any new upgrade. I hope that Bighead games do launch the new addition for PCSo for me i love it, great allround play, realistic so anyone not happy remember we are not the Rocket!!!! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not a game I can honestly recommend with a clear conscience, although people looking for a Snooker simulation on Steam are going to find their options sorely limited; this is in fact the only one, but there are so many things that don't feel right with this game.The AI difficulty can vary wildly within the same match, and even within the same frame, going from missing shots you'd think were unmissable to clearing the table unless you snooker your opponent on the break. The AI has no concept of shot selection either - in one example, the computer opponent had potted a red and ended up in the jaws of the middle pocket, completely unable to see pink and black. He them promptly nominated black (despite having an easy blue he could drop in to the opposite middle) and proceeded to play the cue ball directly into the jaw of the middle pocket, sending it careering around the table and missing everything. This happened 3 times in a row, at which point I was awarded the frame. Laughably bad.Michaela Tabb, bless her heart. She's a good referee and a likable character on the Snooker and Pool circuit, but there's no visual representation of her in-game at all; she's been reduced to a disembodied voice with about as much emotion in her tone as GLaDOS in Portal. In some instances, the game doesn't even get the scores right - on more than one occasion, I've potted a red, followed by a pink (for a break of 7), only for the game to proudly announce that I'm on a break of 6. The only thing stopping poor Michaela from turning in her grave is that she isn't actually dead.Sending the cue-ball in-off is a common occurrence, but one that seemingly happens at random, completely irrespective of how careful or otherwise you're playing. There is no consistency with shot power, with a 100% power shot sending the cue ball all the way around the table twice, but a 40% power shot is rarely enough to even pot the black off its spot.Animations of the crowd clapping are horribly and obviously looped, the player character is never seen and has no character model, so you can forget about character customisation aside from the name, and the opposing player is only ever seen sat down at the side of the table while you make your break. Obviously it was too much to ask to animate a model of someone walking around a snooker table and playing a shot.If you want a good snooker game on the PC, avoid this and buy Virtual Pool 4, which has a fantastic snooker game mode.

												I do enjoy a game of pixel based snooker and pool and have played many different games over the years, from classics such as Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker and Archer Maclean's Pool to World Championship Snooker and Virtual Pool 3. Over the past few years I've found my enjoyment from online game iSnooker, but the high price and lack of improvements in that game have meant I've given up on it forever. So, having given International Snooker a couple of long sessions, where does it stand on the scale? Unfortunately, a far, far way from the top. The interface for thisg ame is just poor beyond words. You can only cycle through frames, for example, by clicking on the field through all the options and if you go past the option yuo want, you have to click all the way through again to get to where you want. An option to just cycle up AND down would have been an obvious choice here. The menus are like this for everything and quickly become frustrating. Furthermore, most game modes are locked from the beginning and can only be unlocked by winning tournaments, so if you're keen to play pool more than snooker, you're going to have to play a lot of snooker for the privilege.The gameplay itself does not fare much better. The camera options are limited to overhead and table level, which is pretty standard, but during a shot you have no control and the AI picks the most awkward angles to show the shots from. Pots that would be impossible in real life - and would indeed not even be attempted by the top pros - can be pulled off with ease here whilst the AI play is erratic at best. Black off the spot? Not if a thin cut pink to the green pocket that offers worse position for the next red is there for the taking. Of course that doesn't matter, as an equally outrageous red will then be pulled off the AI, who will then miss a simple black off the spot in what is a real Jekyll and Hyde display. Perhaps the pink up to baulk was the right shot after all?The whole thing just feels like a huge step backwards from the games that have come before it. This is tedious, processional snooker at its most basic and uninspiring, and a game I simply can't find any reason to recommend to anyone.			",108,34,4,12,6,3,11

												If you are a fan of Snooker, you will appreciate this title, as the physics are fairly true to form.  Since this is only a simulation, the game has to be a little forgiving in certain areas...namely that the rounded pockets seem to allow balls to ""bank in"" more than in real life.  It's great that you can unlock other forms of pool simply by completing in-game challenges, rather than having to pay for them.  There are no Steam achievements, but the in-game trophies are fun to earn.  The best part of this game is the online community; you can learn a lot from your multiplayer partners.Heroes of Gamers Haven:  Forum[www.gamers-haven.org] ",268,95,2,27,23,5,39

												If you are after a snooker sim, this is the game for you.. Smooth shots, smooth ball movement and very nice environment. Absolutely great in those respects.. However, lazy devs, have completely and utterly failed to produce a two player game that has any kind of reliable multi player. If you want to play vs AI then your laughing, if you want to play against another human? best of luck with that. I have played maybe 5 vs games online in the 30 plus hours of game play on steam and they mean nothing anyhow so people just concede on you mid break.. such a shame, lazy attitude towards multiplayer on a two player game by the dev team means that i cant recommend this title with a clear conscience.

												After reading some of the reviews for this title, some of them seem a little unfair.If you are after a nice little game of snooker and don't care if it has fancy graphics or well known players - its great. I agree it is a little easy, it's quite simple to make breaks that IRL would be almost impossible. But if you enjoy snooker as a spectator this is a great game.Although it lacks the humour and feel of old time (Archer Maclean) classics like Jimmy White and Pool, it's still a solid representation of the game of snooker.Personally, I don't feel that the physics are wrong, the cushions and pockets feel (to me) like they should and are a close approximation of a real ""fast"" table.I like that you can drop in and out of tournaments and that you can speed up the play of AI opponents.I'm not that fond of the woman they got to do the voice overs inbetween frames, but it serves a purpose I suppose.All in all it's an excellent and very playable snooker game and I'm glad I purchased it.

												""Quite possibly the most realistic Snooker game to come to any gaming platform ""- I strongly disagree with this statement, in fact it is most misleading and untrue statement you could possibly make about a snooker game. I have played many and this one is the worst of the lot. It is too easy, the pockets are too large, the cushions and bay are unrealistic, too fast, too bouncy...not to mention spin control is totally off and you dont even get a real player animation.

												I have been playing the game International Snooker 2012 for the past 3 months. This game is really so close to the real thing that is unbelievable. Unfortunately, a lot of flaws still exists in the game. I have found the AI players to lack vision in certain respects, some are programmed to be over 100% which makes them impossible to beat. They can also sometimes make the strangest shot selections and are very limited when snookered close behind another ball.My biggest criticism of this game lays in the multiplayer. It does not show all the names of players entering and also tend to lose connection at awkard times.What a pity that the developers do not have money to update the game properly  ( according to Big Head Games spokesman ) in an email to me recently.Maybe they should also be looking at a crowd funding solution so that we can all enjoy the game more.There are various other problems that can easily be rectified by a good programmer.I am therefore calling on Big Head Games to react to this review and tell us what you have in mind for this game.To make money, you must invest in this game and I am sure that the profits will exceed your wildest imagination.I am running a snooker league with this game, but in order to progress, the game MUST be updated.Sincerely yours.Christie Geldenhuys			",9,0,27,0,7,1,0

												For a game that sells itself on ball dynamics the developers need to go and play a game of snooker in the real world.The ball dynamics are atrociously innacuate, and the opposition can hit balls that are not on the table to alter the trajectory of both the object and cue balls, using side to perform a masse or slow masse has absolutely no effect on the cue ball.If I want a game of snooker I'll be on a proper table down the club. This game is a total waste of £10. Learnt my lesson hope the people reading this heed my advice and avoid this game.			",13,0,1,3,1,1,0

												It's not quite a simulation but it's lots of fun. Having said that I'm getting breaks just above the 50 mark which is exactly how I fare in the real game. I like the career mode with the easy early rounds and then tough opponents later on. The AI is OK. Let's face it the computer could play a perfect game every time so it has to be dumbed down, mostly you don't notice. Sometimes it reminds me of early games with my Dad, when he would throw a few shots so I could get some table time. Cue ball action is a little unpredictable but you can mostly get the position you were aiming for.There are significant problems with the Miss Rule (almost like real life). Your AI opponent will never put you back in, no matter how poor their position is. Also the AI will happily throw away a frame, or even a match, with three misses in a row.I like the crowd noises. The oohs and ahhs, the coughing and the occasional ""Go on my Son"" add to the atmosphere. It's a shame they didn't record more variations with Michaela Tabb, she has a gorgeous Scottish accent but sometimes sounds like a robot or answering machine because of overused words.I've had a great time with this game and it cost me less than a pound in a bundle.

												If you are after a snooker game then this a good game with a fair price and great graphics. But there a few things to note. First off you are probably going to want to leave the aiming guides turned on. This isn't cheating, it just compensates for the lack of depth perception that is inherent in virtual pool games, at least until there is a version that uses the oculus. If you stick to playing in first person it gives a fairly realistic feel and balance to the game. If you turn them off then you end up playing nearly every shot from the overhead camera view which makes if feel like an 8-bit arcade game. Also lining up the shots in the overhead view without the guides is so frustrating that you'll find yourself moving your head to strange angles and spending a few minutes on every shot to try and find the right line, only to miss by an inch or two anyway. Changing to the overhead view at all could be considered cheating but it is the only way to get a overview of the layout since you can't walk around the table while playing, something that I found lacking. There are also shots where the pool cue completely obstructs the view while in first person, which is odd since a little tranparency would have been an easy fix here. Changing to the overhead view is a must in this case.To play you set the desired spin, cue angle and power level before clicking on a button to fire the shot. A mouse driven cue and power action is sorely missed here. Coupled with the guides it takes nearly all of the interactive feel of the game away. However, since spin, power and cue ball placement are so important in the game of snooker it still has its merits as a tactical game or training aid. As mentioned in other reviews, the AI is inconsitent because they will play poorly for half a game and then trot out a break of 50 or more at the end. I also feel guilty when snookering the opponent since in many cases they will miss, at least in the early stages of a tournament, and it is so easy to force them to replay the shot and win the frame by default after the third miss. They simply don't change the shot they attempted the first time.I'd recommend the game to anyone with a passion for snooker but I'd be raving about the game if these points were addressed. As it stands I'll just have to repeat that it is a good game with a fair price and great graphics.			",475,218,37,60,109,7,108

												The score is 58-42, and Spyro Polymiadis is on a 15 score break. Three balls remain: The blue, the pink, and the devious black ball. As Spyro settles in to make the easiest pocket of his life, NickyJ utters the last rites over his own grave before Spyro buries him and all his dreams of a comeback.NickyJ: ""Just make this last blow a painless one.""*Spyro takes his shot and whiffs on it. The blue ball sails wide left of the middle pocket*Spyro: ""DAMNIT""*NickyJ proceeds to sink both the blue and pink balls, setting the score at 58-53. Only the black ball remains to finish this miracle, a simple knock in 5 inches from a corner pocket*NickyJ: ""Goodnight moon. Goodnight stars. Goodnight Spyro Polymiadis.""*Thud-Thud-Thud-Thud-Thud goes the black ball as it bounces off both edges of the corner pocket repeatedly while never entering the pocket*Spyro: ""Haha, tough break Nicky. Tough break. It's time for me to end this.""*THUNK - The black ball bounces off the corner of the rim AGAIN and rolls across the entire table to the opposite side* Somewhere in the chorus of laughs and cries that reverberate through the tournament center, Spyro and NickyJ both curse the name of that stupid Belgian who convinced them to play this irritating game that has ripped their hearts out and stomped on every single dream they ever contrived.-----------------For the $2 I spent on this game during a sale, I won't say it's bad. I certainly wouldn't pay its current full price of $13, though. Having only ever played pool before, snooker was an interesting change. After learning the basics of snooker quite easily from the game, I'll borrow the sage words from the cover of an Othello box to describe it: A minute to learn, a lifetime to master.Pros:+Easy to learn game with simple rules+Simple, easy to understand interface+Varying levels of opponent skill. Sometimes the round is really easy, sometimes really hard. A healthy dose of both throughout each tournament to keep it interesting.+Other billiards type games when snooker gets to be a bit boringCons:-Multiplayer is absolutely broken. Tried to connect 15 times, succeeded 3 times. If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer experience, don't. Period.-The graphics aren't the greatest. Which is fine, you shouldn't be buying a snooker game to look for high definition graphics. Even so, sometimes you just can't avoid noticing people like this: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/477768284585810206/64BB18D8ECA4F9FFDEDF99EB8BF042EBF90CF5DF/-When I mentioned a ""healthy dose"" of varying skill levels in tournaments, I half lied. Half the opponents are Jekyll Hyde behind a cue stick. Makes an awesome bounce off the wall that would make pros cry in one break; inexplicably sinks the wrong ball for absolutely NO REASON WHATSOEVER the next break.-Mind-numbing physics - I cannot count the number of times I've aimed for the corner pocket and had my ball repeatedly bounce off the corner, going neither into the pocket nor back out onto the table. Once is amusing. Thrice is bemusing. 13th time is agonizing.-Adding onto the above, the ball will never, EVER fly off the table from being hit too hard. If I could climb up onto the table and hit the ball with a golf club, it would never leave the surface of the table. Not really important, but just a petty annoyance of mine.Closing statement: It's not a bad game. If it's under $10, it's worth the money. It's not polished, it's not pretty, but it's still entertaining. Just don't buy it for multiplayer.			",29,1,2,1,2,1,1

												An ok game for what it is.Good:- Got the right vibe.- Cheap to buy.- The only snooker game where you actually have to chalk your stick.Bad:- Dead multiplayer.- Unpolished UI.- Broken store.- Predictable.For 20 rubles it's as good as it gets I guess, pity though the devs could of made some money if they finished this game specially with snooker games being so rare.

												游戏还是不错滴，就是千万别太相信提示，就算瞄的再准，也不一定打的进，如果游戏五分满分的话我给三分，扣的两分分别是，一分没国语，一分价格虚高，不建议全价入。作为喜加一游戏，最好在打折的时候入库。			",65,17,4,13,3,1,1

												If you are a fan of snooker games then you will probably like this version. The interface is simple and easy to navigate. Controling the cue ball is very good with the various spin options ie top spin back spin and side spin all having a positive effect on positioning so you feel like you're playing snooker having to plan your next shot in advance. The AI can sometimes be inconsistant with your opponent missing easy shots one minuet then the next potting from one end of the table to the other. Their are various unlockables to be had by earning points for competing in tournaments ie different cue's, auto chalk, 8 ball and 9 ball pool. The graphics look decent and the sound effects feel authentic you can hear coughing sounds coming from the audience. Overall i would give this game 7.5 out of ten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok 1st off i am only recommending this game because its the only true full snooker game on steam. Right now to the actual game well 1st off ( IT IS NOT THE MOST REALISTIC SNOOKER GAME TO COME TO ANY PLATFORM ) why you ask well if you have played any snooker game say WSC for instance then this is pritty much the same. Has for the phyisics well they are ok but the balls seam to glide rather than roll the graphics are much the same has any other game. The AI is gonna make you frustrated it will pot balls from any position and i mean any if you have played real snooker and are decent enough player you will understand there are no players in game just a cue no ref just the voice wich sounds like a robot. That said there is still some fun to be had but i cant help feel even in 2014 we are still getting what looks like graphics from the middle of the 2000's			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												M'kay, I totally and completely admit the reason why I bought this game is because I don't play Snooker and have always been curious. There is no tutorial to hold your hand here, much to my regret. That having been said, the 'difficulty' of this game is considerably higher than that of Pool Nation [edit: corrected by markie].I won't bother going over the rules for Snooker (if you're seeing this, you have internet) but will comment that the interface in International Snooker allows for a great deal of precision. You also get options for 9-ball and 8-Ball. The practice mode is helpful for getting the initial gameplay down as well. My only gripe here, which is NOT the game's fault, is Snooker's pace-- the game moves a lot slower than 9-Ball.All in all, this is a fair game... but if you aren't playing it Specifically For Snooker then Pool Nation is the better buy for a number of reasons. You have been warned.7/10			",107,57,4,30,26,3,35

												A little easy but good animations, great fun if you like snooker. Probably the best snooker game have ever made. Fake named opponnents is little unrealistic but still its a good game. Lot of tournements, credits, achievements. I hope steam achievements will be available for this game soon.			",308,101,7,41,56,8,32
