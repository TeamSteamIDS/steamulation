												Assuming you have the same issues as me, once you get the optimisation/launch issues sorted (yes, not ideal - took me about 45 mins) the game runs really well.When you get into it, it's great fun.Positive:- Limited reversals: brilliant idea- Roster size: *huge*- Match types: lots- Moves: lots- Create a...: extremely in-depth. Haven't explored it much yet, but it looks good- New Day: just because New Day ROCKS.- You can beat up Nikki Bella with a sledgehammer.- Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens are pretty much spot on (they're the first match I played - Sami's entrance is brilliant)Negative:- No four horsewomen: Yes, another person saying it. The three women in the triple threat at 'Mania, and the NXT women's champion aren't included, and won't be included. Community creations may well cover it - but they shouldn't have to. WWE should be embarrassed about this.- Some things are a little outdated. Paige is the NXT women's champion, for example. But I guess, with no Bayley... and Emma isn't Evil Emma.- Amore and Cassady are included, but no Carmella. Same applies to Blake and Murphy - no Alexa. Again, a little bit lacking, considering the depth in other areas.- I tried to play online, but it couldn't find a match. Whether that's the game's fault, or just that no one's online, I don't know. But I couldn't play against anyone. So I have to give it a negative mark.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												100% better than 2k15, I love the new limited reversal system, it makes the game fun and challenging and it can be turned off if you don't like it. I'm actually able to use strike in this game more than once before it is reversed which is a milestone for me! This is the first WWE video game where I actually have lost a few matches, the previous versions were all way too easy for me even on highest difficulty. The gameplay is very similar to real matches, They finally nailed the realism and pacing. If you are looking for arcade wrestling or No Mercy (or even HCTP), this may not be it for you, but if you want a realistic wrestling game, this is a must have! Some of my matches have been classic back and forth, mutiple finishers, mutiple close pins, just the overall feeling of at any point the momentum can change, and it will, very true to life wrestling. I've laid the smacketh down on AI at times, only for it to come back and beat me. Again, I enjoy the challenge!      I also enjoy the ability to interrupt entrances or if you are the 2nd person coming to the ring, you can ""Break Out"" and control your own entrance (including attacking the person in the ring before the bell sounds). VERY COOL and much sought after feature for me. Now if we could only get a feature to attack after the match is over...But overall, I highly recommend 2K16 to anyone who enjoyed the previous installments. This may be the best one yet for me. The Roster size alone gives it a few points!Restart steam if you are having issues starting, or choose run as admin on the .exe file of the game, ignore the bad reviews about game not running, it runs perfect for me. No issues whatsoever. If there is some sort of issue affecting a lot of computers, then wait for a patch and actually try patience. My framerate, except for entrances (they are locked at 30fps), is a steady 60fps. Only one time did I notice a drop in fps, one time for a second.Also, a tip for people complaining about targeting, choose manual in the options menu, you'll thank me later. I suggest looking at options for other ""issues"" as well. Don't like the chain wrestling? Turn it off. Several options and choices to alter gameplay.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do you want one of the most accurate simulations of wrestling money can buy?Do you want (mostly) outstanding graphics and smooth gameplay?Do you want a relatively robust amount of unlocks customization options?Do you want a ridiculous (and I mean ridiculous) roster size?Do you want to play a plethora of matches from wrestling history?Do you want a satisfying amount of well-made community content?Do you want to talk about Tyler Breeze? This is the game for you	Are you like me and more or less simply want a career mode akin to the old SvR games, with a never ending cycle, branching paths and voice acting?Do you want a large variety of match types, again akin to the SvR games? Nooooope	Basically If all you want is a great wrestling sim with plenty of unlocks and historical matches, look no further. You will get hours of fun from this game. But if you want a satisfying career mode or unique match types, you will be often frustrated by this game. The career mode is repetetive and dull and you CAN'T use your character in any mode other than career, even after you retire. And beyond 2k showcase, don't expect to see buried alive matches and really any niche match types. 6.5/10 for me, 9/10 if my negatives don't matter to you	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:- You can make Daniel Bryan vs Cesaro vs Rollins vs Cena vs Orton vs Sting 6 man elimination chamber match for Wrestlemania 32 and pretend everything is alright.- Roman looks strong.- My Career mode offers unprecedented realism: regulary put on 5 star matches to get stuck in the midcard.- JBL is on the game's commentary now. Haha, I love it!- Customization options allow for masterpieces like this one[i.imgur.com] - WWE Universe mode perfectly emulates WWE writing team: enjoy feuds and storylines as random and incoherent as tv product.Cons:- No trombone mode.- Old glitches still persist, can't see Cena at times, RKOs come out of nowhere.- No Byron Saxton on commentary. Oh wait, that's not a Pros list. This one's on me. My bad.In other news, PC port seems to be somewhat better than 2k15. Except it doesn't launch for some people (upd: I believe these issues have been patched by now). Multiplayer, for the first time in the series history, doesn't lag for me, which is a huge improvement. Customization is improved from 2k15, but still not quite on par with older entries: no custom music, no custom crowd signs for whatever reason. Limited number of reversals appears to be an interesting change, adding a bit of a tactical layer to the matches.This review gets rewritten into something more useful as soon as Neville gets a push. And by that I absolutely mean replacing all the text with New Day gifs.Update: now that Neville is injured, I don't even know, this review got sad.Update: not as sad Wrestlemania 32 booking though.

												So far - a BIG step compared to wwe 2k15pros so far- the new grappling mechanics work better and make more fun to play- creating a wrestler has now a lot more items- big rooster- interviews to change attitude- attitude in general- choose a Title you run for- Rivalrys (including inteferences before/while Matches)- choose a Tag Team Partner- Portrait Scan of your own Face- limited reversalscons so far- Submissions: Low Health / Endurance has no effect on the Submission minigame, means: your foe is low on both, but still has the same big circle and speed to counter your submission) (monitoring this - so far starting as a submission wrestler is not recommended, probably later when you got higher skills)- Loading Times can be a bit sometimes (especially in the character creation)- cant deactivate match styles you dont like / dont want to play in career- no own custom entrance themesBUGS so far:- has some trouble if 2 Monitors are connectet- has some trouble if Teamviewer is running! (Game starts in Windowed mode and cant be changed, deactivate Teamviewer - runs as it should)- Tapping out sometimes crashes the game (needed to enter the codes in webbrowser for uploading, better use the steam-overlay)leaving typos for your enjoyment, have fun.

												Spent almost 6 hours trying to beat Titus O'Neil i.e. to learn the basics the game. I can't even describe how happy I was in the moment he surrended to my submission attempt. I never expected such a deep fight simulation system from a WWE game, it made me respect wrestling evern more. MyCareer mode is fun, but I'm not yet aware of all its features, so my character is 65-overall trying to beat 85-overalls superstars. To make it brief, I strongly recommend WWE 2K16 to everyone, but be aware that the game may be ridiculously hard during first hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Joke Review > MyCareer as heel> 1v1 against Cena> Manager distracts Cena goes face to face> I dropkick him in the back> He falls onto my manager> He gets DQed and I win.10/10""I LOVE IT MAGGLE!"" Honest Review I've had fun with the game, even though I still prefer the fast paced nature in the older wwe games this is still a solid wwe game. I mostly just play the MyCareer mode, since it's the main selling point for me in the 2K games, and I'm still playing with a face run and a heel run.Is it fun?At times.Is MyCareer repetitive?Yes it is!How's the creator suite?Meh, not as expansive as 2K14. I enjoy making non-human characters and highly unlikely creatures that happen to wrestle. The good things I can say is the logo uploader, but somehow they make it really complicated to do. Entrance is the best so far, but it still needs more and use the PC to its advantage like custom videos, music and images. How's Online?Laggy, even worse when playing with more than 2 people.How's the roster?The biggest roster in a wwe game to date, but is still missing some great ones. I can name a few of my personal faves that are gone, but the majority of everyone's faves are in it regardless.How's the fighting?It's good if you want a sort of realistic wrestling gameplay, but playing isn't as fun as I had in 2K14. Everything feels too advanced such as the stats, skills, etc. I much prefer the basics and general options when making a character. The reversal meter is the best addition though.Verdict?If you want an online wrestling game to play, don't get it.If you want to make wacky characters, you can, but very limited.If you want a singleplayer experience, absolutely get it.

Recommended (no longer with Caution!) WWE 2K16 is a clear improvement over 2K15. The fighting in this game is some of the most fluid combat in any wrestling game, and the character creator is significantly quicker and smoother than others (at least the two I've played, 2K13 and 2K15). Honestly, I only play wrestling games for its character creator feature. I am a little disappointed that there are fewer customizable features than in 2K13 (where is was easy to create a massive-headed, tiny-limbed monstrosity), but I am willing to sacrifice some creativity for not having to wait 15 seconds for an item to load its preview as I'm scrolling through the menu. EDIT!Initially, when I wrote this review, there were a few issues I had to deal with. I have solved the issues by verifying the game cache. If you are suffering from any of the problems below, try that; It may fix them.But there is a warning; this game crashes very frequently. Currently, I've experienced three consistent crashes:- The game crashes when I attempt to preview a lot of the boots and footwear (the first two boot choices are okay, but the third and the next two rows are volitile).- Previewing any of Mr. Perfect's music, entrance animation, and/or absolutely anything crashes the game.- Starting a career with a created character has crashed the game.After I verified my game cache, the game ran perfectly! So far, this is the best wrestling game on PC! If you're a fan, you'll love this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2k15 is the first wrestling game on PC since RAW 1, yet this one excites me far more because of the insane roster size - 120 wrestlers. You can have dream matchups and play as The Rock n Sock, Hart Foundation, British Bulldog, Ministry Undertaker with his own entrance, Badass Undertaker with bike entrance and 2 attires, Ken Shamrock, The Outsiders, Sting, Lex Luger (Even make nWo Wolfpack). All the wrestlers are fully detailed and have a complete moveset with signatures and finishers.Better performance than 2k15 at max settings.

												This is a bizarre mix of great and awful elements. The Showcase mode is stellar, the editor is remarkably detailed, there is an exceptional amount of content and it all runs beautifully.Unfortunately, this is let down by other aspects of the game. The commentary is so far short of the NBA series as to be embarassing. It's buggy (incorrect lines are often spoken, and sometimes the same line is repeated several times in a row) and there are times when the commentator is clearly reading from a script (particularly Cole). Some lines are recorded at a different volume, and sound like they were literally phoned in.The AI is wonky at best, and when combined with the awkward hit detection and inconsistent ability to interrupt animations, multi-man matches become an absolute trainwreck where AI teammates constantly interfere with each other. Several of the achievements do not trigger properly.Game concepts are explained poorly, no effort is made for a manual or tutorial. Not ideal when the series is new to PC.The career mode is built around grinding; even though this version comes with DLC to at least boost your character (albeit buried away in a menu - I wasted plenty of time before noticing it), it is still a painful slog through match after match against the same opponent - aggravated by the nonsense Authority objectives, some of which are rendered impossible by circumstances out of your control. Oh, and on career mode, it baffles me how an otherwise great-looking game reduced Renee Young to a plastic, Uncanny Valley resident.It's frustrating because this could be a great game, and elements of it are outstanding, but it's just let down by so many needless flaws.Oh, and I didn't miss 2K's continued gouging of Australians, either - a 30% mark-up is a disgrace.

												As a PC gamer, it's been an incredibly long time since I have played a WWE game. Although I've played just an hour of game play, I will edit the review when more hours have gone into playing it. First off, I'm pretty impressed with the visuals on some of the superstar models, especially Randy Orton, however I do feel there is some inconsistences amongst the models, some looking like they're from the PS3 (Jericho being a prime example of this) and not next gen. The game is not the best optimized, I have a beast of a laptop running games like Witcher 3, The Division, Rise of the Tomb Raider on ultra, hitting 60 fps with WWE2k16 on maximum I'm hitting on average 50, but patches will more than likely fix this in the future, after all it's not even been out a full 24 hours yet. Started the showcase and it's fun living out my childhood memories of Stone Cold. The roster is ridiculous, the amount of superstars to choose from is huge. The Divas however are lacking. It's pretty sad seeing Layla or Cameron in the game and not a single member of the ""4 horsewoman"". The creation mod looks good and glad they've put back a lot that was meant to be taken out the previous game. I've only briefly touched on the Universe mode, which I have enjoyed so far. Overall I think this is decent game, with future patches having the possibility of making it a really good game, once fps is smoother. It's worth a buy to any wrestling fan.EDITED REVIEWSo after spending more time on the game I feel there are one or two things I should add to my review. I still stand by the showcase being great and is arguably the best feature in this game. Althought the Hall of Fame showcase is not as good as the Stone Cold showcase, it is still good to play classic matches such as Macho Man v my favourite wrestler of all time, Jake ""the snake"" Roberts. The Universe mode is ok, but I feel it's missing one or two things to make the mode go from ok to great. The Career Mode is enjoyable, it's pretty darn fun using my created superstar in a semi-story mode. The interviews with Renee get repetitive quickly though. There seems to be an odd bug here and there that seems to make the game crash however this has only happened to me once luckly, but I have seen on other reviews/fourms it happens frequently to others.Pros:The showcase modeMy Career ModeThe insanely large roster (including a decent range of NXT stars to pick from and legends)Creation mode is back, bring back things they took out in the previous yearsUniverse mode is enjoyableGame looks good and has the presentation of a TV broadcastCons:The lack of divas (having Layla and Cameron but not any of the 4 horsewoman)Optimization (as mentioned hitting 50fps on max with a machine that smashes the recommended requirements)inconsistences with character modelsThe odd crash (happened once in my game, but seen it happens frequently in others)The ridiculous lip sync and the fact the mouths are so big when speaking, it looks like you can shove Neptune in there.Overall 7.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the best wrestling game since, well SvsR the first one.This has some of the best presentations of the shows of any game so far, the game play is much better, the reversal system massively improved and to top it off it does recognize your DS4.I basically can not recommend this game more enough.Also the framerates in matches are far better than 2k15.So I have no idea why the reviews went from positive to mixed but take it from a person that has over 80 hours in 2k15 and a life time in all the wrestling games he could get his hand on, this game is deserving of the 40 euros price tag.

												While I'm recommending this game based on what's here, I have to also talk about why I WON'T be buying another WWE game from 2K until they make some changes.First off, the game IS a bit buggy at launch and it may run, or it may not. Every single time you click ""Play"" it's a toss-up whether or not the game will launch. Once it launches, I'm good with 60 fps at Ultra, but whether or not the game starts up at all is the question. Second, it absolutely ticks me off that we PC users don't get the ability to use custom music. There's no reason the restrictions of the consoles should remain for the PC version. We don't get stuck with the console graphics, but we do get stuck with the console limits on custom music. This is a DEAL BREAKER for me. I make leagues of my own CAWs, and if I can't give them custom music, that's half of the pro wrestling experience completely thrown out the window. Sure, modders will make it possible, but I shouldn't have to mod the game to get what I want out of it when it comes to something as basic and integral as entrance music. It would be NO BIG DEAL for the game to let us point to a folder full of MP3 files, but they're simply not allowing it. That stinks, and it's the big reason why I won't be purchasing 2K17 for PC (or anything else) until I hear that Yukes/2K put the ability to assign custom music to CAWs back into the game. It's ridiculous that I would rather go back and play my league on 2K14 for Xbox 360 because it is technically inferior to 2K16 in terms of customization! Another big problem is the submission mini-game. It just sucks, and the AI almost always has the advantage, it seems. It doesn't even make a lot of sense, and I find myself missing the old submission method. Again, 2K14 is making me happy where 2K16 does not. If only I could get 2K14 on my PC.What 2K16 does have is great animation, excellent graphics, and a more streamlined (though more limited) creation suite. I'm currently debating if these advances are enough to make me keep this game. Frankly, I'm still pretty ticked about the lack of custom music and I've been two seconds away from hitting the ""submit"" button on a refund. The only thing keeping me interested is the exceptionally nice look to this game. But graphics aren't everything, and while the models all look great, they still don't look photorealistic, and in the end I can probably be happy with my 2K14. So I continue to debate over the value of 2K16 to me. If you're a fan of the WWE and all the ""superstars"" and ""divas"" in their roster, then you'll probably love this game. Me? I *really* don't care about the WWE characters and would much rather play my own. When some company makes a game like this that doesn't have any licensed characters and instead lets CAW fans make their own leagues, I'll buy two copies (if it's any good). Sadly, I think the thing that ultimately ruins this series for me is the WWE licensing, which seems to be pretty restrictive when it comes to customizing features. That's all I can conclude, anyway, because there is NO TECHNICAL REASON why WWE 2K16 wouldn't support custom music or other customizing features that are missing. So many names were removed from the announcements, so many clothing pieces, so many types of makeup, face paint, etc. and worst of all, on the PC we STILL have to go through the stupid upload process to get logos and faces into the game. WE'RE ON A PC! Why should I need to send something from my PC, to the web site, then get into the game and download it again when it WAS ON MY PC IN THE FIRST PLACE?! This is just so stupid!Why can't I get a Fire Pro Wrestling game like this one, yet with all FPW's customization? I suspect the glitches and bugs will be squashed and eventually the game will start up when you click ""Play"" instead of tossing a coin and deciding at that time whether or not you'll get to play. I doubt, however, that 2K gives a crap about patching in custom music.GET IT TOGETHER, 2K.  This is the PC, not a console, and we want CUSTOMIZATION. You won't get another dime out of me until you wake up and support the CAW fans, too. Consider it a thumbs up if you only want to play within the WWE using their characters or characters that fit the really strict creation content (limited names, no music, limited clothing, limited body sizing, etc), but a big thumbs down if you're a CAW fan. They really disappointed me with this one. I'm getting the refund and going back to 2K14 on my 360.UPDATE:  Steam denied my refund request because ""play time"" was past 2 hours. Unfortunately, much of that time was the game ""running"" in the background (unbeknownst to me) after it had crashed on start-up. This IS a continuing issue with this game. Feel free to check the discussions and other tech support requests. My actual time in game was no doubt under 2 hours. My time trying to load it, trying to troubleshoot it, and dealing with technical issues was over 2 hours.  I do not think 6 hours of troubleshooting and digging into the game to see what's working and what's not working, and what's missing, is ""significant playtime"". Anyway, if you're having doubt about the game, get your refund ASAP. Steam doesn't seem to care that the game process continues to run after crashing, or that the game fails to make it clear that they've completely stripped the creation suite, prior to purchase. I feel like I got ripped off by 2K, here. Enjoy your 45 bucks, guys. I'll seriously reconsider purchasing any 2K title after this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game makes 2k15 look like an unfinished beta. There are very well made improvements such as the reversal system and the ability to change difficulty during career mode. The game itself is addictive (note: I'm a huge wwe fan anyway) it has that 'hmm maybe one more match' feel about it. The career mode is excellent with infinite choices to make your own superstar and get into the hall of fame over a 16 year career. Had zero running issues and running it at 60fps on a gtx 770.

												I'm writing this negative review in the hopes that it will assist the others who have similar problems in gaining attention to fix this issue.After putting so much time in making many creations and downloading many more, I ran into a save data corruption issue. This needs to be addressed, and the game doesn't deserve a positive review until it is mended.This has been the first wrestling game I've decided to buy in 10 years (since Smackdown vs Raw 2006 on PS2 ...It was also a very careful decision after reading up and following the games made the last decade.) and would hate to see my experience of it, along with many others on here, end this way.In short: Fix the game breaking issues, and I'll turn the thumb up. Cool? Cool.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												LOVE IT!I have not owned a WWE game since PS2's Here Comes The Pain. These games have evolved so much, and have addressed a ton of little things that were lacking in the old games. The rosters are huge, and not just limited to the current one. So if you are not a fan of the newer guys, there are a ton of guys from the old school and attitude era. I love that you can create your own TV show, and customize the roster for different shows. I've created a ""Legends show"" with the roster filled with the old wrestlers. Story mode is an entirely new experience for me, and i think it's awsome. It follows the career of Stone Cold Steve Austin and it has you play a lot of his memorable matches accompanied by old clips. It is really well done.Overall I am very happy to have access to wrestling games once again (They weren't on PC for a really long time). It is everything i wanted from the old games. You are no longer limited to just one finisher for a wrestler or even just one outfit. The customization and amount of content is amazing. I hear players experiences issues. I have encountered some random crashes, and a constant crash during the WWE showcase mode, during Stone Cold vs Shawn Michaels. It crashes every single time after it requires you to irish whip Shawn inside the ring. I just end up beating him without completing the objective and am able to proceed through story mode and finished it without any further incidents.I'd rate it a 8/10. Looking forward to 2K17 and might go back and get 2K15.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

EDIT 03/06/16: The game has been patched and all of the issues I had have been fixed. Now I absolutely recommend this game without hesitation! (Original review)[pastebin.com]Last year we finally got a WWE licensed wrestling game on PC in over a decade, but it was a fairly mediocore game. 2K16 is a huge step up from that - It reintroduces many features that were missing, has a much larger roster and online is greatly improved.In fact this is one of my all time favourite pro wrestling games. If you're a fan of the old school Smackdown or N64 games then beware that this is a much more simulation focused game. It's a lot more slow paced and more unforgiving but that allows for more strategic gameplay. With stamina you can't endlessly run away, and you may have to decide to rest a little following a big move rather than hitting another with no stamina left for a quick pin. There's also limited reversals this time and THANK GOD. FINALLY matches aren't just an endless chain of reversals anymore.If you dislike any of that then everything can be customised; turn off stamina, reversal slots, adjust finisher damage etc. Also this year's game brings back features like Create An Arena and a much improved Create a Wrestler. (You can create females again! Yay!) The roster is massive and includes past and current wrestlers including some from NXT. Entrances are the best I have ever seen and are now completely seemless which allows you to interfere during your opponent's entrance! Awesome!It still suffers from Yearly Franchise Syndrome™ which includes plenty of minor bugs and glitches and some strange roster ommisions like Sasha Banks and Charlotte even though Blake and Murphy are somehow in the game. And for some reason you can't use your own entrance music even though you could do it in the last gen console games. Commentary is also as bland as ever and feels like it hasn't improved since Smackdown Vs Raw 2006.However it is entirely modabble! There was tons of great mods last year from updating wrestler's attire and entrances to entirely new arenas, and this year is no exception. Check out Smacktalks[smacktalks.org] for tons of great mods including tutorials on how to mod the game to use your own custom entrance music.[smacktalks.org] ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Currently, this is THE wrestling game to buy on steam. 2K16 is a MASSIVE upgrade from 2K15, with tons of more features such as Create a Show, Create a Diva, and Create an Arena as well as having the largest roster EVER with tons of arenas and over 100 spots of your created wrestlers. If you're looking for a stacked roster and tons of creation then I would gladly recommend 2K16.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game but... the ""My Career"" title shot system needs to be fixed. Here is what I mean. In order to get a title shot you have to be the #1 thru 3 contender to the title. That is fine. (Even though it is a bit grindy to get enough popularity to move up the ranks). Then, you need to be in a ""rivalry"" with the current champion. This is the part that is annoying. I ended up winning the title after about a calendar years (about 120 matches - two to three matches a calendar week in game) worth of time climing the rankings and getting my title shot finally. I won the belt and in my first title defense... I had ""cut scene magic"" occur to take the title from me. (You can't control it, it just happens). First issue - the guy who took the title from me isn't the Champion... It defaults to going back to Seth Rollins for some reason. (The guy who I took it from originally). THEN I tried to get back into a rivalry with Seth Rollins (since I am the #1 contender still) and either A) he didn't wrestle - so I couldn't attack him to force the rivalry, or B) I had to wrestle against him, and no matter how badly I beat him, he was ""fine"" with it and didn't get angry at my wrestler - so again - no ""Rivalry"" is initiated. Now I am at the next pay per view - and have another match against Seth Rollins - this makes about 15 matches against Seth Rollins in a row... but NO title shot because I don't have the magic ""rivalry"" engaged.I am due for at least another 15-20 matches with Seth Rollins (despite winning every one of them) before I can contend for the title shot again.This needs to be fixed. I would recommend NOT buying this game until that feature is fixed, unless you enjoy spending a LOT of time grinding matches against the same opponent over and over.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WWE 2K16 is awesome, simply awesome as a PC wrestling sim. Runs A LOT better than WWE 2K15, solid 60FPS in game at High settings with 8X MSAA. Gameplay is a little sluggish compared to the previous WWE games, but it helps control the pacing and makes it feel like a true WWE broadcast. Graphics are also improved a lot over 2K15, from the hair not clipping as much, to the sweat effects.Very big roster, it has a Superstar or Diva for everyone . It has the obvious choices like John Cena, Randy Orton, and Stone Cold Steve Austin, but they even added the more obscure Superstars, Divas, and tag teams like Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Alundra Blayze, and Harlem Heat.2K Showcase follows Stone Cold Steve Austin, but I haven't touched it very much as I am not interested in the story, but for what it has it's great.MyCareer is also a major improvement over WWE 2K15. Instead of having you embroiled in meaningless rivalries (""B! Blade! anyone?), you get to pick your path into the WWE and what you want to do with your career. Absolutely amazing, worth the money by itself.I would say if you have the money OR have not played WWE 2K16 on PS4 or Xbox One, definitely pick this up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not No Mercy, but it's probably the best wrestling game since then.  Combines a comparable control scheme, with an almost Fire Pro-depth moveset, strategizing on your reversals and stamina, and creative character design.  Matches can go long or short, and like actual pro wres, your match scores can still be strong if you lose in an entertaining fashion that puts both wrestlers over.

I was hoping Elimination Chamber matches wouldn't be too hard to find because they were usually plentiful last time I played online (WWE 2k14), but apparently no one does play them. Even 2v2 matches are extremely difficult for me to find people for. I don't know why 2k decided to re-invent the wheel with online and get rid of the ranked and player lobbies for ""hey choose random match type and cross your fingers that someone in the world wants to play the same thing at the same time"".

												To keep this short and sweet, WWE 2k16 is the wrestling game that fans deserve, it is a massive improvement over 2k15 which lacked so much customization, had a lack luster career mode, terrible soundtrack and the worst matchmaking system of all time in a video game.                   Pros: Game run really well, no crashes for me during my 105 Hour playthrough, and the game ran at a                             constant 60FPS at 1080P (Expect for the entrances which are capped at 30FPS).                             The entrances now don't have a loading screen, it just goes from one entrance to the next straight away                             which adds realism to the game.                            Arnold's T1 Entrance and Overall design is incredible.                            Having the ability to choose what championship you want in to go after in Career Mode, as well                             as choices like joining the Authority or Rebelling against them.                            Soundtrack is so much better this year, and you can also use WWE Entrance Themes from the game for                            Menu music as well.                            Customization: You can create Divas, Arenas, Championships, Shows etc...                            Stone Cold Steve Austin's Showcase Mode is just awesome.                    Cons: Online matchmaking is still terrible and there is no leaderboards at all.                             Renee Young's Career Interview's are repetitive, random at times with no link to your current storyline                           what so ever, and she look's terrible too in the game.                           No choice of Voice in Career Mode, and no Diva's Career Mode.Overall I enjoyed WWE 2K16 way more then 2K15, If you are thinking about picking it up then you will definitely get your money's worth compared to last year, plus you get an extra 6 matches for Macho Man Randy Savage's showcase mode because you get all the game's DLC for free. 2K you are going in the right direction, keep it up.

												This game is an awesome wrestling simulator. I've only played one other wrestling game before this and that was WWE All Stars on the Xbox so when I began playing this I noticed it was completely different and people will eithr love it or hate it. So i'll tell you my experience with this game and you can be the judge whether it's worth a try. Initially my first week with this game was frustrating as I couldn't pick up the controls because there is literally no tutorial in this game; you have to pick it up and learn it for yourself. I found myself looking online to be able to use certain moves and certain grappling techniques. However after spending enough time on this game (as you can see from my hours) I would highly recommend it. After the learning curve I found this game to be extremely enjoyable, granted it can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥at first (have fun mastering the reversals) it is a fun and enjoyable wrestling game. There are 100+ wrestlers to play as (male AND female) and also the option to download custom made wrestlers by the community who didn't make it into the game eg; AJ Styles, CM Punk, Shinsuke Nakamura, Batman (i'm not even kidding)There are five different types of play modes available in this game.Play - Allows you to setup any match and play it in whatever ring with any of the wrestlers eg; Kofi Kingston vs The Rock at Raw with Hell in a Cell. This mode is fun as it allows you to make any match and is quite fun.My Career - Allows you to import a custom made wrestler or make a new one to play your own WWE career (WARNING: MAKE YOUR WRESTLER IN CREATIONS RATHER THAN MAKING IT IN MY CAREER - YOU CAN'T PLAY YOUR WRESTLER OUTSIDE OF MY CAREER IF YOU MAKE IT THERE RATHER THAN IMPORTING IT) This mode although fun at first can become boring and repetitve fast. After completing NXT you have the option for any of the main titles (Titles before the brand split). I found myself facing the same people over and over again which became boring after a while. The Career Mode is extremely basic and is not where this game shines. You can make your own rivalries and create a tag team with another wretler as well as having a manager if that takes your liking. Oh and you can't play as a woman wrestler.Showcase Mode - Basically allows you to play through Stone Cold Steve Austin's career. This mode is fun as it gives you objectives to do during the match (eg; attack opponent by ringside) which allows you to unlock extra characters. (although with the PC version you can just unlock everything anyway) It's fun but nothing i've sunk hours into.Universe Mode - Create your own shows, PPV's, Championships for shows, rivalries, tag teams. All that stuff. It's fun I guess but I often found myself skipping the shows and playing the PPV's only.Online Play - Buggy and laggy as hell - avoid it.As mentioned before you can download your own wrestlers from the creations tab and play as them in the ""Play"" and ""Universe Mode"". This is where the game is most fun. Although the game features a lot of wrestlers to play off the bat I enjoy getting the custom ring gear for wrestlers and play as them in the ""Play"" and ""Universe Mode"".So if you're willing to learn the controls and want a fun wrestling simulator i'd recommend this game. If you're not willing to spent the time to learn what this game has to offer and want a game you can learn in five minutes then this isn't for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everyone is talking about how bad this games performace is and i dont see why. I have everything on high settings except the crowd population is at 60% and it runs at 60 fps. If you have a good computer i reccomend you buy this game its alot of fun and a good way to kill time. There are several little flaws with this game but they arent a big deal to me except for two. The first one is the commutity creations. Everytime i try to download a character/arena it wont show up in my game and apparenty everyone is having this issue too, so if they can fix that in a patch that would be great. The second one is the ""create a arena"" its a fun mode but you cant actually have battles in the arena you built. Which would have been good to know before wasting an hour building my arena (like i said a good way to kill time). Out of all of the good things and bad things about this game i would give it a 8/10 it would be a 9 if 2k knew how to fix their games...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's so much better then 2K15. I've had 0 performance issues, so I'm not sure what all these negative reviews are on about.EDIT: Alright, now that I've played a decent bit of this game I can expand a bit. The gameplay is a lot better then 2K15 in practically every way. The new submission system is neat, but the real star of the show are the new reversals. The graphics are nice although some player models look like complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm not too deep into MyCareer, but it has been fun so far. Also the creation suite is much more refined in this game. With a lot more options and some nice new features in there too. Overall I'd say it's a really solid game and you should go buy it. Also free dlc is pretty gr8. My only gripe is that as of now the game does not support 21:9 resolution, whilst 2K15 did.EDIT 2: So apparently people are having their save files corrupted. I'm not sure how common it is, and this hasn't happened to me, but it wouldn't hurt to backup your game just in case.8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												- Constant crashes despite having good performance.- No custom music.- Save-file corruption risk (it has not happened to me yet, but after reading so many complaints about this issue, now I'm afraid of playing).Everything is good in this game except for this. The new submission mini-game is weird and difficult, but I think it's better than the old button-mashing system that could be exploited by using turbo buttons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Short version: This is no different to last year. The only change is now you have a set amount of reversals (that you regain over time) to avoid the ridiculous amont of reversals of yesteryear. Unless you REALLY love Showcase or somehow weren't bored of the Career or Universe mode's repetition, you won't miss this. It's probably better than what THQ would still be producing, but 2K are just like WWE - phoning it in now they have no competition. Why try?Long version:Exactly as I said in my review of last year's game, there are moments of huge potential hidden in here.The movement is so fluid nowadays that things look a notch more realistic (like playing a tag match as The Outsiders, and Hall slips out of a move and pushes the guy in your direction as you run up and deliver Nash's Big Boot finisher, beautiful).The tech is advanced enough to have physics for satisfying impacts on weapons and through tables now too (X-Pac's Super X-Factor onto a ladder or table you conveniently laid below is a bit more satisfying now, but not as much as setting up a table next to a ladder, fighting on top of the ladder, and powerbombing the guy off it in exactly the right place where you laid out the table, which you may or may not have set on fire beforehand.But it still needs a lot of tweaking. They're clearly aiming for the more thought-provoking game we once had around 2007, with stamina and limb damage and how it affected your moves, but they're still not there yet. Even when they do add things, there's no tutorial and no real manual so people are tasked to find out themselves what icons mean or how to do things.Another notable thing is finisher spamming and no-selling. Spamming finishers and kicking out of them has become cool. This has been replicated in the game, and it's just as ridiculous. Your matches can go 10 minutes too long because Rusev kicked out of his 10th F-5. It makes the health bars meaningless.Unfortunately the graphics have always been a generation behind. There's been no major graphical overhaul in this version, it's still cartoony, and the Divas are still creepy as hell and have ♥♥♥♥ed up Joker smiles. Funnily enough, Steph finally looks a lot like Steph now - she seems to have a face that's been impossible to recreate in digital form thus far.And how's the commentary? Well Cole, King and JBL are annoying as ever. They're all good guys ('faces') now, so they brown-nose everyone in the ring and spout hyperbole like how Kane and Daniel Bryan was ""one of the most famous tag teams in history"". They have conversations about the guys in the ring... then repeat THE SAME CONVERSATION a minute later. So kudos to 2K for accurately recreating their horrible, repetitive chatty commentary. Well King, if wishes were fishes...While the roster is large (mainly because of the Austin showcase adding random guys like Savio Vega and Mikey Whipwreck), #GiveDivasAChance didn't reach WWE 2K16 so women didn't get the same treatment. Basically the only women are Trish, Lita and all the usual names. No one new like Sasha Banks, Bayley or Charlotte nor the female legends like Victoria, Molly, Ivory or dare I say Chyna. And for some reason Emma has her cool heel theme but is still dancing like an idiot and her face looks like a puffy kawaii interpretation rather than her actual self. With added sunburn to her face.This year's Showcase has you play through an abridged version of Austin's WWE career (with a few bonus WCW and ECW matches). Haven't you done a bit of that before? Yes! You'll be replaying some of the matches you did in WWE 13's Attitude Era showcase!There's no big extra bonus showcase this time around either, just one where you play one match each as the Hall of Fame class of 2015. Relive those historic and proud moments like when Jake the Snake beat the everloving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of inductee Randy Savage while Miss Elizabeth screamed for him to stop, or the time Alundra Blayze faced Paige at WrestleMania 31, or you can relive Kevin Nash's career- and industry-changing moment when he and Scott Hall... faced Harlem Heat in a tag match.I always enjoyed Showcase mode (and it s predecessor Legends of WrestleMania), but it's not very interactive now. Here's how it goes now:1) You start a match2) 5-minute cutscene of entrances and opening moments of match, very slow-paced.3) Get given an objective as you start the match (e.g. irish whip your opponent, do your finisher, throw them out the ring), this can take anything from 3 seconds to a minute or two.4) Very slow-paced cutscene plays of what happened next in the match, this can be a few minutes, because they've got to show every second! You've now been sat here 10 minutes and only played for 2 of those minutes at most.4b) Sometimes there's a QTE, which means you spend 20 seconds watching the buttons waiting to see which flashes, so now you're not even watching the cutscenes!5) Go back to 3 until match is over.This is combined with the familiar half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥unemotional commentary from J.R. He and King are slightly more believable, but now just sound mildly interested. I picture them sitting on the sofa, feet up in front of the TV and commentating on the match to each other.My Career mode is where you create a guy and climb the ranks. In the last game it was just a load of meaningless matches, and it's not any different this time around. Again there's huge potential here. When I reached rank #1 for Kevin Owen's NXT title, I made sure my bosses (the game) gave me my shot by taking out Owens. He was having a match, so as he was doing his title pose during his entrance, I appeared into camera shot behind him, the crowd went mental, and I laid him out.When I got promoted to Raw, I needed to fast track myself to the title, so I made a statement by going after the #1 contender for the world title: Brock Lesnar! He was having a match, so as he was doing his little pose during his entance, I appeared into camera shot...Ah, you see where I'm going. That's the problem. You can go after people, make statements, do your thing, but there's only one way to do it, it's the same old♥♥♥♥♥♥ and there's no intricate storylines. Just as in Universe Mode, two guys beat each other up each week then have a PPV match. Same every month. Even if something major happens, like joining The Authority, it's like nothing happened, just a random cutscene that played.The unintentional highlight of this mode is the promos, delivered awfully and eerily similar to one of the Family Guy voices. ""Nothing but net.""Every week you're very awkwardly interviewed by Renee Young. She asks you about a guy, you stare silently at each other for 10 seconds, then you get a choice of reply. A lot of the time these choices are vague, or it's a meaningless choice. You'll randomly turn heel for not trashing your bosses (The Authority) in your first month in the job as an NXT jobber, or you'll pick a harmless looking response and your guy will insult the fans or something.There's nothing sophisticated though. All you're doing is saying if you want to feud with a guy and if you want to be heel or face. Every ♥♥♥♥ing week. Then do random matches and see random cutscenes, the same ones you've seen every month.Universe Mode is completely unchanged. It and My Career are pretty much the same now. I've seen a lot of people say they stopped playing Career when they realised it was the same as Universe.On its own as a game it's alright, but this is pretty much exactly the same game as last year, if not worse. I don't feel like I've wasted my time, but it's definitely wasted potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a strange game for me to review - well outside my wheel-house of usual choices here on Steam, BUT, in my youth I played a-many wrastling games starting with the glorious Nintendo 64. And yeah, I love wrestling games. Passerby's generally get them all wrong - they are in-fact NOT button mashers, but very strategic timed chess-like matches of skill.As soon as I loaded up WWE 2K16, a flood of memories came back - and man this title didn't dissapoint. The tried-and-true formula that is the backbone of nearly all wrestling games is still present, with a few new additions. Some good. Some not so good.I like everything about this title, except maybe I could do without some of the 'mini-game' additions to the fights. These shouldn't even really be called mini-games, but that is what 2K dubbed them. It is just little joystick battles that resolve a grab, etc. I think they are unnecessarily overly complicated, but hey, thats just my opinon.Pros:+Graphics are beautiful+Controller support is great+Comentation is excellent and hasn't gotten old yet+Workshop support, a huge roster of wrestlers, plus a deep create-a-wrestler (standard affair) ensures things don't get stale+Metric tons of modesCons:-I mean it's AAA, so it is expensive and there was originally DLC - what else can I expect, right? I wouldn't recommend paying full price, but I would get it on at least a half-price sale no questions asked-'Mini-games' to resolve parts of the battle are unnecessarily overly complicated IMOIf you are new to this genre, watch some videos or buy an older version first, but if you are familiar, you should own this!Peace,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm terrible at reviews, but I really want to leave a positive mark to help this game out. I loved wrestling games as a kid and I just spent 4 hours making a group of superstars, a couple arenas, nailing their entrances, and getting everything the way I liked it. Somewhere in those 4 hours I realized that I was having a very good time. I decided to give a match a go and it feels similar to the arcade like mashing of games like Just Bring It, but had so much more depth. It took me a match or two to get used to it, but after that that feeling came back. This is a fun game. Not just the next big thing that you feel obligated to play to be included in the hype, but a video game that just feels right. I know this is opinion based, and it could be nostalgia forcing a bias, but I want more games like this on pc. The positive review is my small effort in showing developers that when they do good work, it's appreciated and more importantly, purchased.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 WWE 2K16 for PCOne of the best WWE games of all timeAfter putting 50+ hours into this game on the Xbox, I'm going to review the PC version. So I came back to WWE games with 2k15. I enjoyed 2k15 because I didnt realize how good a wrestling game can be.But 2K16 is way better than 15.They improved so many flaws that 2K15 had. Now you can't spam counters anymore, you actually have to think if you want to take the hit, or use up one stock of your counter-meter. The PC performance improved aswell! Positive:   Biggest roster ever. The career mode improved by 100% You can play the best Stone Cold matches in the 2k showcase CAW(Create a wrestler) is great again.  Customizing the entrance can lead to some funny moments. Creation of custom titles. All DLCs included. The gameplay improved overall. A lot of things to unlock. A lot of gamemodes Online and local multiplayer. Upload and download user created wrestlers. Tons of moves Neutral:   Facial animations can look weird. Decent, but not great graphics. Especially the audience. Negative:   Sometimes it takes a long time to start the game.  VERDICT:   WWE 2K16 is an amazing game. If you like wrestling you will love this game.  It improved A LOT after 2K15. My final score is a 85/100 Thanks for reading. Feel free to comment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's better than 2k15 by miles, proving that the last release was probably worth skipping a release to get to this point. Although that's not as big of a compliment as I made it sound, It's a very mixed bag.The customisation options are all back and are utterly outstanding, at the moment the hours of gameplay I've had two matches and spent the rest of it customising and completing the WWE Universe mode to my liking. This is where i have most of my fun, nothing better than being the show runner and having the shows run how i want.The wrestling in the matches i have had are still very poor, messy and so, so glitchy. Little mechanic faults and immersion breaking animation trips. Is the character trying to pick another up but he's slightly out of reach? Watch him slide into place as if on ice... Is a wreslter next to an object or even on top of it? Sit back and watch the animation freak out before either giving up or just ignoring you did any button press. It's the 2016 version, how is it still so bad?The ropes seem to be a bug bear of the character models who spin around near them like they are electric. Getting in and out of the ring is still limited to the middle section or they freak out at lifes hard choice of weather you meant cclimb the turnbuckle, go to the apron or exit entireley, 2K need to have a little button reallocating. Even lifting an opponent from the floor can take some work as the character model struggles to comprehend what it is you've instucted it to do, often just looking down then stepping back.Everything in ring feels slower, not in a pacing way just a doddering way to keep the gameplay more 'realistic'. Sure it's realistic if you want to watch the Old age pensioner divison. Running around makes it seem like the players swapped their kneecaps for sponges and they are wearing moon boots. It's one of the ugliest movement animations I've seen in a game aiming for realisim. It's ugly, janky and cheap looking and pretty embarrasing, it's WWE it's already hard to explain to the missus why i still buy the games and still watch it... I've sweated with anger when the prompts of 'too fast' and 'too slow' pop on screen after reversing, I've sat emulating a Rocky montage trying to train my fingers to hit it right. I;'m convinced there is no real pattern, it's just what ever the game needs it to be at that moment.They've capped the amount of reversals you can do at once, which is a nice feature though i feel they would of been better served actually having to play the game once they release is so they can see just how pants the system is and always has been.It's 2016, as I'm reminded by said missus who once again asks why I like this soap opera... Why, why in the day sof 'Realistic action' can't i stop a taunt? Some of these dudes have entire dance routines as taunts which lead to your character helplessly doing the funky shuffle while a large fighter barrels towards you. In short the wrestling aspect of this game is it's worst feature, it's poor mechanics hindered by worse colision detection, AI and movement. 2K definately have not figured out how to do this type of action.Slightly less poo yet still on the scale of ""ew what's on my shoe"" it's the 'Showcase'. Which is still pretty much the laziest, most uninspired useless game mode. ""Hey, remember all those great memories of when WWE was good? Here, play this and remind yourself why you didn't just subscribe to the Network instead"" QTE moments which are epicly pointless, the QTE is not so much a 'Quick Time Event' but a 'watch this clip and press the button after a few minutes of an animation playing out' And you can't enjoy the animation of an event being recreated because have to focus on the button wheel at the bottom of the screen to catch the QTE. So what's the point?I know what they are doing, they want us to go back into our memories of when the product didn't feature Roman Reigns, and by having it fleshed out so poorly it will trick us into thinking we were just remembering it wrong and it did all suck. How many objectives per Showcase match do we have to meet? It's like a job i didn't apply for. 7 for the Bret Hart match alone, and some of the descriptions for the objectives are hilariously appauling.The roster is the biggest we've seen yet the oddest ommisions are glaring, the womens division gets clearly the worst treatment as the best names get dropped in favour of 2 types of sting and 4 Triple H's. He's definately going over.Customisation is amazing, the graphics are good for most of the character models although 2K still can't figure out long hair. However the actual wrestling is disgusting by and large.Here's a quote for the next poster, slap it right on Goldbergs forehead 'Best bought on sale'			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you were like me looking to re-live some WWE nostalgia from the old WWF games, do yourself a favour, and save your money.Bugs, crashes and terrible overall gameplay. You can literally beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your opponent and still manage to get pinned easily and lose. The mini games ruin the game, they're not fun or challenging at all.I just had a game as my custom character where I pinned the opponent, he grabbed the rope and both wrestles just froze in the pin position. I had to quit the match.Lucky I got my game off a 3rd party site and saved some money, still, wish I didn't bother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the best WWE Games out there i have ever played. ( WWE SVR 2006 - WWE 2K16 )Yes, some features like Create a story is missing but instead of that you have so many new opportunities to draw the game for your liking.Pros:- Create A Diva/Superstar, Arena, Championship etc.. with MANY Functions to choose from like having a metal like or  matt outfit- Universe Mode to make the feuds and battles which WWE missed ( taker vs sting / lesnar vs your own Superstar )- Good Optimized- Very good graphics- Roster with over 100 playable characters + you can download your own Caws/Items from community workshop ( CM Punk, new outfits for everyone, shows like ECW )Cons:- Game just got released, needs a bit bugfixes ( update released 2 days ago to fix )- None If you are a WWE Fan and always dreamed of making your own storylines, buy this game! Note: ( I am not an online player, just playing the universe to make my own story )			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I origanlly hated this game. I kept crashing and I wasn't able to play. Once everything fixed the game was excellent. Love the showcase and if you're a wrestling fan like I am get this game. PROS: Graphics are really goodLot's of wrestlers.Run's smoothly.Really addictive.Huge create a superstar.CONS: $hitty commentary like all WWE games.Most of the superstars have to be unlocked in showcase.Only 6 wrestlers at once. Ex: 30-man Royal Rumble when there is 6 superstars in the ring they don't countdown until someone is eliminated.Funny A$$ glitches Ex: Wrestler goes ragdolling all around the ring very common for this to happen.Roman Reigns always kicks out at 2.Pretty bland MyCareer.I really recommend you guys getting WWE2K17 but if you wanna play now. You should this game has some cons. but I think it's worth it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed the game, the large roster, and the return of several modes. The controls were smooth and varied, and all in all was one of the best itterations of WWE 2k. The issue I took with the game was stability. Innitially the game worked great. After about 15 hours of playtime, the game started crashing on the load of any match. I tried various troubleshooting steps to resolve, and I just couldn't clear it up. Too bad. Like American football, pro wrestling is a neglected genre on PC. I was whole heartedly excited to have the chance to pop in play from time to time, and go through and unlock everything. You'll notice a lot of other people had stability/save/crash issues. Purchase at your own risk, it's not a very great port.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Review is specifically on the MyCareer part of the game.Cons- Not allowed to hold multiple titles (singles/tag-team) at the same time.- Sluggish mechanics. (not a stamina issue) Control pathing from running to picking up grounded opponents can sometimes get caught by the environment. Inability to get out of the ring while the player is near the turnbuckles etc. Problematic controling due to simplistic nature of the game's intended layout.   - Unresponsive controls. (again, not a stamina issue) Submission, chain wrestling minigame mechanics are sloppy, and slippery. Pressing a button a second too fast causes the action not to register at all. This happens during striking, grappling, and reversals. - Match rating system is a poor attempt at prolonging matches. Game only registers one grappling, striking, and running move per match. Players will have to utilize about 3-4 signature and finishing moves to gain a five star match rating. 6-8 special moves per match counteracts the game's intentions to make the game realistic.- MyCareer match booking system will often pit the same wrestlers against players even when no rivarly is in place.- Rivarly system feels stale at times. Not varied enough to provide storyline tension.- No create-a-move option- No mycareer rematch option. - Manager relationship system not explained. Pros- Decent variety of wrestling moves to choose from. This should always be improved. Score: 4/10Wait a couple years before buying another 2K wrestling game. 2K Games needs to refine their mechanics. Too many unexplained features ruin the gaming experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In over 20 years of gaming I have never had a game crash as many times as this. I read the reviews and thought to myself ""it's fine, that won't happen to me"". I was wrong, I am very disappointed with this purchase. 14 hours played and my motivation to continue playing is null. Massive waste of £40.The 14 hours I have played have been slow, repetitive and honestly tedious. My Career: Number 1 contender for many many weeks, keep getting standard single matches, no title shot, getting very boring very quickly, I will say that the customization is pretty good if that's something that interests you. Couple this slow build up with frequent crashes and the game becomes uplayable.Stone Cold/Hall of Fame mode (whatever it is): If you want to unlock everything you are going to have to through 100s of matches doing X, Y, and Z. 'Do damage outside the ring', 'do damage with the chair', 'irish whip the opponent', 'COMPLETE QUICK TIME EVENT'. Jesus H. Spare me from this ****, every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ match is exactly the same, the same stringent criteria to unlock a little bit of kit.My honest advice is to save your money and do not buy this, play some of the older games. I'm not the hugest of wrestling fans these days, but I have enjoyed the games in the past and was a huge fan of the Attitude era, I thought this game might be portal back into WWE but it has left a very sour taste in my mouth.

												When I was a little kid, I would always look forward to the new WWE game. Whenever Christmastime would roll around, my grandma would let me open one gift before Christmas, and it was always my wrestling game. I've stuck with the brand since at least 2000, playing all the WWE games for Playstation 1, Nintendo Gamecube, XBOX Original, nearly all of the earlier generation consoles.Now, as an adult, I couldn't be more disappointed in these games. Character creation, my favorite feature, I used to be able to fill up all the character slots with creations, has simply been flushed down the toilet like a dead goldfish, with no hope of ever coming back or being great again. I've had better load times on the old  Smackdown vs. Raw  series for Playstation 2, this game refuses to let me preview what clothing and hairstyles look like on my superstar because it's too much trouble to render.I don't want to get into this. The old games were just so much better. This game isn't worth the $20 sale I bought it for. 2K is a disgrace on the entire WWE/WWF videogame chronology, my childhood memories, and my grandmother.

												It has a huge ammount of content including a lot of great video from various iconic 'superstars', their career highlights, and their rivalries. The graphics are pretty decent. The big issue with this game is that the control system is simply awful and makes it nigh-on unplayable. The use of right stick in circular movements to sustain or progress grapples is unresponsive and just doesn't work well. The old system of button combinations may well have resulted in repettitive moves and easy finishers but at least it was playable. This, at least after an hour or so of continuous play, is not. Even diehard fans should avoid this unless they can pick it up for next to nothing in a sale or bundle. I wanted to like it and I'll give it a better shot but right now I'm just extremely disappointed. If you chance it the odds are that you will be shouting more than you fair share of Steve Austin ""what?"" in pure frustration. For once the bulk of negative reviews seem to be accurate.*edit* perseverance unmasks an okay game. I'd still leave it to big wrestling fans only.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whether it be making my own storylines in Universe Mode or just battling it out with my 2 favorite superstars in a custom match, I fully enjoy the game.  Super Cena is a pain though.  It seems the devs coded Cena to be just about unbeatable on Legend difficulty.  The community creations are a huge plus as well.  There are so many custimazation options to make titles, superstars, or entrances and it really makes it feel like it is your universe to control.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gotta love all the new things since the last title I played, such as being able to pin when still on the ground by crawling over and pinning, limited reversals so you have to think about when to use them and can't abuse them, tons of game modes at offer here...

												I love wrestling. I love the WWE. I wanted to love this game but it's incredibly frustrating. It has the least intuitive control scheme I've ever seen. The game has no tutorial so if you're like me and never played a WWE game before you're going to have no idea what you're doing. The one aspect I really enjoyed was getting to see all of the wrestlers entrances before fights and the MyCareer mode is an awesome promise but the clunkiness of the game and having to wrestle with things like unclear timing for reversals, make this game hard to recommend to anyone who isn't willing to put up with hours of getting destroyed by AI in early matches in order to teach yourself how to properly enjoy the game.

												this game is a mixed bag. there's plenty of good like the customization and the match pacing but there are sevewral iussues. the first of these is both the ebst and worst aspect. of the game. the arenas look great, usually the character models look pretty solid, and the lighting is fantastic, but there's also the bad about the graphics like renee young's shark face and the disparity in quality between character models. john cena looks photorealistic while kevin owens looks like the console port of the sims 2 level of bad. the second prominent issue is the audio, it all feels like it was recorded ina dusty janitors closet, quite frankly. the audio isnt just bad in the deliveries of lines or the overall quality, it's also the lines themselves. i know it's hard to replicate live, genuine commentary on a game but jbl and lawler will go on about cena learning kantonese, like who actually cares? it's better than earlier years, however. you'd have a royal rumble where kane and let's say rey msyterio were in there and theyd blab about randy orton anyways i'm off topic tl;dr the commentary is still a hot steaming pile. the third and final (i'm too lazy to list any more) issue is that career mode is still a chore. you'd expect it to be like a decent narrative but it boils down to a neutered universe mode. i could go on but you get the point. ps: if you like dramatic 2 counts, you'll love the nxt portion.now onto some fo the goodthe first apparent plus to the game are the graphics even if they're also the weakest part in some areas. i mean the characters may not all look perfect but they atleast resemble their real life counterparts, which has honestly been an issue since svr 2011. barring renee yong and kevin owens the roster just looks nice.another positive is the vast customization. i'm pretty sure i spent more time customizing than playing the game. you can edit everything from what stable a character is in to what tatoos they have on their♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is amplified by the gargantuan roster in the game, although it'd be better if half the roster wasn't taken up by OL STONE COLD.the last of the positives i care enough to mention is the realism. nothing quite accurately represents wwe's modern product quite like having roman reignsa take 17  finishers to the face to win off a spearoverall: pretty good gam buy it on a sale or something if you really like fighting tyler breeze			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I never really intended to play this, and then got kind of addicted to it,,,There is absolutely loads to do - any number of match types, a ton of wrestlers, career mode and so on. That alone is enough for me to give the thumbs-up, but it's not without its issues - gameplay is a bit stiff, the commentary desperately needs more variety (and to actually pay attention to what's happening on screen!), and career mode is, sadly, a bit of a grind. As someone who doesn't normally play games like this, maybe I have unrealistic expectations, but it all felt a bit 'samey' after a while. Also, if they really want to get on side with me, make the women's stuff equal to the men's!! I want to create an awesome female wrestler who I can own a Royal Rumble with!Nevertheless, watching Sting suplex the living daylights out of...Sting (because some of the wrestlers have multiple versions) amused me enormously.It is worth getting on sale (I think I only paid about £8) if you are not a huge wrestling fan. If you are a huge wrestling fan, probably worth the asking price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pluses+Animations added to make it feel more authentic, IE: surprised animation after hard kickouts, grapple and can push to the ropes and decide to give a clean break or give a dirty strike, certain animations added like sitting upright after escaping a pin to setup for the next move you can do if you'd like strike to the back. Little things like that to add a better flow.+Limited reversals improves the incredibly easy difficulty level of last year (though it still regenerates faster than I'd like)+Career mode post interview after matches adds a lot of life+Graphics and roster continue to get better. Sure is a lifetime away from the 2k14 graphics engine now.+Pretty good customizatin suiteNeutral/ Showcase mode is not as exciting because it's only Austin and a couple matches for hall of famers. Last year they had a better idea with it. But I can't put this under the minus section because it is technically still good./ Changed mini games, I could see hating the new submission system, I'm ok with it. I'm also ok with the new pinning.Minuses-CRASHING ISSUES - this is bad enough to warrant a non recommendation but luckily it's happened very rarely for me and only with entrances. I suspect an issue they'll fix, but even so I can understand this causing you to think twice about getting it now.-Online improved but still takes time to find matches and can have a lot of lag. For twitch reactions like reversal and fighting games in general where you're paying attention to the frame this can be really rough.- One thing about the pinning I would qualify as a negative is they still haven't gotten it to a point where doing things like multiple match ending moves don't end matches and that's partly due to the kick outs not getting harder sooner-Commentary is still garbage-Misc audio like strikes and throws into barriers still the same archaic sounds from years ago-Career and universe mode aren't very different from the past year, they could still use more branching storyline optionsSome improvements, some is the same crap. The technical issues still make me consider giving it a thumbs down, but I'm enough of a fan and enjoy it enough to push through. If you're not maybe this isn't for you right now. Otherwise I am having a good time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												It's not the best WWE game, but I've certainly been having fun with it. I enjoy the touches to the A.I of the make it so that Heel characters will actually get frustrated and sometimes just start leaving and let themselves get counted out or they'll go out and get a weapon and try to get themselves disqualified. I appreciate the physics they have implemented to objects even if they end up looking goofy. As for gameplay, it hasn't really changed that much aside from a couple of mechanics like the submission mini-game or the visual indicators for how to kick out of a pinfall. The last game I played before this one was WWE 2K14 and i'm surprised to see just how similiarly this game plays to that one. So, if you've played any of the recent WWE games then you'll have a pretty good idea of how to play this game. If you can get it while it's on sale (my friend bought himself a copy and another copy for me as a gift for a grand total of $30) then I def reccommend, it's worth a pretty good time.

												Disliked this game, very much so! Bought because I enjoyed playing the game back on the 32bit consoles and even on the original xbox. Since then they've introduced un-needed mini games which over complicate the game (from what I can see you can't turn them off) and this makes playing the game more of a chore. My number 1 hate for this game though is the size it takes up on the hard drive. It's obviously been build on top of older versions leaving alot of redundant/ not used/ not needed information that will just take up hard drive space (and I mean alot +50GB). RAW on the xbox was and still is a better game and that runs off a DVD (5-7GB).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game would be fun if it wasn't buggy.   The worst issue I have has is with corrupted save files, which seems to happen to everyone if you read the forums.   2K for some reason doesn't want to patch this issue, and I have personally had a support ticket open for weeks with them with no resolution in sight. Without the ability for the game to save properly, all you can really do is play one-off matches.   The whole MyCareer and Creations section is unplayable because if the corrupt save file issue. Save your money, get something that actually works! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rowdy Roddy Piper smashing pies in Jimmy Snukas face humiliating him and taunting his child, Big John Stud stringing up Lord Alfred Hayes and ""basting"" his face with BBQ sauce....where have those days gone...theyre gone....but, you can relive your childhood more through this game than any of 2K's previous efforts.  The roster is much fuller than previous games and the intros, storylines, etc are all better. Just buy the damn game....cause Grendel said so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆      ☐ Worth full-price      ☐ Only on sale+ Massive roster.+ Decent graphics.- Horrendous optimization. FPS tanks HARD outside of fights on a rig capable of running modern AAA releases on the best graphics settings at 60 FPS.- Gameplay mechanics and animations are clunky and leave a lot to be desired.- QTE-fest. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. These new WWE games are a major step back from the old WWF/WCW games by THQ on the Nintendo 64. I can't believe major titles with production values as low as this are still being made. I thought we were passed this. Almost as bad as the Acclaim games from the 90s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a miserable experience. The quicktime-event based wrestling becomes boring very quickly, and the frustrating aspect of trying to switch between the handful of ""minigames"" that every move requires you to perform just to succeed at a move doesn't help. Ultimately the game feels extremely unresponsive (compared to the classics on PS2 and N64) where it was all about fun and not about slow-paced ""realism"".The customization is the best part of this game, have fun making a character and then prepare to sluggishly stumble around a ring until an opponent hits you and then you just sit there waiting for them to stop slowly slapping you and putting you in pins and submissions so you can actually play the game a little. It's kind of like a WWE-watching simulator, you spend 95% of the game just watching the character you make either try to catch their breath or just lying on the ground while you wait for him to maybe stand up at some point.

												WWE2K16 is a massive improvement over the last year title.Game works better, unlike last year I did not need to mess with settings much to make everything run smooth.It has way more content (all the dlc`s on day one) and things for community to create. Create a Diva is back baby!The AI is way more fast and aggressive thanks to this matches feel more real.The animations are little better and the guys move really good and realistic.The new limited reversal system is a welcome change (no more reversals spamming).New circle submission system is challenging and I prefer it over the constant button smash.Sadly the graphics are stuck in the same place. The game does look good but we still far behind EA sport game as far as characters look.I also miss some excellent songs from the last year WWE game.I was coming to this game with high expectations, bought it on the launch day and I'm not disappointed. This feels like real matches, wrestlers moves like they should - good job 2k!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is much imporved over 2k15. It's still got some flaws, but still a pretty decent game. Wish they would bring back create-a-finisher. That was one of my favorite things about 2k14, and 13. Had some problems loading up the game when I first got it, which was annoying, but with some research, it got fixed. Shouldn't be happening to a game, especially with a $50 price tag. All in all, it's still pretty fun to play from time to time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 25, 2016
												Hell yes, I recommend WWE 2K16.  The only thing better than a good wrestling match is a good wrestling game, and 2K16 is such.  My biggest gripe is no mixed matches.I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I have.  I thought at best, it'd be a fun little game to spend a few hours in.  I've put in more consecutive time here than I have Fallout 4.  At the time of writing this, I am still not burned out on it.PRO's:+Graphics are mostly terrific.  Some Superstars/Divas are spot on.  Others don't seem to have had as much attention to detail put into them (not that they're ugly, just that they aren't as good as the really good ones).  +Create modes. Holy isht, create modes.  Create Superstars, Divas, Entrances, Arenas, Shows, Titles... the CAW was always the draw to these games, and it has been greatly expanded upon here.  Face uploads make for creating anyone you can imagine without much effort, and with logo/texture uploads, you're really only limited by your imagination.+Sharing these creations is so easy now.  If you've used the Community Creations of The Sims 4, you'll feel right at home here.  Anything you create (even move-sets) can be uploaded and easily downloaded.  WWF CAW vets will appreciate this - no more writing down CAW parts!  Just share that sucker!+Match types.  Plenty of must-have matches have made a return.  TLC, Elimination Chamber, Hell in a Cell, Steel Cage, Royal Rumble, Last Man Standing, Submission, Battle Royal.  That's not to say they're perfect, which I'll get into in the Con's.+The Roster.  Largest roster to date in any WWE game, and arguably the best.  It reaches back into WWE history and presents dozens of favorites and familiars.  Some of these even have alternate attires or versions.  Add CAW's to the list, and you're looking at 200+ fighters.  <-Holy Strawberries, Batman, is that a jam!+Mechanics.  I spent time playing No Mercy and Day of Reckoning waiting for this release, and I wasn't sure how I'd feel about the leap from arcade to simulation.  It's not as bad as people say it is, and I usually hate QTE-type things, but I find them enjoyable here.  It's nice to have control over how you place and evade grapples/holds, and I feel missing the kick out of a pin because of poor timing adds to that ""Oh, come on WWE, how could that happen?"" feel you get watching the actual program sometimes.  And like No Mercy, the grapple system is multi-layered.  If you've played No Mercy, you know what I'm talking about.  It literally feels like they mashed No Mercy, Day of Reckoning, and Here Comes the Pain into one big, beautiful baby.+Customization.  This is the best part of the game.  In Universe mode, you can control who's in what show, who they face, and who their rivals are.  It's like a very hands-on Exhibition mode.  Outside of Universe, you can control how the game plays by toning down (or pumping up) the new simulation systems.  You can control what music plays in the main menu.  You can even tweak the individual Superstar/Diva stats, both in Exhibition and in Universe. CON's:-Some matches are not included as team sets.  For instance, I haven't seen any tag team TLC's.  Such a shame, as tag-team TLC was usually among me and mine's favorite match types.  It's a bit odd see it in singles, but not to see the beloved team version.  -Royal Rumble is gender-restricted.  2K16 does not feature a Diva Royal Rumble.  Surely there are enough Divas in the vanilla version to do a 10-woman rumble, but adding CAD's to it, and I see no reason the women couldn't have one.  At least they can do the other matches.-No mixed matches.  I get it, I understand it, there is nothing that can be said I haven't seen/heard on the issue.  I do not want to be a man hitting a woman.  I want to be a woman hitting a man.  Specifically, Stephanie McMahon.   Beating Brock Lesner.  What's your problem?  The point of WWE video games is to create (or re-create) your dream matches with your favorite WWE characters, and Stephanie McMahon happens to be my favorite.  I can set males to be her enemies, but nothing ever comes of it.  We have Super Mario CAW's fighting Freddy Krueger CAW's.  It's not practical, it's not probable, it certainly isn't representative of WWE, but damn, is it enjoyable.  That's what made the classic games so great - you could have your serious recreations, or you could have totally insane stuff... or, you could be like me, and just want to have your favorite/created Diva be the face of your WWE game.  To ignore mixed matches does very little to protect women... in fact, it makes them appear more fragile.  Not including mixed matches as a possiblity speaks to the WWE's confidence in their current Diva's - both that their personalities are not strong enough to clash with their male counterparts in a digital space, and that their fanbase isn't large enough to want to do so.  Add to the fact that I have to hear Jerry ""The King"" Lawler spew his sexist comments during a Diva's match (""I may be too old for her, but she certainly isn't too young for me..."") as a ring-side announcer, and I roll my eyes at the ""respect women"" excuse for no mixed matches.  I hate to make this such a political statement when I'm not really seeking equality on a grand scale, just a better game.  Ah, well, hopefully mods will fix this.-Universe can be redundant.  I'm okay with this, but I list it for those that may be curious.  I figure, Exhibition will be redundant eventually.  At least with Universe, there's a chance of seeing some good random match-ups.-Lack of notable faces.  No Charlotte Flair, no Dudley Boyz, no Sasha Banks, no Alberto Del Rio (so, no official League of Nations team).  Easily remedied through creation mode, but the over abundance of Triple H's and Undertakers makes you kinda wish these stars were included instead.-Undertaker from his Fred Durst years is the strongest 'Taker without tweaking him yourself.All in all, this is a terrific game, and you can make any Superstar/Diva you want the center of your Universe, albeit with a few warts.  It's been a good minute since I've felt this freedom in a WWE game (pre-SvR and DoR titles), and I've never felt it to the extent I have in 2K16.  Couple this with the gameplay, and I can see myself playing this for years to come... unless 2K17 greatly expands on it (fingers crossed... 2K15->2K16 was a considerable leap).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WWE 2K16 is way more better than 2K15, i was dissappointed by 2K15 but 2K16 is really awesome.I will list out the good things added / removed and the bad ones:Pros:Huge Roster including lots of NXT & newly promoted superstars.Okay Divas Roster with awesome DLC that adds Lita & Trish StratusThe limited reversals system is actually cool, i liked it, but if you dislike it, it can be turned off.Even more match types. More match types like steel cages for tag team & triple threats, Ladder, Hell in a cell matches for triple threat & Fatal 4 Way.Improved reversals animationsMomentum reduces when illegal men in a tag team do mischiefs so thats good.CREATE A DIVA : We needed this feature.Creation Suite, now with the face texture, there is a 100x variety to create a superstar/divaCreate a Arena, Championship, Show (FEATURE NOT IN 2K15Way better online matchmaking system than the 2K15 oneSteve Austin's ShowcaseDLC Superstars like Samoa Joe, Blake & Murphy, etc.Finn Balor & Demon KingWay better Career, choose what title you want to fight forA NEW REFEREEE YAYNew abilities like Dirty Pin, Rope Break & ResilencyThe new submission system, Yes many people might dislike it even i did for the first 60 hours or so trying to figure out how it works but this system is really innovative than the older button mashing. It does needs tweaks to balance out in the future games because at the moment its easier for the defender to save himself.cons:Cant see CenaNo CM Punk (Thank god move set exists)My Universe has no updates, still the same.My Career gets boring and repetitive after a while.My Career - Champions never change by itself, no simulation at all.Online matchmaking is nice but connections still terrible.The kick out gauge synced with the counts (I personally didnt like this)Only One showcase on Austin which is disappointing compared to 2K15's Five different Showcases****BIG CON******XBOX CONTROLLER NO COLORFULL BUTTONS ON SCREEN***SO overall Its WAY WAY better than 2K15, also its price is lower than 2K15 (atleast in my country)RECOMMENDED GO GET IT if WWE Fan.

												Having spent around 30 hours on the game before this review I can say I've explored most of the game features now. Without a doubt this is a big leap forward on last years edition, graphically it's about the same, but FIFA get away with that every year too :P The real star in this years edition is the large roster and much improved creation tools, and gameplay tweaks to the controls (some such as the submission system are a bit of a faff but in fairness it's better than button mashing to win) , and revesals are vastly improved upon (you can see the shock as you power out on the other players face... hilarious). A lot more expressive animations and better cutscenes and comebacks this time around.Pros - Big Roster full of classic WWE era charcters, All DLCs and unlocks included free, better creation options, smoother gameplay, expanded and improved controls, loading times are massively faster than 2k15 at the price of a bigger 40gb install size, replays are much better now (in last years game they often showed no relivant action), career mode now has more things to do. Entry cutscenes are still poorly optimised and cause terrible frame drop... even though once the match starts it's fantastically smooth.Cons - Still no Diva career mode, Diva roster is improved but still missing many big names like Chyna (Thankfully there are plenty on custom downloadable area), some of the controls are still a bit sluggish and faffy to use (Submissions for example), Custom photo importing is still very poorly supported.Overall - Must have for Wrestling fans.

												I love this game so much that I cry every time I leave my house because I'm not playing it then.And don't you dare buy WWE 2K15 over this game. Don't you dare. This game is everything 2K15 should've been. It fixes a lot of the faults that 2K15 had, plus it is way better optimized for the PC than than 2K15 was. If you decide to buy 2K15 but not this I will punch you in the face!Also, if you are getting stuttering during entrances like I was, I (sort of) found a fix. Go to your documents folder (under C:\Users\[insert name here]\Documents\WWE2K16) and go into the config.ini file. Once in it, change simple_lighting to on and then change audience_tessellation to off. It's not perfect because it will turn (current day) Sting and Luke Harper into black silhouettes during their entrances. However, if you go to into ""advanced creation"" for Luke and Sting's entrances, change the lighting to whatever lighting you want and it'll make the character models look normal again. For Luke I changed it to Undertaker's lighting and for Sting I used no lighting at all. Hopefully 2K will fix the stuttering in an upcoming patch. However, I never had any frame rate drops during matches.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So far from what I've seen, the game is entirely in working order, it runs just fine, and every single piece of content is here, unlike last time. So, as far as the port goes, it's safe to buy. As for the game itself, it sports a massive roster, more customization than you could ask for (except maybe create-a-finisher,) and the trademark Universe, My Career, and 2K Showcase modes. If you're a fan of WWE, or even just the games, this one is definitely one to pick up. My only real complaint I have with the game so far is that it's missing some of the old gimmick matches, such as the Inferno match, Casket match, and even the locker room and backstage brawls, however, this can easily be looked past by some. As I put more time into the game, I will update this revew with more problems or gripes I have with the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 This game is lit.  Pros:  -The reversals are much better.-Game is more challenging.-Movement is more fluid.-OOOOOOOOOH YEAAHHHH THE MACHO MAN IS COMING.-No Hulk Hogan.-Sami Zayn. -NXT NXT NXT!... well, some of it.-I think Baron Blade  died .-Curb Stomp into an RKO outta nowhere! Cons: -I don't like the submission system, but i'll adjust to it. -No 4 horsewomen without community creations.-Michael Cole commentating over NXT.-Michael Cole commentating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An improvement in every single way to 2k15, this is the wrestling game I personally have been waiting for.Huge roster covering all eras?  CHECKSolid Career Mode with goals, and actual rivalries and alliances?  CHECKImproved visuals?  CHECKIf you enjoy wrestling and were not a fan of 2k15, then seriously check out 2k16.  Its better in every way.  Plus, its focused on STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN! BAH GAWD HE IS BROKEN IN HALF!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Submission system is broken, 2K still hasn't fixed it. The controls don't feel fluid and there isn't a decent tutorial or guide on how to play. The manuel that comes with the game doesn't give players a good idea of how to win their first match much less progress through the game. Want to create a custom character with your face or some celebrity? It's a complicated process that kinda works. The worst though is the AI... I've had the computer crawling on the ground yet it still finds a way to counter my attacks. I have had the computer down to virtually zero health and STILL lost the match because SOMEHOW it was able to get me into a submission hold. The counter system is also broken, with the player becoming frustrated at hitting the R trigger too fast or too slow and getting steamrolled by the computer AI. I had really high hopes for this title but not being able to progress from my first match because of the broken AI has left me requesting a refund for this title. I grew up playing Wrestlemania and WWE on N64... This is just a halfway decent title that would be better if 2K would take the time to fix these issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well after playing this game for a little while I can say that I can only recommend it if:•	You have a high end PC to actually run this port. (I have an i7 6700K, GTX970, 16 GB RAM)•	You have a controller •	You have a second, spare controller. The submission system might make you break the original controller•	You do not mind learning the new submission system, which most people on the consoles either liked or despised.•	You do not mind staring at Stone Cold Steve Austin’s armpits for at least 5 to 10 minutes. For some reason the game gets stuck on that splash screen when you run it for the first time (or after computer rebooted)•	You already know that you will like the game. For example you played it on a console before and did not think that it is a complete rubbish. Or if you played WWE 2K15 on PC and only thought that the game could do with a bit more content (like more customisation, more in-depth MyCareer, more match types, more playable characters) and a bit more fluid movement, animations.•	You read the reviews for the PS4, Xbox One versions of the game and still thought that you want to play this game. •	You really do not mind the new submission system.Otherwise I cannot recommend this game to you.

												I would recommend this game to any fan of wrestling/WWE. I love the showcase and story mode, way better than 2K15. The only con I have about this game is the online aspect. There aren't many players online so trying to find a match can be quite long and boring. But overall, it's on sale and it is a great game! Give it a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First of all it's not a bad game neither it is a very good one.Pros-Amazing Character Design. Seriously numerious customization options are available.-WWE universe moments, although it kinda gets repetitive after some point.-HUUUGE amount of move-set options. And ability to mix and match your moves.Cons-Bad gameplay, just worst. I am not against Quick Time Events, but not only they have been used excessively, they are also buggy and make the fight just not look right.-Matches are slow paced. It doesn't give you the feel of fight.-Reversal mechanic is just awful. You've got 3-5 bars, if they fill up you can do reversals. Enemy AI seems to be so accurate. And once you passed your queue on that bars, oh it's downfall from there. You do reversal, ai does reversal but in the end he beats you up and pins you. OH PINS!-MOST ANNOYING THING IN THE GAME IS PIN MECHANIC, It's plain stupid. It's just the worst game design of all.You might be winning the fight but just because you passed on that small spot, All that time will be for nothing. Who makes pin mechanic an accuracy action. Why not mashing, why not something else. :(-Most minigames are stupid. Takes your eyes away from the fight. You can't even watch the move you are doing while doing those minigames.-The career mod; you have to do 600 matches or so to get to fighting rating 84 or so. That slow progress frustrates you.Well i kinda regret buying this game. I thought i would find action and badassery in this one. But all i find was minigames and character creation. Think again if you want to buy this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I knwo that you can Edit the Matches and can start Rivalries but still i doesn`t make sense at all- Games crahses sometimes for No Reason at allI will change my ""Not recommend"" to ""Recommend"" If 2K fixes some of these Problems but for now stay away from the Game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awful game do not buy.I decided against my better judgement to give wrestling games a try again, what a mistake that was. The port is very poor, the game always launches in windowed mode regardless of what you have it set to, there's tonnes of screen tearing even with v-sync on and entrances can very often tank the fps. While the roster is very large there are some glaring omissions like Kurt Angle, Eddie Guerrero, Rey Mysterio, Rob Van Dam and Hulk Hogan, however Hogan is a more complicated issue. many of the characters are not in career mode and are mostly just there for free play. The In ring gameplay is ok some of the new systems like the submission mechanic are downright awful but for the most part it's ok.Career mode is where i spent most of my time. You start out in NXT and slowly climb the ranks till you face Finn Balor for the NXT title and then you are moved up to the main roster and can choose a belt to go after, The ambitious man that i am i went for the WWE title. For a while career mode was good i had a storyline since I'd come up from NXT which basically boiled down to the authority thinking i wasn't good enough. on the way to my first pay per view i had lots of cutscenes and interviews that helped develop the storyline which culminated in a ppv match against big show and kane. After that the story continues and advances to Triple H attacking me himself and running in on my matches, again lots of cutscenes and interviews to advance the storyline which ended with a hell in a cell match against Triple H where i pedigreed Triple H through the cell ceiling. This is where career mode took a turn for the worse, by this point i was pretty happy with career mode I'd had a good storyline and good matches but that all ended here. After the hell in a cell match i had no more storylines no more cutscenes nothing i was 4th in ranking for the title at this point and i was just playing matches against the likes of Ryback and Mark Henry over and over. Sometimes a wrestler would run in on my match and it would start a feud but after the run in it's back to the same old random matches and then i got a normal match at the ppv with a rival I'd have had no buildup for. Then the next night on raw the same wrestler i just ended a rivalry with comes out and starts it again so it's another month of the same match over and over to end in a ppv with no storyline or buildup.By this point i was getting pretty bored of career mode and was considering uninstalling the game when i saw the next PPV was the royal rumble and i thought there's a storyline to be made there, then i got in a rivalry and thought ok i can eliminate this guy at the rumble and get the title shot this might be ok. Then the royal rumble came along and i saw i wasn't in the rumble even though i was the number 3 contender for the title, after some frantic googling to find out why it turns out if you are in a rivalry you can't do any special matches at a ppv so no money in the bank no royal rumble which is the dumbest thing I've ever seen if you made it so no one in a feud could be in the rumble then there would be like 3 people.By this point i thought well ok I'll get in a feud with the rumble winner and make the title match a triple threat, well you can't do that either because the game doesn't tell you who won the rumble. After some more googling i found out it doesn't matter anyway because apparently the AI doesn't cash in money in the bank and doesn't take the rumble title shot so i thought I'll play till mania and get in a feud with the title holder then it happens... the message you are locked in a rivalry with a mystery opponent pops up I'm thinking ok another actual storyline this might be ok. Well as it turns out it was Triple H, i started getting the exact same cutscenes as when i started the game so i was playing through the single storyline this game has twice instead of getting the title shot at mania. After that i decided to just skip all my matches until money in the bank and go that route. I remembered not to get in a rivalry with anyone before it so i could be in the ladder match and on the day of the ppv I'm in a normal match with Kane even though i'm the number 1 contender.The reason I'm telling this story is because anyone buying this game should know what they are in for a grind fest playing the same matches every week, no storylines, broken mechanics, and the game ♥♥♥♥ing you every time you try to make a storyline yourself.The career mode was very obviously rushed out the door and not play tested because anyone who is even a casual fan of wrestling would pick up on some of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this mode like the fact that once you turn heel it's impossible to turn face, it considers hitting someone with a chair in the Tables Ladders and Chairs match a heel move, if you get thrown out of the ring the game acts like you ran out the ring and it's counted as a heel move however there's nothing the game considers a face action to counteract this. The pay per views are laughable most of the ppvs in the game none of the titles are defended and at night of champions the one where all titles are defended one is defended. You have to be very lucky to be in a special match 99% of the time you will be in a normal 1v1 match regardless of whether it's mania, extreme rules, hell in a cell or the rumble.The custom wrestler creator is decent not great and once you've made your wrestler be prepared to shell out money for the skill boost or start out unable to wrestle.The only really good thing about this game is the entrance maker and even then you have to get a 3rd party program to get custom music for your entrance. Avoid this game at all costs unless you want Maggle Cole telling you how great it is to be on monday night raw even more than he already does.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is so far for just 4 hours of the custom superstar storyline thingPros:Roster is greatShowcase mode is fun because it removes several gameplay features (such as minigames or tag team interferrence on pin)Cons:Gameplay is awful and slowMinigames are extremely bad and frustrating and used for pins/submissionsNeed to hit an opponent with multiple finishers/signatures to win meaning matches take forever while they kick out on pin two multiple timesLoad times are atrociousCharacter customization takes around 1 minute for me to view a part, then back out because it's crap as there's a loading screen each timeSoundtrack consists of 4 songs which get on your nerves and aren't even the same type of music. In tag team matches the AI will always interfere, even if they're face superstars. I get it when they're dirty but why would a good guy have poor sportsmanship like that?Reversal system			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Before I start this review i want to say that I am a big wrestling fan as my first wwe game was HCTP and been playing wrestling games sense. Now to the review, I want to say this game is far way better than wwe2k15 way more options and such more to do with new gamemodes and mycareer being way better and feels like you control your guy the way you want. Unlike wwe2k15 which was very limited and storylines were short and boring. More customizable stuff and create a diva is back. The gameplay is smoothed runs great on a AMD R9 380 my final verdict is a 9-10(list of pros and cons down below)Pros- Lots of create features - Many gamemodes to choose from- Over 100 superstars to play and choose from- Gameplay is smoothed as butter- Great optimization Cons-Loading time takes around 3-4 minutes ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Я считаю что это отличное продолжение серии WWE  от 2KПлюсы игры:1.Намного больше кастомизации персонажа(а то есть приёмы,одежда,причёски и прочее)2.Это отыгровка(получение урона,и т.д)3.Система отношений(Давно мечтал выйти во время выхода того же Triple H и надавать ему пощам после которого начнётсчя целая цепочка боёв с ним)4.Кто бы что не говорил но графика здесь потрясная,в какой-то степени даже лучше чем в WWE 2K15Минусы1.Это система submission,её изменили не лучшем образом,но после пару часов к ней привыкаешь.Больше минусов для меня не нашёлИгра отличная,самого выхода я играл на пиратке,и вот только сейчас купил и продолжаю играть,интерес после 20 с лишним часов не пропадает.

												Looks good, plays ok. sort of un-responsive feeling at times.more than once i've pressed the finisher button only to have it do nothing, then the opponant will do a move [and yes this is whith the finisher available & in the right possition] It seems harder than ever to be sure what move you are about to do also. I've played every Smackdown / Raw / WWE game since smackdown 2 & this one is the biggest offender for that. In the career mode i chose 'he's not worth my time' after assaulting someone from behind...this turned me 'Face' somehow. So far, I rate this game 7/10. A good wrestling sim-game with issues but well worth grabbing on sale. i'll modify this as i play more.[Edit 1] 6 hours in this game has stalled / frozen three times. one of which loading the career save & one of them in the pause menu.

												A good PC port, if lacking in graphics options such as model, object and environment detail, but is a much better improvement over the previous game. I'm not a wrestling fan, but even I love this game, with its vast customisation, game modes, character roster and sheer amount of replay value is incredible.Running at a locked 60 fps, WWE 2K16 sees the return of many favourite game modes, like create-an-arena, create-a-diva, match types, a whole new career mode and much more. The graphics seem better than WWE 2K15, especially with the character models and costume textures. Gameplay wise, I'm loving all the match types and going into the options menu to change rules, game hints, blood on/off and so forth. And speaking of, I also love the new mini-game-like QTEs that happen when actions like a pin, or grapple, occur. It adds a simple layer of 'fun' on-top of what is already a fun, meaty game. I love making my own movesets with my characters, making an entrance for them, and an arena for them to battle in. It's just incredibly fun and you'll be here for triple digit hours with it all!I haven't tried online, so this is an offline review. Having said that, a couple of things I want to see added in for the inevitable sequel is better audio design. What I mean is - I want to hear the occasional character scream or grunt as they pull off certain moves; giving it immersion by proportioning realism onto what is already a realistic game. Also minor, yet near-essential things like hearing footstep noises, climbing the ladder/cages, more variety in 'punch' sounds beyond the generic slap noise. And finally, better flowing commentary: it's quite jarring hearing the commentary suddenly cut-out to talk about something else I'm doing without finishing the previous sentence.Overall, as I said, I'm not a wrestling fan at all and I doubt this game will turn me to one, but I'm very much enjoying my time with this game. Perhaps a little more violence wouldn't hurt with enhanced persistent character damage, floors being scuffed and whatnot as per real wrestling. Having said that, this is a much better, improved, real letter to the fans that were left disappointed by the previous iteration or like me, just lost interest after so many features were dropped.Recommend to people who enjoy sports, brawlers, RPGs, simulators and action. Worth the £35 asking price? Definitely!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm pretty much satisfied with WWE 2K16. Got it on the Steam Summer sale. Runs well on my machine, no crashes as of yet, loading time is reasonable, 2K showcase is fun , and of course the community creations makes the game fresh with new wrestlers, arenas, belts etc. Btw, the game version shows 1.0.5 inside the game, meaning some glitches and bugs from the previous versions  were probably fixed. Use a game controller for better experience. Must have for Pro wrestling and/or WWE fans.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The real highlight though is the fact the game has ""community creations"" where one can download what others have created, such as Wrestlers, Arena's, logos, etc. Great game and worth the price it is on sale.

												Alright what do I have to say about WWE 2K16? Well to start off, this is a pretty good upgrade from the previous installment(s). It adds quite a bit, but also removes some features from the past games. So far in the 60 hours I've put in the game is solid and plays well. Granted some of the animations and storylines in MyCareer can be clunky and overdone. Like how you get the same interviews over and over again. But other than that the game is pretty good and Universe mode and CAW are great modes. Showcase is good aswell. The only thing that I have trouble with is some minor things in MyCareer mode. Other than that its a good solid experience. Would recommend to any wrestling fans. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game has crashed on me a handful of times. I got to a good point in the story and the game crashed and wiped my saves. It's a crashing mess. I had to reinstall it once already and I can't delete the corrupted file that is causing my game to crash as certain points. I'm not going to continue to play a game that wipes my saves everytime it crashes, which is rather often. This is a horribly optimized game.Well, after I couldn't get a refund, I decided to get back into the game and see if I could fix the issue. Hilariously enough, the game crashed again and wiped all my CAW's, so the corrupted CAW that was crashing my game was now wiped so the crashes stopped! I then decided to redo the MyCareer mode and almost came close to capturing the NXT title....only for my game to tell me the save file was corrupted after a recent match. For no reason whatsoever.♥♥♥♥ this game. DO NOT BUY IT. Until 2K learns to port their wrestling games to PC, I'd suggest not getting this game. It's a good waste of money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is this game buggy and terrible? Yes.Is this games My Career very WWE feeling? Yes, it attempts to have very silly story lines that make no sense just like you would expect from wrestling.Is this game enjoyable? Very much so, but if you want to win expect to play more like a rythm game rather then a button masher, it is very timing based to not screw up.This game is buggy but the bugs actually make the game feel more WWE because it adds to the stupid that is the WWE. But with that said if you want to get far in the my career your success will be very much based on what you level up and your move set, you can screw up a build making it very hard to win even on easier difficulties.All in all the game is much like some bad movies, its one of those its terrible which makes it great. Would I spend $50 on it? No, but you can always find a discount code at GMG or wait for a Steam sale and it is pretty enjoyable to play. I picked it up for $36 and am not disapointed, specially since 2K15 is still $50 as well.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the best strategic wrestling game of all time thus far, as someone who has been around for a while and played them all that is my personal opinion.  For the first time there is a real tension and back and forth feel to online play just like the kind of tense moments you get in a Wrestle Mania main event in WWE PPV. I am going to give the game a recommendation and thumbs up because of the above thoughts about this game however there is a big con for me with the online experience.1 on 1 normals matchs is the only match type you're able to play online in this game unless you have a heap of friends with the game who want to play with you. I enjoy the normal matches very much but it should be so much better than this. As with all large corperate game companies nowdays, you make a great game but you have no clue how to make a compelling online exerience or more likely just do not care. The system for match making is one of the worst matchmaking systems in history.  Multiplayer has been carelessly tacked on at the end and to hell with your playerbase that enjoys online competition. I don't even see leaderboards this year which makes it a downgrade from 2k15 in that aspect.  I want to be able to get into a 1 on 1 Hell in a cell match at the very least and I want to be able to at least comunicate GG at the end of a great match without having to say it through a always turned on mic. Is that too much to ask from a modern wrestling game? I think not.Easy Fix imo - Remove all the unnessassry match options from the selection screen, which are false advertising since no one can find a match in any of them. Implement 4 options instead which will be 2 players - 4 players - 6 players.All the players get put into the same lobby and pick one of these three options. Once the players are all in we enter a vote for which match type it will me and bang .. done. We dont bother with caws online, we only care about fast effiecient matchmaking.You done ****ed it up			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

VS CONSOLEI've played this game previously on the Xbox One. According to the Xbox, I have played at least 264 hours on it. So how does the PC version stand up to the console version? I think it holds up very well. The game does have a few crashing problems for me, but so did the console version. The PC version also loads up 10x quicker than console. It would literally take a minute or more to load into a match on the console. For PC, it takes about 10 seconds.GAMEPLAYIf you're looking for an arcade like wrestling game, I'd suggest looking for a different title. But for someone looking to play a wrestling simulation just like the TV show, you will love this game. The pacing in matches is fairly slow to start off as you perform lock ups. You then transition into your normal grapples, leading into back and forth action. You have limited reversal, so you have to use your reversals wisely. As you get into the big heavy hitting moves, you start to feel the exhaustion as your wrestler fights with every last strength they have. Every time you kick out from a person's finisher, you feel like you're out of breath as you and your opponent can't believe you still have fight left in you. Believe me when I say, you will feel extremely satisfied when you kick out of a finisher without using your resiliency. And honestly, it's hard to get upset after losing a match when you know you put up one h*ll of a show.CREATIONSFor creations mode, you have a decent variety of things to create. You can create your own Wrestler (Cool looking or just plain wacky), you can create your own title belt, your own arena, your own show, and unlike 2K15, you can create your own Woman Wrestler (or Diva, as WWE likes to call them...). The customization for your wrestlers are very good. I have been able to create some very life like wrestlers, especially with the face import tool (where you can import any face you want and use them for your created wrestler). Create a move-set is still there of course. Create an entrance is better this year, with nearly every wrestler's entrance as an option, as opposed to very little. Unfortunately, still no custom themes (but there are mods for that...)MYCAREERHonestly, I played this on the console version and was VERY bored with it. Very rarely have I ever gotten cutscenes and storylines. Aside from the mandatory feud with Tyler Breeze in the beginning. I don't quite have much to say for this mode since I kind of skipped out on it. I'm currently trying to go through it again for PC. So, hopefully I can give you updates on my thoughts for it.UNIVERSE MODESame sh*t as the previous years, nothing has changed, lol. You run your shows, create feuds. Get occasional cutscenes.

												Having owned the Xbox One version of WWE 2K16, I wanted to add this to my Steam library now that I'm a PC gamer. The PC version is definitely superior in just about every area with the exception of multiplayer.It has the largest roster in years, it has a good Austin 3:16 showcase mode, it has good customisation options, if has a decent Universe mode, exhibition is fun, the community downloads are always a welcome addition, and there is a good number of hours that you can put into this game.Also, for anyone experiencing poor framerate issues; right-click on the desktop, select Nvidia Control Panel, select manage 3D settings, program settings, click add, select WWE 2K16, then select the high performance NVIDIA processor as your graphics processor.

												This game is amazing, 2K15 was a great game too by the way. The only disappointment is ..finding someone online. You can't really play online except for 1 vs 1 where you can find people sometimes :(Anyway lot of WWE Superstars , arenas etc.. 2K showcase is awesome too as always. The great thing about this game is that you can play with a friend, I mean nowadays multiplayer is only about online, but here you can have a lot of fun playing on the same screen like we all did for years before.+ Same screen Multiplayer+ 2K Showcase+ Career+ Lot of possibilities + The atmosphere+ The commentators ( I don't speak english very well but I understand most of it and for someone who speaks it , it's awesome )+ Creations- Multiplayer Online , hard to find opponents			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game runs fine on PC. Was a bit buggy when it first came out and thats where all the negative reviews are coming from.  People are getting stuck on launch because they didn't run as admin or restart steam then wait a few minutes.  People also don't know how to simply set the graphics card for the game since there is a minor issue with the game recognizing the intel graphics card instead of the gaming one.  Was looking at another one of the reviews ""The game is laging i have an alienware still the game is slow and lags need a patch ASAP.""  Not sure if troll or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and doesn't realize that alienware isn't that great and you're paying a shet ton just for the brand.  Well i rate the game 9/10.  Runs well, and has much more content than the previous release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Love the game, but the execution is kinda a miss.. the game runs in 40fps for me, and is lagging and stuttering for no reason. I played 2k15 on all settings max with endless frames no problem, so something is wrong with the port here. I am guessing this will slowly but surely be fixed, but still a bit dissapointing.

												First Impressions Review:I think WWE 2K16 is an improvement over WWE 2K15 but it still has a lot of issues.What's Better:1) Create-A-Diva: '15 left out Diva creation '16 brought it in. Nice to know that 2K stopped being sexist.2) In-match optimization better: I no longer have the stuttering and performance issues during the match as I did with '15.3) Story Mode: They added a LOT to story mode, including rivalries, allies, picking which championship you want to go for, who you want to invade, all sorts of stuff! It's still got a grind factor, but there's a lot more depth in '16 than there was in '15.4) Match depth: There's a little more in-depth match mechanics like the various grappling mechanics which involve a back-and-forth mini-game of who can find the ""sweet spot"" first. But the game doesn't really tell you how to set that up...What's The Same:1) Graphics: Virtually the same engine. The audience is slightly improved. Superstars and the scenery are pretty much the same. Maybe some minor improvements...2) Overall fighting mechanics: Same huge sets of moves that are hard to perfect and rememberWhat's Worse:1) Submission: The submission mechanic is horrible. The system works like this: The defender has a blue bar, the aggressor has a red bar. The aggressor wants to have their red bar inside the defender's blue bar to fill up the circle in the center. If the circle is filled, the defender taps out. If it becomes completely blue, then the defender kicks out. Sounds fair, right? WRONG! If the body part is undamaged or fully damaged there's no real adjustment to how the mechanic works. It's all skill-based. I can understand that the bars should initially be based off of the wrestler's skills. But as the match goes on, there should be an equalizer. If you damage a body part, the aggressor should have an equalizer to help them get the submission win. What's the point of damaging a body part if you can't even take advantage of it...2) AI Kick-Outs: The AI kicks out ALL THE F*CKING TIME! An opponent I was against had no health, no stamina, just got Finishered, but STILL KICKED OUT BEFORE 3! This wasn't even the first time I had done the Special/Finisher combo. How are you supposed to win a match when the AI just magically kicks out ALL DAY LONG???? Then when the AI pins you, I don't even get a chance to kick out on the 1st count, have a tiny little zone for the 2nd and 3rd counts... The imba is real...3) Match Rating: The match rating was an issue with '15 and it's even worse in '16. They provide you with a meter in the HUD so you can see how ""well"" you're doing. Unfortunately, if you do a move once, it can no longer give you points for ""variety."" This game punishes you for using a move twice... Seriously? It should at least be diminishing returns instead of ""you can use a move once, after that, too bad!"" I guess the game really wants you to focus on ALL of those moves you picked in the character creation screen...For the $25 I paid for it, it's worth it so far. I hope '17 can address some of the issues that '16 has and finally get rid of those nagging issues leftover. Seriously, get rid of the match rating or make it actually worth having as a mechanic. I could get 4 and 5 star matches on '15 and I can't get above 3.5 stars in '16.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR --> From an objective point of view, it isn't that good and the pricetag really doesn't justify the content it offers, even if all the DLC is free on the PC version. That being said, if you want a more in-depth analysis, please keep reading.I've been a wrestling fan for around 10 years. I remember switching channels through my TV late in the night and finding a show that caught my interest: Smackdown! The main event that day was Bobby Lashley vs Batista vs Finlay and I won't forget that match easily.After that, I tried my first wrestling game by renting it from a local Blockbuster (does anyone stil remember those?). It was Smackdown vs Raw 2006 for the PS2. The controls felt a little bit clunky because it tried to be something it was not: a grappling simulator. However, I enjoyed every single moment I spent on that game just because I could recreate what I saw on the show and fight with my favourite wrestlers.Fast forward to 2016 and I'm still playing the same damn game with an updated roster and a graphic mod.The main problem with WWE 2K16 is exactly that, they've been doing almost the same game for 10 years. Sure, they've added more game modes, characters and other stuff. They have even improved the grappling and striking system to make it more fair when playing with friends (oh the times when you had infinite reversals and they were performed just by smashing a button).If you're a hardcore wrestling fan like me, you will probably enjoy this game, even if it has really strong weaknesses as a a PC port (fps drops, physics crashing, animations glitching...) and even if it adds nothing at all to previous WWE games but a wider roster that doesn't involve repeating the same superstar in different time periods (I'm looking at you WWE 13 and your 3-4 versions of Triple H).However, if you're looking for a fun sports/fighting game this probably isn't the correct choice for you.

												WWE 2K16 is amazing...ly bad. Every time I find something to like about this game there's something else that is just horrible. Basic gameplay is solid but submissions, chain grappling and the new pin system are all complete nonsense. It looks beautiful but runs like chunky crap for a lot of people. There are awesome custom downloads for characters, logos, title belts and arenas but you can only download 20 total per day and the servers are constantly having issues. It goes on and on. 2K simply have no idea how to keep themselves from screwing up wrestling games. They seem to think that they need to reinvent the wheel but at the same time have no idea what the wheel is. At best WWE 2K16 is a fun distraction but you are just as likely hate it 3 minutes later. I just can't recommend anyone pay money for this unless you are desperate for a WWE game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You dont need to know anything about todays Wrestling to like this Game...Its a realy funny and nice competetive playable Fighting Game,where you dont need a 400 Dollar Arcade Stick and 10 Hour Training a Day to play Online.The Charackter Generator is awesome you can make any type of Wrestler you want,and there is a very nice Career Mode where you start in the PErformance Center.Your Characker has 6 Traits like Respekt,Fear,Pride etc and after Matches you have Interviews which can change this Stats,depending if youre a good Guy or a Bad Guy,and that also affects the Feuds you can have etc..I dont knowed nothing about todays Wrestling,just watched it like 25 Years ago as it was still in Free TV in Germany.I like the game alot cause finaly i found a Fighting Game which has alot of possible moves etc but all are easy to made and dont require like i said a arcade stick and 10 hours Training a day like Streetfigher or Mortar Kombat.I think everyone can have fun with this Game its realy nice ;) Even when you think Real Life Wrestling is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t,this Game can be big Fun for you ! Give it a Try,if you dont like just make a Refund,You will know after 1 Hour if you like it or not i think			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Haven't regularly played a wrestling game since Smackdown! 2 on the Playstation. Saw a good deal on WWE2k16, figured what the heck, I'll try it. There's a lot to like in the game, but matches can often go from fun to absolutely infuriating based on the dumbest things. I get that handicap matches are supposed to put the player at a disadvantage, but there should not be the *added* disadvantage of having the game ignore you when you're trying to target a specific opponent. For example, in the Showcase, there's a Stone Cold vs. Vince and Shane McMahon ladder match. I can't even count how many times I would turn Austin towards Shane and try to strike or grapple, only to have Austin magically spin around and flail in Vince's direction. The game's decision for when you can or can't target someone seems completely arbitrary.Similarly, attempting to grapple an opponent standing right in front of me works 90% of the time, but 10% of the time, inexplicably, my character just sits there doing nothing, allowing the opponent to recover, often costing me the match. This is inexcusable.On top of that is the counter system, which basically turns every match into a game of chicken to see who's going to blink first. If I have four counters, and my opponent has four counters, the first one to use a counter is at an *immediate* disadvantage for the remainder of the match. For example, let's say Austin vs. Rock, each with four counters. If I'm Austin and I counterattack to get out of a bad situation, Rock has 4, and I have 3. That means my BEST CASE SCENARIO is Rock counters (3,3), I counter (2,3), Rock counters (2,2), I counter (1,2), Rock counters, (1,1), I counter (0,1), Rock counters (0,0). We're now both empty, but because he got the last counter, he has absolute control of the match, and I can basically just put my controller down and walk away for a minute or two, because I can't do ANYTHING. Counters recharge over time, but as soon as I've regenerated one, he's regenerated one too, and he's still controlling the match, which means I HAVE to use mine first, but as soon as I do, he'll use his, and he's back in control again. There's actually some strategy into how this can work in a tag team match or triple threat (though those come with the targeting/nonsense mentioned above), but in a singles match, the counter system effectively punishes whoever uses it first. On top of all that, the game either has no real tutorial, or has hidden it well. The NXT career and Showcase modes offer some tips, but leave others out, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what is and isn't taught. For example, the game teaches you the submission minigame, but never teaches you how to actually start a submission on an opponent. It teaches you the collar-and-elbow tie-up minigame, but never teaches you how to initiate a collar-and-elbow tie-up. Never tells you how to climb ladders or cages. Never tells you how to target another opponent.It's frustrating, because when the game isn't being super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, it can actually be fun! But the moment your character randomly decides not to grapple when you're telling him to, or decides to target someone outside the ring instead of the opponent standing next to him in the ring, the fun instantly stops; all that's left is yelling at your monitor.

												Very great and funny game but corrupted save files.. I would really like to play this again but my saves are broken every time after a short period.I have little hopes for a fix but maybe 2K is not a ♥♥♥♥ery this time.Don't buy this game, cannot recommend it at this moment.In advance, ♥♥♥♥ 2K nonetheless plus their NBA2K PC ports are also mostly ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

												Haven't regularly played a wrestling game since Smackdown! 2 on the Playstation. Saw a good deal on WWE2k16, figured what the heck, I'll try it. There's a lot to like in the game, but matches can often go from fun to absolutely infuriating based on the dumbest things. I get that handicap matches are supposed to put the player at a disadvantage, but there should not be the *added* disadvantage of having the game ignore you when you're trying to target a specific opponent. For example, in the Showcase, there's a Stone Cold vs. Vince and Shane McMahon ladder match. I can't even count how many times I would turn Austin towards Shane and try to strike or grapple, only to have Austin magically spin around and flail in Vince's direction. The game's decision for when you can or can't target someone seems completely arbitrary.Similarly, attempting to grapple an opponent standing right in front of me works 90% of the time, but 10% of the time, inexplicably, my character just sits there doing nothing, allowing the opponent to recover, often costing me the match. This is inexcusable.On top of that is the counter system, which basically turns every match into a game of chicken to see who's going to blink first. If I have four counters, and my opponent has four counters, the first one to use a counter is at an *immediate* disadvantage for the remainder of the match. For example, let's say Austin vs. Rock, each with four counters. If I'm Austin and I counterattack to get out of a bad situation, Rock has 4, and I have 3. That means my BEST CASE SCENARIO is Rock counters (3,3), I counter (2,3), Rock counters (2,2), I counter (1,2), Rock counters, (1,1), I counter (0,1), Rock counters (0,0). We're now both empty, but because he got the last counter, he has absolute control of the match, and I can basically just put my controller down and walk away for a minute or two, because I can't do ANYTHING. Counters recharge over time, but as soon as I've regenerated one, he's regenerated one too, and he's still controlling the match, which means I HAVE to use mine first, but as soon as I do, he'll use his, and he's back in control again. There's actually some strategy into how this can work in a tag team match or triple threat (though those come with the targeting/nonsense mentioned above), but in a singles match, the counter system effectively punishes whoever uses it first. On top of all that, the game either has no real tutorial, or has hidden it well. The NXT career and Showcase modes offer some tips, but leave others out, and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what is and isn't taught. For example, the game teaches you the submission minigame, but never teaches you how to actually start a submission on an opponent. It teaches you the collar-and-elbow tie-up minigame, but never teaches you how to initiate a collar-and-elbow tie-up. Never tells you how to climb ladders or cages. Never tells you how to target another opponent.It's frustrating, because when the game isn't being super ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, it can actually be fun! But the moment your character randomly decides not to grapple when you're telling him to, or decides to target someone outside the ring instead of the opponent standing next to him in the ring, the fun instantly stops; all that's left is yelling at your monitor.

												Wanted some good ole wrestling nostalgia. Not impressed by the game play overall.Creativeness of CAWS? 8/10. Graphics? 9/10.Time to mess with mechanics. Even when messing with game sliders, the AI has a rediculous reversals and timing. If the game doesn't want you to reverse something, it will always tell you ""TOO EARLY"". Doesn't matter how great you are at timing reversals. The AI needs a lot of work. I hope 2k17 has some improvements.Edit: 20+ hours into Career, I gave it more of shot. Got into a Rivalry with John Cena. You cannot land a finisher. Period. He reverses everything. Even if it's set to the easiest possible setting...YouCannotWinUnlessYouCheatNice busted game play. I'll never buy another wrestling game as long as i live so long as they keep making it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The last WWE game I played was Smackdown vs Raw 2010, so compared to the other 2K games I have no idea, but this game is nowhere near as good as SvR.That being said, 2K16 is actually pretty good in its own right. It has a huge cast of wrestlers (RIP Hogan), graphics and animations are good and fluid, commentary is actually much better than it previously was, and the gameplay is pretty fun and impactful although you will need some time to learn it. Customization is very poor and that's probably the worst part of the game. Lack of music for entrances and overall entrance motions, almost every hat is entrance only, and there is just a lack of good clothing options so I hope you like using the logo upload manager.In terms of the port it's acceptable. The entrances are all locked at 30fps and the game has serious audio and frame rate issues most notable during the after match replays and the 30-man Royal Rumble.Despite this, It is still a damn fun game to play and there is just so much other content to enjoy that makes it worth getting.

												I enjoy the game mainly for the creative modes, but the gameplay can be very irritating. I've never seen a game dominated by a single stat/mechanic such as this one. The reversal system is frustrating. While fun to watch on screen, having fewer max reversals than your opponnent immediately put you at a large disadvantage, which makes the MyCareer mode that much more difficult. When you're out of reversals, you're basically helpless to defend against the opponent. It's a basic system of wrestling, so of course reversals need to be in the game, but it feels like the game is dominated by the system so much that you might as well just put your controller down until your reversal bar fills.

												I bought the game from Humble Bundle (It's currently cheap.) All of my play time has been me TRYING to get the game to run past the splash screen. It crashes every single time, I haven't installed any mods or even played a single match. I know my computer can handle the game as I pirated it before I bought it to see if it would play well. I've tried the fix everyone praises fixed their game, it worked one time and got me to the main menu, but I had to restart due to a scrolling issue; I haven't seen the menu since..... Here's my suggestion:If you really want to play the game, either buy it on console or pirate the game without the update, at least it will work that way...EDIT: The issue was with the WIndows 10 Anniversary Update, so after a clean install of Windows 10 and a re-update to the Anniversary Update the game now launches, but will not go fullscreen without a Borderless Window app. It plays well, but I feel highly inconvinienced (I know W10 isn't officially supported, but it's still bothersome when compatibility doesn't work). So if you have Windows 10 build 1607, pass on this.I brought the issue to 2K support, so hopefully it doesn't happen with 2K17.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a giant professional wrestling fan, I knew nothing about this game going although I can happily say this kicks 2K15 in the dirt.Port: Optizimation is great this time around (Mainly stays at a solid 60 for me and I didn't met the recommended specs, keep in mind I'm playing maxed out) so 10 for thatGameplay: It is honestly  changed a lot since the No Mercy and SmackDown days with a more realistic approach (Stanima system,  build ups and chain grappling) but I personally enjoy it this way.Graphics are honestly not that great to me considering a lot of it looks just overall bad at times (I get they couldn't scan everyone in)Roster is amazing this time around with The Terminator (no lie), Mikey Whipwreck (ECW original) and even the return of Shane O Mac. I think it's around 120 (minus DLC) I would heavily recommend this if you are a wrestling fan			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WCW/NWO Revenge for the N64 is what I want in a wrestling game, this is not that type of game. I wouldn't even classify this as a game, more like a very slow, drawn out rhyhthm game. I have yet to even come close to winning a match. Here's how a typical match for me goes. Throw a punch, throw a move or two, get reversed. CPU on offense now, try to reverse, too fast, wait for CPU to finish move, try to reverse, too slow, wait for move to finish, try to reverse, too fast, wait for move to finish, try to reverse, too slow.......and so on until it comes to the submissions, oh lord the submissions are terrible. Rotate the thumbsticks to avoid your opponent, sounds easy enough. Get put in a submission, move up, it's not moving up, try to go left, WTF it went right, get submitted..you lose. The game does look good though and I like where after the match I get interviewed by Rene Young, though I'm not sure how serious I am taken when I'm 0-20 and talking about being the greatest living legend in WWE.

												This is probobly the best wrestling game you can get on a pc.Lots of fun features and customisation.You can interupt your openents entrance,i like that there are no loading screens between entrances and the start of the match.MyCareer mode is fun in the begining but after a while it becomes realy dull and repetitive.Anouncers are quite buged aswell, sometimes they repeat the same line twice or the call a reversal when a wrestler didnt reverse,a few times anouncers even called a male wrestler ""she"".The customisation is also not too bad.You can change practicly everything, but that is also the downside of this game.I've spent some time making a few arenas, custom championships and i edited a few superstars to create my own show in a universe mode.It worked fine for some time.But recently for no reason at all the game just started crashing after almost every match.I have also expierienced quite a few crashes during wrestlers entrances.Sometimes the game even crashed while performing an OMG moment on the anuncer's table.It just seems that the game can't handle all the customisation it lets you do.Overall it's not a bad game but all the crashes and model glitches that i encountered makes me say that i dont recomend this game if you like customisation since it will just make you feel frustrated after having to edit things because the game could not handle a wrestler or arena etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought WWE 2K16 hoping to be take advantage of the excellent community creations feature so I could make my own custom rosters and shows in the WWE Universe mode. However, there is an issue with the game where all community creation downloads are corrupt once you have too many custom creation files associated with your save. Many users have also reported bugs that completely corrupt game saves, meaning they have had to delete hundreds of hours of progress. Aside from these issues, the general performance of the game is unimpressive. Yuke's PC ports of WWE 2K15/16 have been subpar and have not been adequately supported with patches. It is extremely unlikely that I will buy another WWE game for PC, having been ripped off for two consecutive releases. If you want a WWE game and own a PS4 or Xbox One, buy it for that platform instead.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, we all love wrestling and we all want to be wrestlers ourselves, right? With this game you get a chance to be a wrestler yourself. But honestly, if real wrestling is just half as exhausting and frustrating than this game I don't want to be a wrestler.TL/DR at the end. ;)The game is really nice with all it's possibilities to create a unique superstar and the career mode. What killed the game for me was only the bad coding.The loading times are way too long, it feels like you have to wait forever before the editor/match/whatever has laoded.I could live with that if the ingame-perormance was okay. Well, it isn't. I don't have a high-end gaming machine but it's decent enough for most games (specs on the end of this review). The problem is that the FPS drop massively during the entrance (in the entrance-editor too) as well as when more than 2 wrestlers are in the ring. I've set anything in the graphics options as low as possible except the resolution but the framerate didn't increase much.Besides this issues the game is actually very fun to play. You have a lot of possibilities to customize your superstar as well as you may customize already existing superstars. The graphics look nice (not really up to date but still fine).The gameplay itself is more complex than I first expected but really easy to learn (yet quite difficult to master IMO). Summary:I really wanted to like this game but I just can't. The technical issues just outweigh the rest of the game. I bought the game when it was on sale for about 13€.I would recommend this game to you if you were a huge wrestling fan and if this game was on sale. For the regular price, I definately would not recommend to buy this game.System-Specs:CPU: AMD PhenomII 1055T (6x 2.8GHz)RAM: 8Gb DDR3 @ 1333MHzSSD: OCZ Agility3 128GbGPU: EVGA Nvidia GTX 560tiOS:  Win 10 Pro 64bit			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't speak for the campaign or anything because who actually buys these games for playing as the actual wrestlers? The true greatness of this game lies within the ability to create your own wrestlers and have them fight each other. I mean, it what other game can you make a super ripped version of yourself, then dress him up as a dictator, and have him ride in on a motor-cycle to the ring for his fight against DIO and The World from Jojo. 10/10 instantly.Go buy this game, the time is now!

This is my first wrestling game since 2002.It was on sale for 75% off so i thought why not.I had looked at all the negative reviews,but seeing as i just wanted abit of fun like the old days i decided it would be ok.WRONG!The controls are atrocious,back on the old games in the 1990s to early 2000s the controls seemed more action oriented.More fluid, The amount of fun me and a friend used to have playing TLC matches was staggering.Constant on your seat intense jumping around excitement. Technology is the culprit here, now they can do more advanced motion capture,they try to make it as real as possible,and that's where i see the problem.For me it needs to be more fluid, more action oriented. With this game it seems like your a walking pile of concrete, so slow. everything is so slow.Slow to move,slow to get up,slow to climb.That's just not fun.Seeing as ive not played one of these games for 14 years i have no idea when this started to happen but these games used to be alot of fun to play.The grappling system is one of the stupidest things ive seen in a game,completely doesn't work,reversals don't seem to work either,either your too fast or too slow.They don't give you enough time to time it right,same goes with being pinned and submissions.  Im old school, track and field old school, button bashing is the way to go when trying to get out of a hold.The graphics are also not as good as they could be.I love realism,but a game like this can only add realism if it can keep things fluid and exciting. They are unable to do that which results in slow and monotonous gameplay. Overall id say if your a hardcore fan and you like things to be slow and have more realism sacrificing action and silly gameplay then you will probably enjoy it.But for me and anyone wanting what i wanted don't buy this even if its 99% off. I spent 12 hours downloading this, Wasting time i could of used downloading my other games and taking up 40 gig. Im going to try and play abit more but i doubt it will stay on my drive for long.

												I had heaps of fun playing this game on Xbox One... well, until the DLC updates completely ♥♥♥♥ed my Universe Mode up time and time again. Then it continuously froze only on the Universe Mode screen. So I thought I'd re-purchase it on PC instead to do some modding for it, but despite having better than the recommended settings for this game, it still runs quite poorly. Even while not in full screen and the audience density or texture turned down, the game consitently provides a B performance rating. I get lag spikes throughout matches, but the worst part for lag is during the entrances. No matter how low I turn the graphics or how small the window is, the superstar entrances are slow and laggy, especially when stuff like pyro is used. This pretty much ruins the main thing I'm modding in the game.I'm just hoping I don't get the data corruption that most people (modders in particular) seem to be getting with this.I'll continue playing, but I'm not happy with this.

												If you think the fact that 2k makes us PC owners wait 6 months after everyone else gets the game is bad enough you havent seen nothing yet.Normally this is where someone would list the negatives or positives for the game. For this review you only need to know two things.1-If you plan on downloading ANYTHING expect the game at some point to randomly erase all your hard work and enjoy starting all over.2-At some point the game will literally just decide not to work anymore and no amount of reinstalls/reboots/exorcisms will fix it. The game WILL NEVER WORK AGAINOne would think they would throw out some fixes for this, well they haven't and they won't and why should they?In the end we will continue plunking down our hard earned cash to a game that always arrives late without a reason ever given and will be plagued with bugs and those bugs will never ever be addressed.

												I'm not going to lie, I enjoy this game, but there's negatives about it...Pros:-No frameskipping when below 60FPS.-Custom Divas.-Fatique is realistic.-All DLCs included.-Local Co-ops.Cons:-I press RT on exact time to reverse, the announcer says ""Nice reversal"" but the character doesn't reverse.-Reversals can be pain in the♥♥♥♥♥-No create a finisher.-Hardly any patches.-Sometimes the player/character looks like he's/she's growling at the other character when attempting to pick them up.-Sometimes wrong moves get inputted. -Controls aren't good, I still prefer 2011 controls over '12 and above.-Camera effects can really decrease FPS heavily.-Xbox One has constant 60FPS whereas my GTX 750 Ti OCed only achieved 45fps minimum.This game would've been nice if more work was put into it but sadly it seems like there's only one patch. I still play this game only for entertainment purposes but when it comes to reversals, ALT + F4 comes in handy. Other than that, it's not recommended, I hope to see this game removed from steam store since it's like MKX (In terms of abandonded game).Overall score: 2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a big improvement from 2k15 and the later releases by 2K, pin/sub systems that arent glitchy, over all i'd say 8/10. Theres still room for improvement but 2K are on the right track with this one. I should also mention that I had 2k15 and I had to return it as it was a mess. 2K16 is a bit pricey though, so I got it off♥♥♥♥♥ Have fun!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Single Player.  Always losing.  Lower career difficulty to Easy.  First match after changing settings: I ""Win""  because the AI glitched and walked all the way up the entrance ramp and got counted out.  Second match after changing settings: Pin the AI 10+ times.  He pins me 2 times. Second time I am unable to hit the ridiculously small bar during the Quick time event and lose...game freezes during the animation showing the winner.  Have to force quit the game.  Force quitting allows me to play second match again: Pin the AI 20+ times.  Finally WIN the match.  Game goes to show replays, completely black screen, music, not responding.  Have to force quit.   Just like real WWE, game is apparently rigged.  I do not recommend this game, it is mosly Quick Time events with button mashing, and glitchy as hell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Used to be a big fan of these games a few years back, well about 6-7 years ago. Wow, I feel old. Anyway, it's been great playing it again. I would recommend using a controller though, the keyboard controls are horrendous. The gameplay's fun, never has hitting someone with a sledgehammer been so immersive. I will say the reversal system is rage endusing, but besides that a fun experiance overall. Totally worth it if you're a fan, or in my case feeling nostalgic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I dont get that ""wtf i hit the button"" moment, as i didn in previous games. the graphics are great, the male characters are spot on, while the Divas look a little ""butch"" and unrealistic. The career process is pretty much the same as 2K15. Its dry and dull, and you grind it out to advance your char. I HATE the interviews.....""and there you have it"". anyone who has played, knows what i mean, and those who are about to play, will know what i mean within 3-5 carrer matches. I would give this game an OVERALL of 6.5/10. the career is the only reason its not an 8 or 9.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've had a bittersweet experience with this game. I first bought it directly from steam, and despite having a more than optimal hardware configuration for playing it, an error would appear every time I tried to launch the game. After trying all possible methods, I got annoyed, uninstalled it, and asked for a refund.After almost a year, I happened to win a key for the game in a giveaway. I decided to give it a try once again, only to find the exact same error whenever I tried to launch the game. This time I decided to read the threads in the game's dicussion forum, almost one by one, until I found a solution I've not tried before (apparently it was a new solution). To my own surprise, IT WORKED! And so, I was finally able to play the game to my heart's content.I'm really happy with this game! Sometimes the FPS drop drastically while loading some of the entrances, but besides that it works like a charm. Sure, it may take an entire minute to load at first, but it's worth it. IF the developers had not abandoned this release in order to work on the newest version, things would've been different, and users wouldn't be rating the game as badly as they're doing now. Nonetheless, if you manage to ""skip"" the errors it throws at you while launching the game (the ALT+tab during Steven Austin's splash screen saves lives), you'll find it's an enjoyable experience. It has really good graphics, nice animations, a challenging AI, and an impressive roster!So, I give this game a thumbs-up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I used to play wrestling games on the N64 and I haven't liked any of the newer ones I had tried, but I heard 2k16 was supposed to go back to the roots and try to make a better experience.  I personally didn't have any good experiences with it. First, when it is in full screen I still have a bar visible on the top and one side of the screen, it is annoying, but not a big deal.  For me the worst part of the game is the wrestling. It feels like the entire combat is based on reversals. The reversal system requires you to press a button at exactly the right time to reverse the move. It sounds ok, but by the time the indicator shows up to press the button it is too late if you try to anticipate it coming up it will say you pressed it too early.  This makes it very hard to successfully get a reversal and can mean you spend the entire fight trying to get a reversal or lose. My first match I only got one or two hits in the entire fight. Which, leads me to another issue there is no tutorial or training mode. Well, there is a tutorial, but you need to use a create a wrestler to do it, and there is no way (that I know of) to go through it again other than creating another new campaign. While you can make your own matches to practice with there is no dedicated training room like other fighting games have.  The pinning system is also very annoying. A wheel will pop up and start filling up you have to press a button to stop it while it is in a specific zone to kick out it sounds easy, but it goes so fast it is very hard. Now I've read a lot about the reversal and pinning issues online and most people seem to think you just need to keep playing to get used to the timing, well I didn't get to that point when I had a (for me) game breaking bug. I made a create a hero started doing the campaign and very shortly after I had an issue where it failed to save or let me load a save.  I tried every suggestion I found online except completely reinstalling (because if it happened once whats to stop it from happening again?) with no luck.  While looking online I saw someone lost a save with over a hundred hours on it. Fortunately, I only lost about an hour or so, but if this is happening to other people and with far more time invested than me, why should I or anyone else put time into it when we could lose it all to a bug that there is no known way to fix or prevent? Even if I could get adjusted to the reversal and pin system I cannot recommend a game that can randomly corrupt a save that people have put hours into.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As I write this post I've only played the game for seven hours, but I just wanted to tell anyone who is unsure about buying the game that it is absolutely worth it. The new reversal, submission and working hold systems combined with the fantastic graphics  (never had any issues with framerate by the way, and I ""only"" have a gtx 660)  and better physics means that 2k16 is an incredibly fresh game to play.

												I usually don't write reviews much.  Till this time I just review for GTA V. After playing this game for a while here are some pros and cons from MPV.Pros.1. Excellent graphics and gameplay2. Liked overall audio effects. It syncs quiet well with game timings3. Great for wwe fans and even if you are not, its great time killer4. Game from 2K, well it says all, one of the market leaders in this industry, so questions around their creativity5. All DLC included in one packThough there aren't many, still, here are some cons/suggestion for improvementsCons.1. Controllers can be tricky at times2. Story line is a bit slow and slaushy at the same around3. Not many times, but Bugs out once in a while(e.g. especially when using the weapons on aprons near rope/corners)Conclusion - a defiantly buy and big thumbs up from my end.Score - 9.0/10P.s. Above mentioned all the pointers are my own views and may differ with individual experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun game. Pretty extensive character creator, decent career mode, lots of different moves, a good amount of different ""modes"" (single, tag, elimination, cell etc) and you can both upload your creations or download the community's. Exceptionally fun when you can get a few friends together (mp modes include up to 6 people).BE WARNED though, not worth full price in my opinion. While I do genuinely enjoy the game I will fully admit it has its flaws and they show (awkward controls, career gets repetitive because it doesn't mix things up often enough, more managing options during career would've been welcome, etc). If you can look past some flaws you can find an enjoyable experience with WWE 2k16, otherwise steer clear.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a weird mix of good and bad. The character editor is good, and the various universe modes are solid. The showcase mode is also quite enjoyable. The MyCareer mode will remind you of every reason why so many people stopped watching WWE in 2015. Usos and Reigns are booked to be stronger than you, no matter how well you play the game. The authority henchmen will also march down to the ring and frequently harass you and cause you to lose matches, also mostly regardless of how well you can play. The gameplay itself is inconsistent, with button hits occasionally not registering. The timing is also terrible, with ""too fast"" and ""too late"" messages often appearing simultaneously. The manual is less helpful than a homeless alcoholic trying to give directions outside of a gas station, and you will almost certainly spend sometime googling basic things like ""how to enter and exit the ring"" and ""how to climb the ropes"". All in all, don't bother getting it unless it's on sale; it's not worth the list price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh god, where do i start with this game?First of all, I haven't played any WWE games since the PS3 titles like the ones with Smackdown vs. Raw kind.. so i was quite overwhelmed with the look and feel of this title. Being said that, the gameplay annoyed me to the greatest extent. My first match was probably a minute or few long, cause the bloody pinning system is really unnecessarily annoying. What is up with this timing crap? Maybe i'm too old school and liked the arcade feel better..Then there's the submission and the reversal systems. Oh my goodness.. and i thought the pinning was absurdly difficult for an old timer like myself. I'm not going to go in much detail, but the submission system is like a cat chasing a mouse, go figure. Ohhhh, but the reversal system.. TOO LATE, TOO EARLY. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. how many times have i pulled my hair after failing to press the button at the EXACT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ moment.I seriously hope that things are better on WWE 2K17, when it comes out for the PC (if it does?). Cause this game could've been fun for me.. and it is fun played with a friend, but these three systems are outright terrible.I've only managed to try out the career mode a little and it seemed okay. Character creation feels limited though. There were enough match types to go through just to please any professional wrestling fan, but even they couldn't help save me to be on this game's side.Can i recommend the game? Not really, unless you accept these downsides of the gameplay. But to each their own, really.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you actually enjoy wrestling games, then maybe you'd like this.But if you watched Jermania on Youtube, don't buy this game. For absolutely no reason whatsoever, in this version of the game and the 2017 version you can't use regular clothing in matches. So no wacky characters, no funny nonsense. No. This is a SERIOUS game for SERIOUS Wrestling fans. Wrestling's fake as♥♥♥♥♥♥anyways, so I don't see why they would make it even less entertaining with this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Get the 2015 version, when it's seriously on sale, because these games are discgustingly overpriced.

												Pros:-Stone Cold Steve Austin Showcase-Graphics are okay-All DLCCons:-A lot of wrestlers that we won't play (Arnold, so many more, etc.)-Too many varients of a character (They couldn't just have more attires and changable entrances?)-Lack of iconic wrestlers (ECW Originals, RVD, etc.)-Many customization for characters but missing the feature of having your own music, which kills all CAW (This is a PC version, I expect it to be easier to have your own music.)-Limited Amount of downloads-Mods are a long process to install...-So... many... more...I think the PS3/Xbox360 version would be better.

												Once again we get a good game from the WWE franchise. The game has good story line and is fun to play.It seems that some people are facing some glitches in the game but I haven't faced any , also some lower ebd laptops are experiensing sudden fps drops in matches like Royal Rummble where u have more than 5 or 6 ppl in the ring.However if u reduse the sudience dencity to qbout 45% it should be fine. The best part about this game is obviously the multiplayer part ,it remides me how I used to love both WWE and itz games when I was a kid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[not free, but came in a bundle]Some background: I used to be a huge wrestling fan when I was younger and have very fond nostalgic memories of WWF: No Mercy, which I still consider the best game of its genre.  I came into this expecting a janky, arcade brawler to play with my friend.  What I got was a slow, clunky psudo-sim.  It may sometimes look the part but it feels like sludge to play.  Is it better than it's playstation predecessors?  Idk, never played them.  But this as a stand alone is trash.Under what circumstances would I recommend it?  If you have a spare 50 gigs you don't know what to do with and want to have fun in character creation for several days.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*********************Terrible.... it's like nobody at yukes cares anymore when developing a WWE game, each year they get more buggier than the last game. I even own' the PS4 version and it's no better than the PC port only reason I bought this was just mod it and pla}|?y as the NPCs that should have been playable to begin with.The reversal system is just garbage sometimes it will say you reversed it when you didn't or it will not when you did reverse. Trying to irish whip someone back into the ring feels like a choir because most times it will always wanna aim at an angle and just smack them againts the apron.2k Showcase mode is mostly reused content from WWE'13 and Legends of wrestlemania matches for stone cold so not and the My career mode just no fun at all.....Lets talk about how garbage the AI is... I'm getting pinned in a tag team match after a finish and hal the time the AI just sits there and doesn't do anything to help costing the match so it's basically a 2 on 1. With how crappy the reversal system is you will be missing all the time while AI is constantly reversing nothing wrong with a challenge but when it completely favors the AI on normal difficulty then you've messed up....What's with all the removed stuff from CAW mode hardly anything to work with anymore can't even make a backwards hat anymore everything is so limited you be better of playing WWF WARZONE on psx. I haven't fully enjoyed a WWE game since Smackdown vs RAW 2007.....Don't buy this if you're expecting a playable game only buy it for the mods nothing else there is nothing redeemable about this game besides the mods			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about the game other than it's a disappointment? Before I downloaded the game and spent the $50, I double checked to make sure my system was able to run it. It was. I like that there's a variety of superstars and a variety of different match types and I personally don't mind that you have to unlock things because after all game wouldn't be fun if you didn't have things to earn. The problem is I can't play any of the matches as this thing crashes more than a driver playing GTA. I was able to create a superstar but the minute I go to edit? Crash. The minute I try anything other than character creation? Crash. And I'm a female so I expected that you can't really do much of anything but go for the Diva's championship but seriously, I felt so left out about the story mode (which I couldn't do anyway because it kept crashing).I hadn't played any WWE games since the Playstation 1 and I was really looking forward to it.

They know about the issues and do nothing, while already trying to sell us 2k17. Game will shut down in career mode, refuse to upload items. Those are the more irritating bugs to me. I like career mode a lot before that crap. I really wanted to upload my face and make myself. Nope. That wont work either. I am an IT professional. This stuff is not fixable through settings, etc. This game...I am done buying wwe products until they prove themselves again. Absolutely Horrible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												2K continues THQ's tradition of taking one step forward and two steps back as it presents new challenges for pins and submissions which go beyond creating a learning curve or providing a stronger difficulty. In many ways, it seems like an experiment not well tested then, on top of that, it seems to have disabled the AI from making each other tap out. Which, for those like me who like watching AI vs. AI matches in universe, means you will be watching long fights, with multiple finishers. Many of which could, and should of, ended with a submission, but for some reason the hold is let go and the AI decides to pin soon after.All in all, while I remain happy 2K is realeasing a PC version of this with all the DLC, after a decent first iteration and mediocre 2nd, something outstanding has to be part of the 2K17 package for me to buy this game 3 years in a row.

												I took a bit of time to gather enough hours in the game to make a halfway decent review.So from the start the game was fun, since everything is new and interesting.The fighting gameplay is good, not amazing but good.If you learn to time right it feels balanced.After playing the game for 24+ hours I noticed the following:- Targeting system in matches with multipe AI's is really poor- Not possible to target the ref, only 'accidental' hits to knock him out- Bug in the game the ref does 3 taps but only counts 2- Rivalry is extremely boring and 1-dimensional- You are forced to enter rival matches without being able to do anything other than leave- Animations of post-scene interviewer is horrible, really bad modelling- Authority targets are sometimes impossible- No special entrances for custom character- Move search/filtering in move editing menu not search-friendly- In career mode, it's not possible to use chairs or anything even in extreme rules tournaments.  -> which is super annoying since you manager will throw in chairs in the ring which can't be used or you're disqualified- improving attributes takes ages and becomes very boring- Player base is really low and this makes online play with tag-team almost impossibleSo in general. the game gets boring very fast. You really need to enjoy wrestling and grinding to such an extend to accept this. The gameplay is just very lacking for a game which gets upgraded yearly. Feels like rushed and unpolished.

												First game I've played in this series since 2008. It is hands down the worst game i've ever bought and this game has convinced me to never play another wresting game again. And I've given this game multiple chances, thinking maybe I just need to get the hang of it. But no. You can attempt to polish excrament but all your going to get is a soiled towel. The submission system is stupid and unresponsive. I've lost a game 30 seconds into the match because the cat and mouse system of you moving your right analog away from theirs is horrible. Try tapping out to a basic submission move with full health 30 seconds into the match. The pin system is horrible, even with a yellow chest if you get pinned you can still miss the kick out chance. No custom music, no changable controls. The story mode is boring, let this superstar run out on you.

												My review is based on MyCareer. I don't play the other modes:1) A lot more customization than last year. 2) The submission system somehow got worse than last year. 3) Easy mode is fighting ragdolls who forgot they have arms. 4) Normal mode is highly over-turned as far as reversals go. 5) The mini-pin game works well, if you are the PC. 6) The same constant interview with the creepy lady over and over and over. 7) The Authority seems like piece mail, and thier directives only make sense about 15% of the time whether you roll with them or against them. 8) The lack of interesting matches you get to participate in. 9) The same constant run in to start rivalries over and over. Overall, it's way better than last year, but that doesn't say a great deal. The developers are simply very lazy and anything resembling stories is non-existent. However, WWE 2K16 would be impressive if PS3 was still on top of the market.  I've bought this the last two years hoping for a decent my career mod as I grew up watching wrestling that doesn't exist anymore: Mid-South, NWA on TBS, AWA, etc.  While 2K16 is better, it's like claiming that eating a mud sandwich tastes better than dirt. Yeah, it's a little more complex, but it's still malnourising.In short, I'd hold off on buying this one because of the WWE Universe save corrupt issue and MyCareer is a repetitive, grindfest with the same runs-ins and interview, not interviews, over and over.

												Do not buy this game, Not even when its in sale.This game has to many flaws. Mainly because this game was meant for consoles and you notcice that right away.Targeting system:There isnt any,  You will find yourself calling out to the screen: no no that guy get the other one ! thats not what i wanted to do at all! and so on. the same counts with all other movement. you will fin yourself climbing the pole in the corner a lot without you intendiong to do so!Reversal:Unless you are superman you wont be able to time this correctly meaning you get our♥♥♥♥♥kicked untill finnaly, by chance, you get it right once but this is more luck then skill.Minigames:For some clashes between fighters you have to do certain mini games but there over complicated and not well explained at the beginning. this means that half the time you dont know what the hell your doing. also this makes the fighting look clunky and rushed by the developers.Interviews: Laggy as hell you will often get the same questions and it doesnt really matter what you say to the reporter she will always say the same thing. ""well there you have it back to you guys"" sure the game isnt about the interviews and stuff but its in there and im more like: do it right or dont do it at all!Tuturial:is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the barely explain anything and you dont need to do it right in order to continu this means that the game progresses even though you still dont get it. why the ♥♥♥♥ a tutrial in the first place then?Character creation:This is the only thing done right! you can costumize your character and make your fighter the fighter you want. character creation is really extended. and they did this very well.All in all the gameplay feels broken maybe its different if you play with a controller but this game is frustration simulator to me. the most fun i had was watching my friend who also bought this game freak out.

												This game has such a steep learning curve it almost isn't fun.  Reversing moves seems almost impossible at first and opponents reverse 80% of your moves even when the game is on easy.  The create a wrestler depends on the face import system which is a nice feature but, you can't create a wrestler's face without it.  They could have kept the old face creation system and added the new one with it but instead they completely ditched the old system in favor of the new.  Movement often seems clunky instead of flowing smoothly, and many of the wrestlers look goofy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game does nothing to teach you how to play it. Looking at the controls does not help either. The tutorials only teach you how to do the stupid mini games. Worst of all no refund because I spent too much time in the customise area. I swear Smackdown vs Raw had more customisation options than this game does as far as intros and allowing custom music.If you are new to the 2K stuff you will be utterly lost as to what you are supposed to do.Pretty much 45gb of useless game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most likely the worst WWE game so far. This game tried to get too techinical with it, and ended up actually making it LESS fun to play, with things like telling you to press F to counter, and when you press it tells you ""Too Fast!"" or ""Too Slow!"" when you try to forget your reaction time and postpone hitting it for a second, and an odd kick out move. I have never been able to tag in a partner while playing, because while near them, instead of tagging my character will climb the ropes. Defintely regretting this purchase.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played this at a friends and loved it so I decided to pick it up on sale for $20 on steam, boy was I disappointed. I don't know why but this game is nearly unplayable for me even with the graphics settings turned down. Even the character creation screen was laggy as hell. I compared the minimum requirements from this to Metal Gear V Phantom Pain which I also own and has a higher minimum requirement and demand, it  played without any sort of lag or frame rate drop whatsover...WWE 2k16 give's me maybe 13 fps if I'm lucky. Not sure if it's an optimization issue, bad port or maybe it just hates my graphics card but I don't have the time, the money nor the patience to figure it out.  I have 8 gigs of ram, geforce gt 720 and an i5-4460 quad running @ 3.20 ghz, I should not be having issues to this degree with such a basic game. Requesting Refund.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A lot better than some of their previous ones. However, it still belongs in a pile of garbage. The moves have no clear indicators to when they are gonna happen so you can't properly reverse them. I'm not talking about moves just being hard to reverse, I'm saying that the characters just teleport to certain spots when they do a move and the reversal indicator is never properly timed. The submission system can either work or just spaz out sometimes. The game has very little in the way of proper introduction to some of the newer mechanics if you haven't played any recent WWE 2k games and that can really affect a match. In MyCareer mode you constantly get asked questions by a monster(mouth and eyes like to freak out) and the answers are very bland. The character creator is once again a couple steps forward and then a couple back. It takes forever for certain parts to load and sometimes they don't load until you have completely set them up. The game can still be fun if your a WWE fan, but I can't recommend it as a game. 2K has had so many chances to make a good WWE game, but it's just dissapointing that this one isn't as good as it should be. As I mentioned though, the game can still be fun if your a fan of WWE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WWE 2K16 is pretty much the same as the previous WWE game with just different and more charakter and some few more gamemodes. The controlls are the same hard ones as before. nothing really new. Honestly it feels like the development isn't trying to create a good game, they litterly copied and pasted in as the previous games and named it different. The controlls are crap, the combat is mostly bad not really fluid what so ever. And it is hard to hold up with combos. Those who start with this game will have a hard time figuring out how to play consider there is no tutorials, atleast not what I have seen.Really not worth the money to be honest unless you truly are a fan of WWE. To be honest wait for WWE 2K17. Hopefully they have more fluid fighting system			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is great. Improvement from WWE 2k15, better optimization, better mechanics, career mode and 2k mode has improved. Once I played the game for a few hours, I wanted to play the Online, as expected, the game is pretty dead. Playing WWE games online were great fun, teaming up with a buddy and doing a tag team match against some other randoms, you would never know what to expect, how the match would turn out. If you do come across players, they are from a different country (US), as I live in Europe, this causes a lot of lag delay, It would be nice if we didn't share the same servers, but would the game be completely dead then?

Thumbs down for that lazy stupid idiot of a developer.Seems like that savegame corruption bug still exists. The first time i encoutered that bug was in WWE 2k13 and 2k still doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about this problem. Lost my save files after 112 hours this time. Means I wasted 112 hours of my life again this year which I spend creating superstars, shows, arenas, title belts and playing MyCarreer mode. The game itself is great, the best WWE game so far in my opinion. Everyone who claims the WWE SvR (Smackdown Vs Raw) games are better says it because of nostalgia reasons. But the problem is that it's not reliable. 2k also promised to update the content on a regular basis. Well, I haven't seen any update for this game at all, no bug fixes, nothing. That's why I can't recommend this game for the full price even if it's one of my favorite games. After 145 hours, the game somehow is complete trash by now. I uploaded a backup of two of my CAWs and every time the save files get corrupted i just download them again. I also made 12 custom logos for my own show's PPVs. But every time I try to download them or something else from the community creations, all other logos, CAWs etc are getting erased. Makes the game unplayable for me. The game doesn't even inform me now the the save files are corrupted...Fix the mentioned bug(s) already you stupid idiot morons. In reality, guys like me who buy these games every single year hoping this bug will ever be fixed are the only stupid idiots. Try to resist guys and don't buy it next year.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR: My save corrupted with no reason behind it, and the game is a general buggy mess. Purchase at your own cost!I really want to like this game, but in my 5 hours of play its become apparent that I don't want to continue this game.I downloaded it last night, spent an hour or so creating a wrestler, did a match, and then went to sleep.  I wake up, all ready to get into the career mode... and then learnt about how buggy the game is. I found the for some reason, every time I launch the game the ring appears completly pitch black, making it difficult to fight since the ropes are also black. There is a fix, but you have to do it every time you launch.  So I figured I could live with it, and kept going. I finished the tutorial, took a break, reopened the game.... and my save file suddenly corrupted for no concievable reason! I have had saves corrupt before, and they can be pretty depressing, but having read how common these corruptions are, I really don't want to have to face any more!Buy this game if you want a WWE game on PC, but any game that corrupts the save that quickly is a big no for me!

Going by other reviews, I am not the only one.My machine is above the recommended requirements, however I suffered a very low FPS rate which made me refund the game.Game is also 45GB!!!Looks to be good a game, perhaps one for console			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun, but have to complete at least two finishers to win... Maybe make the finishers a little bit harder to get so you can win after one? Also, there has only been one update in almost a year.... Just can't recommend it for the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll go straight to the reasons of not to by this game.. As there are far more reasons not buy it frankly.Con's.Stupid bugs that shouldn't be in the game at this stage.. (Some basic superstar walkin's even have bugs.. One looked like it was walking with one boot higher than the other... Stupid things like that are still in the game.)Pre-scripted matches and come backs that put Bulk Bogan to shame.. and you end up feeling worse than Brett did in Canada against Shaun.. ><_><You can honestly smash someone around for over 10 mins and then they turn in to the ""counter king"" and reverse everything.. and even if they have just started the comeback and you have taken your time.. They wipe you out like they have been doing all the bashing.. and then it's good night Viena for you..Bogan might be wipped clean from the HoF and all WWF / WWE content ... but wow.. His screw job style is flying high in this game.. (You know.. The guy who couldn't put his P***IS over in court.) lololPro'sA HUGE roster and that is about it.. Some nice WCW inclusions with more WCW things to come in 2K17. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To be honest I haven't played the game much since I have been busy with other things. I will tell you that this game is definately a big improvment over WWE2K15.Mycareer has been improved way better and showcase mode is pretty good.The gameplay is way better than WWE2K15. The matches feel realistic like how it would look in a WWE programming.So 2K I see that you have improved alot since you took over back in 2013.Anyways I hope you add more match modes like parking a lot, 3 stages of hell and a match creator.Mods are working perfect without zero lags.I haven't liked a WWE game this much since WWF No Mercy, Smackdown 2!, Smackdown Shut your mouth!, Smackdown Here comes the pain and WWE Smackdown vs Raw.The only cons this game has is it's lacking story mode creator otherwise a great game and I recommend every Wrestling fan of Wrestling in general.All around I give WWE2K16 8/10 i'm quite happy with this game.

												I'm going to give the game a 4.5/10The graphics are pretty and there are elements of the gameplay that are fun however the gameplay feels very much simulator as opposed to arcade, which does have it's benefits however it makes the entire game slow, also doing the same move 5 mins later marks you down for points which is stupid. The create a character season seems really really dry, there is the option to have an enemy and a friend and that's about it, after a match you get asked a question by a blonde chick whos mouth is slighty too wide? You can then respond in 4 different ways and the characters voice sounds like it was done by a person imitating the generic male voice on Family Guy. It's worse voice acting than the original Resident Evil. I'm almost certain they done it on purpose as a poor joke that's totally failed to land.I miss the days of WWF Westlemaina 2000 / No Mercy / ps1/ps2 Smackdown games. These games by comparison were a lot more fun, they felt like they had a lot more to do in the career mode with so many alternating storylines and random events, the combat although straight up arcade was great fun.I guess this games saving grace (if you coudl call it that) is the ability to replay old matches or events throughout WWF history, I think they've been doing this for quite sometime now anyway so this isn't exactly new.When you're designing your charcter be sure to press X (on xbox360 controller) so you can preview items on a dummy charcter. Absolutely no idea why you can't preview them on your actual character as they're alreaded loaded on the screen. I assume this was a mistake as it makes no sense. Overall it's just ok, if you're lookin for a fun game then this isn't it. It's very dry and the combat relies on stamina management, stone scissors paper and other weak minigames to make it seem different, all you get is a slowed down game with a lot of the story stripped back.Once again the voice acting on the male create a character is absolutely shocking and whoever got paid to do it should spend that money on voice acting lessons.

												This has to be the worst port I have ever tried to play, and I've played through Arkham Knight. To start:5820k @ stock16GB ddr4390x @ stock3x ssd raid 0 & samsung 950 nvme (tried installing on both)I first tried to load this up using my steam link. I thought ""oh the feed is really choppy"", which is weird as everything is wired. I shut the link down, and came upstairs to play. My fears were realized when I re-launched the game and the stutter remained. The game has a stutter that makes it completley unplayable. Every 1 second, the game locks for 1/2 sec. In the splash screen, in menu's, In benchmarks, in quick matches. 0I've checked the pc usage whilst running the benchmark.Cpu stays at a solid 15% usage. Memory @ 25%, vram at 30%. Gpu doesn't know what it wants to do. Shooting between 0-100%, but not in time with the stutters. I've got the latest crimson drivers, have tried all the .ini 'fixes', have tried changing literally every single graphics option, and it still chokes. I've reinstalled twice, to seperate drives 'just incase....'. Literally the only game I have ever played on this rig with this issue.A good pc port is one that gives a console like ""launch and play"" experience. This is not one of those ports. Thank god I got it in a humble bundle. Was thinking about buying the cd key solo, glad I didn't bother.If your thinking of buying this, I can only say this is my experience. I hope yours is better.

												A must have for any wrestling fan.This is the definitive PC wrestling experience, and arguably the best WWE game yet. A huge roster of wrestlers, Stone Cold Steve Austin story mode, a career mode for your created wrestlers, create and download wrestlers/arenas/titles/logos. There is a lot to do in this game to keep you busy.Recommend playing with a controller. A patch was released just after release which made all the performance issues go away.A few downsides:- Elimination Chamber matches are bugged, you can get stuck in the wall (this happens on consoles too)- No custom music option like in previous games- If you don't like grinding for exp to improve attributes then you probably won't like career modeCan't comment on online mode as I haven't played it myself, I got this game more for booking my own shows, rivalries and events using universe mode (In my game Zack Ryder actually keeps a title for more than one day!)

												In terms of gameplay quality, it's a step in the right direction from last year's empty roster and disappointing career mode. This year's career mode doesn't end when it starts getting good this time around, and the roster is sure to please most fans. The reason I can't recommend this lies in its poor optimization. Don't get me wrong, it's a step up from what we got in 2K15, but it's still a hack job. Only the Showcase mode and very misleading Benchmark ran at 60fps with no hitches. Once I'm in a normal match or MyCareer mode, it all falls apart due to random stutters making it near-unplayable. Literally no solution worked, therefore the main reason I bought this game was unplayable. To make matters worse, my specs far surpass what are supposedly the recommended specs.In short, you're better off waiting for the next entry in the series. Hell, I'd advise to pick up something like Shut Your Mouth or SvR 2006 for less than this. Please get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, Yukes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WWE 2K16 is playing much better than 2K15 when it came out. Gameplay is more of less similar with a few meaningful tweaks like limiting reversals, button spamming when performing a hold. All these tweaks have improved the gaming experience. I did face FPS drop to 10-15 about 2-3 times during my 5+ hours of gameplay. But considering it's just released. I can expect it to fixed in a future fix. You also get all DLCs since day one, unlike 2K15 where they were released as an update after some time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't believe I blew money on this game.  WWE 2k15 was horrible and unplayable.  But I didn't learn my lesson and bought this one becuase reviews said that the gameplay was better.  They just made it worse.  Submission and kicking out of a pin is what ruins the game.  You can be as good as you want but if you can't do either, especially the kicking out of a pin....then the game is useless.  You will lose every time.  Never again will I spend money on any WWE game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you played wwe 2k15 and hated it you will hate this game..infact if you hate 2k wwe series you will hate this game.The match pacing is slow and uninteresting the graphics never seem to improve and have not kept up with todays realistic look the hairs look the worst. This whole gameplay is based on mini games and  restrictions they spent soo much time trying to simulate a match that they take the entire fun out. If you played wrestling games before 2k you would know  it used to bring in more than just casual wrestling fans. This series is starting to become the CoD of a franchise nothing improved just added content and recycled formula with a few tweaks that make the game better and worse.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-----------------------------------------------------------------------The good:Way better than 2K15Sound and music are very goodRoster feels more balancedCena no longer always kicks out at 2Graphics are fair to good, depending on specs. I run everything at max settings and it's pretty good looking.Foreign objects do as much damage as they actually should nowSupposedly multiplayer is good, but I havent tried it yet (Same thing with MyCarereer) IF you buy the DLC, you actually get a good amount of things for what you pay forTitle managment (Not new, but fun as hell with all the options you are given)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The bad:For some reason, I had to use a 360 controller for my 2nd player, as a USB keyboard did not work.If you don't have a solid state drive, you have to wait about 5 minutes for the game to startup everytime (This has been fixed with the latest patch)A lot of characters use the same animationsOdd, slow motion glitches when characters go outside the ring area (announcer table, intro lane) and this is not graphics, it does the same thing on low settings for me (Fixed with latest patch)Some ladder and tag team matches work, but i have crashed about a fourth of the time trying both of those (Stability for theses matches has increased greatly with the latest patch)Apparently if you use AMD this game pretty much won't run and the devs don't plan to release fixes for itAnnouncer repeat themselves OFTEN, More than 2K15 evenSound patches out when doing 4 or more characters in 1 match (This is no longer a problem, it has been patched)Crashes seemingly at random (Not often, it did twice in 2 days which is not that be IMO) when in the menus or loading screensCounters sometimes say ""Too Early"" or ""Too Late' even when no button is pressed, leading me to belive the ocunter system is messed up (It works sometimes, but really feels like RNG)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------All in all, you liked 2K15 or are really into wrestling, yes, I think you would be ok with buying it now. Hopefully they patch it soon, because the game did just release and it seems like these wouldn't be hard fixes.EDIT (3/29/16): The latest patch has fixed NUMEROUS issues, making the game feel completed now. I would most certainly reccomend this game right now, as most bugs and issues have been fixed. PC users can finally say we have an actual, good wrestling game now :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR, dont waste your money on this trash.   This is my first review.   I have bought over 100 games through Steam, and this is by the far the worst.   I paid 50 dollars for glorified PC port.   And most PC ports are all trash.   First, there isnt any mouse support.   You have you hit space, return, esc to navigate the menus.   Second, the controls while wrestling are stupidly nonsensical.   Almost to the point of being absurd.    Games like Elite Dangerous ( a space sim) use a ton of controls.  Were every keystroke helps you pilot your ship.    But there is absolutely no reason to have a wrestling game need all the keys to control your character.   Its almost like they took the all the different combinations of movements & controls possible from a game controller and then mapped them to indivual keys.   That is ridiculously stupid.   3rd, there is no tutorial to help you learn the game.  Nothing, no instructions, no warm up matches - nothing.   You get dropped into it, and you have to figure it out.   4th, there are 2 ""mini games"" - and they are not fun.   1 mini game for submissions, and 1 mini game for kicking out of a pin.   But, there is no way to practice or learn either of these, until you are in a match.   And you will quickly lose the match, if you can't figure out the mini game fast enough.   Kind of important to have a tutorial on these things.  Last but not least, this simply isn't fun.   With a terrible control system 2k games took a potentially fun game and made a frustratingly bad game.   Almost forgot.   I had a friend come over and try the game.   The guy is a wrestling fan, and played a bunch of the console games.   He played all the older n64 wce and wwf games back in the day.   I let him play this game, and tried to talk him through how to play it, and he was completely shocked and how bad the control system was.   If nothing else, he saved 50 dollars.   Its games like this that explain Steam's game return policy.   But I want to take it a step further.   I want to be able to blacklist 2k Games from my Steam store.   I literally never want to see another game made by 2k games every again.   I never want to potentially buy another game from this developer.   Steam, can you make that happen?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟In my opinion, despite negitive reviews this game is pretty good for the price. True, the lags like a brick sometimes, even though I have much better than reccomended specs. As for career, I have experianced glitches, like the time when I was champion and the weeks before Wrestlemania and there was this storyline with me,Daniel Bryan,Seth Rollins and John Cena where you have to choose who to face at Wrestlemania. I chose Cena, as I find him the easiest to win agaisnt, however when Wrestlemania rolled around I faced Daniel Bryan, which I thought was weird as I chose Cena in the storyline. Then Daniel Bryan managed to beat me but after Wrestlemania Brock Lesnar was the champion and he wasn't even in the storyline in the first place. And now we have online,WWE2K16 features possibly the worst online I've ever seen. It is literally impossible to find a match, even for a normal 1v1 match. I've tried many times since I got the game back in February and have only found a match once. Despite these negitive facts,however, the graphics are good,aswell as the special effect animations for pay-per-views and championship matches, the gameplay is good,although it's a bit repetitive on career, and one of the biggest selling points for this game is the customization. The amount of things that you can change to suit how you want is probably the best of a game in the fighting genre, anything from apperance, to enterances, to custom championship belts and areas, you can do it all. Overall the game has its ups and downs. Is it worth the £35? I think so, if you can get past the fact of multiplayer being nonexistent,the odd glitch and sometimes having major frame drops, it is a good game, that I've had hundreds of hours playing.I also thought I should add that even though many people have had save data curruptions, I haven't experianced it, if I had have done, this review would be a very different one ;P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In terms of gameplay quality, it's a step in the right direction from last year's empty roster and disappointing career mode. This year's career mode doesn't end when it starts getting good this time around, and the roster is sure to please most fans. The reason I can't recommend this lies in its poor optimization. Don't get me wrong, it's a step up from what we got in 2K15, but it's still a hack job. Only the Showcase mode and very misleading Benchmark ran at 60fps with no hitches. Once I'm in a normal match or MyCareer mode, it all falls apart due to random stutters making it near-unplayable. Literally no solution worked, therefore the main reason I bought this game was unplayable. To make matters worse, my specs far surpass what are supposedly the recommended specs.In short, you're better off waiting for the next entry in the series. Hell, I'd advise to pick up something like Shut Your Mouth or SvR 2006 for less than this. Please get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together, Yukes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Was really hopeful for this... just as a game to play with a mate online against ai but it's hugely disappointing. For all the crashes and bugs that have been listed, the reality is it's just not a good game.The game is so poorly optimised that even after workarounds, lowering the visuals and tinkering with files to balance the speed... the game has a general sluggish drag to the fighting and tends to grind to a halt at relatively demanding sections like retrieving the belt in a ladder match.The submission system is insufferable in particular, whilst the majority of minigame grappling and pin systems are just needlessly complicates.It's just no fun... if you can work past the feeling of playing on a time delay between pressing a button and a response... which is tricky on the mini games for sure, the chances are the ai will consistently reverse your moves to the point of tedium. Something which, again, would be just as regular against a person who can prejudge the delayed button response.Even if all this was ok and you could live with it, what's left isn't any fun. The games sluggishness destroys any flowing moves, particularly Ariel and running, as even the animations are weak. And don't forget the endless bugs and glitches (see YouTube ... they're funnier to watch than get lumbered with).Avoid. See 2k17 reviews and wait for 2k18 I guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's buggy but mostly fun. It's not amazing. I'm not really sure it's worth the 50 bucks even with all the DLC that puts it over 100 on other platforms, but it's fun if you want a good laugh. The controls are awkward and the collision handling is pretty terrible. If you want to climb the turn buckle, it's the same button to do so as it is to tag your partner in a tag-team match, so sometimes if you want to tag out, you'll climb the ropes instead. And speaking of climbing the ropes... in a battle royal? Wanna jump off the top rope onto somebody, but there's somebody pinning somebody else, no worries, it'll just slide them across the ring and out of your way as you hit them on your way down. Yup.Further issues include the targeting/locking system or whatever. Multiple people in the ring? Wanna switch targets? Well, by default, 'smart' targeting is on, which is hilarious as it basically means you can't switch targets. So you decide to turn it on manual switching... awesome, do it mid match, that's cool. Next match, however, it's back to default. So you change it outside battle, that's a pretty obvious fix, right? Only if you actually think that the targeting switching actually works. Guess what, half the time it doesn't. Woo!Then there's the graphics, oh man, they're interesting. It's very very obvious which ""superstars"" (still cracks me the hell up that WWE insists that all it's wrestlers, oh wait, can't call them that, are superstars), they spent the most time on. Most of the models for the incredibly lacking NXT roster are outright garbage. On top of that, any mid-carder, jobber, or female wrestler also look like they were made in a weekend. And that's not even mentioning what they did to poor Rene Young and her teeth. Good god almighty, she should sue.However, this is the biggest budget WWE game of all time supposedly, which isn't really a surprise, it just points to the fact that 2K games and the WWE don't take their fans or customers very seriously, and that the annual release schedule is untenable and leaves everybody with an unfinished/unpolished product. Hence why I said it's not worth the 50 bucks. I'm still going to give a 'yes' as to whether or not I'd recommend this game, but with a few caveats:1). Buy it on sale, preferably at 50% or more off.2). You need to like buggy games. Some of us find the bugs funny, so yes, that's a legit bullet point, if you don't like them, don't buy it.3). You probably need to like the WWE, a lot. Even if you liked the old WWF and WCW games that were actually great back in the day, and you want to play a modern version, this isn't it. Those games are still more fun, I just wish they had an updated roster and graphics.4). You need to have a high tolerance for repetitive and awful dialog. Michael Cole and JBL are involved so... yeah, and Renee Young's entire voice part is pretty much to say ""and there you have it, back to you Michael Cole"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I tried liking this, as I got it in a Humble Monthy Bundle, but it's just not fun. I enjoy/enjoyed wrestling when I was younger, and I remember the crazy and fun days of N64 and Gamecube wrestling games (both WCW and WWF/E). The fights there were simple and enjoyable; they were fast-paced and actually fun.If this is your first time trying a newer WWE wrestling game, this might not be what you're looking for if you're longing for the games of your past.The things I dislike about this aren't really the characters, graphics, or the fact that the audience still looks like creepy dolls, it's that the game isn't simple at all. There are mini-games for almost everything that suck the fun out of it very quickly--and they're not fun, chaotic mini-games, like mashing a button. The game is all about timing, and you can lose in under a minute if you're not perfect at it.Also, the load times are bad, especially in Create-A-Character, but I can look past that.Sure, some people like the game, but to me, it's too unnecessarily like a giant Quick Time Event.

												The game is filled with crashes and many bugs. This is mainly evident when playing career or universe mode (The cutscenes in universe are a mess). Had to reinstall the game multiple times due to the game not starting. I would not recommend this game. There is no hope of fixing the issues with the game because support from developers ended a long time ago and they are no longer releasing patches to fix the current problems. The only positives I can think of is the large roster (I believe it is the largest in wwe games history) and the first few times you play it can be fun and challenging. But after a while, even legend difficulty is not enough to give you a challenge in matches since you have mastered the game's techniques			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This was my first pre purchase ever and I'm glad I went for it. It's so rare at this age of time  to be able to play a game smoothly at launch for PC...Honestly 2K15 seemed like a demo to 2K16. 2K16 is the real deal. Even if you're not a WWE fan, but are a fan of general wrestling you must buy it. I pity those who will ignore this game due to awkwardly stupid reasons.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												slow action + cluncky movement = no funweres the fun? its all timeing and waiting thats not how a weaslting game should be, feels like i'm playing some kinda quick time event in another cruddy game. i do like the reversal bar but thats really it. so far i'm not impressed. now if you will excuse me i'm gunna go play some WcW vs NWO on my N64. (becouse i have more fun XD)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
