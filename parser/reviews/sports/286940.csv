												Never played this game but steam say that I actually did so instead of judging the game here's a cool way to make skinny guacamoles with homemade baked tortilla chips :Skinny Guacamole:2 medium green sweet peppers2 medium fresh poblano chile peppers1 bulb garlic1/2 teaspoon olive oil2 roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped1 serrano pepper, minced2 medium ripe avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and diced1 teaspoon lime zest2 tablespoons lime juice1/2 teaspoon saltBaked Tortilla Chips:Corn tortillasOlive oil spraySaltFor the guacamole:Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan with foil; set aside. Quarter, stem, and seed the peppers. Place pepper quarters, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose. Place foil packet on the pan with the peppers.Roast peppers and garlic for 20 to 30 minutes or until pepper skins are charred and garlic cloves feel soft. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.In a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.In a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Gently toss to combine.Serve immediately or cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill for up to 1 hour.For the chips:Cut corn tortillas into wedges and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and season with salt, to taste.Bake in a 350° F oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden brown.			",145,18,14,6,11,2,8

												I have played FPS games for many years, and still belong to an online clan, and we have a lot of fun.This game is good to a degree, but that is where it stops.If you know Gameforge you will know they own Tera the MMO a game that is amazing, but they decided to just screw the whole game up IMO they should have left it as it was , they also do loads of mobile games, so alot of there money comes from that also.Sadly it is the same with this it is a huge money making machine.Dont get me wrong companies have to make money we all know that, but it's the way it is done.lets shorten this OK, so pro's first.Pro's: 1) Very much like C,O.D. 2) Maps are not huge which is nice, so a real good run, and gun.3) Have your TDM, explosive, also Hero which is an alien type, and manhunt, also party for funshoot the glass and c who wins :).Sniper mode is in ther e as well, as is HC to a degree.4) Nice selection of guns, all with different sounds.5)good graphics, and fluid gameplay.Cons:1) You have to repair your guns which cost you ingame money, or you can pay £10 for 30days, and they will give you 2 nice chrome ones which you dont have to repair, but all others you buy you will have to repair :(.2) Camo you have to buy with real money, parts of uniforms again will cost you real money.It so SAD, as most of the stuff only last for 1day, 7 days, or 30 days.3) If you want to be a woman it will cost you nearly £50, and outfit called Black mamba.Gameforge should be done for being sexist, just for this.4)There are only two HC maps in the game, and I love playing HC, so this is a real let down, all maps should have been HC, it's a pain trying to kill someone witth a whole clip sometimes in soft core mode.5) Smoke grenade will cost you 2000 sp (ingame money) or pay with real money which will cost you £5 !!!!, flame grenade's are the same as well.6)The killcam is way off, and they should fix it, as most times it looks, as tho they have not hit you.7) bullet penetration has not been done well at all, fire at someone, and chances are he will turn, and just kill you, as tho you have not hit him at all.8) in COD you can play around with sights atc on the guns, but in this you cannot.If a gun comes with a sight you are stuck with it.9) There does not seem to be any mode for guns like single fire, and full like in COD.10) Info given on guns is useless just give damage accuracy, but would be nice of them to let us know about auto snipersetc.There is a load more wrong with this game not just the money machine.All I can say is try it for a while, and make your own mind up.I paid £10 for a month just to see the differnce between F2P, and P2W.It seems that if you pay all your weapons get + 5% more firepower, and -5% recoil which does make a differnce, and in my book is wrong of the company to do this.

												Before reading this review please check that I do have 2k hours playing it.This game suffers a lot from their publisher, Gameforge. As it is they milk their community as they can.Every month Cash only weapons are added to the lotery ( capsules) which are significantly better than the ""free"" (ingame currency) versions.These are capsules that used to have a 100 capsules accumulation limit. Once you spent about 50 euros (!) you were sure that that weapon would be yours. Now they remove it - you can actually spend hundreds of euros without having a item that you want.They charge you 75 euros for a +100% exp char 25 euros for a lucky point Tshirt or zombie mask to help you getting extra exp to level up. Yes your heard right.One could think that with all that money they would have a good game. But no.The sheer amount of hackers is insane. I did last week clanwars (cw's) where i couldnt find another clan without hacks. Many have their cheats hidden and once they start loosing the war they start killing you from their spawn or behind walls.The cheating sites actually have happyhours for this game where they offer the cheats for free for the weekend.Why?Because gameforge insist on using Xigncode who anyone in this community know is a very bad anticheat. They also refused to implement VAC as their anticheat,even tho XIGNCODE is beeing replaced everywhere in any game due to be so easy to bypass.Everytime they make a maintenance no one knows when the servers will be back up - that's how competents and professionals they are.10/10 Is beeing runned by money hungry people with absolut no respect for their gaming community.

												Hackers. (Saw a guy cheating on Monday, same guy came three days later and was doing the same thing; which means he didn't get banned or punished in any form or fashion)Not noob friendly. (♥♥♥♥♥♥ match-making, most hackers are in the low level servers as well)P2W (Pay to win) trash of a game. (at its current state)Installed it a few times over the years, every time ended up uninstalling and forgetting about it few minutes after. There are a lot of better games out there, and a lot of people are noticing that (player base dropping rapidly)Can't recommend it untill the DEVs make some changes (which they won't cause they're hungry for that sweet $$)Just skip this one and browse the Store for something else.P.S- I've played this game outside of Steam for many hours, don't look at the play time on here when judging my review.This is my opinion, respect it and don't talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about it.

												I'll go over the advertising to clarify:>>Over 20 maps covering a wide range of locales, spanning everything from deserts through to winter landscapes. True, but every one of these maps is tiny and you'll spawn facing the enemy team, so most of the time, you'll live 10 seconds at best. The map design is by far the worst point of this garbage game.>>Cool weapons to suit every playing style – from pistols through to heavy machine guns. If it weren't for the terrible gun handling, that might be interesting. But the game is mostly spray & pray.>>A plethora of options to change the appearance of your character and weapons. If you got a bucket load of money, that is. Also, items directly influence combat and 75%  of the store has a premium sign.What they don't tell you is:a) horribly outdated graphics. UE3 can do much better.b) really bad client. You'll get popups asking yes or no without knowing what for, the menu is cluttered and it will pop in and out as it sees fitting.c) ZERO feedback. Could be a grenade, could be a giraffe, you don't get a difference. Also, people will gun you down randomly while sprinting because bullets just find their own way of travelling, no need for ballistic physics.If you really MUST play this, just use the pile of credits you get from the start, buy the M14 and shoot people straight, you can get 3-4 kills in a row just spamming the trigger. After than, you're not getting much credits so at least this 30 minutes will be fun.I have now seen the ""unique hero mode"". It's a blunt and trashy MOBA mode with so many problems a list wouldn't even fit in here. The number one issue in MOBAs are people leaving. Actual MOBA games tackle this issue with massive punishments for leaving. This game offers premium to prevent this punishment. Nuff said.			",173,17,3,22,19,0,37

												Skill SF2 is a P2A (Pay to Aim) FPS game which is also full of hackers and tocix players (like in any other FPS game).Most hackers will claim they are ESL players and most Clans in-game are filled with any kind of hack. Anti-hack shield is a joke which will most likely detect your TS client as a forbidden program and shut down the game, maybe block the game from starting again. (True story, i had to contact the Korean team that developed the shield and get no result of course!). It is not a game to play and have fun with random people, BUT it is a game to play and have fun with friends! You don't have to pay to play it...you just pay to aim or tog et EXP - SP faster. Overall it is another Gameforge game (surprised it is still online), that has close to no possibility of evolving and the swarms of hackers will continue to pollute the game for at least 10 more years, until the game goes offline or changes ""hands"".P.S. Don't count my hours on steam for this game. I was a Closed Beta player (August 2013), spent way too much time in game creating new accounts to play on the low levels cause on high levels everything was ""instant"". Too bad steam does not allow you to create multi accounts in Skill :(			",50,5,3,1,1,0,11

												All in all a decent FPS - 7/10If you're looking for a F2P FPS, definitely consider giving this game a go.At first I thought it was another one of those CrossFire/Combat Arms games; you know the ones, where you pay a stupid amount of money to RENT a gun for like 3 days? This IS one of those games - there is gun renting, HOWEVER.The prices for permanent weapons or accesories are very very reasonable. As soon as you start playing, you'll have enough (30 000) SP (game currency, not real money) to buy a permanent weapon and should be able to scrap enough for another by the time you reach 6. Most weapons are between 15 000 to 30 000. I, personally, got an MG, for the insane ROF and DMG, and surprisingly low recoil. Well, that and I absolutely love to see people cry over the MG every single time you kill them.I have no problems with the graphics (even though the menu is sort of low quality). I remember camping in this small shed, covering this teammate who was sniping. I was looking in his direction, standing by him, when all of a sudden his head blows up, covering my screen completely with blood for 5 seconds or so. Instantly contracted PTSD. This is, of course, praising and not scolding.Every day or so, you can get a free item (pick 1 card out of 3, get a random item that increases your stats such as speed, armor or even cash gained) for anything between 24 hours to 7 days.I was surprised by the amount of Game Modes the game has. Other than the classic TDM, S&D, FFA and Domination Game Modes, there's the Hero one (basically a MOBA, pretty unique but didn't really get the hang of it), Convoy (basically Payload (with a twist?)), PvE Zombie Survival, Manhunt (one side weird mutants, other soldiers), good old Hardcore, the fun-packed Party and many more.Is it a P2W? Well, not really.You can become a VIP for 30 days for 99 Cash (another IG currency, 60 Cash is 5 dollars...), which lets you get SP and EXP much faster (though you can just buy boosts for less Cash), 2 chrome skin weapons with 5% more fire power, and 5% less recoil, and instant respawning. You be the judge if that's P2W, obviously is not for me. You can also buy other skins for Cash (roughly 35 Cash for 30 days of.. skin time?), which are purely cosmetic and do not give you any advantages over other non-skin players and characters which give you more EXP and SP while playing with them, ranging anywhere between 49 and even 999 Cash!tl;drPROS  fun gunplay decent graphics rather cheap permanent weapons loads of game modes F2P, not P2W barely any hackers has a (good?) tutorial and a map where you can spawn your own bots rookie servers where you can play with other beginners, though not for long as you can only stay there as long as your K/D is under 1.2, or until you're Sergeant Major (20+ Rank)CONS  every time I launch the game, I must rush into the tutorial or a normal game, because my FPS launches up into a thousand, despite having V-Sync on. Entering a game fixes it really weird low-quality menu, despite the game looking decent gun and accessory rentingWill update if I come across anything else I like/dislike about the game.

												S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2Rate: 5/10Pretty good game with a solid gameplay and alot of guns. The maps are great and for sniper lovers it's good.Now why do I give a even rate for this game despite it's great potential.This is f2p game and as we know, when a game is consider a f2p it needs some kind of store or real money strategy to actually gain some income. So as I suspected and my knowledge from previous f2p FPS games, this game includes a store for purchasing weapons and skins. But there is one thing that ruins this game, for me at least, S.K.I.L.L. has a VIP system that is based on a leveling process that when you buy VIP, everyday you will get points depending on the duration of your VIP and then your VIP level will increase and will decrease when you don't have VIP.Now you say well thats great, you get stuff unlocked from the store that is VIP restricted and also some pretty usefull bonuses. Well thats what makes this game fall in to the p2w category. The bonus you get from the VIP are bonus damage and recoil reduction, I believe it around 5% at least at level 1 VIP. The weapons are stronger than the normal weapons, the ones you buy with SP and VIP weapons don't need to be repaired.Also you don't get SP(in-game money) for every match that you win or lose, you will get a small percentage to fill up a bar and when it reaches to 100% it will give you a set amount of SP, but by the time you get another 100% you need to repair your weapons and reaparing weapons is really expensive, so basically you are stuck with low SP for a long time. So my advise is to at least give it a try and if you have money to spare and waste in this game, go on you will get a pretty decent content with VIP. Overall this game is p2w and for me it's a NO.

												It's a decent game if you fancy a free to play shooter. But it also lacks a lot.I hoped it would be a bit like Arctic Combat, and in some way it does. But the game has to many issues and hackers.For example: When you get killed by a sniper and watch the killcam you can see the shot like a meter next to you and still youre dead..Also the holosight is so ugly, it covers your entire screen..They need to fix  a lot in the game.On the + side it has a clanwar channel system. Which i love. IF anyone knows a game that has that aswell please notify me.But for new players looking for a nice basic F2P shooter i would say: Warface.			",111,9,9,8,23,2,10

												I know most MMOFPS are pay 2 win, and I've played lots of them, but only in this game that p2w factor made me quit after 2 hours of playing. The game itself has amazing graphics, the controls feel good, etc...The thing that made me quit is, other games are p2w, but you don't feel that $$ only weapons are that overpowered, it's still manageable to win vs a guy that has $$ items using regular in-game money items. But what happened to me in all, and I repeat, all, the matches over this time is that my UMP and my M4 that I bought with my in game money, took 20/30 bullets to kill a guy, hitting his chest, then I die, check the killcam, and see a fancy gun, that can only be bought for cash, kill me with 5 shots to my feet. This repeats, all over again, with minor variations. It got so ridiculous to the point where a enemy is afk on spawn, I let this spawnprotection expire, aim at his head, fire 15 bullets, get hitmarkers in all, and he still stands alive. Overall, this game would be strongly recommended if it wasn't for this so heavy p2w factor, but still, if you are a kid that wants graphics in a game, and doesn't mid getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hard by a bunch of guys that paid for a fancy weapon, this is the game for you!

												First of all, I have played this game since the beta (about 1k hours in total) so ignore my steam hours.This game is really good for a free FPS, it's really fast paced and lots of fun.I started playing this after my AVA career which lasted for 3 or 4 years, until the game died completely. This game was a lot different so it took some time to learn all the tricks and stuff like that, but once I kinda learned how to play it, it became so much fun. This game has all the game modes you need for a FPS game; Team Deathmatch, Free-For-All, Demolition/Blasting (Plant bomb/Defuse bomb) and couple of others like Snowball fight, Hexa (Fighting in a glass arena) and Seizure, which is basically Capture the Flag.I personally don't play too much TDM, FFA or Seizure, or any other ''casual'' game modes, I mainly focus on the Blasting because it's played on the tournaments and is the most competitive mode.TDM is good tho, for training aim and such.Seizure is just some casual fun.FFA is same thing as TDM, but without a team.Weapons in this game are pretty balanced, but there is some exceptions. Some of the SMGs are really trash, you can't do anything with their short range and bad accuracy.All rifles are usable, but there are few rifles picked up by the pros that are considered the best ones in the game (When I was playing this game in ESL tournaments, the best rifles were HK417, M4A1, K2 and Famas).Snipers are really powerful in this game, there are few snipers in the game, but only 3 of them are used by the pros, CheyTac M200, AWP and CZ 700. These are all bolt action snipers, and the semi-autos are pretty useless.This game also has a capsule shop, where you can try to win some overpowered guns with real money. They are pretty good in public games, and casual players seem to fancy them for their good accuracy and damage. But they are banned in the ESL league, so if you want to be good in this game, just don't bother trying to win those guns and learn to use the basic weapons.Community in this game is pretty much the same as in every other FPS game. There are some annoying people and some really great people. You will get called a noob/hacker/cheater/macro/lucker countless times in public games, so just deal with it. In the competitive scene players are respectful and really cool guys in general, so if you can't handle the kids in public games, create a team and start scrimming with other teams.And for those who want to join the competitive scene, ESL is hosting GO4Skill cup every weekend. So just pull together a team, and join.Overall I would give this game a 9/10, it is a really good free FPS game, and has potential to become really big.Had a lot fun in tournaments, so thanks for that to everyone in the scene.

												Let me tell you this now; I got at least 15 min of fun from this despite it being... well itself I guess you could say...While this game is free I prefered the 10 minutes of watching youtube while it was downloading than actually playing the game. When I first started the game I was instantly bombarded with notifications of item recieved, while thats not particularly bad seeing as it is more free stuff I was instantly confused. From why the game was bordered and there was no option to make it fullscreen along with the descriptions of the menu options just flashed, as it almost instantaneously stopped and it took me a second of exploring to tell what was going on. I rather liked how most cosmetic options I liked was purchasable with the in game currency which I was given over 30,000 of in the start I'm assuming which is for a weapon purchase. When messing with the options I found that the preview for the maximum graphics looked pretty good, I then got in game and found that it looked utterly terrible when compared to what I was expecting. I then proceded to get one-shot multiple times from a sniper rifle with some of them shooting two feet behind me and hitting but ended up winning with a positive K/D ratio feeling rather disappointed and decided to try a different game mode. To my surprise I got put into a payload type mode and enjoyed the first half; then it turned into sniper central getting one-shot left and right proceeding to pick one up off an enemy and going on a 5 killstreak before getting oneshot again.Overall I was going into this without much expectation and came out with even less. I would not recommend playing this unless you are absolutly bored and have nothing better to do.			",100,10,0,20,2,0,1

												Nice remake of Soldier Front (it's the same DragonFly series)The game isn't really "" Pay to win ""It still requires 'skill' to get kills. Tho some paid stuff (tomahawk, hammers) can be useful sometimes.You can compare the game the most with ""Soldier Front 2"" from Aeriagames.The big difference with these other versions is the support. GameForge has enough staff to keep this game up to date, respond to your tickets in less than 24 hours etc.GameForge also updates the game on regular basis: meaning new maps, modes, guns etc.This makes the game more dynamic than eg. CoD.Even tho it's a F2P game and there are many things you can buy in-game, GameForge tries to keep the game reasonable for non-paying users. By leveling up and unlocking achievements you earn enough in-game money to buy you a nice arsenal of guns.For more screenshots / gamemodes / guns / info visit https://skill.gameforge.comYou'll also find the GameForge launcher there## DOWNLOADING THE GAMEBenefits of downloading the game via steam+ faster than via GF servers+ automatic updates (if enabled in your client)+ steam in-game overlay so you can browse facebook/google stuff while you're dead ;)Downside of downloading the game via steam- you can't (yet) login to your GameForge accountps: I've played both SF1, SF2 and SKILL. I have a couple thousand hours on record.			",119,13,4,9,1,2,11

												I  personally hate reading long reviews so im gonna keep it short (last part was kinda what my dad said)  well its free and makes fun. The graphics are on a pretty high level and the game mechanics are goodThe anoying things about S.K.I.L.L  are that there are those dots in between the letters skill and all those kiddies buying expensive vip stuff (skins, grenades, weapons). Its not pay to win (you can still wreck them with a little bit of shooter experience) but it still sucks seeing all those shiny skins and guns no beeing able to buy them.			",46,1,14,0,11,0,0

												I've been playing this game for quite some time now (I used to play it before it was on steam). Although the game has its disadvantages, it still truly is a remarkable FREE to play game. I capitalise 'FREE' because everyone expects the game to be 100% perfect. The 'Hero Mode' pretty much makes the game. It's really fun to play with a coordinated team. It's pretty much League of Legends but in first person... and with pimp guns!Q: Are there hackers in the game:A: Yes there are hackers BUT they're not frequent. Everyone is friendly and contributes to the ban/kick of the hacker. Q: Is this game Pay2Win?A: Although many people claim it is Pay2Win, It really isn't haha. Every 'paid' weapon is exactly the same as every normal weapon except it may have a shiny texture e.g. Gold or Chrome. These guns don't have any advantage over the normal ones. They are simply there for 'bling'. Character models may give you an XP and SP increase but you get what you pay for, right?. Pay2Win Level: 2/10. (I give it a two only because I like the cool looking guns and wish I had them)One problem that annoys me: It's quite hard to find people who talk english. If you talk english or understand feel free to add me in-game (AlmightyPear). I'm assembling a team.Note: Don't play this game for like 2-5 hours and start complaining. Practice is needed.

												This game is basically a pay-to-win, don't even think it's fair.But the satisfaction of owning a pay-to-win guy is out of this world.It's not impossible to beat a pay-to-win guy, it's just they have some speed advantages and some cool features. Nothing more.The mechanism feels lacking, but over-all this game is much fun.Clan Wars like no tomorrow.It's a decent game.But no matter what I say, don't forget that this game is FREE.It's fun fun fun, and if you find yourself liking it invest in some stuff.

												I'm very conflicted. Pros: it's kind of like 'CoD for poor people'. Where I think this game has an advantage over CoD is there's no 'stupid deaths' so to speak. EI you're not gonna get killed by some stupid bout of luck like a claymore or a killstreak. It's pretty bare bones.Cons: really made me question if I wanted to recommend this game, but it's got the stupid typical korean p2w crap attached to it. The VIP is just...idk how to word it without just saying it's the stupidest ****. VIP gives you camos which increase your weapon damage and reduce recoil by 5%. But that's not all! it also allows you to spawn instantly...like really? Then this games got a super low population and they're gonna have this VIP crap in their game...their game may have been dying prior to this, but sure as hell adding the VIP crap isn't gonna make people wanna stay it's gonna kill your game that much faster. Two other lesser cons is there's a big lack of customization, not a lot of weapon choices, and I was really hoping for the cool cat gun I saw on youtube. Then lastly which also is a bit of a fun killer...some weapons are way over tuned. I've been using the...m16 I believe. 1 burst kills most I think that's a little redic. random tip: play on the EU. US is completely dead.Edit: at the moment it would seem the EU servers either got merged with the US or just got shut down. Any time I attempt login via EU it says the game isn't available in my region. I thought maybe a region lock was placed, but wouldn't let me on even with a VPN.			",42,1,0,7,0,0,1

												With a couple of exceptions, Gameforge's games line-up is all about fantasy titles, however the publisher took a distance from their usual environment by offering you a brutal and competitive military-themed online FPS: S.K.I.L.L.S. - Special Force 2. With a lot of well established free MMOFPS out there, offering something capable to stand out and gather a consistent pool of players is certainly a tough challenge; and of course we couldn't miss the chance to see what Gameforge managed to do in a field that for them is totally new and unexplored, so follow us in this review and check out if the game is worth trying or not!The first impression upon entering into the game is somewhat both good and bad. It is good because everything is kind of familiar if you've ever played any other f2p MMOFPS, and you will basically know how to play and navigate in the different menus, but at the same time you will probably feel a sense of déjà vu as the developers' intention clearly wasn't to innovate or change the genre, but to offer their personal interpretation of a well-known and working formula. Speaking about menus, after the log-in you will be brought to a pretty standard home screen containing all the classic tabs that you would expect from a game like this: capsule market, shop, inventory, mini-game, career and clan. While shop, inventory and clan are pretty much self explanatory, the others may need a word or two about them. The capsule market is a place where you can buy different kinds of sealed boxes which contain a random item and give you the chance to obtain special and unique gear pieces. However, most of them are temporary, and you could end up with an item that you don't need at all, so choose wisely if it's worth to gamble or not. Regarding the mini-game tab, don't be too excited; the game offers some interesting and unique game modes, but in this tab the only thing you will find is only a free training mode where you can spawn dummies and do other stuff in order to get confident with controls and mechanics. In the career tab you can find all the information and statistics about your in-game performance and more. The game features a shop that offers a wide selection of digital reproductions of real firearms, which are usually available for both cash and in-game currency. Of course there are unique VIP weapons which are only available to VIP players, but from what I could see the differences are mainly cosmetic and intended to let you show off your VIP status. One thing that I appreciated a lot is the possibility to buy permanent weapons. They still need to be repaired, but this is a whole different thing compared to a lot of other free MMOFPS where you can only buy temporary weapons and you are forced to constantly play the game in order to buy them again when they expire. With this system, on the other hand, you can buy a new weapon, take a break from the game for some time and then come back without the fear of having wasted your precious weapon. The control system is standard and identical to almost every other modern FPS. However, I have to say that the jump feels a little strange. There are a lot of objects in the arena that seems to be there just to be climbed and that are not very tall, but you can't actually jump on them. As I said it's a little strange and sometimes kind of frustrating, but it is absolutely not a game-breaker. However, the point where the S.K.I.L.L . - Special Force 2 gameplay tries to differentiate itself from the masses, is probably the featured game modes: Deathmatch,Team Deathmatch, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Manhunt, Glass, Hero, Sniper battle...there's a lot of them.Speaking about graphics, S.K.I.L.L. feels like a raw gem; they are not bad, instead, they are actually pretty good, but they just can't stand comparison with the latest free-to-play online FPS. S.K.I.L.L.'s graphics, while clean and enjoyable, lack in details and this makes the maps' design to look a little empty and too simple. The same deal goes with the sounds; they are not bad, but I think that the developers could have made a way better job with just a little more effort. The steps sounds are often a little unnatural, while the shooting and weapons sounds are average.S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes.

												All those comments about pay 2 win? They're not joking.TL;DR: Don't play unless you want to sink money into the game.I loved the fast paced environment and it felt pretty satisfying to kill people... provided they hadn't bought a gun better and get you first.  I played Seize first, and that was pretty fun although I'm not a fan of round based gamemodes. I leveled up twice and was super pumped to see the little amount of ""SP"" I won. I was disappointed to go back to the lobby and see I got nothing. What??? I understand most free to play games are not very generous to non-VIP/pay-to-get-a-membership but usually you get something. Okay...I tried the AI-bot gamemode next, that was awesome. Being able to get multiple double kills - SWEET! However, it wasn't hard because the map was basically a hall way and you could really only funnel out of one area making spawn killing just way too easy and unfair. Again. out of the lobby... I did get a little option to pick something. However, it was only an item you get for X amount of days. Boring. Again, no SP. Since the game mostly revolves around SP and having an INSANE amount for benefits (10,000+) or buying cash for cool items, I don't really want to continue playing when I can only play two gamemodes (the rest didn't have anyone playing, probably for this reason). Disappointing, but not the worst game in the world. You're better off to sink money into something more rewarding, in my opinion.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is free to play but not pay to win, and that automatically makes the game so much better than any others that indirectly force you to spend money to actually have fun. If you are really keen on spending money, you can buy some capsules that give you some good weapons, or buy V.I.P. to look so 1337 compared to your teammates with a coloured name and background.Beware, as there are hackers in public servers, but these can be kicked out of the game easily. What you'll encounter frequently is players using macros, which do the double-Q motion automatically while using snipers. Please, don't be one of these idiots.Like most games, this is more fun while played with friends. Specially the Hero mode, which is basically League of Legends in first-person perspective with shooter elements and Survival, which is PvE and consists of you and your team surviving waves of monsters. Regarding the Hero mode, I did compare it with LoL, but the thing is: I have played LoL and hated it, the whole MOBA aspect doesn't appeal to me, but playing a strategic MOBA-like game in first person shooter is so fun, and I congratulate the S.K.I.L.L. devs for adding this in.Other game modes: Glass, Seizure (i.e. CTF), Escape, Single (i.e. free-for-all DM), Defense (Survival with difficulties) and Manhunt (kind of like a PvP zombie mode, but against alien-ish creatures). There are also the classic FPS game modes: Team Deathmatch, Sniper - Point Battle (TDM with only snipers) and Blasting (bomb planting/defusing). As you can see, it has tons of game modes to satisfy a wide range of tastes.There's also an active competitive S.K.I.L.L.[play.eslgaming.com] scene, but I can't dwell much into that as I'm not part of it.The graphics are pretty good and you can configure them to your own liking. I don't care much for eye candy in first person shooters so I play in low graphics and get around 300 FPS. Oh, and this game doesn't require you to have a top of the line gaming PC. The recommended specs are 2 GB of RAM, a Core2 Duo E6600 or comparable and GeForce 8600 GT or higher. You can probably even play with a worse PC than that, but seriously, it's the second decade of the 21th century, you should already have a computer that's way more powerful than that. >tl;dr: very good free-to-play FPS. Downsides are some hackers and macro users, upsides are good graphics, gameplay and fun game modes. ",519,182,22,101,79,14,95

												Having played this game for dozens of hours via the Gameforge client, I now feel experienced enough to give you a rough overview over the game.BASICSSKILL is a PvP online shooter though also features several PvE modes; the game covers most standard game modes like Blasting (arming/disarming a bomb), Seizure (stealing an object) and Escape as well as the standard TeamDeathMatch. For those SKILL offers several dozen maps with different layouts, from small arenas like Hangar to slightly more open ones like Russian Factory. It’s worth keeping in mind, however, that the maps in general are not too big, though usually offering multiple paths and a good mix of open and more linear parts. In addition you can participate in some so called party-modes which involve playing in arenas made of breakable glass floors or jumping over obstacles.For everyone interested in coop-focused action there’re PvE modes against aliens and zombies as well as a moba-style mode with spawning alien bots as well as a leveling-up system.TECHNICAL STUFFOn the technical side the game is solid, with nice sound effects and weapon models though overall slightly dated graphics; when being in a tense multiplayer match, you probably won’t notice this too much though. It has to be said, however, that the game suffers from some performance troubles due a not really perfect optimisation which seem to have gotten worse over time. You may also encounter some connection problems from time to time which seem to appear out of nowhere but usually disappear as miraculously as they appeared.And yes, as in most F2P games you will also find hackers here in SKILL. Most of the time their numbers are rather low with the exception of some rare “hacker-waves”. While public matches are mostly fine, they seem to be a more common annoyance in clan matches.CLANS&TOURNAMENTSRegarding clans and eSports in general: The game features a built-in matchmaking system for clans as well as special channels for them, while the public matches are separate. Gameforge recently announced the end of the eSports leagues due to a lack of active players there, though maintaining the so called Go4Skill cup with money prizes as well as sponsoring community-organised tournaments.SHOPOf course you will find a lot of equipment items like hats, gloves, t-shirts etc in the ingame shop as it’s common for F2P games. The basic items are available for the normal currency SP which you can earn, more advanced ones which usually give you a money and experience boost have to be bought with Cash, the premium currency. This includes character skins which completely change your whole appearance as well as boosters, weapon camos etc.Talking about weapon: SKILL features a large amount of non-customizable weapons for every playstyle – all available for SP. You can set-up up to three different loadouts you can switch between during a match, consisting of one main gun, sidearm and special weapon (like throwing axes, bows, …) plus 3 different grenades. There’re, however, a couple of advanced weapons with shinier camos and attachments like better scopes which can only be obtained via the so called capsule market.Here you have to buy capsules with Cash to get a chance of winning one of those special guns. It’s pretty much a luck-based system though even if the capsule doesn’t drop the wanted weapon, you still get another item, camo or some SP.The capsule weapons have a slight stat-boost over their normal brethren, though it’s too small to make any difference in the game. The game still is true to it’s name and very much dependant on SKILL. It has to be said though, that there’re slightly troubling tendencies, with the last update introducing a gun with heavily improved stats for roughly three-times the price of the normal capsules. Let’s hope they don’t continue this road.MISCELLANEOUSIn more or less regular intervals new events are activated in the game. They usually last for only 2 or 3 weeks and aren’t really creative; the prizes are okay and can get you a temporary version of those precious capsule guns or the premium skins.Overall the update policy currently is a little bit weird, with a large break between the last two updates. It also has to be said that most updates only contain new content like maps, weapons, skins etc and only rarely additional features. Looking at the amount of requests and suggestions by the community since the launch in 2013 it seems like the developers are not really interested in adding new features, tweaks or fixing things.The VIP system which basically is some kind of subscription model currently offers a boost to your EXP and SP as well as access to a couple of silver or gold weapons which have the advantage of not having to be repaired. There’re some other, minor extras (special emblems, reduced quick-spawn costs, …) but overall it currently isn’t very attractive thing to invest in except right at the start of the game, where you’re more likely in money-troubles and can use the VIP-system to avoid repair-costs.SUMMARYSKILL definitely isn’t the holy grail of multiplayer shooters though it’s definitely a solid game with which you can have fun for a couple of hours, even more probably in a clan. Fortunately the game so far stayed away from the dark path of P2W, though as mentioned recent changes are troubling, especially combined with the slow updates.If you’re looking for a free, fast and simple PvP shooter or some horde-mode PvE action why not give this game a try – you most probably will spend some fun hours with it, there’re worse alternatives on the market right now ;)For some gameplay, check out my video review:

												If you want a free version of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Call of Duty, this might be what you're looking for.This game is littered with ""rent this weapon"" and other meanings to get your money.The gameplay is boring and the gunplay is dull. It's basically ""spray and pray"" with any weapon.I wouldn't expect anything else because it's free to play.			",206,11,20,14,14,1,10

												I had high hopes for this game, but it failed for me. Bad. I know some people love this game, although it's not for me, it's a pay-to-win game. Either you grind for the in-game money or pay alot of money for a small amount. I personally dislike this game, to be fair it has awesome graphics and decent gameplay. I know what you thinking, I only have 30 minutes of gameplay but I saw enough in those 30 minutes, you have to buy guns to use in the game. The Pros and Cons will follow. Pros  1. Decent gameplay2. Great graphics3. ""Free"" Cons 1. Mirco-transactions everywhere (I know it's Free)2. Small Maps3. Werid gameplay mechanicsPrepare for war; bring your gun, your buddys, and most importantly your wallet. Thanks so much for reading.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Special Force 2 is an easy for everyone FPS game because of it's very familiarformula of navigation and gameplay.This game has a very good feature that i liked the most from other FPS gameswhich wasn't other than the weapon shop buying feature which allow you to buyweapons for permanent use and not for temporary use which sadly forced you to buy them over and over when they expired.The grachics are very well balanced and the gameplay is standard and identical to almostevery other modern FPS.Another positive feature is that it contains a huge selection of game modes (TDM, DM, Survival, Defence, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Party modes etc).You also have the ability to create-join with clans and experience head to head wars which is very interesting.The only minor thing i personally didn't like about was that some of the maps felt somewhat low detailed or eigher empty as far as enviroment content, but it could be not a big deal since the game has so much to offer for a free-to-play.Overall, SKILL Special Force 2 is clean and enjoyable with unique and fun game modes and it's the right choice for everyone who looks to have fun and also for the people who look for challenge and hardcore gameplay.I'll give it a score of 9/10.

												With a couple of exceptions, Gameforge's games line-up is all about fantasy titles, however the publisher took a distance from their usual environment by offering you a brutal and competitive military-themed online FPS: S.K.I.L.L.S. - Special Force 2. With a lot of well established free MMOFPS out there, offering something capable to stand out and gather a consistent pool of players is certainly a tough challenge; and of course we couldn't miss the chance to see what Gameforge managed to do in a field that for them is totally new and unexplored, so follow us in this review and check out if the game is worth trying or not!The first impression upon entering into the game is somewhat both good and bad. It is good because everything is kind of familiar if you've ever played any other f2p MMOFPS, and you will basically know how to play and navigate in the different menus, but at the same time you will probably feel a sense of déjà vu as the developers' intention clearly wasn't to innovate or change the genre, but to offer their personal interpretation of a well-known and working formula. Speaking about menus, after the log-in you will be brought to a pretty standard home screen containing all the classic tabs that you would expect from a game like this: capsule market, shop, inventory, mini-game, career and clan. While shop, inventory and clan are pretty much self explanatory, the others may need a word or two about them. The capsule market is a place where you can buy different kinds of sealed boxes which contain a random item and give you the chance to obtain special and unique gear pieces. However, most of them are temporary, and you could end up with an item that you don't need at all, so choose wisely if it's worth to gamble or not. Regarding the mini-game tab, don't be too excited; the game offers some interesting and unique game modes, but in this tab the only thing you will find is only a free training mode where you can spawn dummies and do other stuff in order to get confident with controls and mechanics. In the career tab you can find all the information and statistics about your in-game performance and more. The game features a shop that offers a wide selection of digital reproductions of real firearms, which are usually available for both cash and in-game currency. Of course there are unique VIP weapons which are only available to VIP players, but from what I could see the differences are mainly cosmetic and intended to let you show off your VIP status. One thing that I appreciated a lot is the possibility to buy permanent weapons. They still need to be repaired, but this is a whole different thing compared to a lot of other free MMOFPS where you can only buy temporary weapons and you are forced to constantly play the game in order to buy them again when they expire. With this system, on the other hand, you can buy a new weapon, take a break from the game for some time and then come back without the fear of having wasted your precious weapon. The control system is standard and identical to almost every other modern FPS. However, I have to say that the jump feels a little strange. There are a lot of objects in the arena that seems to be there just to be climbed and that are not very tall, but you can't actually jump on them. As I said it's a little strange and sometimes kind of frustrating, but it is absolutely not a game-breaker. However, the point where the S.K.I.L.L . - Special Force 2 gameplay tries to differentiate itself from the masses, is probably the featured game modes: Deathmatch,Team Deathmatch, Seizure, Escape, Blasting, Manhunt, Glass, Hero, Sniper battle...there's a lot of them.Speaking about graphics, S.K.I.L.L. feels like a raw gem; they are not bad, instead, they are actually pretty good, but they just can't stand comparison with the latest free-to-play online FPS. S.K.I.L.L.'s graphics, while clean and enjoyable, lack in details and this makes the maps' design to look a little empty and too simple. The same deal goes with the sounds; they are not bad, but I think that the developers could have made a way better job with just a little more effort. The steps sounds are often a little unnatural, while the shooting and weapons sounds are average.S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes.

												ENGLISH AND SPANISH! INGLÉS Y ESPAÑOL!It is an awesome game! It is free to play and it has good graphics.The good part of this game is that you dont need a good computer to run it, because my one is a i5 with 8gb of RAM (i mean, it is not the best laptop in the world ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)). It has lots and lots of guns and camos. The only bad thing i find is that you have to buy some clothes, for example, the horse face, instead of being able to buy it with SPs. Anyways, it is so entertaining and fun... You can join a clan, get new weapons, level up your rank, play more than 12 different gamemodes. Only one word for this game: MAGIC!Es un juego fantástico! En serio lo recomiendo 100%! Desde el primer momento en el que lo jugué me quede viciadísimo a él. Además, se mejora de forma muy rápida: ha sido el primer FPS al que juego en PC. Recuerdo que al principio era un poco malo, pero ahora la verdad es que no hay nadie que me pare (por lo menos en el servidor de principiantes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)), y eso que llevo jugando apenas 4 meses. Pero no sólo eso; hay una gran variedad de juegos, personajes, armas, ediciones de armas, clanes y las clásicas cápsulas (como las cajas de CS:GO). Por último, los gráficos son excelentemente buenos para ser de un Free-To-Play, y se puede jugar perfectamente desde un ordenador malo (de 3GB de RAM, por ejemplo).			",37,3,0,3,2,1,2

												Now. What is my reaction... ,, OMG WTF DIS GAEM IS AWESUM 10/10'' but some of people are like OMG MONEY CLEANING MACHINE PLS 0/10. Well. Let me tell you that... this isnt a pay 2 win game. You just need skill, alot of it.I played this game on gamejolt. And i dont know why people hate this game, cause this game is awesome. Still time for pro'sPro's1. The maps are awesome.2. There are alot of fun gamemodes. Like hexagon. (In hexagon you can kill people or make them fall to death, and there are item boxes like in Mario Kart, which is awesome3. Clans, clans, and more clans. This game is filled with awesome clans. You can make a clan, you can do something what i call is cvc. (Clan VS Clan)4. The game feels like crossfire.5. There are no cons.Cons-There are no cons...I rate this game 11/10. Literally.Edit/Update:The game is still awesome, try it if you are bored and you dont know what to play!			",77,9,2,2,5,0,2

												The gameplay is alright but vertical FOV is smaller in widescreen. To maintein such fov, you need to play with 4:3 resolution stretch or you ganna have hard time looking up or down. > FOV is lesser than 90 sadly, more suitable to play it on a TV screen playing it like a console game not PC. (The game is not suitable for everyone, shorten costumer range) > One shot headshot kill no matter what bullet and distance. Guns with high RPM have the most advantage. Eh, SMG anyone? And accurate and low recoil guns too, ""FAMAS anyone?"", make sense with rifle rounds but pistol and SMG rounds on a helmet from afar. > Maybe is a good idea to make all enemy model the same, models depending on the maps. This will nullify ""You use this model so you look slimer noob"".  Or ""I can hit your head easily cause of your blonde wigs""> Anyone with macro (Rapid Click Per Second) have more accuracy and recoil recovery than normal burst or full auto fire players sadly. Need to fix this or everyone gana use macro mouse and play this exploit. > Takes grinding to earn SP without VIP.			",156,18,3,17,12,1,14

												Waste of time.This game only has people running around and hip firing and still manage to kill you, if you watch the Killcam back, they aim nowhere near you and still manage to kill you.The beginning weapons are underpowered and take many shots to kill someone.The killcam shows you a guy shooting at ya and magicaly getting a headshot without even aiming at you, this game makes ZERO sence on that part.So like Soldier Front way back in the day. If you pay, you gain an advantage so this game is sadly also Pay 2 Win. Oh yeah, LOTS of cheaters.			",97,15,2,8,4,0,3

												This game could be an AWSOME free game but ofc it is like all other free gamesIts Pay to win..All the players that are ""VIP"" gets to run faster,make more dmg and get more money and xp.The damage is just a joke, If u get a Headshot the helmet will just fly away and he still has 40hp.A shot in the shoulder with a M4 does 8 dmg 8!!!!You can not even jump on top off a single barrel or find a nice spot.DONT waste time on this game.I think i am gonna wait untill they make this game a bit better...

												The anti-cheat seems to be more fair than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ""VAC"" System that valve use.I personally like this game a bit better than cs:go.Why I like the anti-cheat:No random disconnections. (I'm currently having issues with my internet, thankfully, this game doesn't kick me for it.)Not strict. (no random ban)Less hackers. (the VAC system doesn't really 100% ban ALL hackers.)

S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 is a valid free-to-play shooter which puts a lot of emphasis on community and clans. Even if it's not the best shooter around regarding graphics and sounds, it manages to offer a complete and fun overall gameplay experience and some pretty unique and fun game modes. With its simple graphics and solid mechanics, combined with a fair in-game shop and a complete clan system, the game has the right tools to offer a nice competitive scene for hardcore players and an enjoyable environment for new players as well. If you are a fan of online FPS and want to try something new without going too far away from your usual games, S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2 could be the right choice.			",270,47,11,25,15,1,25

												""Enemy helicopter is start ready.""In a nutshell, SF2 can be described as 'eh'. I played in closed beta a year or so back, maybe somewhere around 10 hours. I can't seem to link my account to Steam and it's forcing me to make a new character which I do not care to do, so I'm sure as hell not going to be using Steam to play it.Special Force 2 is the EU name for Soldier Front 2, the sequel to a Korean FPS made back in 2005, surprisingly named Soldier Front. SF1 had graphics from 2002 and game mechanics from 1995. Seriously. Creating a movement engine that doesn't allow you to go faster running diagonally was one of the first things I learnt as a hobbyist developer (Don't let anyone tell you Pythagoras' theory and trigonometry isn't useful), yet Soldier Front 1 still has this 'feature' well into 2015. I believe SF1 is on Greenlight in some form, but enough about that.The graphics are fine. Not spectacular, but not an eye-sore. The game tries very hard to be Call of Duty, and you can see it in the aesthetics of the HUD (In places they're not even trying to look different), and the gunplay (run and gun, ADS, all of that, you can't really complain about it, unless it's about how cookie-cutter it is). Game modes are your standard affair. 'Single' is deathmatch. Team Deathmatch is, well, team deathmatch. 'Blasting' is your standard Counterstrike bomb defusal mode. In 'Seizure', one team has to capture an item and bring it back to base, the other defends it. Simple enough. I haven't seen the 'Party' mode before, noted as the 'Glass' gamemode ingame, but it just seems to be a♥♥♥♥♥♥around mode probably taken from CS custom map. The real sore thumb is the 'Hero' mode, an FPS MOBA on some 3-laned alien landscape where you try to advance your load of aliens to the enemy base. Use gold earned from killing blows to buy stats and new guns. Cliche FPS mechanics fitted with cookie-cutter MOBA mechanics. Whatever.Soldier Front 1's store returns here in Special Force 2, where you have to repair guns after each use, stat-boosting armor and equipment are timed items, and the coolest stuff is behind luck-based capsules and other paywalls. Unlike the first game however, it seems (I may be wrong) paywall guns aren't utterly broken. The VIP guns are just gold/chrome reskins, perhaps with a sight or something. If you want to pay for that, enjoy,I guess.I haven't given it the greatest look, but without level up rewards and EXP/SP boosters, I think people would run at a loss trying to maintain all of their guns and other equipment. Admittedly I could make a better effort to save money, but already a few hours in they're not just throwing it out anymore.Maybe I will play it on occassion. Even I like a bit of Call of Duty sometimes. And I guess if you want to play Call of Duty without purchasing the latest games over and over again, this would be it.			",177,12,17,10,28,5,37

												Just your generic Korean free to play and pay to win first person shooter.  Most of these games are better being played in one life game modes instead of team deathmatch.  Originally as Soldier Front 2, this game doesn't have much to really live up to besides being somewhat of a Call of Duty clone.  It's an okay game but it can definitely be better but if these developers want to actually want to be relevant, they need to start changing up and bring in new features instead of using the same old feature over and over again.  A lot of these F2P P2W FPS games are dying but it's good though, we got better games like Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played 506 hours on the original game. It is by far one of my favorite games. But the downside of this game is the bad community. There are always a guy who is looking to ruin the game for the others. and then there is these new kids who think that you are hacking only because you can kill them. But all in all this is an amazing game, and if you join a clan you can use some sick tactics to win over the other clans. 8,5 out of 10. (And it would be nice if you added the *change account* option to the game menu)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has many problems, but its still fun for a couple of hours. If you expect an AAA title you are looking at the wrong game tho. The movement and gun handling feels good but the hitbox is just weird sometimes. When you get killed, you see in the killcam that you were already gone and the guy who shot you didnt even aim near you, but still killed you. Sadly thats a common thing. And hackers are also a huge problem, hence its free 2 play.All in all its a about average free to play FPS since it does not look like its just pay2win and build to cash in for the devs. If you love f2p FPS games and you are fed up with your old one, go try this.If you are looking for AAA fps, you might get disappointed.

												Like so many other games its broken in so many sectors... with cheating rampid and lack of ability to report and remove these obvious cheaters is a serious issue.  On top of that the game continues along like every other fps with loads of microtransactions that will give you hugh advantanges against other players in a number of ways.   I find it easier just to start a private room against AI or play the PvE modes.   If you avoid public rooms and play with only friends the game can be quite entertaining, that or have VIP access to remove cheaters quickly without limitations due to not being on a cheaters team or the fact that only 1 report every 24 hours can be made per day even if you run into 10 different cheaters throughout gameplay in a single session.  (Note when I claim cheaters, these are people who can be seen in the kill cam without a weapon in hand at their spawn point killing the other team at their spawn point with nothing but headshots.)All in all, its just like every other FPS with no real change.   Guess the point here is the base engine is so easy to use that any idiot can make this type of FPS and put microtransactions in the game to milk it for as much as you want and ignore the obvious issues that plague FPS shooters.

												Dated looking game that doesn't even have a proper menu.Not worth the time to get into, like almost every other F2P shooter on Steam.Crashed on the cheat detection. Apparently running Chrome or Steam, is cheating.			",223,39,8,17,26,1,57
