								Turn-based football. You have time to think about your every move and feel the full control over your players. I am not FIFA fan, I don't even like football. But the way developers made the game totally won me over - it is a lot like chess (my favorite board game) but with elements of RPG like gaining levels of footballers and gaining skills and tallents for them. Moreover the developers are constantly improving the game to suit player's tastes (players can pick match duration in turns, will players playing on different position get a penalty for it, will there be injuries, how fast footballer's stamina will recover and more) and provide new options and additional content. And if there happens to be a bug from what I've seen they are fast to release a fix for it - usually within hours.I don't know if all the FIFA fans would like this a bit slower and more tactical version but I recommend it to all who like turn-based strategies and RPG-type of games, at least for me it was a fun new experience that may not have as many resource types like in other strategies (fame, money in this case) but is just as fun.

								The game puts you in the shoes of the general manager and coach of an amateur football team. Can you lead them all the way to the premier league? The team managing is interesting; upgrade your staff and stadium, develop your players or sell them you hire better ones. But the main focus of the game is the turn base matches which is surprinsingly addictive and tactical.Football tactics has a lot of depth, it rewards the player for doing their ""homeworks"" before each game. Adapting your formation to your opponent's and using your most relevant players really helps the achieve sucess. That makes for a great stategy game. Still in early access, the game is very stable. I mostly used the beta version and it crashed only once in almost 200 hours of gameplay. Had a few minors bugs that I'm sure will be fixed (some of them already are), but nothing serious or gamebreaking.Recommended for anyone who likes strategy and team management games. Thumbs up Creoteam! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I've been in love with football management sims since the days of One-Nil[www.myabandonware.com]. That's 1992, my friends.I've never enjoyed one as much as this one.This game is simple enough to play that you can jump right in and start playing. And if you want a casual experience, you can play this game like that. Don't think too much about your decisions, just pick what feels right. You can do that and have fun.Or, if you want a more analytical experience, you can take your time over each decision. You can put your roster into a spreadsheet, plan out which players you will develop and which ones you will sell, and when.You can crunch the numbers over the tactical decisions in the match. Do I take a shot from long range with my ACC 52 midfielder against his DEF 67 keeper, or is it better if I try a layoff pass through his center back to my forward, who can then try to score with a rainbow feint? You can do the math and figure out which one has a better chance at a goal--and also think about what position you leave the opponent with if you do not get a goal.In other words, you can play this game hardcore, and try to make the best decisions all the time (even though many of the decisions will defy exhaustive analysis), or you can play by the seat of your pants, and try to win by instincts. It is a remarkable acheivement to have created a game that can satisfy both types of play styles.You will like this game if you like:Turn-based tactics and strategy. (Even if you aren't a football fan, you will like this aspect, if you like turn-based squad tactics at all.)Roster management--balancing the need to win matches now with the need to develop your next generation of players.Elegant game design--something simple to learn, but deceptively complex beneath the surface. Every decision that confronts you offers enough options to be interesting, but not so many to be overwhelming.The challenge of taking the worst club in the lowest league and slowly building it into a continental champion.Replayability--start over with a new club and try a different strategy.Real club names and logos. It takes only a couple minutes to download the user mods with real names and logos for all of the clubs in all of the leagues. After all, isn't it more fun to take over West Bromwich Albion, with the throstle-on-a-hawthorn-branch logo, than some club named West Bromwich FC represented by a generic green eagle silhoutted atop a soccer ball?Things this game does not do:Pretty graphics. If you want eye candy, look elsewhere.""Realistic"" simulation. Players have four attributes, there are 10 different special abilities they can learn, and the pitch is a 10x7 grid. It certainly ""feels"" like football, but it is not a ""realistic"" simulation.Complex player relations. Players do their best, all the time, no matter what. You don't have to figure out how to motivate them, whom they like to play with, etc.Player contract negotiations. When you acquire a player he has a 1-year contract. When a contract is due to expire you can sign a new contract (1-3 years), let the player go, or sell him. The cost of the new contract depends on the footballer's level at the time of signing and the length of the contract. There's no negotiation.Media interactions. No press conferences, interviews, etc.The threat of getting sacked. It's your team. You make all the decisions, and you never lose your job.As of the date of this writing (April 29 2016), the game still has the Early Access tag, but it is really a complete game.The developers are adding additional features, but there isn't anything missing.

								Football Tactics:~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Always wanted to find out how the top coaches made it all the way to the Premier League? Well, don‚Äôt look further, they are all playing Football Tactics!!Football Tactics is a football manager game using a turn-based system during match day which gives this game its originality.First you will have to choose which team and in which country you will be playing. Then, the Amateur League will start. This league is realistically a tutorial and will help you to understand how to play the game and you will probably find it quite easy. As soon as you move up to the next league, the difficulty will increase straight away and you will be facing tougher opponents. In total, you have 5 leagues and 2 cups to play in and the aim is to reach and win the Premier League and the Cups, of course.The management aspect of the game has good depth but it is easy to use and understand. I really like it that way. You can . . . upgrade your stadium to get more attendance and revenue, upgrade your youth academy so you can find better young talents, purchase new players during the transfer window, get specific coaches and assistants so your players improve their skills (but you will need prestige points). How do you get prestige points, you may ask? Really simple, if the goal difference is  1 in your favour then you will get 1 prestige point. If you manage to finish the season in the top 3 teams, you will be rewarded with additional prestige points. Match day ‚Äì Each half will consist of 24 action moves to be used between each team, with a total of 48 moves per match. Remember, you and your opponent will use 3 action moves per turn. They are plenty of moves to make your mark and score goals. At the end of each match, your player will get experience points which in turn will help them to reach a higher level. If you win, you‚Äôll get higher experience points. The graphics are smooth and polished and the game runs well. This game is an early access and it is very impressive so far. Please bring on the full version, I can‚Äôt wait!Positives:~~~~~~~   -	Good and easy Football Management -	Turn-based match day-	Really fun to play-	Addictive and challenging-	Plenty of achievementsNegative:~~~~~~~ -	No trading cards9/10 Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

								What's left to say about the game. If you need proof it's worth getting consider I've played 300 hours and I stiil love it. It's easily played, absorbing and totally addictive. The mods made by the fans must now cover every league from all nations. The developer's update it regularly and if you find a problem, just post it in the discussion page or contact the developrs and it'll be sorted post haste. If this doesn't convince you to try it I'm out of ideas, suffice to say, buy the game and you won't be dissapointed			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Football Tactics is a turn based football game where you manage your own team from the start, from the lowest legugue and your target is to trainyour team to be best.In a game you can found 5 leagues and 2 cups. When you manage your own team you can build your station, develop a coach squad, buy players, train players, etc. For transfers and stadion you use your money, for developing your squad you need your prestige points.Matches look very simple - you have two half times, with 24 possible actions in each. In every turn you can do 3 moves. What you can do depends from the situation, for example you can pass, control the ball, power shot, etc. Also your players get TP points after matches and level up when earned enough amount of this. Also some your players can have special skills.The graphics in a game enough simple but looks nice. Sound also good.So my verdict +challenging and interesting+good manager system+Steam Workshop+steam achievements and trading cards- only single player mode - playing against other players would be interesting I think if you like a football you should try this game, as it looks very interesting and developers approached football in a different view. And I should say they done it well. This game now in EA, in a future there may be improvements -  multiplayer would be a good addition to the game, it could be really fun with friends.

								Exactly what I hoped a turn-based football game would be, with way more features than expected, without feeling bloated. Visually appealing, with a nice soundtrack and great mechanics. Unfortunately the teams and players have non-official names, but modders on the Steam Workshop have already fixed that for most nations!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								THE FIRST IMPRESSIONS - EARLY ACCESS REVIEW, done Anno Domini 11/06/16Gents, you are aware that I bring justice with every review I make. If game sucks, I will bring the word that it sucks...This game I played half an hour and I can tell you already this is absolute gold nugget. I never buy things on Early Access, but this one made me change my mind. If you like turn based strategy and football this will be something to go for. So, it is not Fifa or other action minded games. This is for the smart part of the population, who can still play Fifa but can play something serious as well. Players have abilities, there is a statistics behind evey move, you have to think and plan your movement tactically. Plus, there is a steam workshop and people are bringing optimizations for free. Plus, this is being developed. The potential of the game is huge. I cannot believe I am actually praising game on Steam...Graphics is not top notch, it is hard to expect top notch graphics, however the game has decent graphics.Guys and girls, ladies and gents, the game is currently sold for 12 CHF (so 10 $ more or less). You should purchase it. It is worth more than 70% of all Steam games which are sold for that price.I do not know how deep the devs will take the game, but this has a huge potential. The time will tell.---------For Christ and glory! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Early Access on Steam has a notorious reputation for being a haven for dodgy developers and half-finished alpha prototypes that never make it into a Beta stage of play. Let me assure you: Football Tactics does not fall into this category. This is a game and development team that are doing EA right. But why listen to me? Take a look at the up-to-date demo provided here on the store page; visit the discussion forum to see how often the devs visit, respond and take in feedback; and look at the highly active workshop community - which the devs enjoy highlighting in announcements.This is a game community to rival any AAA title community.The game itself (as of Dec 30, 2016) is a highly polished turn-based strategy game. The demo lets you play a full season with all the bells and whistles, and if you do purchase the game, you can continue your saved game. As of writing I have started season 2 of my NCAA-mod game and I couldn't be happier with the state of play. The mod is brilliant in of itself, and the developers are looking at ways to incorporate even more community ideas based.It may seem like a turn-based strategy and a usually fast-paced sport like football shouldn't go hand-in-hand, but something just works. Somehow it blends well together and provides a challenging and unique take on not one but two genres. Players have unique stats for their positions which can be improved on through training and game-play, there are plenty of leagues incorporated into the game itself, and the newly implemented league editor encourages you to include leagues that may otherwise not be in the base game (like the NCAA). The UI is easy to navigate and lends itself to a simple to read yet still detailed enough management side of the game where you can build your strategy for match day via a formations menu. You can either be hands-on during match day, simulate or watch (and then intervene at your leisure). The AI, in my opinion, is well adjusted for each level of team and league I've played so far. Teams with good defense won't suddenly let you score goals, and you have to change up your tactics to suit your opponent. Gameplay is rewarding in its challenge.Football Tactics, as it stands, is a complete game that offers a refreshing take on the hundreds of other football titles out there. Fancy on building a team that resembles your favourite players, well you can, with the current build featuring a face editor. New features are promised as they come to light, and I think even when this game has left Early Access, we can look forward to many more features and content from the developers and the active community.This is a title that could change the landscape of a rather stagnant sports genre. RTS NFL? Yes please.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								This is a very fun game. It is simple and elegant yet there is enough depth in the mechanics to provide good satisfication. I've only played the beta demo, just bought the full thing but I played a few seasons in that and the fundamental game mechanics were fun and I can only imagine it being better once I have access to greater amount of skills and management options that the full version allows. There is a real sense of progression and you find yourself invested in your team.EDITOkay I now have 10+ hours under my belt. So I just want to update this. I can confirm that the greater variety of skills as your team progresses increases the depth of the game and I'm still only in Division 2  so I imagine as I unlock some more or get better players that this will continue to increase.And I stand by my impressions from the beta demo. This is a very clever game design. It's easy to understand mechanics and interface but there is still a good deal of strategy involved.Now it's still not perfect. At the moment, the lowest two divisions are a push over but they have said they are going to update the game with a choice of weaker teams to start with for greater difficulty. It's good in a way because it gives you time to learn the game and it's far from overwhelming. You get hints and concise information game after game in your first season just so you learn the mechanics as you play. It's also not such a problem because the amauter league(lowest league) season is shorter than the higher divisions. That and you get more fame points (which you use to upgrade some aspects of your club) the more you win by so you are still interested in doing well even if the amaetur league doesn't really threaten to win the games.The AI does the occassional silly thing but it's no where near enough to ruin the experience.Finally I had my first crash just recently but it was after 10+ hours of play and 3 seasons in so it seems very stable for early access.I could have talked in more details about why I think the game is so cleverly designed and why this is a gem but this is already going on to long and I just want to be upfront. It's definetely worth the price, even in early access.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
