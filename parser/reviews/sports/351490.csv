												Intergalactic Bubbles is inspired by a game I don't remember the name but I can still see the cursor, the dinosaur and the bubble being sent. It's not  Bubble Bobble though I think there was an arcade version with a different gameplay. Anyway, I've known this game under different names, the last one being on a giveaway game where the minigame is called Blink Shooter and is my favorite.The goal is to send colored balls on others of the same color to explode them and make sure that the board is cleaned before they're descending and touch your line. By doing so, you can also get rid of balls under them if they're not attached to another one that will support everything. Here, you have also the balls moving naturally, like if there was gravity and can also tied themselves to others and if they're the same color, you'll have another explosion that will probably help you to reach your goal.Intergalactic Bubbles is challenging because if you want to upgrade bonuses, you need to collect a sort of stars (that look more like a planet on fire anyway). Each level completed will give you one but if you do it less than the number if balls sent that will be displayed, you'll collect 3 or 2 stars.The game is kinda long if you're aiming like me to a 3 stars. The more you advance, more balls will be on the board or a new color is added.While the graphics aren't spectacular and really simple, the soundtrack is correct.I suppose that some people will be deceived by the lack of features, but it's enough for me. I find the game a little too slow, mainly in the speed at which the board is descending.If you love that kind of games, you can go for it, it's a nice disctraction.Edit: Apparently, the game was Bust-A-Move. The name itself is clicking in my head though I can't be sure if I was that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'll keep this review brief as there is just not enough I have to say about this title.Intergalactic Bubbles is a casual puzzle game, where you have to match the same color balls to clear out a board of bubbles.It's as simple as it sounds and for the price which is a single euro this is actually quite a steal, cause to clear out all 250 levels it will take you around 14 hours and not to mention how much time it would take to a 100% which would mean that you would have to get three stars each level, which would make this game a 30+ hour game.A single euro game and a lot of play value, that sounds like a good deal right, so why am I giving it a bad score ? Well that's for the simple reason, this game is bland. Now you might say what did you expect ? Well I expected some variety through all the galaxies (50 levels for one galaxy btw). After each galaxy you get a new color ball which pops up on the board, but this doesn't really spice up the gameplay and after a few hours it gets incredibly boring. This game does have powerups which spice up the gameplay a bit, but two out of the three powerups are completely useless. The Rocket let's you switch fire a ball in the middle of the board, a rainbow ball which takes out a small cluster of all color balls and a bomb which is the only powerup you will need which takes out a massive chunk of of the board the more you level it up making it very useful in later parts of the game. In the end, I had a bit of fun with this game, I found it too boring. For people that might come along and ask well then just play it on the side, that's exactly what I did and I still got sick of it. I won't argue with the play value you get, but I still think there are way better casual puzzles game that are free in the form of flash games. Final Rating: 5/10Pros:+ Fun..Cons:-... but not for long-Most of the powerups are useless			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun ball shooter.I played a lot of this on Desura, so my Steam time is misleading.  This is a ball shooter game with a twist.  There's phyiscs that affects how the balls move.  Sometimes that ends up in your favor as a dangling trail of balls will swing back and forth and might attach to others which will activate them and make them explode.  Other times the physics is a hindrance when a dangling trail swings by at the wrong moment and grabs the ball you intended to go elsewhere.  There's an upgrade tree that you spend points on.  Get points by finishing a level in under a certain amount of balls spent.  You can replay levels any time as much as you want.3 Bonuses: Wild, Bomb, and Rocket.  Each time you make a match it starts to power up your bonus meter.  Once it is full you can choose a bonus to use.This is a slower paced ball shooter than others I've played.  I find the emphasis to be more on strategy, especially if you want to use as few balls as possible to get the 3 star rating.  And sometimes you can waste a ball if you don't wait for the ones you just shot to fall because your new ball might attach to the falling ones.There's no story, just fun arcade ball shooting.Music is nice.  I like it.Graphics are okay.  I'm not picky about graphics, though.  I find myself having to force myself to quit.  ""Just one more level!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A decent enough casual game where the aim is to fire your balls at the approaching board so that you match three or more of the same colour ball, which causes any now unattached balls to fall off as well. The idea is to clear the board in as few moves as possible, but also against the clock - or rather the board, which moves down steadily (or fast if you haven't made any matches for a few seconds).There is an upgrade mechanism to give you skills you can use to get through awkward sections of the board, which rewards playing well in earlier rounds and getting low scores - you can get up to three upgrade points per board cleared, or as few as one if you take lots of shots to win. There is also some physics you can take advantage of (or get scuppered by), if a group of balls is only connected by one ball they will hang loose and swing around, sometimes banging into other groups, which can cause a chain reaction - or block off an area you wanted to be able to fire at next.Overall it is a decent enough game to play through if you like this sort of thing, don't expect anything new after the first level - each group of levels just adds another row of balls to clear, and each new zone adds one more colour to the mix to make things harder (but resets the depth of the game board to be much shorter again at first)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ok, not all the way done with this game yet, but with 210/250 levels completed @ 3 stars each, I feel ready to review it.IMPORTANT:  Do NOT buy this game if you are ANY sort of color blind. The colors of the balls starts at Red, Dark Blue,and Green, which isn't so bad, BUT...Each new ""galaxy"" unlocks a new color... THAT's the big difficulty spike, 1 more color EACH GALAXY.New colors are Light Blue, Yellow, Purple, and Orange.  Now, I'm not color blind, but I've mistaken the color of a ball several times.So, Pros:1. Pretty fun bubble-blaster game2. Achievements (long, painful grind of 250 levels for all 10 of them tho!)3. Trading Cards, including (as of this review) a cheap collection of foil cards for a foil badge (still only 100 points, but THE PRESTIGE of a FOIL badge!)and Cons:1.  Completing this game totally is 250 levels, which is many many hours of grinding the same-looking screen and music over and over and over...  I recommend Netflix and iTunes or something similar in the background while grinding this.2. This game is NOT very friendly for people who are color-blind, I can't stress this enough!  New colors of balls in each new galaxy (on top of all the previous colors) is most of the difficulty spike in each new galaxy.and one weird pro/con glitch?: 1. Occasionally (this has happened to me twice in 210 levels), a ball will glitch so bad at the corners of the game that it will set off a chain reaction of destruction that will destroy all but a few balls on that level.  This gives you a free (or mostly free) level, at the expense of messing your controls up and forcing you to exit and restart the game to regain normal controls.  Doesn't happen often enough to be useful, doesn't seem to hurt the game (aside from an almost mandatory relaunch), and will never happen when you're trying to replicate it to make a video of it to send to the developers' emails.  T_TVery very VERY fun to watch tho, as all the balls turn into oh so much confetti!  =^_^=Sure, there might be better games out there, like some other reviewers suggest, but this game has trading cards and can be 100%'ed for achievements easily enough (even if it does take longer than some other games).  At only $2 USD, that's a bargain in my book!NOTE: Don't get the 4 game bundle, only this and maybe Fragile Ball are worth it.  Maybe Fragile Ball, maybe...  but definitely Intergalactic Bubbles!

												A connect 3 or more bubble game, nothing too special about it, it's fairly generic although there's a tech tree added to it which gives you special abilities - however it's massively disappointing in my opinion..There's three abilities but the only one you need is the bombs fully upgraded and then putting up your energy storage and income. After the first two stages you will have enough stars (used to unlock/upgrade) to do this.This will be all you need to clear out all the levels with 3 star rating without failure every time.I do recommend playing the game if you enjoy puzzles, it's really cheap for the amount of time you can get from it but I do have a few problems with it besides the overpowered bomb ability.The game can occasionally give you the same colour ball back to back several times.The level is too randomised every time you play it resulting in some attempts being much easier when there's more/larger patches of the same colour.It doesn't really get any harder, just more balls added which prolong the level making it more tedious than challengingNothing really changes throughout the playthrough, there's 50 levels per stage and five stages which only add one new colour each.The biggest issue with this game is that it will offen forget how physics works, the balls can get stuck inside each other, spaz out and on some occasions completely break by getting sucked into some black hole where all the balls will merge into one big mess.This can result in either the board being cleared and getting an instant win, the board being cleared but not winning leaving you no way to finish or move all the balls into your shield and instantly losing.Overall the game is incredibly easy but somewhat fun if you play for small periods of time, doing it all in one go left me wishing it would finish soon.It's worth getting it on a sale or in one of the available cheap bundles with some other decent games.

												The game is fun and is quite cheap but it is EXTREMELY MONOTONOUS.  If you like the same level each and every round with absolutely no change other than a slight speedup, then go for this game but if you need a variety, I would go elsewhere.I am glad I tried it and it isn't horrible though and it does offer powerups if I knew how to use one and all.  Oh, and the controls suck and they cannot be edited.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are red-green color blind, I do not recommend this. I enjoyed the first 50 levels. On the 51st level of the game a new colored ball is unlocked; since I am red-green colorblind I cannot distinguish the new color from the green ball. The nostalgic ball shooter game was good while it lasted....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is an addictive game that I highly recommend for all players that are not colour blind.  The first fifty levels have three colours that are easily discernable, beyond that you will be lost.Note for Devs:- If you could add spots/stripes/shapes to new colours then I could still play this.Please!

												It's like one of those other bubble games, but it has something extra. First of all, this has physics. The balls have weight and that means when a group is holding on with just 1 bubble connection, the whole group just swings a bit. The momentum goes away of course, but when it first goes in motion, it can either “catch” the ball you just shot (if you shot it) or it can connect to something else and if the balls are of the same colour, they act as a ball that you shot.Second neat thing about this game are the upgrades and powerups. You upgrade your launcher to have energy which is gained by bubbles that fall down. Energy you use to activate powerups: launch ball ABOVE the “playground” to selected spot, use a rainbow ball or use a bomb. The powerups themselves are also upgradeable.There are few flaws though, but they're rather minor. Graphics are a bit bad, too though, but gameplay is what counts. Gameplay first, graphics later.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

I'm sure you've seen this game before under another name or own it on your mobile.you launch bubble down a lane and try hit 2 or more of the same color to make them pop.you win by clearing the board by popping all bubbles or making them fall down.This game add power ups & every level setup is random. by using less then a set number of bubbles on a board you can get 1-3 items that can be used to upgrade abilities but you'll need 5x each ability level to upgrade it (L1 needs 5, L2=10, ect until L5).most are things like more bubbles can touch the bottom before you lose, more energy for your 3 main abilities, and faster ways to gain energy.the 3 main attack abilities are 1)a launcher that lets you toss a bubble up into the mass. 2)a multi color bubble that will pop any 2 or more bubble it touches regardless of color. 3)a bomb that takes out all bubble in a set range. these all have upgrades and also you can unlock the ability to do 2 or all 3 with 1 bubble.

												Usually I love bubble shooter games as I think they are great time passers but this one is very very bland, basic, and really boring. For 2$ I would rather save that and open up my phone and play any of the 10s to 100s of free bubble shooter games that are better designed, and much more pleasing to play. I cannot recommend this to anyone because of its quality. I got this as a part of a bundle it's the only reason I own it. My advice to the dev(s) would be to work on its design for sure and maybe speed the game up as the first 50 levels get very boring very quick and may potentially turn off new players almost instantly.

												This game is a bit of luck and doing the same thing over and over and over and over again. And yes i know, normally it's doing the same thing over again in those type of games, but why do i have to beat 50 levels with pretty much the exact same difficulty to ""progress"" to a slightly higher difficulty. Honestly, it only feels like ""do this one level 50 times to progress"" and this is kinda frustrating. It doesn't even get that much harder and it may be fun and a bit of ""something else"" in the beginning but it gets boring pretty fast.The ""skill"" tree stuff is pretty fun though.Summary: Regret.
