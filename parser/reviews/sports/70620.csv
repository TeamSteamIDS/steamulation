AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Worms Crazy Golf Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Sports; Golf; Strategy; Puzzle; Casual; 2D My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Puzzle game aficionados; Casual gamers REVIEWWorms Crazy Golf is a casual, wacky game that focuses on strategy and puzzle-solving in a silly cartoon atmosphere.  Do note: it is certainly more reminiscent of other trajectory-based games, like Angry Birds, rather than any other actual golf games.  If you like silly, simple, trajectory-based puzzle games then you will probably find this enjoyable.To keep things fresh and crazy as you play, different in-level obstacles and utilities (explosive sheep, cannons, teleporters, and such) make appearances in the various levels.  There are also unlockable power-ups which you can equip and use to manipulate the movement of the golf ball.  Using these things, you will find there are various ways to solve each level.Besides just beating the par (in strokes), there are also 20 coins and 1 crate to be collected in each level.  You collect the items by causing the golf ball to move through them.  Everything is cumulative, and you can take as many strokes as you need to collect everything.  So with time and patience you can easily collect everything without having to worry about hitting a wall due to skill level.  There is also a score threshold to beat on each level, which can be reached by taking crazy shots with a lot of airtime and that cause many explosions and such.  There is an achievement for completing all objectives on every course (minus the DLC course).Of course, there are some minor annoyances inherent in the gameplay.  For example, I found it mildly obnoxious that some of the animations couldn’t be skipped; most of them only last a few seconds, but over the course of playing it starts to get old having to wait after every shot before you can take the next one.Worms Crazy Golf is a very casual game.  Once you have access to the power-ups, it’s pretty easy to ace every level with a “hole-in-one.”  The pleasure of the game comes from its silly, easy nature, so don’t expect mind-bending puzzles.  Anticipate approximately 5 hours of gameplay to “beat” each course; if you want to complete all objectives on each course, then that number will probably rise exponentially.  If it sounds like something you would enjoy, get it for a price you are comfortable with and give it a shot.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												Background: I'm a casual fan of Worms game, love everything about it.  I've played golf maybe 10 times or so in real life.  I picked up the game on a humble bundle.This is one sweet game.  You have 4 18 hole courses to play in a 2d platform style.  You choose your club from a driver, iron, wedge or putter, each behave differently and choose your angle and how much power to swing it.You have a few different objectives, you need at least a Par to progress, although later with powerups its common to get hole in ones.  You will need a great mix of strategy, powerups, planning, and luck to get it right.There are 20 coins per level you can collect, these help you to buy other clubs, hats, balls, voices etc.  There is one crate on each level which is needed to help unlock items.  There is also a requirement to get a certain number of points, however this becomes the easiest/lamest to achieve.  If you get a hole in one, you get this straight away.  However in earlier levels I just aimed straight up and hit the ball out of the map repeatedly/or into the sea and got my skill score.Getting all of these challenges on the normal levels will take some planning, but nothing is impossible.  Sometimes you need to wait till you unlock an ability later.There are some seperate challenge maps, eg the ""chip in"" challenge.  If you get the ball on the green you get extra time in your countdown.  If you get it in the hole you get more time.  The ""keep up"" challenges are quite fun, you get only one shot and have to use land mines and other objects on the map to keep the ball moving as many times as possible, you can only choose one powerup to use until it runs out.Most of the achievements in this game will pop normally just playing the game.The best thing about this game, it was always fun, even when I was just smashing the ball straight up in the air.   A great casual game if you have 5 minutes or 2 hours.			",369,43,22,34,22,4,71

												For such a low price, I believe this game is possibly the most efficient game in terms of cost:entertainment. It may appear to be a lame videogame for children at first, but this belongs to the 'Worms' series for a reason, and this game is HARD. CORE. Got that? Imagine golf. Now imagine golf with explosives. Cool right? Now imagine golf with explosives and worms. This is the only game you need ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I personally have clocked over a 1,000 hours on this masterpeice and I highly recommend you do the same! It's the name of the game ♥♥♥♥♥.

												Well i'll be. Never expected to see a 'Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour' -type of game on PC.  In fact i expected this game to either be a turd or something you need a hefty amount of nostalgia to play.  Turns out nostalgia is not required and game stands on it's own and is done with high production values.  And it's a good but whacky PC equivalent of the before mentioned legendary Mario game that is valid and fun even today 11 years after it's release. So what's it like? Well it has got to do with 'real' golf as much as Elin Nordegren has got to do with Professional  Golfing in the real world and that ain't much - except for collecting lots of gold coins, stuff from crates and generally being an♥♥♥♥♥on the golf field and hitting on everyone. All levels go approx. the same: first get a score under par to unlock next level. after that you can just go nuts and try to collect and break everything on the level until you get them all.  Doing objectives unlocks stuff you can buy from the shop to 'accessorize' your worm player.  As you progress element hazards such as wind is introduced but you get special items such as rocket boost.  Very realistic yes?			",775,311,45,87,97,7,148

												Worms Crazy Golf is 2D golf game. It's heavily based on Worms Reloaded (by looks of the graphics, UI, and more) which is good.+ Simple gameplay (if you have 3 years old son or daughter, he/she can play it if he/she knows how to use keyboard or gamepad)+ Enjoyable with keyboard/mouse as well as with gamepad+ Cute graphics+ Up to 4 players local coop+ Great music background+ Runs on everything that moves+ Good UI+ Has funny achievements+ 0 DLC or microtransactions- No online multiplayer (not even LAN)What should developers learn from this game: that they've done amazing job, and I would totally buy same game with new campaign and online multiplayer.

Great game for a single-player. Too bad you can't play against a CPU.This game is funny a bit too casual but still great.In my opinion the game content is way too low even with the free DLC (carnival course) you can easily unlock every level in less then 5 hours.It's a awesome game if you like worms and if you wanna play golf in a awesome way!

												For a Worms game, this is oddly the cutest entry of the lot.From the cutesy theme in the title to how happy all the worms are playing a nice game of golf instead of, you know... Trying to blow each other up like they normally spend their time doing.. It is an odd change of pace, but that doesn't make it bad.. I found this game rather charming, really.Worms Crazy Golf is a game that takes the classic Worms system and combines it with golf to make a rather strange, if interesting, hybrid of 2D golf sim, where players try their best to smack a ball all the way to the hole in as few hits as possible, while trying to avoid more Wormish hazards such as mines, sheep, and even grumpy grannies, in time earning items that help make getting that tricky hole-in-one easier.A game about 2D golf might not seem all that interesting at first, but once you give it a wack you find a humble pleasure playing this simple little game. Sadly, as fun as it can be at times, it does suffer from a flaw or two that holds it back from being a rather enjoyable game in the long run.For 10 dollars, the content the game packs is rather meh, a decent player able to beat the game in a few hours. It might have some form of replay value, but it is rather humble in that area. To make matters worst, the game suffers from an awkward balancing issue, being that one of the powers (Reverse Gravity) is by far the most broken item in the game. Upon earning it for the first time, it doesn't take a player long to realise that he can abuse it to get easy holes in one for EVERY course in the game.. I am serious about that, it takes all challege out of a nice little golf game, so if you are the kind of person who seeks a challenge, I suggest you avoid using it if you don't want to spoil your fun. For the egotist, however, it certainly does satisfy the desire for easy glory. I suggest you wait for the game to go on sale for 5 bucks or so before getting the game. It is fun and all, but clearly not worth the current price offered.			",101,10,3,2,12,2,15

												If your a fan of worms and a fan of the sport of golf, then this is the game for you! Includes the classic whacky gameplay in humor from the Worms games.  There a objectives that are optional to complete in each level on hole. There are also special abilities you can use to help you improve your score. You can also earn in game cash to customize your Worm( Name, Speech, Balls, Clubs, Hats)!			",219,19,1,56,13,3,21

												Yet another game that falls under the ""Bored? Why not this?"" category of games. It is a cute, low-key golf game mixed with the Worms genre. Makes passing time a little easier, and makes for a great local co-op game with a friend when you have nothing better to do.Worms Crazy Golf is not a game I would pay full price for, but it is one I would recommend to anyone who is thinking of getting it, or anyone that owns it already.

***3 out of 5The game to play before you sleep.Worms Crazy Golf is a nice little addition to the vast Worms dynasty. With simple but customisable golf playing mechanics, you putt your balls through some endearing 2d cartoony worlds and imagery.Worms Crazy Golf isn't going to set the world on fire. It's the game you play after spending all day playing those AAA amazements and that indie darling you love so much. So whilst it's a nice casual game, it's still a freakin' casual game.

												I find this game tons of fun and love it as a relaxing game. The soundtrack is just so soothing it's impossible for me not to have fun. Also worms playing golf is an interesting concept, I like it. It's nice with something different from timing grenades and firing  bazookas against the wind :) The golf courses has multiple ways to be completed, there's also many different ways to play. You can either try to collect everything, get the ball in with lowest hits or both at the same time. I also love how the courses are themed and that there's objects which interact with the ball. There's also power ups.Overall I like this game and would give it a solid 10/10. It is also very fun to play with friends ^~^			",160,28,1,14,11,2,14

												I can recommend this game when it is bought on sale or in a bundle (I bought the Team17 Humble Bundle). I think the game should cost around 5 bucks at most, since it can be finished in under 10 hours.The core mechanic is similar to throwing a grenade in a normal Worms game with some twists. After progressing through the levels the golf ball gets upgrades, which the player can choose from. However, when you get the reverse gravity ball, the game becomes way too easy.My opinion, Worms Crazy Golf is an okay single player experience, but for a multiplayer experience, I recommend buying either Worms Reloaded or Revolution (or both), it\'s much more fun.

												Worms Crazy Golf is, as the title suggests, a golf game in Team17's Worms universe. It is not a serious golf game, like for instance Tiger Woods PGA Tour or Links, but a more wacky 2D golfer keeping with the series comical tone and graphical style. Supposedly it is a sequel to the 2004 mobile game Worms Golf, but who cares, right? The object of the game is to complete each hole on par or below par with its par number. If you fail to do so you have to play the hole again. There are three courses (four with the added mini expansion Carnival Course) that contain 18 holes each. Once in awhile you get to play extra challenge levels where the object can be to keep the ball in motion for a certain time or to pop all balloons, etc. These challenges are quite fun and can be a good break from the normal levels. As you progress in the game you unlock power-ups, a couple of which make the game a little too easy. Well, the power-ups combined with the fact that you can steer the ball mid-air by tapping left or right will result in a few hole-in-ones. Some levels have wind and magnetic fields, which ups the difficulty a tad. The levels also contain greenskeeper worms, sheep, bats, moles who steal the ball, and old ladies who strike the ball with their handbags. You collect crates to unlock things in the shop, such as hats or different colored balls, and you collect coins to buy these accessories. The only accessories that alter the gameplay are the golf clubs, so these are worth getting. If you're unlucky, the ball can get stuck inside the ground, though it rarely happens. And if it does happen you can just restart the hole. The game is quite short and can easily be completed in one sitting. Hot seat multiplayer is available for up to four players in true Worms tradition. I found the game pretty enjoyable, a lot better than the puzzle spin-off Worms Blast, but still lacking something to keep it from being just another Worms sidetrack.3 out of 5 worms.

												A slightly odd little title that uses the Worms licence as a flimsy excuse to deliver a simplistic 2D golf game. For what it is, it’s highly polished, with great optimisation, visuals achieving a fantastic level of detail, music complimenting the theme of each course, and solid gameplay mechanics that deliver consistency as well as playability. Course design is mostly a success, and encourages risky play - hitting a ball at top speed against a solid wall high above you, for it to bounce back off towards the platform opposite and come to a stop inches away from the flagpost, is a satisfying experience, albeit one that grows old quickly. The game features achievements, which is a great incentive to play, but collecting all 29 of them will probably prove too tedious for all but the most dedicated gamers. Think of it as the Worms variant of Windows Solitaire - fun to play idly for a few minutes, then you’ll want to shut it down and do something else.			",26,16,2,3,0,2,9

												Graphics and Animations are very sweet and adorable in this Game, just as usual for Team17!Single- and Multiplayer are fun to play, and nice Tactics can be built up!Warning: The Game is getting boring pretty fast, and unlocking some Achievements takes Hours of boring, repetitious playing, so do not expect an extended Amount of Fun!

												There are many haters to this game so you might be one, but being a huge worms fan I have found this fun with the usual worms mechanics and light hearted comedy, no online multiplayer which is a shame, but there is hot seat action.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is Worms, exactly as you know it. Feels very much like an expansion of golf-themed/oriented missions rather than a unique game unto itself, but it's still fun if you like playing Worms and enjoy golf-themed games.			",469,178,15,75,44,7,107

												If you're a fan of the franchise, and golf, its worth it, otherwise don't bother. The audio issues are a drawback, but a fix can be found (I think?) the only help through steam is a few articles from 2012, which don't apply for Windows 10. The game is not even listed on the Team17's website, which is concerning...			",99,3,7,7,5,1,1

												Worms Crazy Golf is basically challenge mode ripped out of classic worms and presented as a full game. While it still retain the absolutely flawless physics from the previous games and the very familiar controls, the game’s focus far too much on challenge goals and not enough on insane and over the top worms weaponry and humor. Sure there is parachuting golf balls and reverse gravity, but those are far tame compared to the signature holy grenade, super sheep, and the banana bomb. Level designs are extremely poor with course objective such as coins placed in ridiculous, and in lot of cases, impossible places. I suppose it’s not really a surprise that this is actually an IOS ported to pc. The final slap in the face is that this version is 3 times more expensive than the IOS edition.
