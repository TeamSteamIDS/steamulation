												I almost never review games on Steam, but this one has warrants a proper warning...I'm not sure what game the other reviewers are playing, but this certainly isn't it. This is a $5 mobile game at best, that somehow made it onto Steam. This is the not a football manager simulation, unless you classify zero front office work as a manager sim. I highly reccommend you PASS on this game.Pros:- Nostalgia of 16bit football - Play creator (although extremely shallow)- Team/Player Editor (so you can recreate NFL teams without having to pay for licensing, yet they charge you like a licensed titles price.)Cons: - There is basically zero depth.- There are minimal management tasks/duties.- Gameplay is as shallow as the rest of the game.- It's made for mobile... - It's $38CAD... Do youself a favor, and if you REALLY need to get a sports manager fix in and it HAS to be football, then go buy Front Office Football Seven. At least that game is ACTUALLY a manager sim, it's about $15 cheaper and it has a ton of depth. That being said, it's still a pretty poor game itself.This is the second refund request I will be placing on Steam. If you look at my library you will see there is a number of subpar games, that I chose not to refund as I managed to find some value (whether I actually liked the game or not, if there's value the devs can keep my money). There is no value in this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Someday, someone will step up and make a proper replacement for Front Page Sports: Football (the late 90s version - not the total crap remake they made in 2014); the best football sim ever.  This isn't it.While the store page doesn't deceive, they don't tell the entire story, either.  The program has potential but it seems more like it's in early release status than a finished product.While the game does include animated acdtion of the plays as they unfold, the graphics are cartoonish and doin't show much real detail.While you CAN (as they tell you) trade draft picks before each year's draft, you can NOT trade players.While you can train specific players in camp - you can only train 3 (wth?) and you can't pick the area they in which they train.  Why in the world can you only train 3 players?   Yes, a few stats on some players change each year, the fact you can only train 3 during off season is bewildering.  ""Hey John, Dawayne, and Ken - go workout.  The rest of y'all, take camp off.""So far (after about 9 seasons played), I have yet to see anything improve in team drills if I spend average time for an area.  Worse, in order tro improve one team attribute I have to shorty change - and decrease a team stat elsewhere.   PFS appears full of coaches who are no good because it seems you can't bump up one area without suffering a decrease in another.Compounding the problems, you must set your starting lineup for the next season before you conduct camp!  So, you set your starters - THEN you train.  This is completely backwards and baffles the heck out of me.  How do I know who I want to start before we train?While you CAN design your own plays, you only have limited ability to do so.  Forget drawing your own routes, blockling schemes, defining zones to cover, etc.  you can't do that.  You get to pick from a small set of options for SOME posiitons, not all.  They state zone blitzes will come later but , as of now, you can only select someone to blitz if you are in man coverage.Salaries, free agency, etc are not paret of the career mode.   Young players improve, old players lose skills, but contracts aren't part of the picture.You can not start witih a draft.   You pick a team and take the players on it, even in career mode.Front Page Sports: Football was WAY more complete than this with vastly better graphics and it was produced bakc in the late 1990s.This game is entertaining, but for $35?   Nah - there isn't enough there to wearrant buying it.As is, its like they took 50% of a good football manager text simulator and added mimialist graphics, thne weant ytou to buiy it for $35.  Not worth it.For $10, it is fine - for $35?   Way overpriced for what you get. ",16,3,3,22,29,1,22

												This game needs to be at least $25 cheaper to be worth it. Word of warning, it is not as deep as it suggests it is. The 16-bit football simulation is neat, but not neat enough to be worth its pricetag. There is literally no front-office work, really. The actual game coaching is pretty good but as others have said, its basiclly the $5 mobile game. Also I'm pretty sure the one music track used over and over again in the game is ripped from Blood Bowl... would probably report it if I cared enough.Until its cheaper or the game adds MUCH more in-depth management, stay away! As much as I want to, I cannot reccomend this game.			",96,56,3,32,30,3,20

												CHEERING......CROWD NOISE......good grief even the oldest football games on nintendo had some canned cheering....I wish the developer would at least put that in the game, but I don't know how much further he is going to develop the game. The game is simplistic....but fun in an old school way. Is it worth $34.....probably not, but I paid it because I was so curious about the game. It really is fun though if you enjoy tinkering with plays, coaching, and building teams. As others have said there isn't any front office stuff to tend to, but I went in knowing that and didn't care. I'd be happy with my purchase if they'd just add some damn cheering or something during games.			",4,1,0,8,12,1,13

												This is a great football sim game.  Whether you choose to be the coach, general manager, or both, it's kept me entertained for hours.  I used to be a big fan of the game and decided to volunteer to beta test it.  The coaching mode is ridiculous with all the different strategic options.  I love the ability to design your own plays in-game.  However, I don't really spend too much time in coach mode as I'm more of an armchair GM.  The game gives you that perfect balance of authenticity and playability.  I've been messing around with trading draft picks and I think the career leader stats are awesome.  I've tried other sims before and this one allows you to make the most critical decisions without leaving you too much in the weeds.  Takes me about 5-10 minutes to complete a season where you sim all the games.  If you used to love playing armchair GM in Madden franchise mode or Tecmo Super Bowl III, like I did, this is the game for you.  Enjoy!			",4,0,0,1,2,0,1

												I want to chime in here and offer a heartfelt word of support for this game.First of all, do not be deceived by the number of hours I have logged only here on Steam.  I first became aware of, and started playing the game, on iOs in its 2013 iteration.  I have bought the game each year since for play on my iPad. Over the course of the last three-plus years, I have certainly played the game for **thousands** of hours, and my opinion of its core game remains unchanged after all this time. The game is, IMHO, the best football game ever created. I am 54 years old, and have been playing football games my whole life----electric football games, board games (e.g. All-Pro Football, Tudor's Football Strategy, Scrimmage, etc), computer-based (MSFL, Playmaker on the Mac, Quarterback Club, NCAA Football, the 'NFL series,' Axis, Madden x 20+ years), etc, etc, etc.Where the game knocks it out of the park is in its coaching sim and mechanics----NO game has ever done it better. It dances on that razor's edge between complexity and playabilty.   Within a few hours you can learn (but hardly master) the UI so that you can choose a huge variety of offensive and defensive assignments on the fly  in between every play without getting overwhelmed by the details.  Not even flashy AAA titles like the latest Madden does this as adeptly as PSF.  The flexibility of the play-calling interface allows for an amazing variety in play outcomes.  When you come down to it, it is the turn-based, chess-like nature of football that separates it from all other sports, and PSF captures the coach-vs-coach mind game *incredibly*  well. Notice I have not said anything about the front office aspects of the game, nor do I intend to. I have not played the game long enough with those features to reliably comment on them.The graphics are simplistic, but servicable.   If you are looking for graphics, or in-play twitch control, just get Madden 20XX.   My only current request for the game, a feature which has also  been missing from the last couple of iOS versions, is online MP, which is a real hoot with a fellow football fanatic. Hopefully the dev. will address this with a future update.Is the game worth $35?  Well, it is to me.... as I said, I have played this game's earlier incarnations for literally thousands of hours over the last three years, so based merely on an analysis of cost vs. hours played, this game's value is waaay up there in among my all-time favorite games....Civ II, HOMM2/3, Disciples series, Diablo series, Mafia I/II, the Souls' series,  etc. etc. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
