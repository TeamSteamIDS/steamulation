												Enjoyable if you like shooting dice.  Has a few kinks to workout, but I won a bunch and then lost it all.  Just like the real thing. 8.5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game if you want to play some craps outside of Vegas. Feels like you're back in the casino. If only they could make someone to bring me drinks.			",38,2,0,1,5,0,6

												If you like craps or have a passing interest, then I'd recommend this game.  The game is fully functional and enjoyable.  The developers are also active and responsive and this is only the beginning.			",61,13,2,6,33,2,12

												It seems to be a good craps simulation but with zero guidance if you don't know the game ... which I do not.  I was hoping this game could teach me but I know less now then when I started.			",489,63,22,31,13,4,16

												I have been playing craps for +15 years and this game has some really solid look and feel.  The chip managment and mechanics need work BUT its the framework to what could be an amazing multiplayer casino game is they embrace:Multiplayer Support In Single Casino SettingMultiple Table GamesAudio support by distance of playersFull body avatars of playersAllow players to be the dealer to earn their chips back.I think all of us advid casino players should jump on board with this and support the developer to make it happen.

												Overall it gives a great feeling of playing the game. You can even set the dice/throw one at a time. The biggest problem is that the dice physics are really bad. The dice seem heavy and soft and its nothing like real dice throwing. To add to the immersion, i would change the computer generated voice announcing the numbers to actual audio of people saying the common phrases dealers say when announcing craps rolls. All in all, would definitely recommend this to Vive users that enjoy or want to learn craps, but please dont stop polishing it!. if you create a blackjack one with a game mode where you can bet multiple chairs and practice counting cards, id buy that too!

												Craps is my favorite casino game and this VR version lives up to my expectations. The latest update makes it much easier to rebet/press bets and the new casino environment looks amazing! The developers are very active and they actually listen to what we end users have to say. I'll be purchasing just about any app they come up with...especially add-on games for this casino environment. Download this game now and enjoy having a craps table/casino in the privacy of your own home!			",18,11,1,1,9,2,0
