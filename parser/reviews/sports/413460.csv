												Very buggy. Should not be released.I wish Steam could give some of these titles a brief test.This thing is frozen at about week 6 of recruiting.Does not advance, can't save, just have to exit out.			",24,20,4,42,60,1,28

												Like many of the others reviewing this, I also found it to crash. I didn't even get to any actual games before it crashed the first time, and every time I load it up it crashes again, and starting a new file crashes it.			",8,1,0,1,21,0,1
