												This game is a hidden gem on Steam. Let me start by saying I'm not a fan of the Steam review system. Quite often you see reviews from people with less than 1 hour in a game and whether positive or negative there's just no way that review is accurate. There's also the possibility of abuse and I think most of us have seen that as well. It's just not a trustworthy way of knowing whether a game has value or not. Playtime versus Price. That's the best way to judge a game imo. As you can see from my hours played this game has that in abundance.World Boxing Manager is a simple yet addictive, old school feel, text based game. It's not easy to understand when you begin but it's not that difficult to figure out before long. It doesn't have shiny graphics or anything 3D. It's not going to set the world on fire either and I'll admit, I doubted the game when I began playing. For $5 I figured it wouldn't be that good and that carried over into the first couple of hours playtime. I was wrong. It's a really good game and it's certainly worth the price being asked. If I had one complaint it would be the lack of a tutorial, but that's certainly not enough reason to dislike the game. It has a ""Help"" page but it's lacking. Other than that the game really doesn't have any glaring flaws. The fight engine is excellent. The training system is good. The matchmaking system is good. The marketing system is excellent. The fight instructions are good and seem to work properly. All in all everything works great for a text based game. The biggest problem is those things aren't explained very well on the Help page. Hopefully Aggroblakh will address this issue but either way, everything functions well once you understand how they work and it makes for a lot of fun. Anyway, I believe WBM is well worth the small price being asked. For $5 it's a steal. Thanks, and good gaming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the money this is a 100% no brainer purchase.  With some more patches and improved UI e.g. better display of data without having to goto 2 different screens.  This will be legend.  The fight engine seems pretty solid.  You should buy this and support the developer, so he continues to develop on the product.			",48,9,2,17,17,1,22

												I love finding hidden gems like this one. Is it perfect? Of course not, for the price, but it's addictive as hell and a very solid game. A few bells and whistles, improve the UI, and make it a tad more immersive and this is an A plus. This is great for fans of Front Office Football, OOTP, etc, and doesn't take a back seat to any of them, just needs a little more polish. This guy has a bright future and I'm gonna watch what he does next. Thanks for a great game that can only get better. rock solid. ",10,7,2,4,13,0,6

												Very enjoyable, the more i play the more i am getting into it. Relative to the price its a great buy, considering its an indie developer that has been actively working on the game in response to feedback its a great buy, relative to all the rubbishy 'sim/manager' games out there its a great buy.For £4 its hard to complain, i feel like i find one of the hidden gems among all the crap out on steam.

												I enjoy the game, I think that there is too much downtime in the early game though, and the fighter's themselves could be a bit more dynamic.   The fight engine is fairly strong ,there are perhaps too many uppercuts and rear-hooks from the outside but the tactics and damage system are interesting.  It is somewhat difficult to follow which fighter is being more effective from just the PBP though.I think that having more starting options, level of starting prestige or funds, and more customization during gym creation, the addition of gym traits of some kind for example, would be beneficial.Also, if a fighter is two pounds over at the day of weigh-ins, they can cut that through water, and even if they don't the whole fight will likely not be scrapped.

												Great concept, poorly executed, this game couldve been amazing, unfortunatly it isnt detailed enough in regards to finances, matchmaking and boxing language i.e (the use of rear hook instead of left hook or right hook) using real existing boxers and organisations could've taken this game to the next level i understand there may be branding/copyright issues but it would have made a massive improvement, the main gripe i have about this game is the amount of time you have to lose skipping each day it becomes very tedious after a while and makes you want to give up on the game, it would have been much better if you could just choose a training category and simulate until the day of the fight, where as instead you have to skip each day one after another while random boxers that have no connection to you whatsoever are given simulated outcomes, ive played this game now for 2 hours and i cant play anymore as it is unenjoyable and unrealistic, one thing to note though it is only £4 so what do you expect, i had high hopes for this when i saw it in the steam store and its turned out to be a let down, unfortunately i highly doubt i will ever click its play button again.

												Probably the most indepth boxing manager game I have come across with a developer who is continually improving the game and taking on ideas (very refreshing)Still a few UI things that need improving that will vastly improve it and also there are various features with training and sparring that could be improved but overall it is an excellent little game and the developer is underselling himself pricing it at just £3.99 in my view!One thing that I would like to see looked at is something a bit more substantial on the financial/ gym / equipment side of things.  Once you have bought everything (which you can do pretty quickly) money actually becomes completely irrelevant.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A little but fine indie game.It could be interesting or not, basing on someone opinion of some pro and cons.Yes, it's not a pro product, but it's the best 5€ priced game I've bought so far.I recommend it to text-sim lovers, but I admit some design choices are pretty strange and difficult to accept and, at the same time, the game is priced... correctly.

												As a boxing fan and manager games fan I like boxing manager games and I am glad i ran into this so fast after being released on steam. In the past there was some games that interface looked better then World Boxing Manager (WBM) has but they were not as realistic as WBM! As well the dev keep updating the game with suggestions of us so im pretty sure this will be the best boxing manager so far if it is not already.The game cost of 1 or 2 beers so I gladly took it and it is one of those games that you are more then satisfied with buy and price and quality!I recommend this game to all you boxing lovers that love sweet science!

												Gem of a game for its price. A bit hard to pick up at first but if you have played any other sims game it shouldn't be too hard.The developer keeps updating it with small things at least once a month.If you are a boxing fan this is a must!			",32,0,2,5,5,0,0

												Had the game a few weeks and keep dipping in and out.The premise is excellent and the foundations are all there. Couple of issues have been rectified and the game is improving all the time. The dev comes across very well and obviously is committed to making the game even better. I think full screen is a big miss and I hope this can be added, I have a few issues seeing text at times too as it desn't seem scaled quite right. Overall though this is a decent game as is and at £4 is a steal really. 7/10.			",3,2,1,5,25,2,8

												After the developer made a much needed improvement with the sim time I can now say I fully recommend this game. Its very addicting and fun, I like the way you can manage boxers from all around the world and at the same time work on different aspects of managing a gym from marketing, budgeting and improving your gym to help boxers train better. Its very addicting and worth more then iits listed price. A true hidden gym here on Steam and a must get for all your simulation manager type gamers out there. This will long be a go to classic in my collection. I look forward to more games by this developer and any welcomed improvements to this already excellent game.			",60,25,0,44,44,1,38

												Nice game like it so far im 18-0  as a coach one of them has 16-0-5 ko the other 2-0-2 ko. It starts slow but then you get richer after each fight didnt fought for a belt yet cant wait and see what happens.It would be nice if the devloper will add the height of your boxer like taller guy has a bit better jabs and crosses agains smaller guy and smaller guy has better hooks and uppercuts just an idea im throwing in but overall good game for the money you paid for.i played fight night round 4 ps3 this all type of boxer:Inside Fighter,Outside Fighter,Brawler,Counter-Puncher,Unconventional,Boxer and Boxer Puncher.Defense style:Text book ,Philly Shell and Cross.All Styles:Upright,Balanced,Textbook,Peek-A-Boo,Power,Wild,Mummy,Speed,Slickster,Smooth,Hyper and Crazy each has their strenghs and bonuses this is where i got it from this game manual page 2 ,3 giving ideas:     http://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Microsoft_Xbox_360//Manual/formated/Fight_Night_Round_4_-_2009_-_Electronic_Arts.pdf ",8,2,2,3,15,0,9

												I really enjoy this game. The UI is rather simple and fighter/gym development is slow, but it is very rewarding to watch your fighter win after putting time into him. The developer seems active, so we can only expect further improvements.P.S. I would love to see a game like this except in a MMA-type setting.			",22,6,0,7,13,0,25

												My first ever review on Steam, I'll be short.If you like simplistic text-based sim like the old editions of Football manager, or more recently, Age of Gladiators( only with more depth), the slow and grinding process of starting from the bottom of the ladder and meticulously building your way onto the world stage and looking for hours to burn, it's worth a Big Mac.To me, it's worth a medium rare at the Ritz. A cult game in the making.			",2,12,1,7,9,1,3

												A really fun game which is value for money and reminiscent of the old text based games that I used to love so much.  A few minor issues during gameplay in respect of the smoothness of the game itself which I am sure the developer will resolve and improve over time.  Had lots of fun getting to grips with it and would recommend it to those that love text based play.			",1,0,0,0,6,0,9

												How tf do i matchmake fights, it keeps saying ""Connot book a co-main event or a undercard match for an event that does not exist, since these match types are supplementary to the main event""I try to book the fight with muliple opponents and multiple dates and it still say i can't book the fight due to ^ that same reason.

												About 21 hours so far. For 5 bucks you can't buy a buger and fries and they will only last a few minutes. If you like strategy you will probable get some enjoyment out of it. If you liked Capitalism you sould enjoy it for a while anyway. It does start a little slow and takes awhile to get your money up and going, but if you match up the right fights you can get there sooner. Their is some things I would like to skip but in real life you can't skip ahead either.  I think it's worth the price. (Copperdollar)			",16,4,3,4,18,1,13

												I cant reccomend the game until a few issues get fixed. Most game is skip tut's because i honestly dont need them. This game desperately needs one but does not have one. You can maybe figure things out on your own but honestly you probably will need outside resources of which there are few for this game. Secondly even for the things you can figure out certain things make no sense. When matchmaking you can send one request with one fighter and have to see if they accept or decline. While i understand why i would have liked a system where you send requests to multiples and priortize them. Because the thing about it is the person will most of the time in my experince decline even if we are around the same level of ability, rank and renown. Then the game does not notify you they decline, only if they accept. So then you have to waste another day trying to send out another match. After you get a mtach you have to get them down to weight, which guess what isnt clear how to do again beacuse of no tut. I havent been able to progress this cycle. I will not refund the game though i should on principle because i really want to like it. Please dev if you read this take these factors into consdideration as i love management games and esepcially boxing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
