								Bugbear means Flatout series, Flatout series means lots of fun, both alone and with your friends.Even in alpha stage this game is really challenging: after the first few laps the track gets filled with debris and wreckages, and holding the 1st position when the other 10 remaining cars try to ram you into oblivion is a pretty tough job.Not mentioning the demolition derby. That's just mental.In the actual state, you can drive and tune 3 different cars and take part in both races (on gravel and tarmac tracks, straight and reverse route) and mosh pits (in 3 different arenas) in different weather and time of the day. There is also a figure-8 jump race. You can race against up to 23 opponents.This is the new generation Flatout.EDIT: as of 2/12/14, the game is still poorly optimized.I know it's still in an alpha state, and good thing the introduction of multiplayer, new cars and a WiP track, but please, if a dev will ever read this, focus on optimizing the game: I have a FX-9370 and 2x ASUS R9 270X in Crossfire and with medium settings, 20 cars, 1920x1080, the framerate sits between 30 and 50 FPS.

								Please stop defending bugbear like they are actually working on this game in good faith. They are not. At best, they've kept an intern on it releasing a new car or track once a quarter. It is unethical to sell an early access game to tons of people, then to almost completely abandon it to work on yet another early access game - http://www.wreckfestgame.com/stuntfest/. That's right. Instead of working on finishing this game, they've been working on creating yet another Early Access game, one which they will probably never finish either. Please do not support unethical developers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								One word : AMAZING !!BugBear come back at the top !!A kind of Flatout but more realistic, closer to Destruction Derby 2 but... more realistic !Vehicle behavior is just fantastic, impacts are accuracy, the laws of physics are outstanding, no object passes through another !A subtle driving, you can disable some assistances and drive in manual transmission !24 cars on the track and everything works with astonishing fluidity !AI is smart and unpredictible !Engine sounds are very good (love this damn american V8 !)A real inside view allowing you to see in 360 degrees !We feel that the game is made by passionnates to the slightest details !Definitely, if you love to drive powerful rusty cars, don't wait and support these awesome devs !!...

								Made by the flatout devs. Technology Sneak Peek is worth it just for the money itself. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in it, test the physics, is just pure fun. The destruction on the cars I the best I've seen. There's not many tracks at the moment, but right now its only pre-alpha and they're adding more onto based on their development roadmap.Highly recommended if you're looking for a racing game with lots of destruction.

								Let me start of by stating this is actually pre-alpha. However, it is extremely badass and very promising despite the complete lack of content it shows a lot of promise. Next-car game offers much for a game so early in its development, the physics engine is second to none and the handling on the cars feels like it's getting there. The pre-alpha even boasts a photo mode to capture all the carnage, and looks like it will support lots of lens effects and photo editing tools too. Neat! Verdict: One to watch. Don't hesitate to buy if you support development. Very promising.7.5/10 ",372,95,31,62,56,2,76

								Great potential, just like any other games that's still in pre-alpha. It's fun for a very short while and then the outstandingly low amount of content quickly makes you wonder how a game that needed 350.000$ to get done with a kickstarter, that ended up earning over 1.000.000$ in sales in only ONE week (In January 2014 when it was released as early access) can still be in in such a poor state. Considering development started in 2012 for this game, how much more money or time do you need to get out of pre-alpha?Another good example of how buying unfinished products is bad for the industry.

								New info first:They have finally released the major update. Lot of things have changed. More cars and tuning possibilities. New graphics ect. (read update reports). -The game doesnt feel the same now. (No... It's even better after new updates)-Graphics are nice and smooth now. Better than it was.-Car physics still needs bit of a work to do but the feel of chaos is intense again.-Online gaming is lot smoother and less laggy than it wasBUT.... Devs had a lot of work to get that new stuff to work and now they can focus on polishing it and releasing a new content. Oh and I almost forgot! New team racing mode feels really refreshing and fun. Im sorry that I crashed in to my teammates couple of time and they ended into drive in bonfires, but I lost the control of my car... :PThis really is a really good game at this stage, but need a lot of work to do before finished! I will highly recommend this game to anyone who likes to drive!My older review below:Great physichs! Beautiful graphics! Extremely fun to play! Lots.... and I mean LOTS of car parts and trash flying! (<-In a nutshell) This game is an experience that reminds me a bit of first Flatout, but is so much more. Control of the car feels good and theres lots of potential to be a game of the year. In a 24 player race after two laps theres so much trash and car wrecks on the road that makes it hard to get to the goal or avoid crashing. And when you crash and stop others behind you can hit you hard and it might be the end of the race for you. AI is really good and it makes mistakes as well and its fun to watch them crashing when you gain better position. They drive pretty good too and its not so simple thing to be #1. Derby is fun but I prefer racing more. In a derby the cars will be totally rasins after the round. Even too much if you are too serious but at the end it really doesent matter. Its so much fun anyway. In the early access theres now 2 race tracks, 2 cars and a derby arena. It isnt much but I still keep playing. This feels so fresh and welcoming after all crappy car games and NFS games what cant give you anything new. Cant wait when this pearl is ready!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								About 2 years ago i bought a ""Promise"".... I saw the Sneak Peek 2.0 and i loved it! Remembering the good old times with Flatout i thought to my self ""This is what i want and i will support it."", so i bought the ""Early Access Game. And for a while it was good. But since we are in a ""Early Access Game"" things can change completley. Im sitting here and watching this Slideshow from screenshots out of the game today and i ask my self ""Where is all that stuff from the screenshots that BUGBEAR is showing and advertising?!?"".Since the grand ""Overhaul"" of the whole game engine and concept, this game turned in to a racing simulator. There are no more chrashes like on the screenshots. No flying physics particles and parts or wheels. There is no flying ragdolls or cardeformations like on these Screenshots you are looking at. The whole game is stripped of this. It is a bad unfinished racing simulator where you get penalties when you touch the gras on the side of the road.  It is hard as hell and BORING as♥♥♥♥♥♥ It turned from a fun carnage wreckfest in to a boring Simulator. The new engine has a problem with NVIDIA cards of the 700 series. The whole screen flickers and makes the game almost unplayable. This issue is reported more than 7 months ago from many people, NO change in this direction til today. There are Forumposts from people who have older cards of the 600 generation, they cant even play this garbage with playable framerates. I dont understand (well actualy i do) why Bugbear still shows these Screenshots here. There is nothing like this in the game at all. Exept the screenshots from the Sneak Peek 2.0 but the Sneek Peak is nothing like the real game today. This is also something that puzzles me, why dont they say that the Sneak Peek 2.0 is nothing like the real game. Why dont they correct this missunderstanding and make a Sneak Peek 3.0. The 2.0 Version is not even the same engine as the new one. I is a straight out LIE! I understand that it still is unfinished and that things will change in the future and all the bugs i mentioned will disapear but the game like they are showing on these Screenshots and in the Sneak Peek 2.0 does not exist.My final verdict: Don't buy this game if you wanted a fun racer with tonns of chrashes and carnage. Don't buy this until they finish their work.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Players need to understand about the fun of this game is that it is more challenging but also more rewarding to try to actually overtake someone by using more clever racing lines. I mean, just ramming into someone is easy but what is the motivation behind it? You don't actually become better driver by doing it. It's more likely you just ruin your own race when the cars get stuck due to the 'glue effect'. If you want to wreck the cars, there are derby races for it.In addition, I'd like to point out that the fun in racing isn't only about the results. Racing against someone who drives approximately as fast as you is more rewarding than dominating a race. I once got to race wheel-to-wheel with someone on the Tarmac track for almost two whole laps, and despite finishing second, that was one of the highlights of my online racing career. No stupid ramming, just cars overtaking each other with only minor banging of wheels, with both drivers leaving enough space to keep the racing neat and tidy  :)That is what this game should be about. Wreckfest offers a good framework for clean racing with its driving physics, but also with its damage model: the cars can undergo a few collisions with essentially no loss of speed or drivability. This is what many racing games such as iRacing lack. They can have better physics but the cars may become undrivable after a small contact. In addition, racing is not bound to tarmac circuits, but takes place on several terrain types, such as mud and sand.			",99,11,5,10,7,0,17

								This game is propably never going to be finished. Bugbear is currently on the brink of going bankrupt and they're trying grab money from people any way they can.They recently announced another game like this called Stuntfest. Think about it. They run out of money to finish this, so they made up another game to grab money for it, but a struggling small studio can't possibly handle two games at the same time. Then they also announced console versions for Wreckfest to try to grab money from the console players. They are just trying to get as much money as they can before their ship sinks. Bugbear is not the same studio it was years ago. Don't let their history fool you. Don't let them cheat your money. It's time to let go.And this is coming from someone who used to love Wreckfest and was a Bugbear fan.Who knows, maybe I'm just dead wrong and they actually pull this off and release the game in a year or two, but right now, that seems very unlikely.

								Full rant: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheZeronShow/discussions/7/341537388320933636/This is a placeholder recommendation for now, I will eventually post a more detailed and precise review about the game itself.Needed to make this placeholder review just to inform everyone not to buy this game until Bugbear cleans up their act. It's unfortunate that I have to do this, but I can't just sit here without exposing Bugbear for their shady practices that have been haunting the game's development.After many years, the game is still an unfinished mess, Digital Deluxe backers still don't have their perks and now... they made a new game and they are already developing consoles versions of Wreckfest without finishing the PC version first. It's clear that they are squeezing as much money as they can right now, so they blatantly screw their customers without giving a rat's butt about their reputation.The new game they made, is free for people who backed Wreckfest on their site. YET, people like me who bought the game on Steam for the same price, don't get the new game for free. There's no way, anyone in this planet can think this is fair. They don't care about their Steam customers, otherwise we would get the same perks. I've had enough with Bugbear and I certainly won't buy anything else from them unless they clean up their act.If you're reading this and you still don't own the game, wait until the moment they say the game is complete. I really want to know if they have the guts to call this complete in early 2017 (which is the date that's being rumoured right now) despite having at least one more year of work for this game to be truthfully complete.Do NOT defend Bugbear's evil practices, this is what's ruining gaming nowadays.

								Next Car Game: Wreckfest is one of those games that you don't see often now-a-days.Next Car Game: Wreckfest is the spiritual successor to Destruction Derby 2 for the PlayStation 1 (In my opinion of course)I've had tons of fun with this game, not only do I feel like the cars have great handling (Even though sometimes they can feel a bit floaty) but the sensation of smashing into other cars in the arenas is amazing. SLAM! POW! BANG!There's some good challenges in the game as well, winning the tarmac race can be quite difficult and being the last one in the arenas is quite hard to do as well however I do really love the game no matter how bad I am at it.But, the game is not perfect, long from being it. I mentioned before that the cars might feel floaty at times and the game really hogs all the power from your computer. It's not a game for all computers. (I run it at 55 fps on almost ultra with my GTX 750ti and 45-50 on ultra)With that said, lets just get to the pros and cons.Pros: Tons of fun (smashing into cars and half-drifting around corners) Great physics Great damage on cars Sound effects are amazing One of the best car wrecking games out thereIn between: Graphics compared to how much power it needs Cars can be floaty from time to time The variety of tracksCons: Uses way too much power for what it really is. A game like ""The Crew"" uses less right now. (The beta version) Computer AI can be a bit douchy from time to time. The variety of cars Not a great racing game (But a god damn good wrecking game)Notes: This game is in my opinion the spirital successor to Destruction Derby 2 and Test Drive: Eve of Destruction.I would recommend you using a controller or a steering wheel. Playing with a keyboard is no fun.Always have manly liquor near you when you play this game. Minimum requirement is beer.			",239,58,36,37,27,4,23

								November 2016 Update! The classic Flatout stunt mode is now a seperate early access game! Still being packaged with the original Sneak Peak 2.0 and video! We're now never going to get only half the game we were promised. Bugbear's entire team should be blacklisted from the industry for this absurd fraud. I wouldn't♥♥♥♥♥♥on them if they were on fire. The game still runs like trash. Game continues to look worse. Damage models based on highly accurate plasticine cars. BeamNG is already lightyears ahead of this festering sewer of a game and being updated at a significantly faster rate. Wreckfest is so♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's retroactively ruined the good Bugbear games for me. Another half a year gone, and Wreckfest is still an unfinished mess. Soon it's failed development will surpass the development time of every Flatout game combined. This May 2016 update contains little new, because the game contains litte new. First, let me totally clear. This game is now nothing like the Flatout Racing games that they sold it as back in 2014. As it stands today, it's a playable mess. The only thing worthwhile I've gotten out of was the Sneak Peek 2.0. Graphics are solid, but dated despite the new engine and performance is dreadful across the board. The confusion of an arcade destruction racer drunkenly switching to a clean racing sim style game in late development has left the game playing like crap. Gone is the delightful destruction, but the physics are sub-par for a clean racing sim, and the change in collision physics mean you can be t-boned and then pushed around the track for entire laps incapable of escape except by reseting.And about those big engine changes and the updates to clean racing sim. They're weak excuses at best, and damned lies most likely. It's the latest in a very long stream of weak rationales offered up by the developers for why they've done little and released less. Around the time of my first major review, the excuse was major overhauling because people wanted the final game to keep the 24 person races featured in the earliest releases. (Apparently only there for stress testing and not originally intended for release). They've released more excuses for not making cars than they have cars.This developers have adopted a 'take the money and wander off drunkly' approach. They haven't utterly abandoned the game, they were prepared with a shameless cash grab upate announcement for the Steam Summer Sale. Don't hold out hope and don't make excuses. The game has been in development for four years. In early access for two years. It only took two years to make Flatout 2. This isn't some first time indie dev, Bugbear's previous titles have easily grossed over 100 million dollars in sales. They don't deserve your money, or mine. I can't get mine back, so I'll keep coming back and updating my review. I'll have to add a video special in another two years, once this game has taken as long as all of the Flatout games Bugbear made, COMBINED.Bugbear used to make good games, but their last full release (Ridge Racer Unbounded) was a disaster that took six years development. Hop over and look at how it turned out. The reviews are strangely prophetic as Wreckfest tries to be a strange mix of racing sim and destruction, the same poorly handling blend described in Ridge Racer Unbounded's numerous reviews.

They have the nerve to charge full price for a game that has been stuck at the level of basically a demo with no hint at making any progress towards completion. I (foolishly) bought this game two years ago based on the promise of the sneak preview, and it remains to this day the only decent thing to have come out of this purchase.

								My probelm with this game is that in every way it is not worth $30. I put in about $5 when it was in kickstarter and it's totally worth that but anyone who paid $30 got ripped. They will never finish this game, it was their toy, and now that they have made some money on what is now an outdated game, they will do what they have done with other games and move on. It's a shame, but it's true.HOWEVER, this game could be a ton of fun with very little work involved. make the game as-is right now but add the ability to download from a third party, cars and tracks and for gods sake fix the damn MP to function. Every time i join a race I'm all psyched thinking ""i have a ping of 50 this race should be incredible"" only to be disappointed when the screen constantly flutters and my car jumps around on the track and i have momentary loss of all control over the car for a half second at a time.Even more idiotic is the control scheme. they have (what i can only imagine) is gear selections for someone with an H shifter (6 gears+ reverse) however, there is no clutch binding, rendering that useless, and if you go with some sort of sequential, you might as well just select automatic, because the shifts are so slow I could complete a lap around one of the Oval tracks before someone could shift from reverse to 5th gear and back... just kinda sad. it's like grandma is sitting in the passenger seat trying to shift the gears for you. There is no real support for axis controls. The throttle only really gets recognized at about 50% anything before that makes the engine do funny stuff like not work or sputter or just go full throttle, the steering axis seems to be the only one that works, and I'm pretty sure if you set an axis for handbrake it doesn't work at all. All of which the axis cannot be calibrated. This goes for any controller, xbox controller, wheel, doesn't matter, it just doesn't work well.Lastly, The soft body physics were supposed to be the spotlight of the game yet they are an embarassment to anyone in the animations world because it's so terrible and fake. The cars deform, but not realistically. Watch some video's of Beam.NG that is true car deformation. This game should have that, but instead it is as if your car is build from some kind of metal that after it gets hit with ""x"" amount of force it turns into putty and then back hard. It's laughable, and somwhat comical at times, but to be honest I would rather the frame break or a wheel fall off than to have some warped up car with two wheels still able to drive at full speed even though the engine is bent at a 45° angle and would not function any longer. Yes it's supposed to be a goofy game, but how goofy do we really want it to be?That brings up another point. The devs brag about a tire model to make it realistic yet show no concern to make the game realistic. I think the devs got lost somewhere and didn't know what to do, and to be honest I think it was when they started selling the game. I think they said ""heck with making what we started, let's just conform to our target market"" and that tarket market is somewhere between chimps on cocaine and Sim racers looking to goof off, which would actually be a great discription of how this game is made. Some parts are super awesome, other parts seem to have came out of a coloring book.I'm just not sure what this game is or isn't supposed to be and every time you go to mention an issue with the game on any forum, you will be blasted for questioning it. I don't see how so many people can drink the kool-aid thinking this game will be finished when it took nearly a year for a single update to drop on this game. Let's face it a year between updates means they don't care anymore, regardless of what they post on their website.			",68,3,12,0,4,1,5

EDIT 21/04/2017Think the game is abandoned? Think again https://twitter.com/bugbeargames/with_repliesThink 3 years in EA is the reason to downvote the game? Think again Think the game has gradually got worse and the ""wrecking part of the game"" was removed? Think again

			Views: 4,002		



These are the reasons why I think people are just being too harsh towards this game.That said, if you are into banger racing and crashes, keep an eye on this game and get it when it will be released. You won't be disappointed. I totally understand that slow development is usually NOT a good thing. The game had an engine and physics overhaul which stopped development for a while back in 2015, but it has gone back to more regular updates since Q1 2016. Many games like Wreckfest (even non-Early Access ones) have been revisited during development: The Getaway, Duke Nukem Forever, Team Fortress 2, Prey, Persona 5 (5 years because of brand new engine, exactly like Wreckfest), just to name a few. Heck, there has been a rumour recently which states that everything CD Projekt Red did with Cyberpunk 2077 before 2016 has been cancelled.  So, saying that the game is abusing the Early Access program, for me, is just pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.PS: the survey shows that most players are happy with the current direction of the game: https://twitter.com/bugbeargames/status/849206001526075392Remember: being worried is one thing, spreading misinformation is another.

								Sadly I have to change my positive review to one that is now negative.  The game used to be real fun, you could load it up get straight into an online race and race and smash your way around the track!!  So great!!Now the devs seem to have implemented some type of rpg career type mode in the MP!!!  This means that you start off with a slower less powerful car and race against others with better faster cars.  Your car will become damaged now and you have to finance the replacement of new parts.  It seem you get most money from playing singe-player.  So back to that mode to get some money to be able to go back in multiplayer.Why would devs make it like this?A lot of people just want to online race, not screw about replacing body parts and having the other people on the start line having faster cars!!!If the devs realise the error of their way I will rewrite this review, but this mechanic in the game completly breaks the game.

								ATTENTION: Bugbear will start doing monthly updates for this game, starting this month, February. They found a full-time funder, so they can really start cranking this thing. More info here: http://www.wreckfestgame.com/wreckfest-december-update/Anyways, I have always enjoyed this game. I have had it for a while, and I have enjoyed most of it. Yes, it has been in ""early access"" for longer than any of us wanted. However, I think the future will be brighter for this game than it has the last few years. At least I hope so.If you are looking for an all-contact racing game, this is your game, as long as you can run it. My GTX 970 on the highest settings on 1080p, I get 40-60 fps. The driving in this game is very heavy, unlike its predecessors. You can really feel it when you hit another car head on. There isn't a whole lot of content in it- about 5 tracks and about 10 cars. The AI are brutal drivers, so you have to fend them off (or go on the offensive) while staying on the track. There is a multiplayer, but I don't think it is too populated. If this game interests you, or your rig might not be able to run it, you should also look into Flatout 1, Flatout 2, and Flatout Ultimate Carnage. They are more arcade-y and lead to more intense racing.Edit: Here's a link to Bugbear's twitter so you can see what they are working on: https://twitter.com/bugbeargamesHere's my part list for reference: http://pcpartpicker.com/b/Xthqqs ",92,1,5,9,4,0,1

								Just tested the 2016 December update. The game is becoming more bland, dull and nothing like FlatOut series.I know one shouldn't be expected to keep producing the same thing, but FlatOut was fun. This is creeping into ""serious"" destruction derby business, trying to be somewhat a simulation. And not being very good or engaging at it. Even the recent update to Gravel 1 track just removed a ton of fun and interesting feautres - less objects on the side of the track to crash into, the track edges are less dangerous. The AI seems to be way more passive and ""serious"", causing less accidents. At this point I'm not even sure, why I'm not playing GRID.And to top it all off, they decided to make a separate game for ragdoll events. So the game I bought hoping for FlatOut like experience is getting further away from FlatOut, and now they're making another game that is just a tiny fraction of FlatOut, and no real FlatOut successor on the horizon. Why on earth would you call this mess the ""next car game?""And after completing the december survey, it seems, that the developers are more interested whether they should add new rim mods, or new paint jobs for the cars, instead of worrying about the gameplay (track) design.Please, make the game fun! Focus on track design. Then career. Leave modifications for the last part. Now they've added forced progression which locks out a ton of cars, so you have to play the game to even test out things that are in this pre-aplha(!) build. Poor gameplay design, and yet, a progression system in a test build! It's ludicrous.TLDR: It's not fun.			",176,32,5,7,23,0,15

								What an absolute disappointment of a game. What happened to you Bugbear? I bought this game under the promise of getting the next Flatout game, from the original devs. The original alpha build was fantastic fun, with an emphasis of destruction of vehicles and unpredicatable car mayham. It was an absolute blast. What happened afterwards baffles me. I have no idea what happened to the devs and what happened to this game. The physics have completely changed, now making destruction minimal and not very fun. The arcadey fun racer has turned into a pseudo racing sim. Its been 2 years and next to nothing has been added. Even Flatout 3 was better than this mess. At least it had content.			",921,216,49,77,103,11,91

								Avoid right now. Devs don't handle early access business well. My worst early access experience to this date. Average time between content updates is something like half a year?Maybe someday it will leave early access and fully release. I hope so, as Flatout was my favourite racing series. But a this rate and pace this will not happen this year and I'm not sure about next year either. I'm not even sure they're going in right direction...So better wait.This is still my biggest early access disappointment. If I could I would refund it, even for only a fraction of what I paid for it. I would take that money and spent it on Assetto Corsa.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I´m a big fan of the Flatout series and I want to be honest. This game really makes a lot of fun but I think Bugbear Entertainment has some problems with this game. The update frequency is the worst i´ve ever seen in a Early-Access game and I think the devs just ignore all the great ideas that the community has. They sad the game will be finished early 2017 but when the game only gets 2 updates in 1 year I don´t think they´re gonna make it. I really hope they´re going to finish this game next year and I would be glad when it gives me a smile on the face like Flatout do.

								This game has been wasting space on my hard drive for two years. Sure, this game has brought me some fun moments, and I think it has potential to become a great game. But for now, please spend your money on something else. Between when I bought it in April of 2014 and now, there have not been very many major updates. There was a physics ""re-working"" (although it feels about the same) and a few new tracks, even ragdoll physics. But at this moment in time, I can't say what I spent on this game was worth it. If this game becomes a finished product, then you can consider purchasing it, but please don't buy it now. This is the way of Early Access titles these days. You buy it hoping for something great and fun, and for a little bit it is. But after you realize that the development team has taken your money and ran, you feel forgotton, and you surely are.

								What happened, BugBear? You gave us Flatout, probably the greatest, most fun racing game series of all times that conquered hearts of many, including mine. For me Flatout 2 will always be the one and only out there. When GameSpy support was shut down and multiplayer became nomore, people almost forgot about you, yet kept playing your games. The fans found a way to play online even after the official online support was cut off. You know what it's called? Devotion. And also approval, it reflects the quality of your product, of your hard work that's been put into it to deliver. A silent thankful tribute to what you once did. You actually managed to do something incredible back then. Then after several years you came out of nowhere with NCG and made such a hype with this new project of yours, which was understandable, people remembered who gave them Flatout and supported you with EA. I heard you raised what, a couple millions at least?.. NCG was supposed to become a spiritual continuation, was supposed to become the new Flatout. But from the very first look at it, it was clear that something was wrong, at least for me. Something was terribly wrong. The far the worse, for the reasons unknown you've made that weird decision to overhaul the engine. Why, who asked for it? Did you do it in order to be able to have 24 players, i heard? Why, why such a need for such a mess on a track, whose idea was it? I think i know. That's a step towards the quantity over quality, which is never good. People on forums talk from your name. You know who i'm talking about, yes. Same people. All the time, everytime.  Why couldn't you just stick to the good old Flatout concept of yours? NCG doesn't have to be EXACTLY like your old games, but it's become clear enough that you don't know yourselves where you're going with it, you're completely lost. Your game is neither a hardcore sim nor a fun arcade. And let's be honest, your fans just wanted the new Flatout. Including myself. Why couldn't you just stick to what you knew how to do like nobody else and decided to re-invent a wheel, will always remain mystery. Your community tore itself apart due to your highly controversial decisions. And now look at it. All that's left from the communty now is a tiny group of people. One and a half person play your game, servers are empty and deserted, i heard. The very same people who write on the forums under EVERY SINGLE POST that  rightfully criticize your unfinished, ugly mess, because there are no other words for your... creation, if it may be called so.  And they behave aggressively. And it's noone's fault but yours. You've had it all, all you had to do is follow your own instructions, but no! You've failed your own concept! The key to success was right under your nose but you turned away.I loved you, but will refrain from buying your products in future, if there will be any, and for what you did i give you another negative review. You used to be awesome. What happened, BugBear?			",77,4,3,1,3,2,2

I understand you want the physics engine to be ""just right"" before you release it, but maybe devoting all of your assets to it and not giving your stakeholders ANYTHING to play with for 6 months? Not a good idea. Maybe have part of the team work on the physics engine while the other part can give us something new? Maybe now isn't the best time to do the hardest part of the game when we only have a few tracks and a few things to do?Your decisions are ruining this community, there is barely anyone playing multiplayer anymore!

								Please understand that this review is based on my perspective. As much as I'd love to give this game a thumbs up, I can't. Months ago, I would have gave it a thumbs up. Why? Because there use to be updates. Instead, they just stopped updating the game, took their cash, and said ""Screw you, fans!"" This game has great potential. The sad thing is that they threw that potential away and made this game a cash-grab.Pros: It has amazing physics and beautiful crashing damage.         A lot of customization options (Type of suspension, engine, etc)Cons: Very few vehicles          No updates in months          Keeps you entertained for only a few hours          No reward for winning a match These are what I could think of off the top of my head. I'm sure there are more. Stay away from this game for as long as possible. They don't deserve the money they have. You shouldn't give them any more money until they prove that they will be updating this game (at the most) every month. No developer should ever do this to their fans. This is complete selfishness.

I wanted to like this game, knowing Bugbear's calibre in the banger racing game scene...Wreckfest is a racing and smashing game inspired by the Demolition Derby series and Street Rod, aiming to provide a comprehensive banger racing experience. This being an Early Access title, it is subject to more bugs than released games.Menus aren't interesting enough. I feel like the buttons are too small. Keyboard and mouse navigation is ok, but gamepad users need to use the left stick to navigate sluggishly. You can open your car's boot, bonnet and doors for no reason other than to look at the things inside - if they allowed access to certain tuning categories and especially showed the engine change from upgrades, I'd like this feature more.Graphically, it lacks artistic flair but the technology is good. Something about the mildly muted colours puts me off from enjoying the rather spectacular impacts and particle effects. Engine sounds have an annoying, though admittedly somewhat realistic, tendency to be really quiet until you hit the high RPM band, then they're really loud. More diverse crash sound effects would be welcome. The same two songs we've heard for years are still the only actual music in this game.If you've played Flatout 1, 2 or Ultimate Carnage, the gameplay will feel pretty similar. It's either full contact racing or demolition derby arenas, with an added strategic layer as locational damage to your car's segments means you'll want to reverse into people to protect your vulnerable front end. The hybrid of locational damage and overall health strikes me odd, however, and cars can become wrecked if they lose both front wheels despite overall hit points being above half. The handling feels like too much of a simulation, with respect to banger cars not exactly being easy to drive. Shifting into reverse with a manual transmission is torture. This game initially had a Kickstarter campaign in, I believe, 2012 or 2013, but it was cancelled because it wasn't successful enough. In 2014, it hit Steam Early Access. The actual progress made on the game, to be honest, feels way too incremental. Major additions since the initial Steam version are: a rudimentary crew system, where you assign crew to each vehicle and allow maintenance on worn parts; multiplayer; several new cars and tracks; dozens of reworks for the handling and physics systems; and a Workshop page for mods and conversions. Bugbear insisted, initially, on avoiding the over-the-top ragdoll elements of Flatout so as to keep the age rating down... then we got lawnmower derbies, and wrecking or flipping tossed your driver around the field. What especially disappoints me about the €25 purchase I've made, is that now rumours are surfacing about Bugbear being in financial trouble and in danger of bankruptcy. What is most concerning is that they've also announced development on: two console versions of Wreckfest for the PS4 and XB1, AND a spin-off title, Stuntfest, which brings back Flatout's ragdoll tossing minigames as its selling point... and using the environment and many assets from the Wreckfest Sneak Peak Demo that you received if you purchased it from Early Access or Pre-ordered from their website. It's become clear to me that they're trying to cash in now while they still can. It's very unlikely that even a talented studio such as Bugbear could provide four games before running out of money. Oh and you need to buy Stuntfest separately, because pre-orders and EA purchases aren't getting Stuntfest. And to hammer the nail into the coffin, it increasingly feels like the addition of the Workshop to Wreckfest is so that the community picks up the game from where development will eventually cease, and make it into a ""complete game"", which I'm upset about. EDIT: Bugbear has announced that it is backed by a partner and it is now on track towards finalizing the game, in addition to openly acknowledging Wreckfest as its top priority. There might be hope for the game still, but until then, please refrain from buying it in its Early Access form.			",81,7,11,7,10,1,7

								People need to know, the reason they have not updated is because they have been currently re doing the entire physics engine for the game. They are redoing the entire core of the game itself. Also if you browse their forums, and browse their blog there is many upon many updates. Don't you think they find their own lack of updates disturbing? Thats why they have been teasing new tracks, new cars, and many other things. They havey an entire hallway dedicated to tracks. People just need to give them time because with this new Early access it throws many things in the Game making process off. Instead of making just 1 final build that people will play and update off of that final build. They have to make several final builds, and give those to the early access. They are trying to release a ""final game"" as their next update. Also if you check their forums, you'd find out why there has been lack of updates. They have cars falling from the sky, they also have things that would make a car halfway through a wall. Guys be Patient, i've seen what is coming (via the forums) and this wait will be worth it. This physics are already amazing, the cars and the tracks they have can make you playing for hours. Yes, you can only play so much with 5 cars, and i believe 7 tracks. Just think of it this way, they know the update is taking long. Don't you think they will put more and more things in this next build to make up for it? Also, once they re-do the engine, updates WILL be much more frequent. Just realize people. The base of the game is what takes the longest in game making. This is a recommended buy!As for those who obviously doesn't know how game development works, and how changing things especially the main physics of the game works, or how that can affect things, look at thishttp://nextcargame.com/week-16-report/Does this game still look fun to play? Maybe for the first 10 mins, within the first 50 meters, car disengration, let them do what they have been doing.			",203,19,17,24,26,2,22

								If you want to know where the game is at now days.. Look for Santa Clause.. You'll have better luck.So the game was awesome and they were going in a superb direction.. but BugBear have decided to stop all development and open the game out to modders.. A game that modders don't play as they are already in places like Race Department, Touring Pro series, Race2Play and the million of other PVT leagues / Communities places and on games like rFactor / Assetto..So you may get 100 mods but 99 of them will be crap and fan made and you MIGHT find a proper gem now and then.. when an actual modder picks the game up and works with it..So to sum it up.. ALL gaming development is on stop and they are adding things for the modders to use..Ohhh and the 30 to 40 players (on a good day) that are logged in playing the MP side.. Yeah. The modding is going to split up the small player base to Modded servers and non modded servers..YEY.. Let us download content that only 2 others are on.. Oh wait, they have changed the server.. download new mod..No thanks.REALLY Angry about this because this could of been the very best game of it's type.. now it's going to be rocking in the corner of the room because of the abuse it's sustained by BugBear.*Slow clap*			",52,9,12,0,15,3,6

								This is... or was what seemed to be a promising game... Loved all the Flatout games. I bought this game in hopes it was going to be put onto the same path... Excellence. The physics demo was cool. showed us all what they could do. but every so often i jump on to check out the updates... oh but wait... what updates? I bought this game 6/2/2015. and the only DECENT update was the multiplayer... but even than it was laggy and spikey all over the tracks. I understand this is an early access game. but lets get real... Bugbear needs to step up to there reputation and complete this game. The slack is real.I do not recomend this game until it has been finished. OR atleast closer to being finished			",173,13,5,11,14,0,8

Early Access Review
								I bought the game on sale about a year ago and it was a fun game, but there wasn't a lot of variations with the races. Since then, there's been a major patch, plus a lot of little ones, that have improves the difficulty of the game and added more variation. You can no longer simply hold the gas down the entire time and braking in tight curves is needed to avoid crashed. Speaking of crashes, the crashing and damage has been upgraded as well and now you can really feel the imact of the crashes. You no longer flip as easily as before the big patch, but it is still possible to roll in the right circumstance. It is still early access, but I think it is worth the money. I've certainly put in enough hours to enjoy the game.One last note: If you see any review from June 30th to July 7th or so, ignore it. The physics engine has changed a lot since the June 30th update. Cars are easier to control, crashes have more weight to them, cars are damaged in more extreme ways. In the two weeks since the June 30th major patch, there have been numerous improvements that make the early reviews out of date already.			",122,50,0,26,19,3,20

								NCG Wreckfest is one of the most fun arcade racing games i have played since probably Burnout Paradise back in 2009. this game captures the inner maniac in all of us and is a brilliant successor to the ""Flatout"" Series. not only is it fun to play with a keyboard, but it is also a challenging-yet-fun game once you plug your G27 or your Gamepad of choice into the USB Slot. overall, i would say that this game is well worth all the $30 that i spent on it, Keep up the good work BUGBEAR!

Early Access Review
								I really hoped that this game would push out some content, but after a year only a few minor changes have been implemented. It litterally feels as if one person takes a weekend a month to type in a few lines of code to keep this game updated to a bare minimum. Steam should really REALLY force to implement a system to get your money back and bankrupt studio's who pull off stunts like this. If you want to have an early access game, you are basically asking for a kickstart. Not finishing the product is basically stealing money from people who trust the studio. And when you steal my money, I want it back. Period. That or give me what I paid for, investing money in a great concept and finish a functional game. This trend where people try out game design and quit half way through is getting out of hand. Same with Cube World. One guy earns millions. Wife comlpains he should focus more on his family and he stops updating the game. Litterally nothing new has come out there as well. Paying money for tech demo's? Has the market really changed where the gamers themselves are the investors? Are we supposed to take the risk with our money to pay for, not only an unfinished product, but the chance they abandon the project as well?If you want to pay for a really nice and original tech demo 27,99 is 27,99 too much for this title. No updates. Half a demo with barely any content or game design. Abandoning your game is a gamers crime and should not be accepted. Steam should really work on a envirionment where the gamer is put on the first place and this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ behaviour stays unrewarded. Early acces should have a function that if too many people downvote the progress of this game, they should be able to get their money back. They are stealing from us while we trust them with our money. This is legal, but really should be made impossible. I know it's our choice to pay for it, but if the developer abandons the game the buyer should have the right to abandon the developer and get their money back.Do not buy this game anymore... Just don't.			",135,21,2,17,19,0,10

								The latest update directly from their blog on their official site states they are currently working on a re-polished physics engine and once released they will begin to focus on pushing for more frequent updates. that was posted 2/10/2015 so it IS possible its not abandoned! took only a couple seconds to find this information. Dont only rely on steam comments and news feeds to get you by! As for the game its a really neat game, really shows a lot of promise and I cant wait for future updates to be able to really wreck some havoc. Physics are nice currently, but are lacking. car models are pretty, destruction physics are pretty good too but DAMN, you can really ruin a car. Somewhat odd that it still rolls in that condition. Good game, from a tech demo standpoint. Get it if you are curious to see what the future MIGHT hold for the game, otherwise, wait for a couple more updates. If you have the cash, do it!

YouTube™ Video: Next Car Game [Steam Early Access] Quick Review and Gameplay 

			Views: 576		

			*This is an early access game. What you see here does not reflect the initial release of the game. Quick review for Next Car Game available on Steam Early Access -...		

So, what do we really have here. From a distance it looks like just another derstrcution derby type game that we all have seen times before that is amazing, yet get bored with after just a few hours of gameplay, but being that it was from the makers of Flatout 1 and 2. I had to do some research on it and as I dug into the game a little more I found out what the plans are for the future of the game and my perspective started to change a little.Now with this game being in an early state. There is a limit to whats available right now. You get 2 cars to choose from right now. One being your typical American Classic Muscle car and the other being a a small European Classic. Along with that you also recieve 3 tracks to play on. One Demolition Derby style track and 2 race tracks each with 3 modes of play including a 24 player race, a 12 player race, and a practice mode. There is also something included with Early Access that is called ""Next Car Game Sneak Peak 2.0"" Which Is pretty much a playground for enviroment and body damage testing.  Its actually really fun to just play around in. As for the physics and controls on the cars.  I was quite impressed as the destrction and just the overall feel for the cars felt quite unique and really smooth. The game features soft body damage and even environment damage that looks and acts far more realistic than any other game of this type has before. Right now the AI is a little aggressive and there is no difficulty option available at the moment so you will have to learn how to defend yourself against them. I reccommend practicing the tracks atleast once before starting a 24 player race. Multiplayer will be made available and players hosting will have options to customize the server by changing various options like private or public and allowing upgrades on vehicles or not. I can imagine a 24 player online race would be really intense in a game like this and definitley something I would want to experience.Along side all that there is vehicle upgrading and modifiying as well. You are limited on what you can change right now, but there are a few options. Alot of stuff is to be added later so expect to be spending alot of time in your garage customizing and tuning the 24 vehicles that are supposed to be released with the full game. Customization will include engine upgrades, body parts, and custom paintjobs altho the main focus it on the internal workings of the car itself. You will also have to change parts between races too as the parts will take damage and become worn out.  I have also read there will be an ingame classifieds section where you will be able to buy and sell cars and their parts, but not much was said about it. Lets hope this does get included.Overall I'm really looking forward to the initial release of this game as I have become quite bored with the very few tracks and cars available right now. Im hoping for a patch really soon. I highly reccommend this game to any racing game finatics and especially anyone that is a fan of the Flatout series. I have high hopes and expectations for the game so lets hope Bug Bear really puts their all into this.  ",511,90,20,25,40,5,26

								Absolutely love this game, have done since the very first sneak peek and public version, every update added something diferent, some made a certain track worse, the rest have only added to how the game is, other reviews from people that haven't played the game too much really are missing the point, once you get to know players the game only becomes more enjoyable as you become part of a community, the modding updates bringing the whole community closer together. whilst also making the game ready for a multitude of different mods ranging from tracks from older games, to fictional ones, to improvements and a large variety of new cars, I, for one, added an old VW van into it and soon a Mini, others have made Lancias and Dodge Chargers and track ports from Destruction Derby 2! Take it as you will, but this game isn't dead in any way			",98,15,12,7,16,2,2

								I don't normally go around bashing games but I feel I've been ripped off with this one. Been hoping this game would start looking like a polished product by now. It looks like someone got in over their head with this project. Don't be fooled by the pic's on the store page, the gameplay is poor for the amount of time the dev's have had. I want to love this game... Just can't wrap my arms around it. I'm even sad that I can't recomend it. They should just re-release Flatout Ultimate Carnage - Remove GFWL and add a Multiplayer LAN option. It's a lot better than this tird. You can't polish a tird. But what do I know... I'm just a gamer. I hope the dev's prove me wrong someday... At this point (October 1 2015) , still a waste of money. I'm very disappointed with this game.Just deceided to re-visit this game tonight (January 18 2016) currently selling for $39.99 CDN. What's changed??? Oh ya... "" Ride-On Lawnmowers"". December update??? Conviently near Christmas, just as someone here predicted. Just a ploy for more sales.I think the developers are getting a laugh out of all us suckers.Don't be a sucker.

								NCG: Wreckfest has been in the Early Access phase for over 1,5 years now and the performance and content is still more than poor. Don't get me wrong, it's really fun.. for about six hours. Buy it during a summer sale and it might be worth its money but at the current stage I would definitly not recommend spending 28 bucks on this game.Edit (October 2016): After being in Early Access for over three (!) years now nothing has changed but the price which INCREASED.

								I agree with many other reviewers - BugBear is taking way too long to do anything with this game.  I think it was a better game when I bought it 2 years ago.  Recent updates have made the graphics ugly and like a cartoon.  Also I can't shake the feeling that I've been had.  They never planned to finish this game.  Just promote it enough so suckers like me who have nostalgia for Flatout / Flatout 2 will pay for a piece of crap.  I think they should offer people who paid for this game a refund.

								I think it's about time for me to write a review on my most-played game, in time for the Summer Sale! Even with my hours, I will try to remain as unbiased as possible within my review.So, let's start with the basics: Next Car Game: Wreckfest is developed by BugBear, creators of the infamous FlatOut series. This game is all about smashing cars in Destruction Derbies and Banger Races.Development rate on the game has, recently, been extremely good, with valuable content appearing once a month, give or take a week. Several updates have occured just before summer/winter sales, and I can't be entirely sure if this is a business practice or convenience. The pricetag on the game, as far as Early Access games go, is expensive for the content that it contains, I think.The content in the game, at the time of me writing this, is pretty good: 8 cars and a Lawnmower, 27 Variations of 12 Racetracks, and 5 Demolition Derby arenas. However, one car is obviously the best car in both speed and durability. The parts market is okay, but there is only a small variety of parts, and only one really fast combination. Fine tuning is very limited. Derby arenas are rather boring, and don't have many interesting props.AI in the game has become rather competetive over the last few updates, and is also more likely to hit other cars. They can be very fun to race against. Online has a steady playerbase during peak times of around 1-2 full servers (10-30 players), but during non-peak times, it is hard to find players.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. I wouldn't have my hours if I didn't. Remember though, it is still an EARLY ACCESS game, there are bugs, unfinished things, and other wonky stuff. The game is a bit expensive when it's not on sale, but you can still go to nextcargame.com and buy a Steam Key for $25. I'm up for answering questions if needed.			",54,9,14,4,9,1,4

								I've always loved the FlatOut series, so i'm sure i will love this too when they release the full version of NCG.I'm just gonna write a short review here for now.At first, the damage models are good, but i think you get wrecked too easily in a race, when there's 24 cars pushing you around.Then there is that damage indicator, when you take impact, well, i don't really like it, i felt it was like FPS game or something.Anyways, seems pretty neat game, can't wait to tune a car from engine to seats.

								Honestly i regret buying this game and i would tell people to stay away. It just feels like the developers dont know what they want to make and have absolutly no development time frame. This is a completely different game then when i bought it, and it seems like everytime i come back its like 2 steps back from where i left. There is a demotition derby game in here somewhere but the developers are driving a car that needs a wheel allignment on a oval track. It really shouldnt be this hard or take this long to make a demolition derby game.Also i just wanted to add that this game conviently gets a update every time steam has a sale. Dont be fooled.

								Just...don't. It's been two years and the game has barely changed. Any changes that have been made are for the worse! The sneak peek was awesome, and sold me on the early access. Now all the physics are rubbish, the driving feels slow, and the performance is GARBAGE. The game doesn't even look good to justify the bad framerate (which appears to be random as some people report no issues, and others with better specs have an unplayable 10fps.)Maybe the game will have a full release in the next few years, if you're lucky. Oh, wait. There's talk of bankruptcy - have a look at the forums.Spend your money on something else. For the £25 they are (laughably) charging, there are so many other games you could buy!

								Ok so lets start out with what I like about this game:-Impacts feel satisfying and weighty-The sounds, oh the soundsYeah that was a short list wasn't it? let's get onto what I dislike:-The AI is just, the worst in a race, they use you to corner if you are there, otherwise they corner well and stay out of each    others way-Your car gets spun out very easily, especially compared to the AI cars which appear to be on rails and this is with every stability assist on!-If you have traction control on (Which is very needed otheriwse your car just doesn't grip up at the speeds of the AI cars) your car is slower in the corners, oh, and the back wheels are weird, sometimes traction control affects them, sometimes it doesn't-For some reason cars have a total health, even though each part of the car has it's own individual health, neither go down at an equal rate/ratio ( My engine can be dead, so my car is dead, but the total health still has half of the bar left or the fenders can be very dented, your car performing fine and yet it dies because total health reached zero)There is one final point I am reluctant to make and that is the lack of new content, they seem to be relying on modders to make new content as even after 4 months no new content has been added.There is one final, very last point I would like to make, there appears to be a deluxe edition available, no idea what it adds, but apparently it adds stuff that I won't be able to get I think, I don't know, they really haven't informed anyone about what it adds, I haven't been able to find anything on the forums about it, they haven't even sent me an automated email. I doubt I do have it however and the fact I bought it when it just exited greenlight on steam or around when it first came to steam and paid full price, never the less since it is still in EARLY ACCESS I refuse to allow them to try pull this BS.Oh yeah, now they are working on a new game without finishing this one, great, just what I wanted, an unfinished game because the devs found something shiny and decided it needed their attention other than this unfinished game which is comparable to a 3 year old currently on life support in need of life saving surgey, although this 3 year old may not get it, theres another 3 year old across the room that sneezed a couple times.

								I've long been a fan of racing games, and I have to say Burnout Paradise was one of my favourites, I played it to the point of obsession, up until i got that damn platinum trophy on PS3. I loved the driving, I loved the vehicle smashing, i loved the game and picking it up on PC I expected once again to have fun. However having already completed the game in full, I unfortunately no longer had the desire to do it all again. This game has filled my Burnout Paradise void. Whether it be in the crazy races which I never seem to win (but never get frustrated with), or whether it is in those Car derbies which turn into an orgy of metal blocks running on their own fumes in the middle. The chaos in this game just fills me with the same joy Paradise did all those years ago. Whilst there's not a lot available now in the game, I expect myself to get on and race to pass the time every now and again until more and more content becomes available. The smashing of the cars is the game's greatest strength and it never, gets old. This means there is tonnes of replayability if watching wrecks fly through the air is your thing (it is most certainly mine). There is nothing more satisfying than sending an opponent into stacked tires then watching them fly through the air with those same tires following behind him before showering down on his bonnet. The handling takes some getting used to, the extreme physicality that the other vehicles have sends your already hard to drive vehicle dancing and spinning from side to side as you try to gain control and move in a straight line. However once you do learn how to drive, you can take advantage of the sliding and turn into opponents during derbies or let them push you before you slide around at a corner in those races. Hard to master, but very rewarding. If racing or derbies get old for you, you will definitely want to check out the 2.0 demo. The smashing vehicles into crumbling textureless buildings and blue tires is oh so satisfying. A very fun way to pass the time. It makes we wonder if challenge maps will be availabe in the future in which users must navigate their way through traps to an end point. A lot of the 2.0 demo reminds me of the flatout games, were users would need to launch their car drivers out their windows towards a target. A similiar thing will hopefully be introduced in which users must get their vehicles the longest distance with the least damage or perhaps even most damage! 2.0 has welcomed a world of possibilities to this excitingly fun game. I'm looking forward to the future Bugbear, I hope you deliver and exceed everyone's expectations with what is already a solid racer. If car orgies and intensely chaotic races are your thing, I would most definitely pick up this title, and along with me, look forward to what's to come!			",157,29,10,25,30,3,12

Early Access Review
								I loved this game when they released it on early access. There wasn't a lot to do and it only had 3 tracks but it was awesome. Cars were fast, the AI absolutely garbage but unbelievably fun. The game was the definition of chaos, very entertaining chaos.Over the course of the last few months we got almost no updates. I heard they had some problems with their engine but frankly I don't care. The last update was a big one, added the so called ""market"". Don't worry, it is not for microtransactions. But instead for parts and cars. You now start with the worst and slowest car on the planet and you earn ingame money after every race with which you can upgrade your car or buy a new one.So far so good, it is fun to have that in singleplayer although I would love to have a ""♥♥♥♥ it, let's jump into a race with the fastest cars""-mode. The problem is, that the career translates into multiplayer. That means as someone who hasn't played much I am now forced to either grind a few hours with my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car to get enough money to upgrade, or I can accept it and have NO chance of winning in multiplayer.The game itself is great but some design choices are crap. And updates take too long. And they raised the price right before the sale. Wait until it is finished and then take a look again.			",149,29,23,21,44,2,17

								Just throwin' some positive vibes out. It is taking time but the last few updates have made the game fun again. So much so it's restoring my faith in it. Crashing feels satisfying (and doesn't do more damage to you than the other guy anymore), races are fun and mad chaotic and it's all just shaping up to a goodun. I can't help but think they should make the tech demo thingy a free demo, that might turn a few heads this way. But yeah, s'good.This update might be worth a read if you're thinking about buying too.http://www.wreckfestgame.com/wreckfest-status-update/ ",182,19,8,8,1,1,4

								Firstly my impressions were that the game was a fun good car game. But i also had seen that bugbear was developing it which i was happy with. i bought the game well over a year or two ago and am not happy with the content and lack of fun in the game. It is missing a spark that makes derby games fun and has died down allot. Comparing the amount of people that did play it to the amount who play it now is massive. i am sad to say this but this game has died allot and i feel without something very new and pushing updates out faster no one will really continue playing it. Pros: Cars deform okay Some contentRacing is okayCons:You can take a blow to the back and catch fireLack of updatesLack of gamemodesLack on allot of stuff. I do really hope this game picks up as if someone does a derby game correctly it can be very fun but this one is currently failing. I hope bugbear picks up Do i recommend currently?

								This game has been in development for over 2 years!  Honestly I loved it when I got it and thought it was a fantastic base to build a full game on.  Fast forward two years and we are still looking at a game in the early development stages.Seriously, Bugbear must be taking development advice from the Half Life 3 team.  This game is one of the main reasons I have given up on paying for ""early access"" to a game.  $40 down the tube...  Even at half off its still a giant ripoff until further content is released.

Early Access Review
								Ok so this review is aimed more towards the Tech Demo (played over 6 hours of it) than the Early Access main game so far, mainly because the Tech Demo contains a lot more fun to be had (at this present time)It is refreshing to be able to purchase an Early Access game and have it not crash and burn on me within 5mins of playing. Infact, this game is already so stable that I have actually tried really hard to make it crash without success... Either my computer is better than it appears or the game's physics coding is so damn solid it's very hard to fault.Play the tech demo under the assumption that restrictions to the physics will be added in the future, because for now, as hilarious as it is, having your car STILL drivable with 1 wheel, no engine, and crushed into the size of a beach ball is a little far fetched, and while it is extremely satisfying to watch it get smashed and mangled into 1000 peices over and over and over in 1000 different ways, the realism is broken after a certain point because it has no killswitch as such. I am excited to see more from Next Car Game, especially different game modes, tracks, cars etc.If you enjoy FlatOut, Crashday, GRID or Destruction Derby (the original), then I highly recommend this game, especially the Tech Demo.Graphics are solid, the destruction physics are some of the most impressive I have ever seen (and I've seeked out games like this for over 15 years). It also has full controller support even for the very freshly added features (The cannon, added within the last couple of weeks). NOTE: You need a pretty beasty computer to enjoy this lag free. I suspect the graphics aren't nearly as taxing as the physics, so bare in mind that CPU power is a big player in this game.Very keen to see more from Bugbear.Early Access game: 6/10 (so far, with its current content)Tech Demo Bonus: 9/10If Bugbear added the physics playground to the Early Access game this would be hard not to give a 10/10 to.... But alas, they have kept them seperate for unknown reasons (they seem like different build versions)I've also attempted to take the game apart and see if I could port cars from the Early Access game to the tech demo, no such luck, this game in it's current form is NOT very moddable, not in any conventional way that I'm aware of.As for the cons of the game, well, it is Early Access so I'll try and be fair;- The title is a bit bland & generic, and doesn't accurately portrey the amount of effort these guys have put into coding such a detailed soft body dynamics engine.- Only 3 camera modes, which is ok, but it really needs more. Especially in a driving game. (And especially in it's current state)- There is no driver model as such, there is a driver inside the vehicle, but it is part of the soft body of the car, and thus bends and mangles with the car, funny, but realism breaking.- The sound design of the car engine is pretty awesome, however, there is only really 1 or 2 variants so far. Gets annoying after a couple of hours- In the Tech Demo, the edge of the map contains a yellow boundary that repairs and resets your car after driving on it, however, if you miss it (fly over it and off the edge into the void) your car just resets, sometimes nowhere near where you flew off the map. I think this is minor but it too gets annoying having to pause and press Repair All (and lose all the destruction around the map) just to be able to continue driving- The Early Access game doesn't really have much in the way of instructions or helpers. You and 23 (max) other AI players in a small demo derby arena, obviously trying to be the last surviving, but the problem is no mini map, no hint of WHO is remaining, apart from the # of players left top right of the screen. Few times I've not been able to get to the 1 person left, because their car is still 'alive' but not drivable, ergo they are stuck in the middle of 22 other cars that I also can't get to. There shouldn't be an option for stalemate in demo derby but that's the outcome i've had many times.			",130,7,21,5,18,4,23

								This is just an initial impressions review. I played it offline for a few hours in addition to the current time so roughly 5-6 hours. I have stayed away from this game for a year due to bad reviews but gave it a gamble because of recent updates and the Steam summer sale.My expectations and evaluations of this game are based on relational experiences from a library of racing sims that include most major releases in the past 5 years.  My system is high-performance and I get well over 60 fps at 3440x1440. No stutters. Smooth. The FFB could use some improvement, but is much better than some other racing games. FFB is nowhere near as good as R3E or Dirt Rally, but probably close to Project Cars and better than GRID Autosport. Cars physically behave similar but better than in DIRT3; however, they lack the detailed fidelity and distinctive handling qualities found in Dirt Rally. Wheel, pedal, and shifter support is well done and you won’t run into problems with individual usb controllers working in conjunction. For example, I use a TM wheel, Fanatec Pedals, and Fanatec Shifter – all work great. Although, I have yet to find a clutch option for use with manual transmission.I am pleasantly surprised at the range of tracks and their function (crash up derby / race). They look stellar and each that I have tried is enjoyable. There are stacks of tires along the tracks that get bombarded by crashes. These tires along with debris from cars wind up on the track as obstacles. Regrettably, these tires and objects have virtually no impact on driving when struck. These objects would be wonderful if upon impact they created driving instability. Yet, they're merely visual veneer. Dirt and mud tracks could use more static ruts and rough areas that create a varied terrain texture and driving challenge. Similarly, these track characteristics need their inherent properties and impact on driving amplified (more sliding, bumping, slip in steering, instabilities). One thing I would like to see in Wreckfest and other sims with varied surfaces (dirt/gravel/mud/snow) is a dynamic track that changes throughout the race. All of the physical contact from vehicles on the surfaces both from wheels and crashes make absolutely no change to the track's physical surface—no new ruts, gashes, bumps, or rocks; tracks simply become predictable and their nuisances are memorized. If the track were pliable like the car, taking damage and having its surface warped, then the dynamically changing tracks would gain depth in challenge while adding an extension in longevity with players.The AI is demanding in races and it’s easy to find yourself at the rear; a wonderful surprise as I would hate for there to be no challenge. At the tail end of my inital 6 hours I was leading often so I would like a feature adjustment for the difficulty range. The aggressive nature of the AI, however, does create a genuine challenge in holding and maintaining a lead. After playing so many racing sims it is a real blast to have crashing into other cars be such a fun and a useful tactic to winning. The crash-up / last-man standing matches have AI problems and it's too easy to win. However, their behavior is very predatory when it comes to stealing the last blow for takedowns during these matches! The physical damage displayed to cars is bar none the best I have seen in any game to date. I gave BeamNG a recent try and for just physically banging up cars, Wreckfest is far more fun. There are cars you can buy and upgrades you can purchase as you win money in game. The upgrade shop for engines, suspension, and other parts is bare-bones and upgrade paths are virtually nonexistent; at least, for the European 3 car I purchased.I believe this game was easily worth $19.99 (summer sale). While you have a huge array of choices in the racing sim arena, Wreckfest builds upon existing themes by adding completely unique gameplay, physics, and strategies. I hope that Bugbear continues to augment the existing game with additional content for the parts shop, as well as FFB improvements, car variety, track enhancements, and car handling disposition. Ideally I would welcome some of the handling elements from Dirt Rally as they would inject an enormous dynamic into the game's varied races and crash courses. The splash screen still says “Pre-Alpha” and due to the duration of this status I can understand the frustration for seasoned owners. However, as a newcomer it provides ample content to enjoy for many hours. While some of the negative reviews are understandable due to development stagnation, the nice range of content and cars will make a great game phenomenal if development continues.

								If you enjoy a healthy dose of motor racing with a generous helping of carnage and more than a little flavouring of mayhem this could well be the game for you. Wreckfest is one of the most visceral racing game experiences I've enjoyed in a long time. It bears not a small resemblance to it's preceding series Flatout, which isn't surprising considering it's made by the same development team. That said I can see this shaping up to be the pinacle of their work so far, and it's still Pre-Alpha! It features some of the best destruction available in motor racing games today. Most games that feature ""real"" cars are restricted by contracts with the manufactures as to exactly how much they can be damaged. Wreckfest, by contrast, gives you jaw-drapping impacts and the resulting destruction cripples everyone visually and functionally. Granted the cars are not specific to a real world counterpart, but you wouldn't know that to look at them. They are authentic-looking amalgamations of classic car styles and seem familiar by design if not by make and model. Finally a Destruction Derby style racing game with modern physics and infinite replayability for those of us who love the genre. The game is beautiful, technically challenging, and most importantly, fun. Hilarious laugh-out-loud fun. I can't wait to try the multiplayer with Teamspeak and a large group of friends. Because I can't think of anyone I'd rather crush into little tiny pieces.			",82,5,5,5,0,2,9

								I have been playing Wreckfest on and off for many years now and can safely say that I like what is there, but for the money, there is just not enough content. Full respect to the developers who have made some great fun work over the years in this game. The sad fact though is that the game really hasn't changed enough within the timeframe to warrant the massive £25 asking price.I find the racing and tractor durbies relaxing and enjoyable, but it feels like the kind of game you pop on and off for 15 mins as appossed to a game you can really get invested in. In time, I am sure the devs will complete this and it will be great, but at it's current state, it's worth like £7 and no more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only updates apart from a new car or track was just them messing about with the cars handling and messed the way the cars were controlled by a wheel. i was gifted a copy of this game and i'm still annoyed with the very little progress made with it's development.

								If you can remember Demolition Derby, and enjoyed it's (back then) state of the art graphics, and race-o-smash gameplay, you'll love this. For a game in alpha, it's certainly quite impressive. We used to pay around £30 for PS1 games in the old days of fat square tellys. We had those real pounds they used to have, made of real paper money, not those invisible electronic pounds they have now. Kids today, with their fancy eye-pads and interweb don't know the hard times we had back then. We had to tend to our sheeps, make soup from hedgehogs and cowpats, served in wellington boots, then rent the latest betamax tape, or go to the posh kid's house to beg for  a go on his Intellivision and Atari consoles, made of real wood. Not like that electronic wood they have now. We had to dance for a game of Outlaw, or the worst game in the world - E.T. - The Extremely Terrible from Activision. A game made in about 2 weeks by a man now filled with remorse and bitter disappointment at what could have been. It's unknown how many holes E.T. fell down, but ironically the unsold E.T. cartridges wer dumped into a large hole in the New Mexico desert. Watch out for Harrison Ford's return as Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Cartridges'. Only fitting, as it was partly Spielberg's fault			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
