												The perfect game if you've always wanted to be a tentacle monster. Also if you want an insanely difficult game. Think Super Meat Boy, except gravity can be just about any direction.Might not be great if you get motion sick easily, though. There's a lot of spinning around.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Mixed feelings about this one. It's almost really good, but a few things stop it from shining.I feel like I would have enjoyed the game a lot more if it was a bit easier. The difficulty around the middle of the game was perfect, but the last few levels were just frustrating. I loved Super Meat Boy, and managed to 100% that game, but I really don't want to go through that kind of torture again, especially from a game that looks so cute.There's also a lot of minor bugs in the game, that add up and start to get a bit annoying. In the level with the moving squares of water, the music broke when in the water, and got so distorted that I had to mute my audio. Fireballs sometimes clearly hit me but I don't die. Stuff like that.Rocks really annoyed me. I kept thinking they were part of the background! So many deaths caused by running into rocks.The graphics are also kind of bland. They're passable, but just... not that interesting or appealing.Anyway! The game still has some solid platforming gameplay, and the gravity and swimming mechanics were implemented very well and were surprisingly intuitive. Collecting sea creatures was satisfying, and I got all of them so far in the first 16 zones, minus one. Fans of Super Meat Boy should check this game out, if they want something very similar. Possibly not worth full price, but worth picking up if you're a fan of the genre and it's on sale. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 About Airscape - The Fall of GravityBeneath the cute visuals of Super Calamari BoyAirscape lies a hard-as-nails platformer (the credits helpfully informed me I died 1663 times in the course of completing it) with interesting level design and a solid amount of diverse content, and it's definitely worth checking out.Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a fast-paced, gravity-shifting action platformer about a deep-sea octopus who has been kidnapped by a mechanical alien race. Control a Dumbo Octopus (Grimpoteuthis abyssicola) on a skybound adventure to save its family from the clutches of the motorized menace. Jump, dodge, and swim through a breathtaking environment full of floating islands, water formations, and robotic terrors. There's no fighting in Airscape - you'll have to rely on your wits, speed, and reflexes to navigate through the deadly gauntlets.  Release Date: 11 Aug, 2015The GameplayYou play as one of five octopi (unlocked through the course of the game), each with a special ability of sorts (one's faster, one's floatier, one can slow time, one can teleport a short distance, and Red... doesn't seem to do anything, as far as I can tell), fighting a mysterious mechanical menace to rescue sea critters. There are usually two or three critters per level, some in convenient locations and some out of the way or requiring a mad dash through the level to reach in time, and unlocks are based on these, which gives a good deal of freedom to pick your levels and avoid some particularly nefarious ones if you so choose (full disclosure: the levels featuring maneuvering in water almost made me give up on it early, but I'm quite glad I stuck it out). The LevelAs the title might indicate, there are some gravitational shenanigans involved - the levels usually take place on essentially tiny planetoids, and the direction that is 'down' will often shift several times over the course of a level (and as many levels have curved ground, often without even thinking about it). It's all part of the level itself, though - the controls are pretty elegantly minimal (up/right/left/shift-for-special-ability). This leaves the levels themselves to hold most of the complexity and they do that well - there are 15 areas in the main game, each with their own style and features, and you end up winding your way through an impressive array of platforms, lasers, cannons, robots, water, acid, homing missiles, mines, and of course the final boss, a force too menacing to be described.All in All  Airscape - The Fall of Gravity is a very nice Indie Game!9/10 From Me Sweep ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

What is this game?Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is an action platformer made by Cross-Product, a small team of students from around the world. An octopus is abducted from its homeworld and is forced to save its family and return home while evading countless dangers along the way.What do I do?You control an octopus that is taken away from its homeworld along with its family and must either reach the exit teleporter in each level or rescue an octopus while moving through obstacles, traversing through land with each one having its own gravity and avoiding enemies that may or may not chase and follow you in order to return home. Objects and enemies include lasers, mines, spikes, robots, etc. There are a variety of octopuses (or octopi - take it as you will) to choose from with different unique abilities and with the first being unlocked by default and all subsequent octopuses requiring to be freed.There are additional optional objectives where you can rescue trapped specimens (they are other sea creatures that have been confined as well) and find secret exits to unlock more levels and rescue more specimens.My overall experienceThis game was quite the roller coaster ride from start to finish. It's relaxing at the start but spiked in difficulty towards and at the end. I loved this game at the start, felt frustrated two-thirds of the way through and satisfied in the end. It was a blast.The beginning and tutorial were very welcoming and helped to prepare for the gradual increase in difficulty and complexity in later levels. The next zones added a light challenge and a different atmosphere. It was at halfway through this game when its difficulty began to show, but the soundtrack kept me in and I pushed through all the way to the end where the level of difficulty never went down.What should I expect?Expect an easy and enjoyable experience from the initial part of this game, but don't be surprised when the levels become much more difficult and require good reaction time, precise movement and good decision-making. You will be punished later on for mistiming jumps or making the wrong moves but don't worry about making mistakes, because it's all a matter of trial and error. There only penalty is to be sent back to the last checkpoint reached (or the start of the level if no checkpoints are reached).Things to look forward to:- The start of the game is soothing and enjoyable to play.- Controls are simple and easy to grasp.- Unique physics and gravity mechanics.- The atmosphere and feel of the game is quite comforting and welcoming.- The orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accompanies the levels very well.- Gameplay is smooth at 60 fps and frame rate drops are very rare.- Enemies and obstacles are introduced at a consistent rate and are easy to understand.- There are a good variety of enemies and obstacles, requiring strategic planning to pull through.Things to look out for:- The levels are linear and rarely reward creativity, if not punishing for it.- The rotation when moving around may cause nausea and motion sickness.- Difficulty will spike around the second half of the game and will require precision and timing.- The movement of the octopuses is a little slippery and can cause a lot of deaths (and frustration) especially when the direction of gravity changes suddenly.- Some levels are deprived of important checkpoints and will require a lot of focus (anger doesn't count).- The teleportation ability of the blue octopus does not work when used to move through lasers and can cause suicides.- The slowdown ability of the green octopus is very inconsistent and can ruin specific movement patterns of enemies and obstacles.- The music can become jumbled and buggy when going in water.- There's no way to change the zoom of the camera, reducing awareness and preventing some levels from being traversed properly.Tips:- Adjust the screen rotation rate and shake to what makes you feel the most comfortable (the rotation can get a little crazy and the shaking can be distracting).- Never stick to one particular rate of rotation and keep the orient camera button within reach.- It is not necessary to complete the levels from a to z in order to progress through the game (only rescued specimens are required to progress).- Watch out for a sudden loud noise when rescuing an octopus.Who should buy this game?Players avid about platformers will likely enjoy this game especially with the increase in difficulty during the end-game, but casual players looking for an easy experience may want to avoid this game for the sake of sanity. People who get motion sick and nauseated easily may also want to stay away.Personal commentsI'm not sure why I pushed myself to 100% this game but there's something charming about this particular game that made me want to come back. Maybe it's the soundtrack I absolutely adored or the love-hate relationship with the layout of the later levels or the design choices that were made, but I really enjoyed this game for everything it had to offer. I guess the frustration was worth it in the end.Thanks for readingKevinEdits:Added a 'What is this game?' and 'What should I expect?' section, reworded some sections and made the headings more concise.

												Challenging platforming game with a lovely feel!The variation in design for each of the worlds is great, as is the actual level design.  It's certainly the best take on ""2d Super Mario Galaxy"" that I've seen, and I understand the comparisons to Super Meat Boy.  It absolutely does continue to get harder until the very last few worlds, which all took me quite a while ;).Also, the option for how fast to rotate the screen is a nice touch - I find that having it move faster bothers me less, as it stays more consistent with the orientation of my character.  But if the rotation really bothers you, you'll find out quickly, so you can always ask for a refund.Pros:+ Solid, Unique Platforming Experience+ Charming Style+ Varied Mechanics/Level Design+ Secret/Bonus Levels+ Great Music!!+ A lot of content for the price - took me 10 hours to complete it+/- Don't expect it to be easyCons:- The rotation *might* make you sick- The physics are sometimes a little slippery (you can get momentarily stuck jumping on angled surfaces, and stuff like that)Edit: Changed a couple things since beating it :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is ruthlessly fun. I am inventing new cuss words and reaching a new level of enjoyable anger than I previously thought possible.If you even remotely think you'd enjoy this it is seriously worth the buck. I intended to play a level or two just to try it out and found myself getting sucked into a two hour session.While cutesy in art I consider this to be a solid design that is harder than most. I enjoy this more than I did Battle Block.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for two reasons...first one: at 0.19€ (90% off) it's cheaper than a steam gamecard ;')second one: I found the sound that the squid made while walking funny.Now I havent finished it yet, reason why is bc I ragequitted after getting the ""100 times died"" archievement within the 30 first minutes of playing. (Yes you'll die a ♥♥♥♥♥on of times) and because my finger hurt :cBut it's a lovely game it truly is! it's cute and relaxing (at least the first few levels :)) and it's really well made!those are a few reasons you should totally buy this game but honestly the sound the squid makes while walking should be enough :p			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok so basically you're an octopus living in the sea and then all of a sudden aliens smash into your house and abduct you and all your friends, which happens to us all from time to time, but you somehow managed to escape and now you're on a quest to save your friends. Oh and you also have to save a bunch of other random sea creatures but they're less important. You zoom around each level searching for sea critters and dodging exploding things and laser beams and like, drones and stuff which you'd think for an octopus shouldn't be so hard since scientists are always talking up how smart they and all but it can be VERY challenging at times so prepare yourself you WILL rage during this game. It is fun though and reminds me a lot of Super Mario Galaxy, did anyone else pick up on that whole Super Mario Galaxy vibe?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Usually I try and complete a game before I review, but this is one I won’t be completing this lifetime.There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between CASUAL GAMERS and HARDCORE GAMERS, but interestingly Australian developer Daniel West ( https://twitter.com/JustASquid ) has tried to bring those differences together with this game called Airscape by adding an artistic flair reminiscent of a Nintendo world and combining it with the hard-core difficulty play of super meat boy. The problem with this choice is that those who would REALLY be interested in this game usually dont even give it a second glance because they think it might be for kids. Make no mistake about it. This game makes super meat boy look easy peasy. The best thing though is that there is enough here for casual gamers to be interested. The learning curve is quite well presented in its gradual approach. You know each level is that slightly bit harder, but maybe with enough tries you might be able to master it and this is where the game constantly teases you. ""It's only that little bit harder!"" ""Surely the next save point is just around the corner!""The story is simple. Aliens are sick of abducting steak for dinner, they feel like seafood. Unfortunately you and all your marine buddies weren't fast enough to escape their tractor beam. However while everyone else gets kidnapped, somehow you make your escape in a little glass astronaut helmet and you take it on yourself to traverse the alien landscapes to free your buddies.Each Octopus buddy you unlock has a special skill, from double jump, to dash etc., however to free them you have to have saved enough fish in the first place to warrant saving them from their alien prison containing diabolical traps. Everything wants to kill you on these alien landscapes that's all you need to know. To save most marine creature you'll have to work out quickly how to get to certain areas, or be at a certain place by a certain time or your friends gets kidnapped again.It's easy to pick up, incredibly difficult to master. Eventually if you’re talented enough to unlock all your buddy octopuses then you'll be given a chance to go against a boss. I've only seen 1 person ever complete this level and it took him well over an hr that's how hard it was. He even completed all the levels of the game, but did he save all the fish? Hell no, even he knows how hard this game is to 100%.Below is me playing the first really easy levels and rescuing the first octopus. It gets way harder, but it should be enough of a sample for you. The question is are you up for the challenge? With puzzles that you will mentally have to wrap your suckers around, with enemies that will make you want to ink, with danger that will make you want to squidaddle. How deep in the game can you go?
