Early Access Review
								EDIT: I just can't recommend the game right now due to the lack of players. When the playercount increases to the point where you can fairly easily get into a game with people at similar skill levels to you I'll remove this edit. Just bear in mind the low playercount if you're considering buying the game. Innovative, addictive and incredibly satisfying. Whether you have played for 1 hour or 1,000 hours the awesome feeling you get from being a part of epic plays never fades. The game is quite unpolished but if you can see through the clunky UI and lacking features there is a great game beneath. As with a lot of Early Access games, it's a diamond in the rough.  Supraball in comparison to Rocket League:   ""Deathball..."" (the predecessor of Supraball) ""... was one of the main reasons why Rocket League exists"" - Psyonix Adam on Reddit  I expect this comparison is what a lot of people will be wanting to know. I'll preface this section by saying I have about 650 ingame hours in Rocket League and about 2,000 in Supraball.  Rocket League gave me a very similar feeling of excitement that I got from Supraball when I first started playing.  Deep down at their core they are essentially the same game - put the ball in the goal, just with different methods of doing so. Both are very pure, simple games which give you some basic controls and then set you free to do what you wish.  I feel like Supraball gives you a lot more ways to be creative  and play the game though to the degree that every second of the game you are holding the ball the tree of your choices branches 100 times: will you do a little rollspin to juke a defender, will you pass to a teammate who is boosted and flying across the map for a volley combo, will you panic and do a horrible pass back to your keeper and score a hilarious own goal or will you do the countless other things available to you?  More complex plays are also far more accessible in Supraball,  within 100 hours of play you can be setting up strong charge to volley goals to score 300km/h screamer goals, whereas in Rocket League setting up a pass play like this is far, far more difficult.  The autolock pass also makes passing very easy and allows new players to perform teamplay quite easily.  Now let's move onto the pro's and con's of Supraball in it's Early Access State. Pros: +++  Every match plays differently.  There are so many different ways to play that you never end up playing the same game twice. It has the ""just 1 more match"" feeling and so can be very addictive and has huge replayability. +++  4 unique positions to play: Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder and Striker.  You can sink thousands of hours into a position and still have room to learn and innovate. Or, don't conform to the meta, you're free to play however you want!++  The skill ceiling is disgustingly high , I have sunk probably 2000 hours into goalkeeping in the Alpha/Beta and I'm not even close to the skill cap. The skill floor is pretty high too, but even when you first start playing and have no idea what you're doing it is still really enjoyable++ Applying curves and combinations of curves to your shots gives huge variety to the gameplay and  lots of opportunities for creative, unique and flashy plays ++  A short in-game tutorial and some follow up tutorial videos really help you to get to grips with the high skill floor.  The game has alot to learn and the tutorial covers all of the basics, with some sections (such as the goalkeeper training) which are even useful to me with a few thousand hours playtime.+  Intuitive and fairly simple controls  similar to most FPS games+  There's something for everyone . Public matches are more casual and relaxed and ranked is more serious. It's enjoyable to play even if you typically don't like sports games like myself.+ Multiple varients of the 3v3 and 5v5 maps (similar to Rocket League) with different visual styles+ Even if this game does not do too well and has a small playerbase (eg. 50 to 100 players) it can still be fun. The whole time I have played from 0 to 2000 hours there has probably been an average of 40 players online and even so it is a blast. Ehhh: ~Only 2 game modes (3v3 and 5v5) though both gamemodes focus on very different ways of playing~ Curved shots bouncing off of walls are unintuitive but add a huge amount of depth to the game  that allows crazy solo wall jukes and is why the striker position is viable Cons: ---  A clunky UI and missing lots of useful features such as easily partying with friends, good matchmaking and team matchmaking (these features are planned).  The lobby system has matchmaking within it to balance teams but there is no way to easily queue and join a match like you can in Rocket League.--  For some people the optimisation is god awful even on a monster rig, for others the game runs perfectly on a terrible computer.  --  The price is based on the gameplay and potential of future content, not the amount of content it has right now.  This game is priced similarly to Rocket League, but doesn't have any of the extra features. You may want to hold off on purchasing until these features are added if they are important to you.  This problem has been mostly solved by the significant (50% ish) price drop.-The devs ""rely on the community renting the majority of servers"", which is certainly not something I'm used to in my games and seems very strange to me- Despite what the steam store says  the game is fairly unpolished,  lacking a lot of nice little features like cosmetics or unlockables- Whilst the game can be played by ignoring your teammates, utilising them properly is the best way to play. This might not appeal to some pure solo players-  Some bugs can affect the mid to high level of play,  include random weird bounces off of walls and occasionally your shield not working. These are almost entirely unnoticeable in the first 100 hours of play though and will hopefully be patched tl;dr: It's basically meth Edit: The default controls can be a bit wonky, I would advise changing the following:""Pass"" to RMB, ""Kick"" to LMB, ""Pull-Catch"" to left shift, ""Quickshot"" to Middle Mouse. ""Shield"" to RMB and the others whatever you feel comfortable with. If you want to goalkeep, turn ""double tap dash"" off and set the ""Dash Jump"" key to something you feel comfortable with.

								-----------------------EDIT-----------------------As the game have mostly ""died"" since i wrote my review, i'll edit it and say that i do not recommend bying the game at this current state.The devs are planning going free-2-play somewhere in the future and i would keep my eye out for that instead.While this is said, my old review still stands, the game is still good. definitely worth it if there were more players. -Sorry to the people who i've convinced to buy the game within the last 4-6 months as the game has been mostly dead for that duration.I should've editted my review sooner.-----------------------OLD REVIEW-----------------------Been watching this game grow for a while, the devs are very interactive, love getting the communitys feedback, and definitely take what you say into concideration.It is nice seeing the developement of the game has been boosted so much since release, i hope that people will look past the early developement stages, and stick around for when this becomes a finished game.I personally think the devs have proven they are learning with the task, and i'm definitely sure that without a doubt this game will turn out great, if just the community would back it up!

								Finding this gem of a game in the summer of 2014 was one the best decisions I've made. No game has given me more pleasure in competing and compelled me to become the best player I can be for my team. I don't think there is another game with the same emphasis on team-play that Supraball has. It's like soccer mixed with hockey but with guns that can shoot the ball really fast with different spins/curves. The graphics may be a turn off for some individuals but I hope that people can look past the cartoon look as there is more to gameplay than just graphics. There are still a few bugs but that is why this is only the early access release and not the final release. I look forward to meeting the newer players and hopefully together we can make this game a competitive e-sport.I urge any new players to watch the tutorial videos or complete most of the in game tutorial. The mechanics of the game are pretty simple, but you can manipulate these mechanics in ways you won't believe at first.* For a starter tip make sure you get familiar with how lock passes work and how your movement affects the route of the ball as it travels toward you.EditThis game has really been struggling with its player base so keep that in mind when you are going to purchase this game (especially if your NA). 4/9/2017: While the playerbase is still struggling a recent update now allows you to get a match within 1 minute against bots.

								I refunded the game of that reasons:1 - There is no enough players to play with (Most servers are empty)2 - Many bugs with the launcher and stupid stuff.3 - I don't feel much fun while playing.$5 USD is enough for the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								9/10 - One of the best FPS games I've ever played. It's entirely unique and I love that,Although a bit tricky to learn at first, once I got the hang of Supraball I found myself losing time far too easily. This game is fast-paced, energetic, dynamic and highly addictive. The community is friendly and willing to help and I see a bright future ahead for Supraball. Highly recommended to try.

								Pros - TEAMPLAY is the most Important thing to do- Very good and unique gameplay- Nice graphic style- Low system requirements- Very friendly community ( That will mostly change )- Also skill based- friendly devs- not too complicated controllsCons- Pretty expensive for the content that it has and that it will have- There are already alot of pro´s with have like 500 and 2000 hours of playing, playing against those  are in some modes anoying :O- Not much of features (still Ea but they had  worked  on it a long time)- The game can get boring really fast depending on what kind of player you are - You need to wait a long time till you can start a match ( 10 - 20 min maybe longer )- Low playerbase ( I know thats this game is an EA but the price scares people maybe create a demo to test it )- Idk but when a match starts people have mostly a higher rank and are better than you ( Not to high but still good )- The game has not much  features (potential) to add  (will become boring for some people )Thats why I dont recommend the game.Yeah and I know that I havent played this game a long time but I was never really complaining about the gameplay I was rather praising it. But with the time I spend on it I could see how the game is.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That are just MY thoughts you can always try this yourself for me this is just a decent game .

It's not just another Rocket League, Supraball is in a league of its own. This game has the potential to become the new standard of eSports and while Supraball got some balls, it doesn't have enough of a playerbase to rub them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								I do not recommend this game at all in the current state.Pros- Fun game to play with friends- The game idea has potential but the developers seem clueless - Dedicated servers (for now)Cons- Very very few players and none in Australia even during peak time- The game seems exactly the same as beta 18 months ago- It's unlikely they will improve the game during EA- The server list is still outside of the game- The UI has been reskinned and the arenas graphically updated (only changes in 18 months)- Game is unplayable with lag due to teleporting- Overpriced which will deter players and without players a mp game is dead			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
