												I got this game during beta and let me tell you: I can't imagine not having this game in my life.I have played this at parties with my friends, where it is a smashing hit and a great ice-breaker and I have played it by myself with one hand pretending to be a random CPU player and one hand actually trying. My girlfriend loves the game, and it's hard not to! You can dress your narwhal as anything you could want (like jedi knights, burritos, and more!!), and as far as entertainment goes, this game is second to none.My one request is that later on online playing be incorporated (for all of us who lack frequent human contact). Buy it now!			",387,71,30,46,36,3,56

								Truly the Citizen Kane of marine-based mammal space battling games.Really though, this game is great, arcade fun. Hook it up to the TV and you've got a great party game. It draws you into to a frenetic, fast paced battle royale. The simplicity of the game means that anyone can play it, and go from saying ""that looks silly, I'll pass"" to ""OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS AWESOME"" in about 4 seconds (and I'm not saying it looks silly).The additions that they've added are great. Great variety of arenas, hilarious costumes (Jayne's hat!). And they're planning on adding so much more. Game modes. Single player. All sorts of goodies, it's just going to get better and better!STARWHAL! JUST THE TIP!			",71,26,2,26,12,0,13

												This is one of those games that you get in the humble bundle but you don't think you're ever going to play because it looks like one of  those	 games: you know the ones where its a neat idea but it doesn't work in practice but it sells well anyway because INDIE GAMES but then you play it and you're like alright this is pretty cool but there aren't enough features so you don't play it very often but then your friend is like ""hey whats starwhal"" and you realize that, on a spiritual level, you don't really know so you go and visit the shaman at your local DMV and ask ""what does it mean to be starwhal"" and he boots up his PC and is all like ""check dis out man"" and you start playing it together and you finally see the light so you go home and play it with your friend but he manages to be a master at it in his first game even though you've played it like 6 times already and he rekts you and it makes you mad so you declare yourself the winner and he's all like ""u jelly bro"" and you are jelly but you can't admit it because you're a bro so you pretend your screen is different but it's not because it's local multiplayer and your friend is all like ""whatever man"" but it's not 'whatever' to you so you kill him in his sleep.

 Why recommended:Nice little game with lots of cute Narwahls.This is a great couch game, as controls and mechanics are easy and you can sometimes win with luck alone, so lesser skilled friends can still enjoy it :)So if you're looking for a colorful local only (!) multiplayer game for literally breaking your friends hearts, definetly give it a try.+ Colorful Graphics+ Easy to learn controls+ Still a luck component, so lesser skilled players still stand a chance -> MP friendly!+ Hearts everywhere!0 Sound is so-so. Quite nice, but way too repetitive. Goes great with my own electronic music library though :)0 Can't tell about keyboard support, only played it with controller. But guess keyboard might suck as when comparing analog stick to controller DPad.0 Single player challenge maps somewhat nice with different obsacles and later ones pretty hard. But at least for me still not that entertaining. You might feel differnt, though.- AI. It's fine for classic mode with basic maps and for a basic training. But they don't really work with some of the game modes and maps containing lava and such. Don't buy if:* You neither have friends to play this with locally (only!)...* ... nor like repeating levels to beat your highscores and collecting medals/achievements-* You do not like Narwahls.

												I played this game with three players, local. Yes, this game is mildly fun and gets alot of laughs. Is it worth the money, considering there are far better couch co-op/versus games out there? Not so much.The problem with this is that while there are plenty of levels and game modes, there is not much depth. Single player experiences are meh, at best. For the meantime I will stick with TowerFall and Duck Game. Here is a breakdown of what I think:Pros:+Interesting in-your-face psycodelic art style+Music is pretty decent+Wonky controls and gameplay certainly gets alot of laughs+""Just the tip"" LOLCons:-Not enough depth - for example, TowerFall has loads of unlockable levels and characters, and some force you to experience single player to get at-Strategy and gameplay are far too simple compared to competitor titles - its basically just move and taunt-Too expensive for what it is-I think multiplayer is local onlyOverall, I would only pick this up if you have all the better couch co-op/versus titles.

												If you love narwhals, then you really should try this out. It's a challenging game with different game modes. Clash with other narhwhal CPU's, friends at your house, or just try to do an obstacle course on your own. One of the gamemodes you try to get as many points as you can by hitting a heart on another narwhals chest. Customize your narwhal with the style you love. The controls are simple, but that doesn't make the game easy. Here comes the hard part-moving. When flying around, the narwhals aren't very stable. This game is very unique. I have never seen any game like this.			",35,2,0,2,4,1,0

It is one of the best because it is ludicrously simple to pick up.   ""A"" for accelerate, ""X"" for taunt, and obviously stick to move.  It is a great party game because of its simplicity and sheer hilarity.  So go ahead, plug in the Xbox 360 controllers, gather round and...""Pierce the Heart""			",459,101,11,36,22,9,44

												As someone who has only played the single player challenge modes (I have no friends, so no local co-op), this game is amazing. The challenges are hard enough that they provide entertainment and a challenge, and trying to get whateverthemedalpastgoldis will provide many more hours, yet the game is easy enough that a n00b like me was able to complete all the challenges (medaled, mostly bronze) in just over an hour. Most people are here for the co-op, which I'm sure is spectacular, but the game is fun for just the single player challenges as well.Plus I made a narwhal that looked like a cat stuck in sushi, what more could you want?!?!?Video ",59,11,0,8,12,1,7

I would highly recommend this game on console, or anywhere that you have gamepads and can do multiplayer with your friends locally.Great game, one of the most fun, and innocently competitive games I've played for a while. Excellent for local multiplayer.Edit: This game has no online multiplayer because the developers tried to simulate how narwhals actually fight eachother and move through space. This required a large investment in a powerful physics engine that is NOT compatible with online game modes.			",67,3,0,2,1,0,3

												I have seena few negative review that talk about the impracise controls, i would dispute them by saying that the controls are, if anything, too precise. The twitch of a thumbstick unerringly points the tip of the starwhal horn in a new fabulous direction, but only the horn. New players will need to get used to this. You can't turn the whale, just the tip o fthe horn. Once you understand this conept, the controls are actually fairly simple and precise. The gameplay is like a rainbow that has been crushed into crysaline form and mainlined through your eyeballs, it is fast paced and frantic couch coop in it purinst sense. I often throw this game up on a big projecter and it always draws crowds. People will scream when the horns start getting close to the enemy hearts and the camera zooms in for a slow motion shot.This game is absolutely amazing when ti works. Luckely it works more often than not, but there are still a few issues, such as frequent lag on levels with moving parts, that keep from being the best game ever.			",249,70,4,36,23,3,87

								This is my favourite game featuring interstellar narwhals. It should be yours too.Narwhals (Monodon monoceros) are an aquatic mammal that live in the icy Arctic Ocean. In Old Norse nár means ""corpse"" for the animal's mottled grey skin colour resembled drowned sailors. It's scientific name is derived from Greek, meaning ""one-tooth one-horn."" It is this horn that is the defining characteristic of this majestic beast. Growing up to three metres in length the narwhal tusk is actually a tooth that pierces through the lip and protrudes past the upper jaw. The general consensus among scientific community is that this tusk is a secondary sex characteristic to garner attraction from all the lady narwhals (size does matter).Not alike their earthly narwhal cousins, the galactic starwhal also features such a tusk but this is not a tusk to attract mates, it is a tusk to destroy enemies (size does matter). The goal of game is simple, using your tusk, just the tip, you must impale the heart of your opponents. Only a strike to the heart will yield any damage and the game has a cool bullet-time slow-motion effect every time a heart is within range of being pierced.  It is a  hectic, tense, and often awkward struggle. As of right now it is an early access game but it is fully playable with only more content and game-modes to look forward to in the future. Its not really a game you can enjoy by yourself and there is no online multiplayer although that may change heading forward. The game shines with local co-op; best played with four players. I had no issues connecting and using four 360 controllers. It may lack in lasting appeal but if you have a few friends over and are looking for a quick, fun, and competitive gaming experience, look no further, looks to the stars.			",213,51,1,57,51,3,73

								This game rules..Also, my housemate and I made a drinking game for it, gather around...Just the Sip(up to 4 players)Everyone has a drink ready to go, play a game of 5 lives, last man standing is the winner and the remaining hearts they had left is the number of sips all losers have to take after each round.It can only get better from there.

												I didn't love this one.  The controls are annoyingly imprecise, the gameplay modes are very limited, and it doesn't have much staying power.  Wouldn't be a bad buy for $5, but after only an hour with it I'm not compelled to go back.			",322,123,3,15,12,4,16

												Starwhal is a zany, neon-soaked, 80s-tinged local multiplayer combat game with silly physics and a killer synth pumping soundtrack.Grab some controllers and some friends and many laughs and good times will be had by all. It's simple enough that almost anyone can just pick up and play making it a super accessible party game, but has enough depth that battles between masters can be heart pumping and intense.

								I'd give it 4 stars for now. This is one the most epic games where you can play mulitplayer with just 1 computer and some ps3 or xbox controllers. It has good ps3 controller compatibility but only annoying thing is the controls that you have to do in the menu. X to accept and O to go back. and to open up bots and player controlled characters, you have to use a ps3 combination like ^ + X + R1.  For now, it is a game mainly for windows as i am experiencing some troubleshooting on my macbook air. although it still runs smoothly on 1.3 GHz, i cannot open the game on fullscreen as it will get stuck on the loading screen. To fix this, i changed the opening method to windowed mode. But all the more it is still in early access and i am eagerly waiting for the upcoming updates for this game. highly recommended for people who want to have good competitive fun with family and friends.

												I must admit that the controls make it hard to ""fly"" around the arena but i take the slippery controls as a challenge since without them i could have gotten a flawless victory on my second game but anyways, Stunning visuals smooth slow-mo and exellent music starwhal has to easily be (on my first day i might add) my favourite game with the only complaint without a silver lining being the lack of online, This game may be written off as some 5 minute novelty but let me tell you this game is more addicting than tf2 and gmod purely because it's easy to learn as Extra Credits once said complexity limits depth and when you can learn all of the controls in 2 or 3 rounds the depth is almost limitless (without a tutorial) it may not have a story but with this game who needs a story anyways? (i have been playing with a controller) The price for this game may nag a select few but when this game is on sale it is a must have 10% off or 70% off			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game about being narwhals in space trying to stab each other's hearts is only a game that geniuses could come up with. Its just icing on the cake when the only way to attack is to generally launch your body at the enemies and hope for the best. In all seriousness though, this game is a great game to play with friends because it has a silly idea for it and the gameplay really isnt all that bad.			",120,19,1,16,27,2,8

This game features all of the chaotic narwhal combat you will ever want and need!   Plus it's local multiplayer so you can challenge the whole family to a wonderful round of Starwhal! Then ruin their self esteem by telling them that they're a pathetic disapointment for not being equal to your Flailing Narwhal technique and that they should be ashamed to bear the same last name as you: THE STARWHAL SUPER SAIYAN.

I adore Nidhogg and its' ilk.  But this game - what is there to like?  Spin, spin, spin, move forward, try not to get your belly touched - that's literally the entire game.  Is it kinda funny and pyschedelic?  Sure.  But that wears off after about 3 matches.			",366,136,0,46,34,4,60

								This is one of those rare party games that is not only fun to play, but also fun to watch. It's an awesome passive distraction for everybody, and it's simple enough that lots of people feel comfortable picking up a controller to give it a try.Because it's still unfinished, expect a few bugs - the game quits recognizing all controller inputs once every hour or so on the OSX version I play, requiring a restart. It isn't quite in good enough shape to be turned off and left unattended, but that shouldn't scare you away from giving it a try.			",169,64,2,11,21,4,21

												Starwhal is a fun and casual game that can be played in offline mode on steam with your friends ON THE SAME COMPUTER. Although some people do not like this game for its simplicity and limited gameplay, it is a very fun, light, portable, inexpensive, and an incredible game to experience. The skill range is very casual but some people can get VERY GOOD at the game. What I love most about this game is the ability to play multiplayer with just one computer. IT IS A GENIUS IDEA and you can play up to 4 players in the game! If you're on a road trip and you are bringing a laptop to play games with friends, I reccomend this game to you! :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fun simple game with friends. The controls are purposefully wonky, and that makes the game hilarious while retaining balance between experienced and new players. Lots of laughs to be had. Some drawbacks:Gameplay modes other than the first one are a waste of time, not really fun and some of them require too much coordination than is possible with the controls. The game works best when it's chaotic. Some of the maps also take away some of the fun by throwing the players around too much, taking away almost all control.Just grab some friends, stick to the main game mode, and find the maps that are fun and you'll be golden.

												Neat concept and could be fun as a party game with friends, however, the controls are so awkward and frustrating i really couldnt stand to play this game for more than 5 minutes on my own. the trials is summarized by messing up and spamming the restart button over and over, and the CPU AI isnt great in versus. they are difficult simply because they dont actually know how to play the game, they just rush over and tap their horn on the person who has the flag or whatever, usually resulting in  them or you getting stuck against a wall unable to move, while the CPU gets all the points and thats about it. Would be better with friends, good game to get when its on sale, wouldnt recommend it at full price.			",159,19,2,15,10,2,23

												I must say... This is great for the first hour or so... maybe two if you reaaaaaaaaaaaally push it. Truly, the only appeal for this game is a party game, a game for when you're drunk, or simply the fact that it has space narwhals.Gameplay: Not much to be said... Pretty good, but it all comes down to a great deal of luck. Point your narwhal in the general direction of where you want, maybe pull off a technique that works 60% of the time, hope to hit the heart. Alot of flailing around, alot of stabbing tails, alot of floundering in corners.Gameplay: 3/10anything else: Not much to be said. Not worth the price, burns really fast, buy if you are planning to play this once.			",63,6,0,3,2,0,6

								I never knew being a narwhal in space could be so fulfilling. Really fun, simple, fast paced game with next to no learning curve, so anyone can jump into and enjoy, and it's especially fun if you can get some friends to play too.My only real issue with the game is it's LOCAL MULTIPLAYER ONLY (at least, for now), so you can't play with friends over the internet and if you have four players in one game, you will need controllers for a least two people.If you don't mind the lack of online multiplayer, it's still a great game, even when you're playing on your own. I'd give it 8/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Since February I have been a part of the humorous game we know as startwhal, now that it is fully released I just can’t believe how much time has gone by. I love this game; I recommend it to anyone with a likeness for arcade style games. With newly added maps, challenges and achievements the amusement to this game has grown to its peak. The game to my knowledge runs incredibly smoothly, and has a nice cartoony graphics style. This is a nice game to play as filler, the rounds don’t take very long, and when there’s nothing else to do it acts as a perfect usage of time I recommend having a copy in every steam account			",129,41,3,7,22,3,10

								This game is good, however there my be unfixable bugs of which I found.Some include:   Teleporting out of the ring if pausing just before hitting the ground at a high velocity.   Being stuck in the ground with your horn, unable to move until someone barges you out.   The AI just forget what they're doing and stop moving completely.Apart from that, this game is pretty good, and the bugs can possibly be fixed (I'm not to sure), and the AI were an amazing feature which the creators added, as now I can practice my skills (Of which I have many) for when I go against my foes.On the subject of AI, I have found that it is very good at this game, and take a fair amount of skill to take down. This can seem a little annoying for people who just started to play the game, but really, just learn to play the game (I have never understood this problem which people have with learning curves).I would recommend this game, as it is only £6.99 at the time of writing this, so is quite cheap for a game which can be a different experience for each person you fight, as everyone brings new skills to this game.

												The latest in space-narwhal simulation, compiled by severl professors whom i by complete coincidence managed to forget the names of.

""Space narwhales stab their hearts each other in many arenas""Starwhal is a roguelike PvP swim'n'stab game with a pretty cool soundtrack. The main characters are in free nature very rare narwhales which are here colored and flow in space for the casual playing and fun.It has basically two gamemodes. 1. Challenge mode is like a skilled timemode to run through labrinths. 2. Versus mode is a PvP arena upto 4 players, but just local Co-op.Though you can have some fun for a few hours with the wonky controls and beating your Steam friends as ghost whales in challenge mode. But then the stimula is mostly over. No locked maps to unlock, no other excitement. Just earning medals and die trying over and over again. If you are somehow finished with the Challenge mode then comes the really most grinding part: The Versus mode. Naturally you play against yourself if you don't have your friends at home all the time. But you have to do it many many times to get the extraordinary high amount of kills (10k in classic 32k in score) for the achievements. And even if they are similiar to do (stab other whales into their hearts) they don't count for each other. That's quite annoying to have such an artificial playtime extender in there.My conclusion: Starwhale could be a casual and fun game. But in reality it demands too much time for grinding some achievements. Also it has just local co-op and is pretty high priced unless you can get it for cheap in a bundle.

								This games is fast, furious and absolutely insane. The customisation is fantastic, the maps are great and the two modes are extremely fun.  I can't wait for some updates. Online multiplayer is a must though, it would just make it even better and give it more re-playability.			",86,13,1,5,12,0,12

												My heart dropped when I started this game up.The game has been slaughtered since the free version with the change to the controls.It is nigh impossible to control the whales with any sort of accuracy, which is frustrating and leads to awkward situations when two players helplessly wriggle about on opposite sides of the playing field.What were they trying to accomplish with this change? Moving around in the old version was sheer joy, and players could play around, hug eachother, strike poses and, yes, even navigate accurately.The new backgrounds and pointless hats bring some diversity but also mess up the purity of the neon graphical style.Many of the levels are great though. I wish I could play the browser version with the new levels.I thoroughly recommend StarWhal, the old free version. Avoid this one unless they fix it.			",191,48,1,21,25,0,43
