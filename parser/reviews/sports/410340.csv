Early Access Review
								======================================EDIT: My original review was in March 2016, and after playing this game I did get into FPV, DEEEEEP... lol, and this sim really helped lock in important skills. I had another look today, and noticed a huge improvement in the tutorial, multiple pre-made quads and general polish across the board. I still can't dive the Hoover Dam, but give them time... Best FPV sim available!======================================This is coming from a hardcore gamer, looking to get into FPV drones because they look like fun,I am enjoying the sim, it seems like a great way to learn how to fly before destroying an actual drone, and I could see it being a fantastic skill improving tool even when flying actual drones regularly. I just have a few things that need mentioning if this game is to be the ""gateway drug"" for gamers becoming FPV pilots, and surely that thought has crossed the devs minds.Firstly, that tutorial is brutal. Maybe coming from a RC background it would be easier, but having never flown a quad-copter before, being put in a box with one window to exit from is the equivalent of learning to pick locks by handcuffing yourself underwater. A typical gamer will need at least half hour in a large open space, preferably with a guide and controller indications explaining how the drone works by performing simple maneuvers ie ""Take off, hover  at same altitude for 10 seconds"" ""Now fly forwards and backwards maintaining altitude"" etc until the basics are natural.Next up, there really needs to be some sort of pre-made drones that handle differently for different levels of skill. Begin with a slow and sluggish drone that is forgiving and easy to fly, then work your way up as your skills improve. I know there is a workshop where I can edit my drone, and options to set motor speeds etc. but these should really be options I fiddle with after I have learned what is what, not while I am struggling to stay horizontal as I smash into another hay bale.Speaking of hay bales. The maps. Seriously, I could be flying anywhere in the world, but here I am in some unbelievably dull locations. I am sure more maps are on the way, but even for RC enthusiasts this can't make much sense. Here are a few map ideas I would be excited to see in the final release:Boat (sinking titanic?)Music festival (maybe Woodstock?)Theme ParkHot Air balloon Show. (Take off from one balloon, and there are 30 others just floating about)Construction tower.Literally ANYWHERE! I understand that this is trying to be realistic, but a game like this also gives you the ability to do things you wouldn't usually be able to do, like fly in public areas full of people, or dangerous locations, and the lines required the fly for racing could be a lot more interesting than markers on the ground, like ducking behind a waterfall to emerge near a roller coaster track, which you must follow for while before shooting into a ghost train tunnel. Gimmicky? Yes, but if just a couple of unrealistic tracks were included, it would be a lot of fun.TL;DR I am enjoying the game, and hope to see it become more approachable, without losing it's realistic simulation edge. I recommend for anyone interested in FPV drone racing.If you're curious how deep I dove into the world of FPV check out this clip

			Working in Melbourne for the past 2 weeks I found the time to fly some interesting spots.		

I'm no Matty Stuntz, but I improved quickly thanks to the help of this sim.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I love this game.     A friend started flying quadcopters and quickly pulled me into the hobby.  I had flown a toy grade Quad two or three times and realized quickly that it wasn't as intuitive as I thought and it was going to take a lot of crashing, buying parts, repairing and crashing again just to begin to grasp the fundamentals. Afterwards my friend introduced me to Liftoff. I was intrigued because it was radically different from actually flying the toy grade drone.  After spending a few days figuring out what radio controller was right for me I ordered one and immediately got Liftoff.      I played with an XBOX 360 controller untill the RC controller arrived. Playing with the XBOX controller is definately not going to allow you to experience the full greatness of the game but I was thrilled to have the option since I was waiting for the RC controller. When it arrived it made playing the game WAY more enjoyable but, the first few hours were miserable. I kept trying and finally I was able to complete a lap, then a race and then things fell together and the game became incredibly rewarding. Not only is the game tremendous fun to play but I eventually realized that awful learning curve was really Liftoff teaching me how to use a radio transmitter. About a month later (about 20 hrs of playing Liftoff) I built my first FPV racing drone and although I've had more than my share of crashes, I can honesty say that Liftoff may have saved me hundreds of dollars and hours of tedious repairs. It gave me a big head start on actual FPV racing.     If you're interested in learning to fly quads then you should do yourself a huge favor and hold off on the expensive quad, get Liftoff and a controller first. Learn to fly in Liftoff, then go fly the drone, you'll be glad you did. I also tried FPV Freerider and while it was fun to play it just didn't seem to replicate the actual flying experience as realistically. The drones in Liftoff feel real, plus, with the update there's new quads and propellers and a plethora of other new parts to play with in the Workbench. I love mixing and matching components and seeing how it effects flight characteristics. The workshop has a number of really great tracks available too.  The various drone options in conjunction with all the maps available really extend the game immeasurably. (Side note: the track creator seems a little cumbersome to use)     Knowing now how much fun the game is,  I would fork over the cash for a RC transmitter and this game even If i had no intention of ever actually controlling a real drone. (Kinda like buying a wheel and/or pedals for a car racing game.)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								No issues downloading and installing from Steam the afternoon it was released.  Try all the menus and options.  No issues at this point.  Got a little sim time, and I am no expert in flying.  The options of FPV noise is nice.  The graphics are awesome.  No major issues.  Looking to hook up Spektrum controller later.  Used xBox controller with no issues.  Nice Early Access - I will provide more details as I play more.  #crashatnoexpenseEdit 11/12Got over three hours in the game, and I love it.  I was able to hook up my Dx7s with the helpful discussion post.  I have gained a bit more confidence and even toyed with Acro mode.  The first update was a big difference.  This game is showing great potential and look forward it!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Still very much an Early Access experience, but it's shaping up nicely. It's already a ton of fun to play and good practice for the real thing. The graphics are locations are especially impressive, and the workbench aspect adds a lot to the experience.The things I would like to see prioritized moving forward are continuing to tweak the physics and adding at least a simple lap timer (ala freerider) so that it is more useful for training, even before the racing aspect is available.Overall, a great sim with lots of potential that is definitely recommended at this price.

								I have flown in a few different multi-rotor sims and this one is, by far, my favorite. It's not 100% like the real thing, but it's certainly close enough to bring my skills up and make me way more confident on the controls. Learning with a sim is like learning to ride a bike with training wheels. Until you get out there and fly on the real sticks you can't hope to compete. However, this is a great tool to get your confidence up and make you more comfortable for when you do get your hands on the sticks. I've been using this sim for a while now and I'm certainly learning more and more. Each time I fly my quad I'm more and more confident and that's come way faster than just flying once a week for a few packs thanks to this sim. There's never a substitute for the real thing, but this is certainly something to help get your there and even help sharpen your skills when you get there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
