												You remember all these times you were playing a 'regular' racing game and that ""!$%@ car passed you right before the finish line? Of course it blocked the whole road and you were out of nitro so in the end you were only able to score the infamously annoying 2nd place...Well 'Gas Guzzlers' solves this problem by adding some machine guns, shotguns or some friggin rockets to your car. An opponent is right in front of your car and blocks the way? Here it's a perfect opportunity to pump some metal into this target on wheels and turn it into a burning pile of scrap. EAT THIS! It's definitley a very entertaining and quite solid arcade/action-racer with several fictional cars, routes and weapons, that features many interesting gaming modes as well as a small tuning system and... Zombies (DLC)! I mean hunting zombies with a nice sports car and some built in shotguns: That's the real manly way to do it!Sure the cars don't drive very smoothly, there is no real story in the campaign mode, the music is just some generic rock stuff, there is no splitscreen (and the multiplayer is kind of empty) and the whole concept is copied from several other games but it is combined quite well, makes a lot of fun and is at least worth to look at in a Sale. It's like the indie child of 'FlatOut', 'Mario Kart' and 'Twisted Metal'. The one with Zombies. And rockets. And railguns. The one you always wanted because of... (explosive) reasons!

												""Very nische racing type of game, yet entartaining as nothing else.""There has been not many games that actually have cars and weapons mixed together. This type of racing game is pretty ""nische"" and there were games in the past (Road Wars for example) that did it nicely. This one is new, fresh, and does it stand up to the great game name? That question is pretty tough, but in my honest opinion - yes it does. Previous Gas Guzzlers was plagued by loads of problems: from barely working controls, via terrible physics, to horrible optimisation. This one as sequel on the other hand, does everything better, as expected. Game starts you with sponsored car. You get the money by winning races. The more races you win, the more money you get. Also winning unlocks cars, upgrades, rims, stickers and weapons, but this happens every 3-4 races. There is a lot to do in single player, however, the beginning of the campaign is pretty slow, and boring, but it does get better as you progress more. In the race you have various objectives that can give you more money, like ""destroy x amount of cars in 1 lap"". This adds variety to the gameplay and does add the replay value to the game. Graphics are much better. They are shiny (but it's not overdone) colourful, with nice shadows and particle effects. Models look nice, and most of cars are based on their real counterparts which is good, but they have really cheesy names. Overall game has really cheesy humour, which could be considered childish, but for me, it doesn't matter, but let's get back to technical stuff. Damage done to cars is somewhat 'meh' but it does job well on harder difficulties. Ai does it's job too. They're challenging, they are intelligent and they use their weapons with caution and can be deadly sometimes. Optimisation here is also better than previous one. I have mid-range PC and 60FPS all the time on ultra settings, which is amazing. There are many options to customise so you won't be dissapointed. Sound departament delivers funny yet very high quality sounds, for example there are voice-overs from Duke Nukem (!) which is a nice touch (they sound exactly like duke!), engines have that ""punch"" and differ from car to car... Just awesome. Music is outstanding, some heavy metal tunes over there, but opinions may vary here.Controls are improved, as it should be done in sequel. Car instantly responds to your commands, they have feel of weight, but at the same time they handle well. I had no problems handling the cars. Keep in mind that every car handles differently, and there are noticable differencies between all of them. Same goes to weapons. Some can shoot even backwards, which is awesome. There are some powerups on map such as repair, oil that you can spill on the track, mines etc. It all works together very well.Multiplayer is a typical madness. Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, Last Man Standing. Just Awesome. Too bad that nobody plays this game on MP which is shame because it's so much fun even with bots. Runs fluid smooth, has no lag issues, so what's the matter?There are some flaws. Sometimes Ai runs in circles when FPS goes down on older PC's. There were some problems for me with my steering wheel, but I got them resolved, and mentioned above slow single player campaign start which is annoying and can make you bored of game quickly if you won't get new car soon. I also wish for more cars, and weapons. There were some problems with achievements, but other than that, I had no glitches.Game is good for what it is. It does entertain you, and it does it pretty well. Question is, is it worth 22,99? For me, yes, for others looking for a realistic racing game - not really. Buckle up, this is going to be hell of a ride!8/10			",399,73,42,34,51,7,45

												This game needs more love. It is Fun, Fast Paced, and full of action. Gas Guzzlers leans into the shooter and battle aspects, but there are straight races to be had, in addition to Arena Deathmatches and Elimination Races. There is a significant single player experience and online bots to get you started.  if you enjoyed Twisted Metal, or the Flatout series, you will likely enjoy this immensely. 8.5 / 10			",322,23,14,10,34,4,49

												Vehicular combat racers come in many shapes. Futuristic hovercraft blowing each other up was made legendary in the Wipeout series and psychotic characters driving contemporary vehicles made blowing your friends up a blast in Twisted Metal. Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a good, old-fashioned vehicular combat racer which brings nothing new to the table but adds a new title to a solid and entertaining genre.The realistic thing about Gas Guzzlers Extreme is that you play as a redneck who has been recruited to race in a tournament created by rednecks for rednecks and, let’s face it, if anyone would be dumb enough to strap weapons on their cars and race around shooting at each other it would be rednecks.For fans of games like Flatout the amount of vehicles may be a bit small but coupled with a number of engine and weapon upgrades and the ability to customise the look of the car, there is ample opportunity to make the eighteen vehicles on stock completely your own. Cosmetic upgrades are free of charge and completing races will unlock new stickers and rims for your car. Engine, brake, and weapon upgrades, however, cost money which you earn during the race by finishing in a top spot, destroying enemy cars, performing daredevil stunts, and completing bonus objectives.Scattered throughout the tracks are weapons and boosts waiting to be picked up by the first car to hit them.The weapons available range from machine guns and shotguns to plutonium tipped rockets and some can fire both forward and backwards.As you can see, there is nothing really new about it, but the levels are very well designed and they come in seven different settings, ranging from dry deserts to snow covered mountains. None of the tracks I raced on was irritatingly complicated or idiotically simple, so the design team deserves complements for hitting a nice middle route in that regard. Races are tight and exciting and the AI functions very much like you would expect a real racer to behave.The graphics are adequate and the sound design is good but where the experience truly excels is music. The rock tracks that play during races blend perfectly into the action and boost the already heart-pounding excitement of the race.The game’s sense of humour is also a nice touch and everything from the track and bot names to the driver dancing the hula with a tire while you customise your car in the garage put a smile on your face both during and between races.This game is a welcome addition to the combat racing genre and although it adds nothing new to it, it holds up well against games like Twisted Metal. This genre is severely under-served on the PC and I encourage anyone who enjoyed the likes of Interstate ‘76 to pick this game up.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Car combat has been the red headed stepchild of video game genres almost since its inception. The rash of Twisted Metal clones that came in the early days soured many, and even Sweet Tooth and the gang haven’t had the best track record as of late. Last generation, Burnout took up the car chaos crown, with its traffic checking and Crash Mode, but the developers got lost in Paradise City and are now toiling away at the endless barrage of samey Need For Speed titles. Gas Guzzlers Extreme, a new entry in the genre by Gamepires, isn’t going to set the world on fire, mostly due to its lack of flamethrowers. However, the game does strike a nice balance between the crash heavy races of Burnout and the heat seeking missiles of Twisted Metal that any fan of the genre should take notice of.I wrote more about it in my full review, available over on Geekenstein.com: http://www.geekenstein.com/gas-guzzlers-extreme-review/ ",2858,996,116,291,324,33,437

												It's a lot like Flatout, while your goal often is to finish first, boost is key to getting past all the cars, and you will get boost by crashing into things and other drivers. Then you have the option to blow up other cars with an array of guns which is fun. Cars look good and are inspired by real life cars and you unlock upgrades for them during the campaign. The campaign consists of a straight line of races where you can pick between race, racing with shooting, elimination and also death match later on.All races have challenges which spice up the fun and rewards you with extra money but the challenges are sometimes very hard to pull off. I would recommend this game if you are looking for something fun, just don't expect anything else like deep story elements.			",472,89,18,46,21,3,45

												One of the best game i've ever played in a long time.Remind me a lot of interstate 76 with a mix of DeathRally with the AAA graphics of the today’s games.TONS of customization, LOTS of weapons, cars, stickers, well the games let you customise TONS of awesome cars.You start with a 1959 3 wheeler car, and you buy and buy more cars. Tons of references too.If you like Interstate 76, Burnout or anything that lets you customise cars, with HUGE guns, and have plenty of fun in an ARENA or around A BIG GIANT CASTLE with friends or versus both with a solo mode that have tons of cups that LET YOU CHOOSE the mode you want to play to progress in solo or in multi (There’s even a capture the flag).This game is for you, even if you think it’s not for you, i’m not a big fan of racing games… but you surely gonna like it.You can select if you want the game to be more arcade or realist with the car reacting differently to the environement.The AI is ajustable, no abusive rubberbanding AI like many game have.Also possibility to select your profile, so you can start another campaign without losing your progrss.Awesome multiplayer mode, even having capture the flag mode.The game is awesome. The only thing the game need is Steam workshop.			",1864,608,106,223,272,42,321

												Really hope the developers have something new coming up. This game is awesome, something I've been looking for since Vigilante 8. Even though it's racing and not just car combat, the racing part of it is still very enjoyable.Capture the flag is quite competitive, you're not always just with crap AI, they do actually help.- Lots of upgrades, unlocks, races and cars- Beautiful visuals- Great humor - Great AI, can be rather challenging- Shortcuts on various tracks, always something to look for.- Hazards on the roads, explosive barrels, oil cans.Overall, if you're looking for a great arcade racer, with guns just like the old days. This is certainlly for you.Note to developers - You've done extremely well, please keep at it and come out with a sequel. Love to see what you could all come up with :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic multiplayer game.  If you want a racing game with simple handling and over the top guns then this is a fantastic choice.  Admittedly single player might get boring after a few hours (although racing against hard AI is a surprisingly deep experience).  However the multiplayer creates fantastic moments and memories.DLC is great value if you enjoy this game.  Zombies is especially hilarious fun with mates.If you have friends who are keen to play this with you it is a brilliant buy.In short, worth considering as a single player racer.Definitely worth the buy if you have friends to play with.EDIT:Didn't expect this review to get noticed.  Thought I should mention multiplayer with strangers is very rare, however there are official servers so its easy to organise a game with friends.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like the flatout serious but you think it could have had little more action, this might be the right game for you. Totally underrated game, being a mixture between a racer and a shooter. Fast paced, good multiplayer, lots of game modes, cars and weapons.Unfortunately there are not that many people playing this game online at any point in time. On the week-ends, it's okay, which means there's like 1-2 full lobbies. It supports dedicated servers as well, so you don't have to fear that you can't play online anymore when the publisher shuts their servers down.			",104,33,3,12,8,2,19

												Car combat games can be hit or miss, and I'm very happy to say that Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a hit through and through. The game features a single player campaign spanning over three separate championships and a multitude of races leading up to unlocking said championships, in which you can pick and choose which type of race you'd like to play. You have your classic race with no weapons other than specials (mines, smoke, oil spills, and the like), battle races (where you must complete so many laps and stay alive while trying to kill your opponents), and knock out races (number of laps equals number of opponents, and you can either win by killing everyone else or completing the laps remaining). Over time, you'll unlock some fantastic game modes such as deathmatch (whoever kills 10 other cars first wins), capture the flag (my personal favorite, where you must capture a flag and drive it to the other flag, which in many cases is picked up by the opposing team; death and explosions ensue),and last man standing (eight cars spawn on the map, kill and try not to die until you're the last). You can pick and choose from whichever game modes you want to play, earning points to further your standing. If you find classic races boring, you don't have to play them at all (other than one per championship), which is a pretty cool feature.The cars control great, and differentiate a bit between one another. You have options to upgrade your car's body, weapons, and paint job, even down to what color your license plate is. There are quite a bit of cars to pick from, and many unlock during your journey through the campaign. The cars are not licensed, but are made to appear like real branded cars (the car The Matador, for example, shares the likeness of the Lamborghini Aventador). The settings screen allows you a variety of options, including turning cursing off, which I did simply because I liked having the option (this also would make this game suitable for children, as other than the cursing, there is no blood or graphic violence other than explosions, which are fun for the whole family). I beat the game's entire campaign in about nine hours, but it doesn't have to end there if you don't want it to. The game also features multiplayer for those who like to play online (not my cup of tea, personally, so I did not check this option out), quick races, and you can even continue in the campaign like normal, sans championships. For those who only play single player like myself, don't fret. The game's AI is some of the best AI I've ever seen in a game of any genre, and I'm not exaggerating. The AI in this will not let you win easily, and their ruthlessness in battle is what made capture the flag so fun and memorable for me. I did not notice any rubberbanding, however. The AI will mess up like you do, driving over mines and crashing into each other, keeping the game fair, yet challenging.The game doesn't feature a very memorable soundtrack, but it's not terrible by any means, and the music that plays during upgrading sessions reminded me a lot of Fallout 3. The graphics of the game are pretty great for 2013, other than some blurry background textures that you shouldn't be paying attention to anyway. The only two negatives I have for this game are that for one thing, I never did figure out how to use the smoke special every single time I picked it up. It seemed finicky, like it would only work a third of the time you legitimately picked it up, so I'm not sure if it had a cooldown or what. The second negative would be that although you can pick between multiple game modes throughout the campaign, the race tracks seem to randomize, and you often have to play some of the same tracks quite often, despite unlocking new ones nearly every race. Also, if you are wanting to play a certain game mode but don't want to play on the track it offers, you can't switch the track within that game mode. You'd either have to suck it up or play a different mode (the latter of which I usually did, since they all are fantastic). Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a fantastic game that should belong to every racing fan, and it serves as a great ""learning tool"" for those gamers who are looking for a good intro game to the car combat genre, as its options and various difficulties make the game approachable for genre veterans and beginners alike. It's one of those games you'll keep on your hard drive even after you beat it, because it's an easy game to drop in and drop out of. I would personally rate this a 9/10. I was looking for a car combat game that would make my heart race and fulfill my need for destruction and explosions, and Gas Guzzlers Extreme did so in every regard.			",461,269,16,130,96,2,166

												This game is fantastic. Normally racing games aren't my thing, but with this vehicular car combat game it is a recipe for destruction, and I love it. The guns are satisfying, the cars drive really nicely, and the game looks really nice.What shook me was the devs asking me to do voice acting for them, and after a few trial runs had my voice accepted into the game.

 It might not be very original, but it is fun and very easy to pick up. I started to play like 15 Hours in Multiplayer with my brother and some friends. Damn... its fun to just stump my Friends with a freaking lazergun on my car and hear them scream: ""OOHH MAAA GAAAD! WHAT WAS THAAAT WTF""hahaha. This game is pure fun! Singleplayer is fun too! Its the typical race Story mode, where you get sponsor and money to upgrade your car like in need for speed. Its fun! Not original but does a great job in what its supposed to be.

												If ever a game was either made FOR Jeremy Clarkson, or BY Jeremy Clarkson, this is the one! Racing in Lamborghini's armed with miniguns and rocket launchers while also being able to lay mines, oil slicks and smoke trails... and racing against drivers such as Luke Likesheet, Alotta Fagina and Jenny Talia... This has Clarkson and Top Gear all over it!I can't recommend this game highly enough! Graphically very good, audio is also very good, and the main feature, the gameplay itself, is superb! I love the black humour and it is very easy to lose all track of time while playing this... so while you may intend to only have a couple of short races, the next thing you know it's 3 hours later. The variety in the difficulty levels are perfect, so this game is fine for racing gamers of any skill level. Progression through the game is set at a good rate so you rarely find yourself having to wait for new cars, weapons, upgrades or tracks to become available, nor do you find yourself lagging behind the other racers because you can't afford the upgrades to compete.I'm a huge fan of racing games, and while this is as far removed from a serious racer as it gets, it is also one of the most enjoyable racing games i have ever played! You MUST buy this game!			",211,16,19,31,27,0,62

												Oh man....this is as adrenaline pumping a racing game as I have played. In addition to the kick♥♥♥♥♥soundtrack, the cars are beefy in an arcadey way, the tracks are fun and often challenging, and the guns....oh man the guns!So, there are a few different race modes (all the racing standards really), but in addition to all the standards, there is also deathmatch. DEATHMATCH! That is balls out crazy bad assedness! There is also capture the flag (which is pretty much deathmatch with an obvious objective added).The campaign mode (so far as I have gotten) involves moving up through the rankings while buying new cars, upgrades, weapons and of course tricking out your cars as well. Each race features three modes to choose from (typically standard race, battle (with guns), and elimination). It's as simple as that.You can select a cheeseball voice for your racer and s/he comments throughout. I chose Arnold, and get some laughs out of it. So, in addition to the guns (THE GUNS!!!!), there are also pickups such as smoke, oil, mines, etc....flapjacks happen to be one of them lol...that you can then drop to mess up the other drivers. There is also nitro for that extra boost. You obviously have a myriad of ways to destroy your fellow racers, not the least of which include good old fashioned ramming. You can also pick up buffs like shields and double damage along the way. All are obviously single use or timed (depending on the type of pick up).Multiplayer features all the modes in a seven race round robin of sorts. They are team oriented, and if you play with somebody you know, you can definitely incorporate tactics into the matches to increase your odds of winning. There weren't a ton of players online when I played last night, but it was still a ton of fun and the game populates the matches with bots to fill them out if you don't have all 8 players to fill a server. The bots are actually pretty solid players as well lol.I would say this may go down as my fave racer. It is intuitive and easy to grasp, but still rewards practice. It has fun tracks, cool guns and upgrades, and no small amount of humor involved (outside of the voices, you might have a blow up doll or president bust passenger in your car, you might find penguins on the track, etc....).Definitely must own, must play.Do Eet. Do Eet Nowwww!!!!9 skid marks/run over penguins out of 10			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												When I bought my first gaming PC 20 days ago, I got this game plus 3 others from the CroTeam for free. First thing I installed was Gas Guzzlers Extreme as I was a big fan of Vigilante VIII and similar vehicular combat games. Although its not Vigilante VIII or Twisted Metal in its essence, it is coming pretty close to it and I was very satisfied overall. Pros:1. Graphics are excellent, both enviroments and cars. Many tracks and lots of cars.2. Physics are very satisfying as you can wreck lots of things and lose a lot of car parts in progress.3. I was never hardcore into racing except for Need for speed Underground 2, but racing itself is pretty nice, had no problems with the driving model.4. Combat ofcourse. Feels nice when you blow up your oponnent to pieces during the fullspeed or smahing them in the arena.5. Game modes. Incredible variety of modes. There is something for everyone: Capture the flag, zombie defense, deathmatch, regular racing, battle racing, team deathmatch... almost endless6. AI. If you play singleplayer and need a challenge, by choosing from 4 different difficulties, you will be challenged.7. If you have a group of friends to play this game with, multiplayer is just awesome, you can lose a lot of time to it.8. Optimization. There are plenty of graphics settings if you are struggling to reach your desired FPS.Cons:1. Multiplayer: As this game didn't have a lot of marketing and its developed by a really small team in Croatia, its not very known. Because of that, it is difficult to find others to play it with. I've been lucky and found a group of Americans.2. No splitscreen. As there are not so many players online, it would be nice to have splitscreen. I was sad as I could not play it with my friend when he came over to my house.I would recommend this game if you are looking for some combat on wheels. Its a quality game!			",37,19,0,1,3,3,12

												Gas Guzzlers Extreme gives you the option of playing a full blown career mode, a single race to learn the controls or an old-school arcade mode.There are a huge number of different cars that will immediately be very familiar. While none of them use the real names it’s obvious what they are.Another thing that you will notice about the cars is that they mostly seem to be iconic vehicles from the world of TV and film. You have cars based on K.I.T.T. from Knight Rider, the General Lee from Dukes of Hazard, the three-wheeler van from Only Fools And Horses, the Renault from Pink Panther and even the DeLorean from Back To The Future.When it comes to the races themselves they are split into three main categories; Knockout, Battle and Power Race.Within these main modes are also some sub-categories such as team battles, arena death matches, capture the flag and arena battles. One you get further into the game they also throw a load of zombies into the mix if you get Full Metal Zombie DLC.New weapons can be bought via the garage and extra ammo can be picked up around each track. Your car is also equipped with a nitro booster and this can be upgraded and replenished in the same way.  It’s also possible to simply ram opponents.Graphically Gas Guzzlers Extreme looks pretty damn great. The engine is fast and smooth and I haven’t noticed any glitches or screen tearing.Gas Guzzlers Extreme is great game to relax and just let your mind rest while you crush and shoot enemies with various weapons.

												Hands down gas guzzlers got to be the best combat racing game ever made, competitive to the bone, fun and awesome! Oh and criminaly underrated. I don't know why people complain about the graphics, because they look great, the usic is spectacular and also You can even choose Duke Nukem's voice as your pilot's voice, what more do you want :D I can't believe it's online playerbase is so very small. I mean, there are times when a room gets full - 8 players - and it's incredible fun, but also a rare event. The standard as of now is more likely 0-3 players playing online when I check in. More people should get it cause the game is really amazing!			",248,25,31,6,3,0,11

												There have been three truly great automotive combat games since people started trying to convert Car Wars into a video game: Autoduel, the original Twisted Metal, and now this title. This should have been one of the big games of the last year, but somehow it slipped past most of us. There is a ton of content here, and it's all AAA quality and execution. (Well, except for the names. As the title of the game may suggest to you, these people are TERRIBLE at naming things. Just terrible. It's painful. I'm not kidding.) Right now this is $3.45 on Humble. That's a steal. Highly recommended at any price point!As usual, feel free to friend me for multiplayer.			",90,6,5,13,14,2,32

												This is a fairly straightforward combat racing game.  While it is a console port, controls can be customised to make the game playable.A wide range of graphics options allow for modern PC's to be used effectively.   The game runs smoothly and looks well enough in 4K. Gameplay is fairly entertaining, pretty much what you expect from games of this genre.   While not the best example of the genre, and lacking a very wide array of vehicles and maps, it's adequate enough and doesn't have any drawbacks, so there's simply no reason to thumb this down.

												If someone ask whats the best racing game of 2013, it is definitely Gas Guzzlers Extreme to meThe game career is split into 3 tiers, each tier has a set of cars and tracks. The higher tier has more tracks but the game seem to have 4 environment only. Every race you win gets you cash to buy or upgrade your car, there isn't much ginding in the game since the money win per race is sufficient for you to buy multiple cars and upgrade them. Every race in the game has additional objective for you to complete, completing them will grant you extra cash. Objective such as: Kill Stu Pitt by smashing or be the first in every lap or get most kills in the race and etc. The career is filled with 3 game type at the start, power race which is like normal races with no weapons (is boring), battle race which let you use guns (great fun!) and there is knockout race where the last racer gets eliminated every lap or you can blow up your oppenent to get them out of the race (this is pretty challenging). Later in the game has last man standing which is like a demolition derby from FlatOut but with guns! There is a death match mode as well in tier 3 where the first person to score 10 kills wins the match. In both Last Man Standing and Deathmatch mode, the player start with no weapon but they always have a random weapon for you to pick up in front of you. You can pick multiple weapons and swap between them in this game modes. After a few wins in a row, you'll be given a sponsor livery for you to put on your car, having the livery installed on your car will grant you additional cash and when there is a sponsor event you'll be invited to race in it. I only went through 1 sponsor event (I prefer the custom livery than the sponsor livery but it seems like you need sponsor livery to unlock sponsor event), it is a team race. It is simple, keep your team in front and stop/blow up your enemy when they try to take your team's lead. The other event I saw is a team death match, there is a total of 3 teams in the match and the first team to get 30 kills wins the match. Sponsor events brings a lot more cash than the usual races. For the career mode, there isn't a fixed career structure. You can play the entire tier until the tournament unlocked by playing power race only if you want, the game dont force you to race a specific race mode that you may dislike, the only time it forces you to play through a specific race mode is in the tournament, you have to play each mode once. You progress the game career by climbing a leaderboard, the tournament is unlocked once you reach the first position of the leaderboard, the game dont force you to enter the tournament either, you can continue earning money for your upgrades even after you unlock the tournament. The AIs in the game is challenging, they are fast and it is definitely better than the typical NFS games AI, there are about 6 difficulty setting in the game.The tracks are great, large wide tracks with a lot of room to run and dodge the bullets and there are some which are tighter and more twisty tracks which is much more challenging. The cars drives pretty well, not the best driving physic since all the cars feels the same but it is still fun. The weapons variety is great, it ranges from shotguns, machine gun, mini gun, rocket launcher, grenade launcher, gauss rifle and homing missles. I'll recommend anyone to this game if they are looking for a great arcade combat racer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Edit: Oh this is lovely, like all indie developers who get bad reviews, the two for this game both gave me ""did not find this review useful"" then now told me that the reason I found the campaign to be repetative was because I hadn't played it enough yet. What total nonsense. They claimed that playing death matches or capture the flag would make the game more fun. I played both (specifically where I said ""Multiplayer games against bots"") and they were still not fun. Edit 2: I've checked the steam page for Gas Guzzlers and there's not one negative review with over 50% of people who found it useful.Huge redflag. Out of a 100 negatives reviews there's none with constructive criticism deemed useful ? I call BS.I'm giving this a thumbs down because I don't believe its worth the $24.99 price tag. At first, the game is a lot of fun and its really satisfying when you blow up your first car. The problem is that this is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played. You'll end up in first most the time, trying to decide whether you should slam the breaks to kill people and break the monotany or just go for an easy win. The ""campaign"" consists of 1. Race with no weapons 2. Race with weapons3. Race with weapons, but whoever is in last place gets taken out at the end of each lap. 4. Play multiplayer games against bots when the game decides its a special occassion. You'll play dozens of these races and feel like you aren't getting anywhere. New cars don't unlock often enough to keep things interesting, a sponsorship insures that you'll have about 5x as much money as you can possibly use, and its just agonizingly boring to win 5 races and be told CONGRATULATIONS! YOU UNLOCKED....1 NEW RIM AND 1 NEW STICKER! This game is fun for about an hour or two, but around the time you reach the first championship, you'll start to ask yourself why you're wasting your time driving in circles (alwasy in first place) when you could be playing Twisted Metal, Mad Max, or any number of car combat games.

A Great Action Car GameWith many different weapons to equip your car with, there is much fun to be had shooting and destroying your opponents vehicles whether it be with your friends or other players in multiplayer mode, or against the AI in one of the the many game modes this game has to offer.The sound and graphics are great in this game and the gameplay feels relatively smooth.The only minor setback for this game is that getting/setting up a game in multiplayer isn't as simple as it should be, since you have to set up your own server in a different window and then go back into gas guzzlers. However once that is all sorted out then the experience is quite good.Considering this game gets discounted by a fair bit during the sales, it is definitely worth picking this game up and having a go with your friends.

												You know, yes I am from Croatia - and this is made in Croatia game and I like it, not only because I support developers from my small (but most attractive looking) country, but also because game is simply awesome - I was always liking Flatout based games but this is something new and much better in my opinion to any Flatout based games. Gas Guzzlers Extreme game has its unique humor - which is really awesome. And game is cheap in price and you'll get tons of fun if you buy it - but you won't regret it I am sure. P.S - since I don't wanna to write much about negatives, because you can't find them easily at all on this game, but there's one little annoying thing is that finding multiplayer games is for now still pretty hard thing to do - it's pretty hard to find populated multiplayer servers for now, but I am sure this is gonna change in the future.Greetings from Slavonia, Croatia!

												The best Combat Racing game available on Steam. My only complaints are that there's usually not many people online and I think it could benefit with more car customisation in multiplayer - earning cash during multiplayer races to trick out your chosen car would make this more appealing in my opinion as there isn't much difference between how each car handles or performs.Otherwise, this game is definitely in my top 10 of the past decade.

With a good variety of vehicles, weapons, tracks, and a number of modes both focused around pure racing, pure combat, and some level of variation between the two. The cars control nicely, drifting is slick, boosting feels appropriately fast. Definitely worth picking up, in my opinion, if you have some friends to go play with for good fun. Can support up to 8 players online. Be weary though, the AI love to tail you and shoot shotguns up your♥♥♥♥♥			",2619,1269,69,244,264,20,256

Product received for free
												after owning this for over a year and playing it off and on in this time (before the first DLC released) - i must say without hesitation or negativity on any other game in the genres part - this is the most underrated car racing/destruction/replayability on the market today.  so few people know about this gem, and its even harder to get someone to give it a try!  well worry no more, the dev's like to think ahead, and by doing so made a demo.  if you are unsure about the content, you can try the demo for free!  how many games have demos nowadays?  a good 90% or higher ratio do not.  this will keep you coming back for years to come, as well as some of the most fun you've ever had in a race/deathmatch.  If you were a fan of games like Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 back in the day, this is like a combination of the two mixed with some of the recent need for speed games.  it has all the variations, race types and options you could ever dream of (save maybe 1 or 2 things which were so minor i cannot remember, and does not affect the product in any way) on top of racing/destroying with friends in a cooperative enviroment.  and if i remember correctly, at the time of its release (even to today) its the only online racing game which features fully functional and fully customizeable AI opponents while online. if you call yourself a 'gamer' and have not tried GGE, you sir/mam are no gamer at heart.  being a 'gamer' involves loving and trying all genres of games, instead of just sticking to 1.  so if you consider yourself one, give this a try, it even has a demo with limited content to give you the idea of what you are in for.  so there is no reason not to try it, my gamer friend.

												Update on review.. I have played the game a bit more and I really like it. I like the corny ai names like Jack Kass, Yuri Diculous, etc.. I like the graphics.. and most of all I enjoy the gameplay. If you thought Post Apocalyptic Mayhem was O.K. then this game is way better. This game is actually fun and has plently of online modes; such as battle modes-last man standing and team modes vs. racing with weapons and without and a good capture the flag mode unlike playing a fps. Only problme is not many human players. but able to vote in the servers and add and remove bots. They also added voice support but I think its always on so unless you ahve a mute button for your mic kinda annoying. great game. Also the music is awesome!!			",271,14,47,4,6,7,16

												This game is pretty awesome. It delivers on so many different levels with AAA execution but for some reason is overlooked by many. The amount of content you get at the low price point is unbelievable and the dlc is well worth it's low price too. The amount of cars and upgrades you can do combined with the several different game modes and tracks will keep you busy for some time. If you have been looking to relive the old twisted metal days then this is for you. If you're looking to destroy some cars and do some racing then this is for you. The only thing on the lower end is the amount of people that play online which really doesn't take anything away from the amazing single player. However I'm always looking for new people to shred some metal and fiberglass with so feel free to add me if you want in some fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Steam says me that I have it, but I just can't play it (if someone know why, and how to fix that, tell me).Meanwhile, I rated the game itself positive, and if I could, I would multiple kill the like button, because it's an AWESOME game made of scrap metal, bad jokes, bullets, explosions, chickens, and fun, and that's why every fan of Burnout, Jack X, or simply cars 'n guns should have it and love it every day of his life. May be a bit short in story mode, but there is MULTIPLAYER, and if you come here with your buddies, BE PREPARED FOR WW3/4/5/THE RETURN OF THE JEDI AND well you get it. Move your♥♥♥♥♥outta there and go for money to buy this piece of metal art.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A doll is sometimes your co-driver and the driver sometimes stand guard in the garage with an AK-47 and similar gags both on the tracks and in the garage make this game more fun to play. Also the game has guns/rockets/missiles mounted on a car.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over the years, I've enjoyed automotive racing/combat games such as INTERSTATE '76, DEATH RALLY, and TEST DRIVE:EVE OF DESTRUCTION.  GAS GUZZLERS EXTREME does a fine job of continuing the tradition.The graphics are excellent on more modern machines.  Gameplay is challenging but still enjoyable, as the difficulty setting is adjustable.  Vehicle control is good.  I will point out that the tracks are rife with sharp turns, so handling is an important as speed as you drive.  At the same time, one mistake by itself will not cost you a race.  There are a variety of weapon types to suit your combat preferences.  Shotguns and machine guns appear to be the most effective for races, but there are also missile launchers, grenade launchers, and even a delayed-reaction railgun for more exotic gameplay.  There are also droppable weapons (mines, smoke, and oil slicks).  In this regard, the game reminds me of Origin Systems' AUTODUEL.Adding to the fun is a wide variety of vehicle models.  These range from classic American muscle and sport cars to exotic performance models from Europe and Japan.The game's general tone appears heavily inspired by DEATH RALLY and DUKE NUKEM.  I mention the latter because some of the track and opponent names feature puns with a decidedly adult sense of humor.  Parents with young children or the easily offended should beware.  Overall, GAS GUZZLERS EXTREME is a very enjoyable game, and I recommend it to anyone wishing to scratch the automotive combat itch.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For older gamers who remember Interstate '76 and Interstate '82, this game will seem familiar.  That is not to say that they are terribly similar, it is just the ""feel"" is hard to deny. Having bought it as a time-waster that I could play with the family, I was quite pleasantly suprised at how engaging the game is.  You just want to keep racing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1- GENERALGas Guzzlers Extreme is a racing and combat game.The game presents itself with a lot of content for a racing game. You have the usual stuff, like career mode, quick race, multiplayer (which is almost empty), but inside of those you can ad a lot more.In career mode you start with one car and you will unlock the others during your progress. Upgrades can be bought with the money earned in the races. You can customize paint jobs, rims and even the license plate. Guns can be added to the car, shield, new exhaust or engine... the world is not enough.I should say that the game does not have real licensed cars, but imagine chinese copies of famous cars. You are wright. All the cars are blatant copies of real cars, and you will spend some time guessing which is which.The graphics are OK. We know this is not a AAA game, but the textures are quite nice and detailed. The cars are very well designed. Keep in mind that this is not Gran Turismo, but the creators have a nice and polished game.2- GAMEPLAYSurprisingly this game has quite a nice handling. The physics of the car are not perfect, but very acceptable for a combat game. The AI is very nice, and hard to beat even at medium levels. There are some nice toutches like the funny AI names, and the option to choose from different types of commentaries. I've choose to have Duke Nukem commenting my races. It's quite fun.There are some different game modes:* Power race: a straightforward race, with no weapons or combat envolved;* Battle race: a normal race but with weapons and the possibility to knock out opponents;* Knockout: 8 guys in an arena, the last one alive wins;* Sponsored events: sometimes your sponsor puts you in private capture the flag races.There are some pickups during the races. They give you some perks or simply ammunition, and they can change the flow of the game.Shortcuts are available, but they are not easy to drive through.3- CONCLUSIONI'm having a lot of fun with this game. I have to admit, the price is a bit steap, since it's marked 22,99€ in steam atm, but in a sale under 5€ is a must have for racing games fans.

												They don't really make games like this anymore. Car combat games, I mean. The best we got was the Twisted Metal Remake on the Playstation 3 in 2012, and that was after years of silence in that genre. Back on the Playstation 1, the best Twisted Metal competitor was undoubtedly Vigilante 8, and Gas Guzzlers reminds me of that game quite a bit, though it focuses more on actual racing than Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8 did.The game is also quite beautiful, with gorgeous lighting, cinematic motion blur, and highly detailed tracks. My issue with the game is the progression. The demo was great fun, because you had a pretty good car and a varied list of modes to play through, between arena deathmatch, combat racing, and even capture the flag. The progression in the full game is a lot more tedious; you have to work your way up buying new cars one by one, but you are locked out of the good cars until you reach a specific point in the game. It always felt like I had more than enough money for whatever I wanted at any given time and that the game was intentionally holding me back and restricting me to lame cars.You are also very slowly eased in to the game's more intense modes. Expect to spend a couple hours doing slow races, often without any weapons at all. Eventually you'll end up with a garage full of cars you'll probably never drive because they are objectively worse than stuff you get later on in the game.Despite this, I'd still recommend it. There's a great game in here, you just have to do some digging to get to it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a spectacular 10+ hour game, with the option of having Duke Nukem as your announcer. The AI have the best AI names I've ever seen in a game, and the cars / weapons are pretty lit as well. The only problem is that the nuke only comes with four shots (That's using the last car fully upgraded) before needing to get an ammo pickup again, and there's really nothing to do after the campaign unless you have a friend who also owns the game. Otherwise, this game is sweet. Buy it when it's on sale because it's more of a $20 game than it is a $30.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game however carefully. This game is also not split screen which is it's biggest down fall.I've read somewhere that this game could be comparable to an xbox 360 version of Mario Kart. Can such a comparison be made? Sort of. The game does deliver a fun arcade impact but instead of over stepping its boundaries and becoming limitless, Gaz Guzzlers Extreme simply plays it safe.As mentioned earlier, the fact that there is multiplayer is nice however there is NOT split screen (... seriously... get on the split screen thing for PC already people). The gameplay controls are what would one expect from a crash into everything type of game. The impact system is rewarding and when knocking out a player with a good nitro boost kamikaze, apparently you get more points. There are weapons that can be attached to the vehicles but this is where the game starts limiting itself. Playing career mode I've gone through four different types of weapons (one being a shotgun may I add and a second being a shot gun able to shoot forward and backwards). This is where it sort of sucks because I feel a lot more (maybe such as adding mortars etc...) could have been added. There are oil slicks as well as smoke clouds that are added into the game but serve more as defensive measures than offensive. This saved a bit of grace with the game giving it a little more to do. Career mode is fun and unlocking new cars slowly becomes rewarding. My favorite part to this game though is being able to choose different sort of races while moving on with your career. There are races where you can put weapons aside and make it a bump only race. This is a high light to this particular racing game, and sadly one of the only things to allow the player to step outside of the box. Career mode also offers players sort of side bonus races where the sponsor will have you play capture the flag. The variation in races is nice, and the tournament feature is a neat bonus. If you want to run the game at 64x... do it because changing graphics within the game sometimes leads to a crash. None the less my computer goes nuts when running this game but the graphics do look good. The car selection is decent and the weapon selection and effects could have been better. Sounds are as good as any vroom vroom sound. This game is cool and has it's moments, but I don't see much replayability in the future either than a game of multiplayer once in a blue moon. If it added split scren this game could have got a +1 easily, followed by another +1 for having a multitude of weapons. But falling short with an appropriate rating of : RATING : 7/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : What it looks like being shot atI absolutely love when games pay attention to detail. Nice to see the back of the carSmoke screen about to clear up. They are quite effective in this gameMoment of impact ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												All in, Gas Guzzlers Extreme is a nice surprise. While the campaign is a little slow, you’re still going to have fun with it. Multiplayer is where it’s at though, so long as it gets popular enough that you don’t end up in full AI lobbies. The sense of humor is good, it looks great, and the gameplay is so well tuned that at times you will forget you are playing a driving game altogether, and instead think you are playing a classic FPS game like Quake or UT.Read my full review here: http://calmdowntom.com/review/gas-guzzlers-extreme-pc/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not a massive fan of racing/driving games because I find them too easy, But gas guzzlers Extreme has manged to keep my interest by throwing guns into the mix. It's so satisfying to drift around a corner for nitro so you can catch up to that guy in 1st place then ram a missile up his exhaust! Enough game modes to play through.(Last Car Standing being my favorite) Only issue is the lack of people playing multiplayer you'd think for a game like this it would be higher.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game reminds me of Flatout a lot just with guns as improvement. It's kinda fun for a while, you can't play too much at once, just few races because its too repetitive. There are few types of races like with or without guns, knockout (every round the last one is destroyed) which seemed as the most entertaining for me and deathmatch or last man standing mode. From time to time there are sponsored events and championships. For every race you will get some money in order to improve your car or buy a new one. Possibilites of car improvements are very limited and there is a long way to unlock them, the only visible modifications on your car are paint, stickers and rims. Long story short the money in this game isn't an obstacle, it is just too repetitive and it takes just too long to unlock all the cars, improvements and tracks. Multiplayer is an another chapter. MP could be much more fun when you have someone to play with, because servers are deserted. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great fun!  This is a totally underrated game.  I bought it on sale and it was worth it.  If you enjoyed ""Blur"" you may enjoy this.  Like Blur, this combines racing and old ""Spy Hunter"" style attacks on other cars, such as oil slicks, smoke screens, shooting with a variety of weapons.  The commentary is hilarious (I like Arny's voice).  You can change the settings on the appropriateness of language and driver names.  Default is ""adult"" names and language.  If kids are playing it, you can change it.  I've been using my Steam controller with the Xbox settings and it works fine.  You can change some, but it was easier just to leave it as it was.   It does not try to be a ""driving sim"" but is more arcade-style which makes it easily playable and lots of fun!  If you're looking for a very serious driving sim, this is not it.  This is a fun racer/shoot'em up game!  However, it does have a career mode like many racing games where you can buy many cars and upgrades, change the paint scheme, colors, rims, etc.  You earn money and open up new upgrades and race tracks.  There are different racing modes as well.   You can play solo races, campaign, and multiplayer.   This review turned out longer than I anticipated but there is quite a bit to this game as I think about it and the bottom line is that this is a very fun game and hopefully you will enjoy it too!

The graphics are pretty good its no Quantum Break but again for the price of the game its fantastic. You can buy other racing games but none of them are as fun and destructive as this except for maybe Wreckfest. You need to get this game and try it out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't trust the preview videos... This isn't the no-holds vehicular combat game it's made out to be: it's a racer... and a bland one at that.There is no real choice of vehicles, since each new car is a straight upgrade to the former. There is no real choice between maneuverability and speed -or any other factor, for that matter, like armor or weaponry.Gas Guzzlers isn't a bad game, but it doesn't have enough to it tobe interesting past the first 15 minutes.
