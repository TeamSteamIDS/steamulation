								A LOT of potential. I never got the ""swarm"" or ""endless"" gamemodes to work, enemies didn't spawn when I thought they would, but the few combats I had were very fun and I can see this being a fun party game. One criticism that's unique to me is that I have a poker 3 keyboard, a small 60% that doesn't have arrow keys. To the devs: I would offer an alternate control system where WASD is move around and IJKLUO are the combat controls. Maybe under settings have a ""60%"" or ""Alternative"" control switch.Overall, in its current state, 6.5/10. If online matchmaking and the gamemodes were fixed, easily 8.5/10+.			",34,1,1,6,3,1,4
