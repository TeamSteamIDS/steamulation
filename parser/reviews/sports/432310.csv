												Totally awesome game, not worth the 25 dollars subscription for just being able to play tournaments and special games that get cancelled cause there are not enough players ",19,3,2,1,1,1,0

												    The game ran fine maxed out at 1080p, even at 120FPS @ 144hz. You don't need to purchase this game for $30. You simply make an account, after making the account reload the game or hit the X in the top left corner and leave the webpage, this will take you to the menu where you click login.    From there you'll be able to see an in-game server list that will allow you to chat to other players or even create your own game. I guess the negative side of this would definitely be that the minimum you can put on a room is 3 players, and you can't make it private. So if you're looking to play with just one friend, you'll most likely have to pay to create a private room.    Among all the pool games on steam, this is one that simply doesn't require the need for ""tracking lines"". It feels very natural and if you know how to use english in real life you won't have any issues here.    I played for several hours with my father earlier tonight and it was a good time. We played a lot of Virtual Pool 3 back in the day so this was a nice nostalgia trip. I guess my review could be a bit skewed due to the nostalgia, but as far as technical issues I haven't ran into any. Take the review for what you will, all I can do is be honest about my experience with the game.			",650,91,40,63,121,9,77

												Bought the game a few months ago and must say loving it, it's not only pool that you can play but an whole variation of games on a pool table or snooker table. And you can play also games on a normal billiards table like Three Cushion Billiards and One Cushion Billiards.The rooms where you can play have all different tables with their own atmosphere, even the table speed and pockets are adjustable the way I like it the best.I was looking for a game that came close to the real thing and must say they “don’t come better than this”!I would recommend VP4 to everyone that loves to play billiards, in real life or as a game.For me it’s money well spent!

												fantastic game, most of the negative feedback are from people to impaitent to adjust and personalize there settings. you can indeed better your real life game by playing this game, and the dev has put out a free version that offers decent game play. my only ral suggestion to the dev is perhaps bring down the price of the full game but keep the price of the cues and v$ the same.i could think of tons of things that could make this game better, but alot would be preferences and its not my game not my loss. any way... love it ",136,22,17,10,22,4,19

												- Game unable to launch in 1920x1080p, runs in a very small window instead- UI reminded me of videogames at least 15 years ago- I do not use inches, so I wrote random numbers at the start- Why would you make an ""offline"" button if it is just to make a popup saying ""This game does not have offline mode""...1/10, the 1 point was because it reminded me my childhood when I used Windows ME.

												This is a Player Gratis Review.My father play this pool series since VP3. He recommend me VP4.Installation & First run:While Installation i had no problems. Also no problems with the first start of the game. I have set the game to fullscreen 1920x1080 without problems.Ingame settings & first frame of pool:After taking a quick look at the settings i was a bit confused because i have the option to change TONS of settings. After 20 mins of testing i've found my setting. I like all the cam/misc/keymapping options. But hey....the default keymapping is awesome good. No need to touch it ! :)As a player gratis i could ONLY play on the small pool table with 3 games. 6, 8 and 9 Ball.For me as a bloody newbie is this perfect. Mostly i play 9 Ball and my table has a tournament setting and the pockets are narrow. I have also the option to change the pockets size, table speed, table skid, rail cut, rail speed and rail grab. But i did not change it.Physics & Graphics:VP4 has the best physics. In the past i've played also other pool games but it was a feeling of ""playing a game"". In VP4 it feels like i play on a real pool table. In my opinion VP4 in a RL Pool Simulator.In VP4 the graphics is good but not perfect. In my opinion the game need bit more shadows (balls & table) and a bit more reflexions. I did not need mindblowing effects & eye candy graphics because I DID NOT SEE THIS IN RL !Multiplayer Lobby, Player & vponlinesite:The online lobby is well frequented. Mostly i see 20-50 players. All players are friendly and they know gentlemen pool language. This is nice.The vponline.celeris website is coupled with the game. There i can get TONS of informations about upcoming tournaments, Matches, Pool and Snooker basic rules, own profile manager and so on.The game has a own web browser.This is a free game without advertising ingame.

												I'm very angry with this game. I got banned for 24 hours for using the name ""Big Buck ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er."" There is nothing in the game that states that I am not allowed to name myself ""Big Buck ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥er."" 0/8			",69,5,0,4,10,3,7
