												Below is a rather detailed account of my opinion of this game. It is harsh, but even with my cons being so extensive, it's a 30/70 split for good / bad. All opinions take into account the price of the game (I would be singing praise if it were a $1.99 game, saying it was great value and a rare gem in that bracket, but even 20% off it proves very, very expensive). If you are genuinely interested in buying this game, read the TL;DR at least as it summarises the gist of my concerns.DISCLAIMER: I know it's only JUST come out, but my points are valid and have this taken into account.TL;DR:- Ambient music and feel of the game is nice.- Has potential.- Drastically overpriced.- No community (yet) to play online with, unless you have friends who already wanted to play.- Artwork feels very amateurish and low quality for a game over $5 . . . your competition outdoes you.- UI and some game elements (camera, walls) *can* be painful to look at and behave oddly sometimes.- Game is literally unplayable (currently) without friends who either A) visit or B) own the game.- No credit given to RnD Labs in the credits despite being listed in steam as a developer..?My opinion (list of pros / cons below this!):- Wait for more content (I would say 1.5 - 2x current) before buying unless below $5- Do not buy if you don't already have people to play with, there is no reliable community. It will sit in your library gathering dust. The game needs far more extensive marketing.- I personally think the game (even with working multiplayer community) should be in the under $5 bracket for the quality and quantity of product.PROS / CONSOKAY! Now we get into the thick of it. The rest is long and detailed, but I explain my reasoning thoroughly. If members of the dev team read this, I suggest reading below and taking it as feedback.Pros:- Would be decent fun when sitting with friends around one TV playing together- Is fun to hear your friends wail in pain- General ambience is nice- Gameplay concept is solid and entertaining, even if it feels highly limited- Would be decent fun playing online with friends- Music is niceCons:- Feels like you don't get much for your money, even with the special. It feels more like a $1.99 (or $4.99 see below) game- No online Multiplayer community (functionality exists, but whenever I have tried to play there has been literally no people looking to play 'online' against random people) which can largely be pinned on the following point...- RnD Labs were the developers I thought, but now it's ""Fun Sponge""? What happened to RnD Labs that they don't appear in the Credits of the game? They went for a multiplayer ONLY pc release. PC release makes it an awful lot harder to say ""hey lets play Death Stair"" and bring it up on your TV. Monitors are small for 4 people to use at once from the comfort of the couch.- Lack of singleplayer in the light of a yet-nonexistant multiplayer community means unless you have a circle of friends to play the game with going in, you will not be able to play the game whenever you choose. Chances are when you try to play you won't find anybody to play with, or for a long time it may only be the same half-dozen people who might go on around the same time as you.- While music is nice, almost every track I thought ""oh I've heard this somewhere before"". Very Mario Party sometimes.- Leaderboard glitches showing the wrong player roles and stats at times.- Game has crashed on launch, requiring task manager end-process a couple of times.- Menu UIs look (mainly in the game lobby) poorly laid out, sometimes mislabling the button input required, and generally messy. The UI elemnts themselves also look relatively lackluster.- Lag time on opening certain sections of the menu. Should I really wait up to a FULL second to see my settings? I don't know if that's expected on a gaming PC...- The camera has some interesting.... interactions with terrain.- Textures for the walls on the first 'classic' level are (literally) painful at times as they can seemingly jitter and the vertical lining is poorly done.- Character models look. . . to be kind, very stylised. Less kind, a bit messy for a game of this price. Simply look at other indie games for this (or lower) price tag for a comparison.- When playing with controller, I followed the ""enter to chat"" instructions and was unable to talk in the chat (even when disabling controller and using keyboard, and couldn't 'activate' chat line no matter what I tried, not sure if bug or my error but if I couldn't figure it out after 5 minutes there's a problem) <further note, in-lobby chat worked ok>- 3 maps don't add much replayability. From what I saw, all characters were basically identical in their playstyle. Having no defining, distinct gameplay traits feels lackluster. Again I haven't tested party mode due to it being LAN only. But for online play (which I would assume should be the main focus of a PC release that is multiplayer-only?) no such option exists. The game gets to the 'same old same old' point very quickly.- You literally have glitches in your steam sample images (UI, not present as far as I can tell in launched game) this is more just a presentation fix than criticism outright (besides maybe QA a bit more)- The drawn art pieces you have for backdrops in menus (sorry if it seems harsh) feels like they were some kind of tumblr or twitter fanart by a new art student than something for a professional, relatively-high-price game.- It feels like Early Access or a Beta. But without people to play with unless I con people into visiting to play a game that feels like a Beta, which would then require networking my system to a TV, procuring a swathe of controllers I don't already own (if I got 3 more controllers it would potentially cost me 5x the cost of this game) I can't test 70+% of the game.- Your canyon reuses assets prolifically, it doesn't feel like a real environment. The water below looks bad and the ridging around the edges of the map look poor as well.- Red text over checkered pattern, end me. I can hardly read it and it hurts if I try. UI shouldn't have that effect. Learning how to properly use colour combinations and patterning would benefit your game tremendously.- Overall, the game feels far too expensive for what it is. Multiplayer only is a good concept if you have the community going in, but you won't GET a community if there's nothing for them to play.- Your 'coming soon' tags put the nail in the coffin for feeling like the game was shipped before it was finished. You should have done ""Early Access"" if you were so bold as to say features were ""coming soon"". If it's DLC, that's ok - that means what you showed us here is the complete game. But I feel you need much more content in the base game for a $11.99 price tag.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
