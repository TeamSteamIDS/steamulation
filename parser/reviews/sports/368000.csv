												Wanted to write something longer, but haven't played too much and wanted to keep it the review digestable.I recommend this game with the stipulation that you buy it for $15 or less and enjoy the McElroy's or cheesy humor meant to mimic the style of 80s/90s anime involving mech pilots, as well have having some friends to play with.The gameplay is standard enough (it's golf), only now you're in mechs and can destroy buildings and try to hinder each other from making shots. Controls are mapped well and feel varying between mechs but are a bit cryptic, since they aren't really explained anywhere so it's more trial and error when you first pilot a new one. Special weapons feel nice as well, though, again, they aren't explained too well. Physics might be a bit too floaty, though we do golf on the Moon and under the sea, so I suppose those are the reasons for it.The voicework is well done (in that it's intentionally bad for the purposes of the shows it wants to mimic) and the McElroy's as the announcers deliver some great lines, though I could understand the desire for an off switch since they aren't everyone's favorite. The mech designs look great as well, varying immensely and even offering a giant skeleton and Pierce's mech from Saints Row (apparently someone at Volition was friends with the people at No Goblin.)If this is on sale and you want a golfing game to play with friends locally (or online, though I haven't tested the servers), give it a go. The game is what it set out to be: wacky, chaotic, and campy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When beverage magnate Arnold Palmer first invented golf well over a year ago, he didn't dare dream that the sport could be elevated to these heights.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
