												this game is awful I bought it while drunk or something years ago and regretted it immediately, you can get a perfect score every round by throwing the ball the same way every time, totally stupid			",243,70,10,59,23,5,25

												I love bowling games, but this doesn't have smooth or intuitive controlls. *If you are looking for a cool bowling game with a lot of personality get Zombie Bowl-O-Rama.			",200,28,5,36,13,5,15

												Menu screen works fine. The game itself, however, just gives me a black screen.			",23,2,1,3,1,1,3

												At first glance, Galactic Bowling appears to be a whimsical casual bowling game with a sci-fi setting that could be a lot of fun. Upon actually playing it, the controls will make you want to throw your entire computer out the window. Whatever I paid for this, years ago, it was too much.			",1460,602,62,239,213,17,275

Graphics:They are s**t, the characters look blocky and the scenery has moderately-low rendered textures.3 reasons why this game is pointless to play:1. You can't play on your own WITHOUT an AI character. (If so, this game would've gotten a higher score, and a recommendation)2. The controls are broken to say the least.3. You can get a 300 EVERY SINGLE TIME! Due to the fact that the f**king bowling ball bounces off the pins for a dumb minigame, rather than going through them, like they were fricking supposed to!Final Verdict: 2/10 It only escapes being WORSE because i like bowling games.

												If you wanted to ruin a bowling game, this game is the definition to go by. First you add a horrible story, then horrible controls. With these two throw in changing physics that are mind boggling and maybe a few special abilities that are special in the sense you'd be a retard to use them. Don't buy this game unless you like to suffer.			",59,24,1,27,49,3,33
