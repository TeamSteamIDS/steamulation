												In regards to the negative reviews:If this is not the way that you remember the original three Tony Hawk Pro Skater games, with bad physics and all, then please tell me what games you were playing and remembering. If this HD remaster has ""ruined"" your childhood memories so much, please point me in the direction of what Tony Hawk games you were playing as children.I was quite wary of this HD remake, considering the negative reviews on Steam. Users claiming that this game is nothing but a failure with bad physics and sloppy game design. This game is exactly how I remember the original THPS franchise (with better graphics and some slight variations obviously), and I put a LOT of hours into those games in my teen years.The controls are still weird and slightly hard to master, it's still difficult to tell if you're going to land something when you transition from a quarter pipe to the ground, and the newly implemented manuals (they weren't in the original THPS) still some times drop your combo instead of maintaining it.Yes, THPS was a crappy game in the early 2000's and it's still a crappy game now, even with HD textures, new skaters, different advertisements and all. It hasn't aged well by any means. When it was first released, it was the first of its kind, so we thought it was amazing, but since then a plethora of skating games have come out. But you know what? THPS is one of the best crappiest games I've ever played, and I have extremely fond memories of it when I was growing up. This HD remake simply updates the graphics, and it seems like people are mad that it's not a complete revamp of the game to bring it into the current control standards. For those of us who ACTUALLY remember the game, instead of just claiming that we do, this is an accurate and fun as hell re-release.Rating: 4.0/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.

												I am a person who LOVES Tony Hawk games. I've played and beaten every single one, (Save Ride & Project 8, but do those really count?) so I was super stoked to try this one out. this was not made clear to me, so I'm going to bold this out for people;THIS IS NOT A PORT OR GRAPHICAL UPDATE, IT IS A NEW ENGINE WITH THE SAME MAPSwhy is this such a big deal? It feels different. For someone who spent 100's of hours with THPS 1 & 2 this is a huge deal. It just doesn't play the same, and that breaks it for me. There are just so many things wrong with this game.-only single player available-no re-mapping controls-the only graphics option is to change your resolution-they've taken out the option to skip ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs (why?) & They've added a lot of new ones that suck.-They've taken out the park editor from thps2-I run into physics glitches all the timeA port or re-release of the original games even with no HD update would have been 900X better than this, this is a poorly made, rushed-feeling wanna be remake of a classic that deserves better.What DO I recommend? Buy or download one of the official tony hawk PC releases, or buy a Dreamcast of Craigslist and google how to burn the games yourself.			",39,2,0,1,4,1,0

												The Tony Hawk series was once one of thé sports titles to look out for every year. However, after the seventh installement, the series went in idiotic directions with a pack-in skateboard that was worse than the Wii Balance Board. After 2 failed games that were playable with that board, Activision decided it was best to go back to the roots of the series. Remaking some of the levels of Tony Hawk 1 and 2 and packaging them together as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD. The idea is great, but they screwed it up.The controls suck. I tried to play this game with a keyboard and with a controller, but both times the game did not feel as smooth as the originals did. There are a lot of glitches and the graphics are horrible. I also wondered why they didn't just remake every level instead of just a few. This PC-port is the worst. You cannot change the keyboard controls, there are no video options to speak of, the resolution is not even Full HD and there is NO Multiplayer... really?? I grabbed the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 box for PC from my shelf and that version had Online Multiplayer... that was 1999. If you're curious about the Tony Hawk series or you're a fan.. in either case, stay away.			",380,50,6,16,21,2,20

												In a day before games kept track of hours played, I'd estimate my time spent across the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series in the 1000s of hours.  I fully completed and became proficient at games 1-8 in the series.  At the time, I thought 8 (the first entry on the PS3) was so poor that I couldn't bring myself to suffer through 9.  And then I played this disaster, which makes the constant issues/glitches in 8 feel like I was complaining about nothing.Let's cut right to the chase.  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not the same game as the old THPS games.  The game was rebuilt from the ground up and does not feel like the old series.  While the PS2 iterations became progressively less inspired and lazy as the numbers climbed to 5, 6, 7, at least the game always FELT the same.  This feels totally different and the best way I can describe it is clunky.  I made an effort to max Tony Hawk's stats because I thought ""maybe it feels like garbage because my stats are so low.""  I got close, but could not bring myself to finish the task.  It was too frustrating.Controls: there is no way to change them in-game and with a controller, they are slightly different than the old THPS games (see ""reverts"")Reverts: This essential move, added in THPS3, is available via a DLC pack.  Okay, yes, it's stupid that it wasn't included in the original, but whatever.  That is not the main issue here.  Fans of the old games will remember that a revert is performed by pressing R2 as you land a vert trick.  The previously mentioned control change?  Now R2  also causes your skater to spin while in the air (I believe R1 did this in the past?  never used it).  Imagine this: every time you try to revert, you spin another 30-45 degrees, causing you to crash-land your vert trick.  It is difficult for me to put into words how frustrating this is.  And it happens CONSTANTLY.  How the developers could possibly think it's a good idea to have revert and mid-air rotate mapped to the same button is beyond me.  This issue alone makes the game unplayable.  There is a somewhat confusing .ini file you can edit to change key bindings, but as far as I can tell, revert and spin actions are one in the same, and cannot be separated.Grinds: In the THPS series, performing a grind/series of grinds speeds up your character.  This mechanic is not present here.  I used to trick around the map to collect objectives because it was faster, and fun.  In THPS HD, I found myself skating and avoiding everything because it slowed me down and I would inevitably run into some glitch that knocked me down.Wall-rides: God... the frustration.  They are damn near impossible to do in this game.  Way harder than in THPS1 (which was not a great game for wall-rides).  I nearly heaved my PC out the window attempting to grind the 5 bells in the schoolyard.  Oh, and when you actually manage to get in a wall-ride, the result is inconsistent and wonky.Display: All controls displayed in the game are keyboard controls, even if you're using a controller.  So navigating menus and buying stats required either guesswork on the controller or reaching over to use the keybaord.  Not a huge issue, but it's sloppy.Constant Glitches: I only played the game a couple hours and encountered tons of issues.  I'd estimate about 5% of my falls would launch me high in the air and across the map.  Manuals after reverts do not work consistently.  One time I was stuck in a manual and could not get out by jumping.If you've never played any of the old games, there is a chance you may enjoy this title, not knowing what you missed.  If you have played and enjoyed any of the previous iterations, stay far away, not matter how low the cost of this during a Steam sale.  It is like paying money to have someone punch you in the stomach and trample your dreams of a time when THPS games were fun.0/10			",97,16,2,8,5,1,5

												Faithful to a fault, and doesn't live up to the potential this could've had.  I'm only an hour in, but I'm confident that's an accurate portrayal of the game.This (with it's DLC) feels more or less like a mish-mash of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1, 2 and 3 with HD graphics.  If they had taken everything from these games and thrown it into one amazing release, it probably would've done better critically.  Instead they hand picked certain levels, hand picked certain skaters, lost a good chunk of the original soundtracks (mostly due to licensing issues), ditched the multiplayer found in the originals (local or online), ditched any kind of create-a-skater and called it a day.  It doesn't feel like the ""complete"" collection it could've been.  Like a greatest hits collection from a band that doesn't include all of their biggest songs, it's not really a game that needs to be in every THPS fans collection.Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad.  Lacking graphical options (outside of resolution) and wonky ragdolling aside, it plays exactly like a faithful HD rerelease should.  If you loved the games back in the PS1/N64 days, this will absolutely give you the THPS fix you've probably been craving.  (If you didn't or have ""grown up"" since then, it'll probably seem overly simple and dated.)  The game was always meant to be simple though.  Simple, but completely over the top... it's by no stretch of the imagination a juggernaut in modern physics.  You grind things you have no business grinding, you'll jump gaps that would put the Springfield Gorge to shame... but that was the fun of it... and it still is fun.  You'll still spend hours collecting SKATE, hidden tapes (DVD's), busting up bells around School II, making your way down the Downhill Jam.  Getting high, pro and sick scores.  And all the little challenges nested into each level, that you'll have to explore and find... unless, of course, you still remember where everything is.If you can find it for a good price and wouldn't mind a quick nostalgic shot in the arm, I'd definitely say give it a shot.  Just know that it's not the ""complete collection"" that it could've been.			",371,86,11,41,18,4,16

												Horrendously buggy, awful physics and lacking in the charm that Tony Hawks' games used to always deliver on. Feels more like a tech demo 'what if' than a full release game, but I guess the only thing in its favour is the low price.I bought this for nostalgia, but all I found was despair.

												The physics are glitchy and broken, you don't even need to buy the THPS3 Revert pack to get revert since its now implented in the game completely. That means in the revert pack, you're basically paying 5$ for a few THPS3 levels. Coming from a THPS veteran, I would say this game is mediocre and not worth your time. Maybe for some laughs, but the Unreal engine is the wrong engine for this game. RIP Neversoft.EDIT: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 is bad as well. Thanks for killing the series RobomodoEdit2: Still playing it even though its bad, yeah			",84,5,1,6,2,2,2

												Man, wasn't this game a massive disappointment. As someone who loves THPS 2-4, this game was a huge letdown. First of all, the controls are absolutely trash, and you CANNOT rebind them. They really should have just stuck to the THPS2 controls, as those felt absolutely fine, but here trying to do tricks just comes off as awkward. Second, they add some of the worst maps from THPS 1 & 2 (Mall, Downhill Jam, Venice Beach mainly). Third, reverts came in a DLC, which is unforgivable. Reverts are what made vert viable for combos past just ending them. Not adding them makes grab tricks almost useless. all of this, and the game doesn't even look that good, it looks like it could have been made 2007-2008. Dont bother with THPS HD, it's not very good, and will only make you want to play the originals. It feels as if little time and effort went into this reboot which could have been great had it just been a new THPS game that returned to it's roots of fun, satisfying arcade styled gameplay. 4/10			",253,81,1,27,17,3,18

												They updated the graphics but downgraded the gameplay. The original THPS2 gameplay felt way better than this HD remakes gameplay. E.g. they somehow couldn't get proper nollie flips done. Basically you do a nollie but then the flip animation is the one of a regular flip trick. Although I undestand that this issue isn't noticable or bothering for many players, to me it is a major flaw. Especially if you consider that THPS2 already did its flip trick animations perfectly fine 12 years before this remake was made. I would choose playing the old graphics with the old gameplay of THPS2 over the ones of the remake any time.Summarizing my experience with THPS HD, I can't say it was worth the time. To me it is nothing but a pretty lazy remake and an even lazier try to cash in on the good name of the old THPS titles.			",16,1,0,3,1,2,1

An old popular skateboarding game got a remake recently, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD. Negatively received in countless sites is it really disappointing? Read on to find out!Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater HD is a skateboarding game developed by Robomodo. This game takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience for the PC.You probably remember playing this masterpiece with your friends overnight just to hit that perfect combo and feel awesome. Now in stunning visuals, the game tries hard to deliver perfection but falls short at times - stick with me while I explain why.Gameplay:This game is all about skating around the levels, mastering ramps, nailing those tricks and ultimately stacking up the biggest combo to earn the best score you can. The game kicks off with a variety of old faces to choose from with the worlds biggest skate pros round out the cast including: Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and of course -Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has over 8 boards, 3 special moves, and an alternate outfit.Normally you start the career, choose a level and spawn at a fixed place in that level. From there, you  skate and explore around the level to find things you need to complete a task from your list of objectives. Once you complete a certain number of tasks, the next level unlocks ready to be skated out.Each level has its own unique tasks to complete, once you complete them you earn cash with which you can buy skills, decks or special tricks. Upon completing the whole career mode you'll unlock the second for your character, while another mode unlocks - Projectives mode which requires 100% objective completion across every map (gaps aren't counted). This mode is the same as career mode but offers difficult challenges for those real Pro Skaters.This game also has the old school free-skate mode where you can explore every unlocked level to find new gaps or hidden areas. Beside free-skate there are also Hawkman and Big Head Survival mode. In Hawkman you have to collect pellets in various ways, they all have different colors and all need a special way to get to clarify this let me explain, red pellets are only collectable during jumps, yellow during grinds, and so on.In Big Head Survival all you have to do is keep your head growth below 100% or it will explode.. with the typical grow....expand...EXPLODE!. In order to prevent your head from bursting you have to chain combo's and long ones at that otherwise you'll fail and end up without a head not pretty. Both of these modes are great to play because they test your skills and wits. Graffiti mode also makes a return where you gotta nail combos and touch objects, upon completing the combo anything you've touched will change into your characters designated colour, the catch of this mode is to tag more objects than your opponents.Content:The content of this game is worth for it's price, you get a selection of pro skater levels and it has steam achievements. The new DLC is on it's way. The length of the game is 10-30 hours, depending on what you do in-game. If you just rush through the career you will finish the game in 10 hours, if you are an achievement enthusiast and want to master everything you'll easily clock 30 hours. Again, it all depends on your personal way of going about with the game.For me it took 30 hours to get every achievement and game modes (beside hawkman) cleared.Graphics:The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo, using Neversoft’s original level models. All I can say is.. well done Robomodo! We finally have the HD version of the game we've been waiting for (or atleast the die-hard THPS fans). During the exploration of levels you'll just LOVE the sweet and eye-pleasing textures of the game. Everything I remember from the old games is so great to see in HD.But still there is one thing, just a little thing I didn't like and that is the rag-doll physics in this game. This is just weird, sometimes you just hang around somewhere the other time you have a long neck...you know, graphical glitches.In the old version when you bailed you'd fall on the ground, grab your board and continue riding, but here when you bail you'll face a white screen and respawn.. I have to say, it's not pretty. Even the blood has been reduced significantly.Sound:This game has a great soundtrack, it is half classic THPS tracks and half new ones. Still I would love to see more variation of music added and the ability to skip a song like in the old games. Some of the returning tracks are Superman by Goldfinger, Bring the Noise by Public Enemy ft. Anthrax while the newly added tracks are quite good too like Teenage Blood by Apex Manor and many others.Conclusion:Gameplay: 8/10+ Addictive if you played the old games+ Loads of pro-skaters to play with, as well as unlockable bonus skaters- Sometimes it's hard to complete a levelContent: 6/10+ Old tony hawk's pro skater levels in HD+ New game-modes added in singleplayer+ New upcoming DLC introduces the Revert from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 (ETA: December 2012)- No Multiplayer or LAN (just for the PC version)- No Scoreboards of friends- Not able to configure or change your controls / graphic settings (needed to be done through a 3rd party launcher or just change the .ini file)Graphics: 8/10+ Great HD upgrade since the old games- Physics are sometimes weirdSound: 7/10+ Great music to listen during skateboarding- More variation of musicOverall Rating: 7/10A great skateboard game that all Tony Hawks lovers should play at least once to feel how this game really is.Loads of people disliked this game but I can't see why. Personally I don't really need a multiplayer in this game just old school skating is enough to keep me happy, you could play it with friends in the same room (just passing the controller to each other). Anyway, if you've enjoyed THPS 1 & 2 it's time to grab the remastered version and relive your childhood, or even if you're a newcomer to the series then this is the best time to start your THPS journey.NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website.

												Being a fan of the classic TH games I had to check this one out.  THPSHD uses maps from TH1 and 2 (not counting the DLC in this review) as well as the placement of objectives in this undignified remaster. After hearing me say undignified, you may think that I resent this game and think that it should burn in hell for all eternity. IMO, I do not, but it seriously lacks the dignity and respect that Neversoft originally had for the series back in its hayday. First things first, I bought this game when it was on steam sale for $5, so pricing is not an issue on that end, especially when Robomodo (the developers that took over the TH franchise since TH Ride) sold TH5 for $60, a unhinged pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ At first i was going to let this one pass as a silly game that would eventually be fixed in the long run, until they pulled the same♥♥♥♥♥♥on the full retail priced game. But enough of the price on this, lets dive in to the actual game.the good: For the most part it is a classic TH game with all obectives pretty much in the same place and alot of classic 90s tunes like Superman make a return. Another thing to note is the return of the upgrade with cash system that was used in TH2, which is a nice return to form, also there is an upgraded roster, but lets be honest, if certain skaters are missing, im less likely to care. The last thing i say that is good are the returning levels, like The Warehouse(TH1), The School(TH2),  and The Hanger(TH2). I wish there was more good i could say about it, but that would pretty much be lying at this point.The Bad: For such a game that could of taken the best ideas from the classic games, Robomodo (and Activision) decided to go the cheap route and make this game as short and barren as they possibly could to maximize profit. This makes me sad because the classics had much replayablility without feeling as repetitive. First thing I am going to hit, is how barren the game is, which is only seven levels long... Seriously... seven? That's it? No Roswell, NM? or Outer space? No Skate street?  Um.. okay. Unfortunately, thats not how shallow this game is. Remember multiplayer back in the ps1 days? Yeah those days are gone. Remember Leaderboards? Yeah, i do too... and its not in here either...How about creating your own skate park? Forget about it! Creating your own skater? ♥♥♥♥ off! Wanna know what we get instead?  Big Head Survival, which is meh okay, and Hawkman...totally sucks. But wait, we havent even gotten to the best part! The physics engine! Oh man...suuuuuucks. Wtf do you think you're doing robomoto? Making a satire of Goat Simulator? I'll admit it's really funny at first, but it gets really tiresome after an hour.One last thing, which i wont let effect my scoring of this game, but there was one level I left off of the list because i was so disappointed by what was done to it. Marsailles, France used to be my favorite level with how it was a tournament like level between you and the npcs (which you never see skate) that lasts a minute each run and you have to use your best tricks to outbeat your opponent. Well what do you get if you win? Well, a cash prize and a gold medal, which lead to future rewards. Turning my favorite level into a bland objective made me run out of steam in the end and i stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Overall, if you want to check this one out, wait until it is on sale for $5, or better yet, if you own a ps3, buy the classics used for $5 or less on amazon or ebay, and know what true classics are instead of living in a pipe dream with this one.

												This game got a lot of bad rap when it came out. Why? No multiplayer. Does anyone remember playing multiplayer in any of Tony Hawk's previous games? No. They don't. Sure, there's no create-a-park or -skater modes, but that's why it's 15 dollars. Buy this if you want to sate that inner-skater that has lied dormant since 2005.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 If it ain't broke, why change it? I'm a long time Tony Hawks fan, but it is impossible to do anything in this game. With the input lag, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics and the addition of a 'big drop', the game no longer wants you to get those big scores that were so satisfying to get back in the Pro Skater days. Merely hit a rock and your character falls off his board like hes having a seizure.  The animation takes so long and you also have to wait a second for the game to reset your character, so falling makes you waste around 5 seconds of valuable time. The game just seems to hate you for playing it. Well, at least we have THUG Pro  ",611,138,25,54,64,12,66

												Simply Awesome!First of all i played the most Tony Hawks that came out in the past years and if you're looking for an evolution of the Tony Hawks series your wrong in buying this game.In my Opinion its a nostalgic feeling to play the game. So its not ""the new and improved skatinggame"" but a pretty good remake of some of the elder games with awesome graphics, a nice soundtrack, but ,and thats the only disappointment, very very sluggish physics.Sometimes you just crash when simply nothing happened or you get stuck in all kinds of objects. But thats ok for me, cause the game was very fun to play and real challenging in some points. After almost 17 hours of gaming, i completed the career mode with Tony Hawk and Nyjah Houston, completed the projectives mode with Nyhah Houston and unlocked all 15 achievements.I did not regret buying this game, for about 10€ you get a great flashback in older Tony Hawks games, if your looking for the newest and best skating game, you should not buy it.

												Tony Hawk Pro Skater HD.Do I recommend this game?? No.This game handles like a PC port of a mobile port of a Dreamcast game.The Unreal Engine makes the unrealistic huge combos much harder, it slows the game down to a half.The Tony Hawk games are funny because you do stuff you can't do in real life, I can't jump off a roof and do a 720 Melon into a Manual, but i can sit down for a few hours, get a 10 million combo and then be happy with that.But in this game it feels like a chore, it's just not fun to play Downhill Jam over and over again.I got 100% achievements in around 8 hours of playing, most of them came easy to me, but I can see some of them being hard to get for people who arent used to the game series.This does not feel like a mix of the first two Pro Skater games, the mechanics are the same (with reverts added, they came from THPS 3) but it feels more like Project 8 and Proving Ground, fans of the series know that isn't a good thing			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm surprised by the number of negative reviews on this game. I remember playing through the entire series when they all came out and then I forgot about this series. I saw this game on sale and I bought it for the nostalgia factor. The remake had almost everything that one would want. They include about half the levels from each of the first two games and you can pay extra to get 3 levels from the third (I did because I thought the third game was awesome. My gripe is more with the DLC in that you pay half as much as you did for the game but only get a small fraction of the levels you did with the game. The controls work well, the game supported my 360 controller. I played through the entire game, and had the same amount of difficulty as the old ones, where the levels get progressivly harder and you can never really master the game. In the end, I like the game and would recomend it. I hope they make a new game or add levels available for purchase (hopefully better value for the dollar than the current DLC). Even at full price this game is worth it.			",59,9,4,7,54,1,19

												This game is kind of fun for the first hour or so, then that is where the cracks begin to show. I was a big fan of the first 4 games in the series and was looking forward to visiting some of those levels again, and for a while i thought it was okay. Eventually you begin to realise the collision detection is not as it should be and you will find yourself bailing and clipping through walls quite a lot, regardless of how well you executed a trick. When you need to grind specific rails or transfer between certain verts, the game doesn't always detect it properly, which can lead to a lot of frustration. In certain instances i found the game wouldn't detect when i wanted to jump over a vert rather than come back down on it again; other times i would go to grind a rail, end up clipping it, being ""inside"" it and would bail trying to get myself out of it.The ""Big Drop"" mechanic seemed really hit or miss a lot too, sometimes i would land fine, other times it would make me bail. It didn't seem consistant at all.Repetitive music tracks, frustarating controls and the fact it still dispalys all contols with keyboard bindings even if you have a pad plugged in. Just seems pretty sloppy all round, fun for a while but can only recommend as a quick nostalgia hit.			",453,100,6,38,33,6,50

												First off, do NOT get this game if you don't have a controller. That being said, it's alright. Not good, just sort of ""meh"".The game was only $10 usd so I had no problem forking over the cash. Plus, at the low price, I had low expectations for this. There are a LOT of bugs (if you try to do a flip or grab trick when landing a grind, your character flies to oblivion and the map selection has extremly little to offer. But the biggest letdown is the lack of arcade-multiplayer. Some of the best points of the series was the games: Grafitti, trick attack, and horse. None of those options are here. Just single player.All in all, it's reasonably priced for the crap revamp that it is. If you don't have much else to do, then go ahead and play it, but don't play it with any REAL expectations.

												This game is packaged as a combination of the first two games from the Tony Hawk franchise. The games were rebuilt by Robomodo using the original code from Neversoft.As with any rerelease of a classic game, changes are to be expected. The problem is that the game appears very much like the originals, from the environments right down to the controls on your gamepad, but the gameplay mechanics themselves have been manipulated so far beyond the titles you think you are playing that it creates a constant misleading feel for anyone who has played the originals.Another big downfall is that there is no online multiplayer, a feature which came standard with release on other platforms.Overall, there is no real way to determine if the intent was to deliver a couple fan favorites or cache in on them. If you were looking forward to playing THPS 1&2 on PC you will probably have to grab an emulator to get the expected experience.			",234,83,6,9,29,6,16

												Is it terrible? No. But it is a remake that is actually worse than any other.Usually a remake is taking what was, and adding just enough to make it better. They took alot of the original boarders off, like Kareem Campbell and Bam, and added others I never even heard of. First play on the first level, I managed to fall on the top of the half pipe going to jump(which in every other game would land perfect) I tripped over air, and fell through the entire floor.I understand the original didn't have switchs between grinds and manuals, but I would assume a remake would keep it as a improvement. I would rate this a 6/10. I played so many tony hawk games from first one on n64, to THUG 1 and 2 on ps2. I never played one like this. Pro skater 3 will remain my favorite.			",157,7,1,15,4,1,3

The whole thing feels spongy, the controls not as tight as they should be, and the balance system is heavily flawed. It will practically auto bail you If you attempt to get a combo going fort longer than 15 seconds or so.The Remade levels aren't bad, but the actual skating and trick engine is nowhere near the originals and you'll be disappointed. Go find a copy of THPS2 and play that instead, it still works OK on Win7.			",370,58,27,21,24,10,35

												**Recommended only if you can pick it up on sale here or via Humble Store, not completely shutting this game down but i'm giving credit where its due**Decided to play for a few hours to get a better feel of the gameAs far as game mechanics go it's pretty flawed, you've for sure already heard of the nonsense physics of the engine this game is running on but it can be funny honestly sometimes seeing the ragdoll physics freakout and clip through things. But another and the main thing this game has done totally wrong is how reverts are its OWN DLC. reverting was literally how long combos were made possible and without that dlc you can not carry on combos at all and its so scummy that you gotta pay that extra bit to even play properly on top of the wonky physics the game already has. it does just take a tiny bit of time to get used to, you'll get used to the speed and turns after a good session of playing albeit learning is a little frustrating.  You should pick this game up only when its on sale along with the pack (bleh). For both the game and the DLC i picked it up on the Humble Store on sale for $7.49 all together so it wasn't bad compared to $15 for those at regular price together. Now i should give credit where its due, when you get past the flaws its actually pretty fun. You gotta map a few of your favorite tricks to the original places but when you start to learn how to play, it definitely takes you back to those good ol' days on the PS2. The music selection is compiled of all the mostly popular songs from THPS 1-4, it felt so good opening the game and you hear No Cigar come up. While still some stuff is missing from the original games like more original skaters and skitching (i think? i'm p sure cause i couldn't do it for the life of me in Los Angeles map) it's still a pretty decent time. i've had fun overall and i'm def gonna play a bit more. as a nostalgia trip it delivers pretty well so if you don't have a ps2 or a way to play the old games again then it's not too bad of a choice to pick up. Just remember it's not a complete revamp of a single THPS game but just a compilation of them all for nostalgias sake and with that said it does a good job there. If you have the means to play the original games though you really should just stick with those cause they'll do you right. It's pretty sad to know we won't get anything like those ever again			",151,28,15,20,23,2,15

Gameplay wise pro skater hd is much slower then pro staker 2 and 3 (thanks unreal engine god go die in a fire), the ragdoll physics are the most annoying thing, in the the old  t.h games if your skater falls on his butt he's right back on feet in like moment but in pro skater hd it takes for ever for him to get up and waste time specialy when you are to do a objective and you only have 2 mins to do it. The level selection form tony hawk 1 is the most confusing thing ever, this supose the best selections of levels form tony hawk 1 and 2  so why in gods name is the Mall and Downhill Jam levels that no one enjoys.Music wise most of the songs form pro skater 2 (there is only one song from tony hawk 1)  make a return but the new track are okayish nothing bad but nothing  special eitherNO CHARTECER CREATOR AND NO PARK EDITOR.   ........ WHYYYYYYYYYYYY ?Overall this game is not worth your time and money, you might as well buy a copy of pro skater 2 on pc since it works on windows 7 64bit			",261,45,7,26,10,3,23

 This IS my Childhood! If you grew up in the 90's as a teenager this was yours too!!This game brings some of the best levels from THPS (1999), THPS2 (2000) & THPS3 (2001) and meshes them all together with a *few* new additions to make this the remake made of all wetdreams.If you don't like this game, it's because it wasn't made for you.This game was made for the Day 1 Skateboard game players from the 1998 Playstation era. This game came out originally when Marilyn Manson, Deftones, Slipknot, Powerman 5000 & Otep were the best metal bands ever!!!Play this game with that music and sit your♥♥♥♥♥down for a travel back in time, HD Style!!! This is a remake, graphical wise, but nothing else changed.... that's exactly the way it should be!!!!_____8.5/10_____CONS:- Music soundtrack could have been alot better (the left out Papa Roach, Static-X, Mudvayne, Korn and a couple other artist that I know for sure were on the official game soundtracks from back in the day.... hell, they even left out Goldfinger)- Achievements are poorly put together, the 8 or 9 that they do have are pretty boring to a go after, alot of people may feel like it's not even worht it...- The Skaters::: why remove some of the Best skaters (Kareem Campbell, Chad Muska and others) and replace them with NON skaters like Metallica frontman James Hetfield and Guitarist Robert Trujillo ???? WHY THE F.UCK did you make a seperate DLC to charge us for Geoff Rowley & Steve Cabellero?????- They want to take advantage of you: by making you purchase a DLC that gives you 3 levels from THPS 3 and the Revert move.... -_- ... maybe nextime you go to McDonalds they should make you pay for your cheeseburger and then charge you extra for the FU.CKING KETCHUP!!!!!!

												Hmm. We have an interesting game here. A remake of the classic Tony Hawk Pro Skater games? Well. Sort of. If people choose to look at this game as a brand new Tony Hawk game made in the spirit of the classics, they may enjoy it better. Why? Because the levels are really the only things that are the same. If they really wanted people to feel nostalgic, they would have left the original games alone, but they didn't. As an example, in tony hawk pro skater 1, you had to collect tapes. As in VHS tapes. Now they have changed to DVD's. Some of the objectives have actually changed as well, with some being removed and new ones being added. I thought it was a bummer that I had to buy DLC to get some of the levels from Pro Skater 3 (arguably the best one) but the DLC is cheap, so my wallet quietly weeps a little and I enjoy it. You should NOT buy this game if you want an identical experience. An original xbox or PS2 is cheap enough if you really want to replay old ones. That being said, there is something cool about this game. Its a mix of modern and classic tied together with a neat little bow on top for a measly $10. That being said, the engine feels different, and even with a controller it doesn't quite feel the same as the originals. There are little physics glitches here and there like some of the reviews mention, but I don't think they are game breaking. If you like Tony Hawk and you don't mind what I've said, pick this up. I've had a positive experience with it, but that is because my  expectations were set properly. -PR0XIDIAN			",912,138,59,85,56,7,110

												Imagine an alternate universe in which Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was never released. (To start with, if such a universe sounds like hell to you, you may want to buy this game.) All the blueprints for THPS and THPS2 were lying around, and years later, a Chicago developer picked them up and thought, ""yeah, we could make something of this"".Such a situation would lead to this game, basically, a new title with a mix of levels from the first two games, in our case primarily based off of THPS2 (2X if you want to get specific). Game mechanics from titles THPS4 and onwards are not at all present, the Big Drop returns, and, actually, the Revert is a default move included with the game now. You do not need the Revert Pack to revert, and you can do so on all levels. Some of these changes may disappoint you if you're used to still playing, say, Underground 2, and expect to be able to wallplant, or jump off anything without having to hold a button, but overall it's a nice way to return to the roots.This is a modern title, and the list of skaters is a pretty obvious reminder of that no matter how much you try to see it as the 90's. Names like Chris Cole and Riley Hawk stand out even when there's no Bob Burnquist in the list, but if anything, this offers a fresh set of playable characters instead of the same-old same-old, I suppose. In the end, you're going to fully upgrade most of them, anyways. This is sort of like a reunion tour, taking you to old places while giving you new things to do and new perspective on them.There aren't really many new hidden secrets like you'd expect from the original titles. There are some, mostly characters that aren't especially easy to unlock. In general, though, the game is very open about its content, even providing a labeled map on the pause menu if you're stuck on finding certain goals. However, pretty much any secret move or area you learned in the original games is fully intact here, which I find quite admirable.The main problem I have with this game, even while I thoroughly enjoy it when it's working nicely, is that it sorta feels incomplete at points. For one, it includes 7 out of a possible 19 levels from the original games (24 levels were present in 2X alone), leaving you less overall content than the original games, though with quality over quantity in terms of visuals, presentation, and gameplay (really, how well do you remember the NY City level?).The options menu is where excuses start to fall apart. The only visual option on the menu is resolution. That's it. However, there are PLENTY of intricate options present in the BaseEngine.ini file if you need to tweak it to run smoothly on your computer. Why aren't these just in the options menu if you already programmed them? What is the options menu for if not options? Also, even if you're playing with a keyboard, the on-screen controls are ALWAYS keys despite a smooth plug-n-play transition otherwise. It's like most of the team did an amazing job making this happen and then their work got buried by bad UI decisions.The soundtrack actually lives up to exactly what you'd expect from the title. It's mostly music from THPS2, or new music that blends in well with it (except that annoying ""room in the mansion"" song, the only one I want to turn off, which by the way, you can't). It's all intensely catchy and you'll probably be listening to much of it outside the game soon after. (Only one song comes back from the first game. Yes. It's that one. You know exactly what one.)In any case, it's a new Tony Hawk game. It's a new, GOOD Tony Hawk game. If you've ever enjoyed that smooth feeling of the board sliding across a rail, if you've ever exclaimed ""Yes!"" under your breath at the raw success of landing a 720 grab into a revert into a manual into another grab, or if the word ""Kickflip TC's Roof Gap"" have any meaning to you, this will be well worth your time. The actual physics of the game are translated quite well (beyond the absolutely ridiculous ragdolling when you bail), and with plenty of game modes, the few levels don't run dry at any rate of speed (though I've never liked the Hawkman mode).There is one last thing I want to warn you about. This is a single-player game. There is no multiplayer in this in any way, shape, or form. This seems another thing oddly missing from the PC version specifically, as it is present on the console version. Doesn't matter to me, but may be a dealbreaker for you.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												Graphics are ok. Chosen levels hmmmmmmm ok there could be some better ones. But my big issue is that the controlls are fixed. No custom mapping. There isnt any in built controller support. Even with custom mapping on a steam controller it just doesnt play well due to lack of analogue stick support. I know this is a years old game, but i bought it at time of release and it was bad. got the update and it was bad. Yet something inside of me had thought that maybe after all this time they may have added controller support at the very least. No sir, I will not recommend this			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I put off buying this game, even though I loved the classics, because of the bad reviews. When the sale came on I finally said whatever and bought it. The game is awesome, plays just like the old school game, except with much improved graphics. I don't get what these crybabies are talking about. This isn't a revamp of the series. It's the old school game you loved to play for hours on end. My only critisism is I wish it was longer because it's so fun to play, but there is still a lot of playtime and fun packed into this game, and at the price, it's a no brainer. Ignore the neck beards and get it.			",143,22,0,16,21,3,13

												This isn't the end all be all of Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. It's a modest remake of some of the classic games for modern hardware on a modern game engine. It has a handful of iconic maps and all together makes for a pretty enjoyable expience for the price. Sure it's missing multiplayer and create a park/skater but serves for some good fun as long as you take it at face value. With the DLC it took roughly 7 hours to do just about everything there is to do in the game but I still go back to it occasionaly to play a couple rounds and I definitely feel I got my money's worth.

												I was excited to finally play THPS:HD, but immediately regretted my purchase before I was in game.  I was greeted with a 'Powered by Unreal Engine' splash, meaning this is a completely different engine, and then a 'Robomodo' splash, which while I already expected that, was still disappointing to see.  For some background - Robomodo are the people behind the Tony Hawk games that used those plastic motion control boards.  Gameplay:The balance system is completely terrible, making it impossible for long combos.  In the previous games, every time you would grind or manual in a combo, your balance meter would be slightly reset.  In this game, the balance stays the same until your combo ends, meaning if you jump off a rail and then grind back on, you will most likely bail unless your balance was perfect.The skater is incredibly slow, and grinding 90% of the time will only make him slower.  Moving just feels slippery and clunky.  Reverts require a DLC, and even then it's just as poorly implemented as the other mechanics.Levels:The levels look pretty nice and are spot on with the games they are replicating, though the goals themselves are lazily done.  For example, the competitions are replaced with just collecting 'competition medals' around the map in levels like Marseille.  In the THPS3 DLC maps there's no photo-related goals, and levels like LA have things like the car chase replaced with collecting items around the map.Conclusion:In terms of a remake, it just feels like an incomplete skating game with THPS levels and characters.  It doesn't play like a THPS game, it doesn't have mechanics introduced in the games (which are over a decade old), and just altogether isn't very fun to play.I've tried multiple times to enjoy this game, but I can't.

												I don't hate this game at all, but the reason I'm not recommending it is because they seriously need to fix a lot of the bugs in this game. The controls are way too floaty and they aren't very reliable. Sometimes the controls are very unresponsive. Almost every time I try to wall ride my character will start to do the right action and then suddenly bails by flying off the wall, spraying blood everywhere, like I just got punched by the Hulk. I will try to land a 360 kickflip, knick my board on a pixel of a ledge and suddenly my character's body is propelled halfway across the map, board nowhere to be seen and my character's limp body descending to the earth. Please tell me how this makes sense, or do I continuously break the game some how? When I clearly hit the buttons to manual, sometimes my character totally ignores the command and doing transfers off of quarter pipes is almost impossible. You have to hit ""up"" at the right time, and that right time varies every single try. If they could update it by giving the right trigger button (assuming you're playing with a controller) a spine transfer button (as well as all the other related actions like centering yourself or doing acid drops, etc.) then that would be a huge help. I know spine transfers and all those tricks weren't available in the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skaters, but just adding such a small thing, in my opinion, wouldn't detach from the nostalgia and would just give it a more playable feel. There are many times my character will bail for seemingly no reason, and some positions when I land will be okay sometimes and other times, being in the same exact position, will make me fall. The physics in this game are practically nonexistent at times.To summarize, the game is horrendously inconsistent, and as someone who has played Tony Hawk's games religiously for years, there are so many things that the other games do better and I should be able to land a lot more things than this remake allows me to. I love that they are trying to make an updated version of the original games, and I love that there is a Tony Hawk game on steam that I can play on my computer, but this game just makes me wish they'd just put THUG, THUG 2, or American Wasteland on steam as exact replicas of those original playstation 2 versions.If this game is improved and fixed, then I think it could be a great tribute to the series and much more fun than it is now, but right now there's so much frustration infused in it. When I got mad in the original games, it was because it had a constructive challenge and I just wasn't practiced enough to execute them properly. With this game, the anger comes from stupid glitches that should never happen and prevented me from doing what I should have been able to do. So get this game if you're just a super fan of Tony Hawk games like I am and/or want to have one of the games conveniently on your computer. But until they fix these problems, I'm going to stand by my ""not recommended"" review.			",190,88,0,15,2,4,3

												THPSHD is a very welcome return to the franchise that I adored. But for those of you long-time fans of the series, there is something important to be aware of...This is strictly a remake using content from THPS 1 and 2 (and 3 in the DLC) Those of you who owned later games in the series will feel very limited in your mobility while playing, as a number of great features have been added over the years that do not make a comeback in this remake...-Spine and Hip Transfers-Wallpush and Wallplant-Walking off your boardIf you've used the above features, playing without them is going to make your experience a much less satisfying one without the grace that you may be expecting.Gameplay aside, the absence of any multiplayer as well as the inibility to create skaters and parks is only further limiting. The best memories I have with the series involve all three of these. Though the ability to skate is there, it feels like so much is missing.Despite this, I hope this game sells well enough to encourage Robomoto and Activision to produce a more complete remake.

												If you're looking for the good gameplay of the Tony Hawk days of yore, don't get this game.Load times take a bit, and the game loads whenever you restart the level.The gameplay is slow and feels very bad. It tries to grasp the core gameplay of the original THPS but fails miserably.Although it was nice to have a non-periphial based game for once, this still sucked in comparison to even Tony Hawk Proving Ground.2/10.

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD! Despite all the unfounded negative critics you may have found, THPS HD is an excellent remix; and I'm a THPS veteran, so I know what I'm talking about!  The game runs very smoothly on almost every computer, resulting from a generous optimisation, yet it offers marvellous detailed textures and astounding graphics. Yes, the 'HD' part of the title is perhaps the most accurate 'HD' title I've seen on any game. It's greatly immersive, too; this remix keeps the good recipe that made the Tony Hawks series legendary, while preserving the whole fun of the first episodes, just enough to discover or rediscover your favourite maps with a fresh and welcomed rehaul!Keep in mind, this supposed to be a remake, don't be surprised if the gameplay looks a bit oldy and devoid of some fresh gameplay mechanics/content, because this was definitly meant to be a new experience for nostalgic gamers. And NO, the lack of multiplayer does NOT justify the massive hate wave you may observe on the forums. THPS HD is aimed for real fans.I could recommend the DLC as well; it's cheap and it adds the best maps from THPS 3. Seriously, buy it! 15€ is cheap for such a great arcade skateboarding game.

												As a person who was never really into Tony Hawk's Pro Skater or Pro Skater 2, I never really understood the legacy all that much. I was significantly more interested in the later games like Underground and American Wasteland which expanded on the gameplay a whole lot.This game feels like they took the PS1 and while modernizing it decided to keep the slow pace of it. If you've played THUG or THAW you'll know while tricking on things, it feels fast and viceral while you complete millions of points in combos. Here you sluggishly complete combos which feels like they tried to make the game more realistic.The PC port is also very bad. You can't change your resolution or any of the graphics options. They'll probably fix it in a patch, but given it's Activision I doubt it. Pro Skater HD is not what I expected and it's really hard to defend it. The only fun bits of this game involve bailing and watching a virtual Tony Hawk ragdoll fly in the air.			",337,42,5,36,12,5,30

												I want to start off with saying I've played every tony hawk as a true fan up till THPS Underground 2. Before buying this game  I was looking for a bit of nostalgia. I tried it out and completed it pretty fast. It's not a long lasting game and it's definitly not replayable like the older Tony Hawk games. It's basically a mixtape of different Tony Hawk levels from Tony Hawk 1 and 2. There's a few missions in each level which do take you back to the good old days, but not too long until you find out the controls are a bit clunky compared to the Tony Hawk games in the old days. A manual feels different when I use it with my Logitech controller compared to my 360 controller and I believe this is something that should not be happening. Nothing else I could add what you don't know about a THPS game. Collect the letters S-K-A-T-E, get 150k points for the highscore, manual the 5 boxes, jump the hobo's. You name it, you probably know it if you are looking for THPS reviews.Pro:- Takes you back for a while- Replay old levels- It's a THPS game on steam- It has achievements and is pretty easily to 100%Con- Doesn't take you back long enough- Controls feel clunky depending on what controller you use (especially manuals)- There can be some graphical glitches- Crashes sometimesI recommend this game for people that are looking for a THPS on pc. If you want to play any THPS I would recommend playing one of the older games on an actual console.			",219,62,4,17,22,5,23

												I had played a lot of the Tony Hawk games when I was younger from 1999 until about 2004. I remember when I got the first one for N64 and even began skateboarding in 4th grade because of it. I played:•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3•	Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 4•	Tony Hawk’s Underground•	Tony Hawk’s Underground 2This iteration lacks a lot of the magic from those previous games. I was wondering what it was that made me so bored of this game when it released in 2012, and I revisited it shortly to try to realize why. I discovered the following:•	No create-a-park, create-a-skater, or really any customizability.•	The levels feel old, not classic. Also, there are very, very few stages. •	The unlocking process for each stage is more of a chore because it relies on tasks completed on the previous stage, whereas before you had the option to move to another stage to try to complete those tasks.•	No way to end your run after completing one specific goal.•	Awful menu navigation.•	No multiplayer (not even locally).•	The “cash” in the game is useless. You use it to purchase tricks, but this is still way more boring than the previous iterations which let you buy stages and boards, etc.•	A couple of controls are just missing, such as the drop-in button or the leveling button that made it way easier to navigate.Overall, this port just felt rehashed over lunch, extremely lazy, and money-grabbing. Very poor quality even compared to the very first game in 1999. There are achievements I guess, but I had tons of fun with this series before achievements were ever a thing.Steer clear of this one.

												For £6 this game is well worth the price.Sounds are amazing aswell as the soundtrack.Gameplay is changed a lot compared to the old Tony Hawks Pro Skater games but I find it fun to play. It's basically a mix between Skate and Tony Hawks. The only thing I don't like about it is that they took out wallplants and manual tricks.Levels are really well textured and are exact replicas of their counterparts.Lots of replayability in terms of buying stats/boards for each character and differnet styles as well as other skaters.Overall I would highly reccomend a fan of skate boarding games.

												Judging from the mixed reviews, I think people have forgotten how the original game played.I've read people saying it plays worse than a port of a port of a game. I've read people going on about the shocking physics.All the creators have done is moved the game onto unreal engine. That is it.It still has the crazy physics we loved to hate. There is still the oportunity to get crazy scores.Only thing that really upsets me is the lack of a multiplayer option. But meh, so what. I can just take turns with people instead of split screening. No big deal.Go back, play the original, then come back and play this. You will see exactly what I am talking about.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is phenomenal. It is pure arcadey fun. I recommend using a controller to maximise your fun levels. I'm not sure if they still have the electronic skateboard controllers available for the game, if that exists it could make the game more fun while drinking with friends. Otherwise this game is sick. The levels are tight, the music alone is worth the price of the game. The campaign is short but it is challenging to 100% it. I wish Spider-man, Wolverine and Boba Fett were in the game. If you are worried that the game won't be as good as you remembered it then you would be wrong. The game still holds up amazing today. 1/10			",39,17,3,20,8,2,17

												Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is not something I would recommend to fans of the original game such as myself.  Hell, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The graphics optio-PFFTHAHAHA, Yeah, like you could call it that, only allow for resolution changes. This set off some red flags as I began the game only to find out that you could break the ♥♥♥♥ing bail/physics engine by pressing arrow keys too fast. No, seriously. Look at this ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ I go up one ramp (Without much momentum mind you) trying to quickly transition from a flip to a grab while pressing 3 arrow keys once each in rapid succession only to find that tony's ragdoll flys all the way to the roof of the building, and, not screenshotted here, sometimes out of it entirely. 


When you can break the game's physics engine by just doing natural♥♥♥♥♥♥you would do in the orig THPS, you know something is ♥♥♥♥ing wrong.

Stopped playing there, I didn't need to see anything more. This was already on top of sluggish movement and trick chains in the HD edition that i could perform with ease in the PS1-Era THPS.In the original thps you would press movement keys with fighting game genre-level precision and speed. When you don't allow for that as a basic feature in a game you're trying to revive, you've done a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing poor job. Now, excuse me for adding in a swear word in this review every now and again, but so many developers recently have♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my childhood with exactly this kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm sick of it, you shouldn't buy this game, and i've had the first legitimate steam purchase buyer's remorse since The Binding of Issac.

												-This review comes from someone who spent his childhood with Tony Hawk 1 and 2 on the PlayStation.I only played 2 levels so far but trust me when I say only one quote accurately describes this game. From Planet of the apes ""You Maniacs! You Blew it up!... Damn you all to hell!""I will list some of the problems that plague this game.- The PC port is horrific (and that’s putting it nicely)- No proper controller support. (It only shows you Keyboard controls even with a 360 pad connected) and they are mapped so badly its sometimes nearly impossible to pull of certain tricks without snapping your fingers- The physics barely work. It randomly launches you in the air if you try doing tricksAnd much more...I could write a novel about how bad this game is from the first 10 minutes.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!			",423,165,25,57,37,7,72

												I'm enjoying it so far, but you might not. It's much of the same mechanics, but the different physics and pace give it a much more mellow feel. If you're used to the speed of the games post-THPS4, it's not unlike going from Smash Bros. Melee to Smash Bros. Brawl.This actually works against it when you max out your stats. The game starts to feel ""wrong,"" because you start doing things vaguely matching the older games at a pace that just doesn't compare. I found it more fun with default stats, but with no way of reducing them after maxing them out, I had to delete my save file.Still, though, the actual porting just absolutely reeks of laziness.

												It's pretty good!I mean, I'm not massive on the series so I mainly bought it quite cheap for nostalgia reasons, but it's a fun game - smooth gameplay and looks nice.I hear there are some technical problems with the gameplay but if you're just playing casually like me I don't think you'll notice them.If you're looking for a kind of ""echo"" of the older titles with fairly modern graphics then this is probably a good choice!

												Great for a bit of nostalgia, but I paid £3.50. The game is half finished - no polish or refinement.The old games had hilariously exagerated physics, but they felt responsive. I'm only about 50% confident that the game will register the edges of objects when I try to trick off them with this one...Not bad for £3.50 is what I'm saying, but I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I'd paid anything more than that.

												The physics in this game are so different from the original that it doesn't have the same feel.

												Though not as fun as the originals, this graphicly updated version runs well and looks nice. I wouldn't buy it if you're expecting an awesome skating game, but if you're wanting something nostalgic this is perfect. Highly, highly, highly recommend using Big Picture Mode! A controller is a must!			",232,97,1,67,39,6,73

												Not as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. May be nostalgia talking, but it does a good job of replicating the ""buggy"" physics, wonky movement, and spazzing bails the classics had (yes, a positive thing if you ask me)My favorite music track, ""Superman"" is luckily still there, but I'm struggling to remember what has been replaced/is missing, if any.It could have used a few more maps and better controller support, but if you get this on a sale for a few bucks it's well worth it.I give this game four Sack Taps and a Benihana.

												This game is a joke compared to old school Tony Hawk games. The controls are EXTREMELY unresponsive. Characters no longer bail and get up, it just fades to white and resets your position. They've added new (terrible) mechanics like bailing when you drop too far. Some of the objectives have been changed from the original games. Physics engine is pathetic. Do yourself a favor and go play the original games. Avoid this at all costs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Is this just a lazy port?No. It's the laziest port.- No option to change resolution. (locked at 720p)- No other video options, such as vsync (which is badly needed)- No multiplayer at all, local or online.- You can't remap the controls.- All prompts show keyboard controls, even with a gamepad.A few of these things can be adjusted by editing the game's INI file directly, or forcing graphics options (vsync especially) on via your video card drivers. Even though it looks good (after adjusting resolution via the INI) and plays well, it's just such a lazy port that I'd feel bad recommending it to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Annoying bugs, bails and built in the wrong engine. Since 2007 THPS has suffered with the release of EA's Skate in an attempt to move from its arcade like roots and try (and fail) a more realistic approach which really doesn't fit the franchise. I can only recommend THPS HD because it is simply the best modern instalment of the game since American Wasteland back in 2005. With Neversoft out of the picture and THPS 5 being the final nail in the coffin this is probably going to be the best we are going to get. The DLC is worth getting as it recreates some great levels and extends the career mode which is very fun to complete. PC port only has Single Player and outside of Career Mode the difficulty in the other game modes is punishing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Some great and impressive detail they've go into on some of the classic levels and nice having a game that works everytime rather than messing around with emulators etc. trying to replay the PS1 versions.However, NO MULTIPLAYER (ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!) and it plays differently; I played the originals on emulator and this one back to back and the movement is very different, not as responsive, slower turns and weird glitches when you bail hard.Having said that, still really enjoyed it as soon as I got over the couple of bugs, worth it for under £10 and the extra 3 maps (DLC) are also worth grabbing (even if they should have just been included in the main game (freeking DLC, sigh!).
