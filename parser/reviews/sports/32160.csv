												So, this is a somewhat challenging game actually. Basically, a meteor lands in a cemetary and is the impetus for the dead rising from the grave. The only way to defeat them? Bowling, Obviously....sheesh. :)Anyway, you basically bowl against a zombie, and all the pins are zombies. There are buffs you can gather and use (which include large balls, rockets, plunger guns, etc...), and also penalties you can pick up and use against your zmbie competitor. Of course, it also gets the same opportunities to use buffs and hit you with penalties. They include icy lanes, narrow lanes, obstacles, and so on.Your goal? To win each match and move on the the next lane. You get a day and night for each lane, so you will bowl each twice. If you lose, you have to try again until you win.You can adjust the position of release as well as the ball speed before/as you throw.That is pretty much it. Although this probably doesnt sound all that impressive, the game is actually a lot of fun. I cant imagine a person playing it and deciding they didnt like it. It's just cute, good casual bowling. Also fit for all ages.7/10			",2039,1022,52,316,205,18,280

												Zombie Bowl-o-Rama is nothing special, but might pass some idle time while you're on a long conference call. It feels very much like a well-crafted mobile game. The game consists of you bowling down a lane full of zombies, overcoming obstacles and traps like water on the bowling lane and deploying tricks that you earn to improve your game. The controls are okay, but odd. You use the mouse to adjust the power behind your roll and then once the ball is out of your hands, you directly control its movement with the mouse -- moving left to right.It's an idle-time amusement and little more. Not worth the price, but not a broken or terrible game. If you're into this kind of thing, I'd wait until it hit a buck or two before buying. That's about the price of a decent iPad game and that's about what this is.			",1460,602,62,239,213,17,275

			here is the review for this game on steam http://steamcommunity.com/id/blinkdoggie/recommended/32160		

your out bowling and the zombie apocalypse happened so what do you do?replace the pins with zombies of course.after you toss the ball you can sway it back and forth and the missed zombies will wander down the lane (they are no real threat).this game is more about the power ups than your skill and there are tones of them about 25.this adds a strategy angle to the game of when and if you should use a power up or save it for a particular hindrance or the final frame.

												not worth the 9.99$ they're asking, but i got it on sale for about a buck and it was totally worth it. not a serious/realistic bowling game obviously, with the power ups that help you or hurt the opponent and ov course zombies from space...i did get a few good hours out of it, and that's about all i'm asking for from a 1 dollar game.

												Cheesey-Campy arcade bowling game, controls well though a bit too much control over the ball.  Each game is won by proper use of power ups and hazards.   Would be better if it could be controlled like Wii Sports Bowling.Overally pretty cute, not bad at 90% off or less.  Unless your dying for a bowling game.			",1183,317,41,180,104,11,216

												I played this game with my son so much when he was 3 years old.  This game is very fun for a bowling game.  Bowl for zombies rather than bowling pins and use special powerups to help with the process.  There's one trick though, your opponent gets to place powerups that harm you such as a narrow lane, oil slicks, etc...  Fun times on a twist to a simple casual bowling game.

												Simple-minded fun to the max. Chances to win mostly depend on power-ups you get. Getting all the achievements is another fun side, since there is pretty much no story, although completing the free mode might be a ♥♥♥♥♥. This could really benefit from having an online multiplayer mode.			",278,133,5,50,28,3,54

												this is an awesome game it's fun for everyone however the Multiplayer is on the same computer and I bought this game so me and my ONLINE friends could play it together and now that I have talked them into buying this game we cannot play it because it's same PC Multiplayer which would have been very helpful if it stated that before I bought the game. on the store site on Steam it clearly states Multiplayer it does not say same computer multiplayer.

												Weird and Suprisingly EnjoyableThis game is indeed very strange. Bowling and Zombies are not exactly the sort of things you would imagine would go well together and yet, here we are with 'Zombie Bowl-O-Rama' from Mumbo Jumbo, proving me totally wrong.Why does it work so well? Its simple, it just adds so much crazy and fun to each scene, imagine chucking a giant lettuce against a bunch of disco dancing zombies or sending bees everywhere sliding a honey-ball across a icy path. It makes no sense but it happens to also be so playable too, simple controls keeping things very accessable.As you can see I am slightly having issues with what to exactly say. I guess all I can say is 'Lets Go Bowling for Brains!'			",2497,1059,89,268,325,28,373

												I know what you're thinking: Holy crap, this game looks really stupid!Well, it is stupid, but it's also fun.  In most cases, video game bowling sucks (I've never been a fan of REAL bowling, either), but this game has a nice twist to it.  While rolling your ball down the lane, you can somewhat control it and when doing so, you can grab different positive and negative items.Positive items help YOU, whereas negative items hurt your opponent, which can be a real person or the AI.  This adds a whole new dynamic to the game and turns what could've been a real flop into something quite entertaining.There are achievements (if that means a whole lot to you) and a ""normal"" bowling mode, just in case you don't want to deal with crazy game items.  I don't know WHY you'd want to do that, but it's there.You can play against a real person if you want.  This is restricted to local gameplay on ONE PC, so you can't bowl against anyone online.

Of the game is pretty easy, beat the story mode with loosing 1 or 2 times.I suggest picking this game up when it's on sale. Fun short time waster.			",454,137,11,45,31,5,29

												A nice acquisition to your everyday zombie themed games. It's one of a kind, not really sure where will you find another  bowling game with zombies...from out of space.Really casual, entertaining, with almost no bugs what so ever. Can keep you occupied for an hour or two (alone or with friends) with it's diversity of power-ups.Well, due to being a simplistic game, has minimum of options and no difficulty settings what so ever...so the computer most of the times is rather incompetent so you won't have trouble winning a game.
