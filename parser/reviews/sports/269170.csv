												I am speechless! I expected this game to be good, but it blew my expectations out of the water! This could very well be the Vive's main attraction! I could see myself playing this for hours, and hours on end. The social interaction is just so wonderful! The ability to actually see the other players hands and head really adds a new level of immersion to this game! I have already made two friends by just joining a random session, talking with them, and shooting some pool! The details in this game (or should I say ""accurate simulation""), are so polished and beautifully created, you easily get immersed in a whole new world...or bar I should say. The physics are 100% accurate, and it is not noticably different from real life. This is greater then real life pool, this is...Pool Nation VR! Even if you have no interest in pool, or you have never even played, you will LOVE this game! Its worth it to learn! ",32,24,4,0,25,4,2

												So... I have a pool table in my family room now. This is absolute VIRTUAL REALITY. You\'re in a bar, you can manipulate most things, the atmosphere is great, and the game itself actually has a game IN it :O what a concept!- There are a number of AI opponents that range in difficulty- Winning spawns presents that give you unlockables... it is the MOST satisfying thing- The controls, to me, are some of the best implemented in a game for world manipulation, the grip controls are the greatest thing in this game!- Using the cue and the aiming system is great, however I wish there was a height adjustment. Being a little taller(6\'1) I find I have to almost squat to line a shot up. But man...it/'s too cool when you sink something you meant to- I have yet to try multiplayer, but I\'d rather play AI. But playing with a friend would be awesome.- There\'s darts in the game. Not the easiest to play but still very satisfying when you hit the board hahaI hope they continue to update this game with some features that would make it pretty damn awesome:- Control the music with your own music library, including shared tunes across streams- Varied environments and perhaps even a few story modes where you play in front of crowds and have rival VR bots- Branch out to Snooker and trick shotsEither way, you like pool? This is pool.This made my day :)			",134,45,5,11,31,6,15

												This game is awesome!!! I love coming from working cracking a beer and playing this to wind down.  There are only 2 things I would love to see this game add.  The first is the option to play my own videos on the tvs in the game and the second is it would be sweet to walk into this room with like 20 people in it and be able to challenge whoever is in the room.  Great game, a must buy, and well worth the money.			",32,9,1,0,12,6,0

												First off, this is a great pool game. Physics as well as hit detection is just perfect.I only have about 40 mins to 1 hour invested so far but that time passed by in what felt like a split second.So far I've only fooled around a bit in the environment and played the AI a couple of times.It's probably just me (sucks at pool) but the AI has bested me every time, and since it's the easiest difficulty it should be a little easier. Don't get me wrong, I like a challenge, but since there's about 10-15 difficulty settings the easiest one should be a cakewalk. That way it would be both a casual game that caters everyone, but they seem to be aiming for the hardcore pool enthusiasts.Pros:   Great physics   Awesome graphics   Truly immersive    PriceworthyCons:   AI a little too good (like I mentioned, probably just me)  Dart physics are a bit off at the moment    For some objects the SFX sometimes doesn't playConclusionA hell of a game that's more or less free.There are some minor caveats, but they're all patchable.ImprovementsPlease oh please add multiplayer hubs for about 15-20 players so you can just hang out by the sofas and chat, walk around and spectate tables etc. That would be EPIC!

												SportsBar VR is a great experince and really fun. My friends and I love playing and just hanging out together. I would reccomend this game to any one who wants to have fun and relax in VR or wants a great bar sports game. The game is a little laggy but it doesnt affect game play that much. but there are some features I think would make the game even better and more fun to play. -Add the ability to change the tvs in the bar so my friends and I could watch sports games while playing pool or something like that-make the games like chess have a more competitive feel by not allowing the other player to move your pecies-suggestions on other games you could add are ping pong, bear pong, 12 pin bowling, cards, blackjack, roulette, poker, bean bag toss, or horse shoes-add more items and make a currency system to get thoughs items while you can still unlock some items from leveling upThoughs are all my suggestions if the developers dont read the reviews can anyone tell me the way I could tell this to them I would really appreciate that.

Posted: June 1, 2016
												Awesome. Awesome.Firstly, the pool game itself is very good. It’s intuitive and slick, and the whole environment looks great. You can also play darts, but I found this to be fairly tricky. I’m sure it could be mastered with a bit of practice though.But that’s not where the appeal of this game really lies. It’s an insight into just how social strapping a brick to your head, in a dark room, on your own can actually be. Until now, fun as it may be, VR has been a pretty lonely experience in most games, but Pool Nation VR changes that.The multiplayer mode is hilarious. Even though your opponent only appears as goggles and controllers-for-hands, their realistic movements really do give you the sense that you’re actually in the room with someone. Once you have a buddy to share the space with, the pool almost becomes secondary because there are so many other amusing ways to entertain yourselves. Virtually everything in the room can be interacted with, and the physics are pretty spot on.Bearing in mind that it’s this much fun with total strangers, I can’t wait until VR is more commonplace and my mates and I can have virtual get-togethers, presumably on a more regular basis than is feasible to arrange in real life. I’m thinking poker games etc.In the games I played against numerous opponents, neither of us spoke much. I put this down to the poor quality of the microphone in the Vive, and the fact that it was late at night and the rest of my family were fast asleep. Instead, all you can hear (aside from the background pub noise and the music) is the pair of you rapidly descending into uncontrollable fits of childish giggles. I could actually see them physically bent over double, as was I! Almost every time I played a shot, I’d look up and see the other guy doing something comical, and vice-versa. I was crying with laughter for most of the time, more so than I’ve done in ages. We tended to use gestures to show, for example, frustration at missing a shot or an outrageous fluke, rather than saying things out loud.It was all the more entertaining because this was on the day of release, so you could see that everyone was still figuring it out and were awestruck by the novelty of it all.Technically this game excels too. The textures look great, and it’s the only game I’ve seen that manages to make the resolution of the screens look several times greater than they actually are and as they appears in other titles.My only complaints thus far are:•	I’d like to be able to adjust the position of my grip hand on the butt of the cue. The reason being is because, by default, it’s quite far forwards and I can see no way of changing it. This means you’re hitting your body with the controller as you stroke the cue back and forth. In real life my hand would be further behind me.•	Sidespin doesn’t seem to take any affect when the ball bounces off a cushion, and I can’t appear to get the ball to swerve. Maybe I just need more practice.-       The background sounds are on a loop of a few minutes, and every so often you hear some bloke banging on about 'Tuesday night, Tuesday night'. If it weren't for him you probably wouldn't notice it looping. It just breaks the immersion slightly.Some suggestions and wishes:•	Multiple players (as in more than two), and/or spectators. It would just add to the atmosphere and hilarity. You’d probably need to be able to set up an exclusion zone around your table though to stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to ruin your games. Either that or a vote-to-kick or some sort of block system.•	Access to your own music library. It would be cool if it could be displayed and selected using the jukebox in the room. I could create a playlist and then anyone could choose songs from it to queue up.•	I’m sure there’s a technical term for this, but it makes things so much more realistic when objects resist each other. E.g. at Present, I can grab a bottle and wave it through other objects. In Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades, for example, the physics are just a little better in this way.•	Following on from the point above, I shouldn’t be able to play a shot where my cue is intersecting another object – a ball in front or the cushion of the table etc.•	When positioning your head within a solid object, such as a wall or the pool table, the sound and vision should go blurry, like in Call of the Starseed.•	Be able to write messages – maybe on a board so you can hold it up to the intended recipient (assuming more participants are allowed in later releases). Could either type text or scrawl it with chalk or the like. Maybe have a set of predefined sentences and/or be able to define your own (‘good shot’, ‘you fluky♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.). This goes back to what I was saying earlier about not being able to talk if the rest of your household are asleep or whatever.•	Beer to flow from the bottles and bar taps.-       Mirrors on the wall so you can see yourself also.•	Change the TV channels, or even play music videos from your library.•	More environments.•	Be able to create and share new environments, tables, people, cues etc.•	Be able to create, style and position bystander avatars.•	Be able to control lighting levels etc.•	Be able to control ambient noise and music levels.•	Have a full head visible instead of just the VR goggles and hats. Could even have facial expressions to select from. Could be amusing.•	Hands visible in the game instead of controllers? You could then have hand gestures like in Hover Junkers.•	Miscues if you hit the ball at an acute angle and/or haven’t chalked your cue (need to be able to chalk the cue!).•	More game types/rules. English pub rules. Red and yellow. Two shots upon fouling etc. Display the rules somewhere.•	Snooker option.•	Replays. Slow-motion etc.•	Pocket tightness adjustment.•	Table speed adjustment.•	The potted balls to show up in the clear slot on the side of the table like in real life.•	Room scale and height adjuster.•	Adjust the scale of the people in the room. Everyone seems a bit small, which is fine for the girls, but the guys look a tad out of proportion.•	The bystanders to walk around instead of just dancing and chatting on the spot.•	Be able to punch the guys and undress the girls. There, I said it. Everyone was thinking it!Tip: You can actually grab the three big lights above the pool table and take it with you to illuminate the sweet, peachy asses of the chicks around the room. You’re welcome. Update: They just fixed that bug. It was fun while it lasted. Maybe they could put a torch in the room instead??Until now, Audioshield was my favourite (followed by Project Cars), but Pool Nation VR now easily takes that crown by a loooong way.I already had high hopes/expectations for the future potential of VR hardware and apps, but this definitely raises the bar and whets the appetite further. Lest we forget we’re only a few months into this whole VR adventure (proper), and if we’re already achieving this then it bodes extremely well.Props to the devs.This is the future!Awesome.

												This is easily one of the most immersive and 'full' feeling VR games out there right now. The bar is gorgous and has a great atmosphere and the devs took full advantage of UE4's powerful lighting tools.Interaction with the game is simple, fun, and predictable. The physics of the pool balls and how they move around the table/react to the cue are spot on. It's almost frightening. There's a ton of other stuff in the bar to grab and toss and interact with. You can even play darts and it'll track your score for you, which is pretty cool.This is my first VR title with mutliplayer and the feeling of being next to another human (who may be on the other side of the world for all you know) and being able to hear their voice come out of their 'face' and see their gestures and mannerisms, and understand when they're shrugging or leaning on something or holding their hands on their hips when it's just represented by a set of floating goggles and controllers is an unreal feeling. My first multiplayer match was with someone I didn't share a language with, and we just spent 20 minutes throwing bottles and chairs at each other and fooling around and giggling like children.That alone was worth the cost of admission.Plus, the devs are active in the community, seem like good guys (or gals) and are working towards improving performance and adding content.You can't lose with this purchase.

												An easy recommendation.  It's exactly what VR pool ought to be.Things I like:- Arcade-like assists like ghost ball that are completely optional.- Multiple game modes- Locking the cue in place mechanics- Teleport, snap-to-table-edge teleport, AND wand-based positioning- Efforts to support a physical table in the play area (though completely optional)Things I'd like to see changed or improved:- Scale feels a little bit small to me.  NPCs are all about 5'2"".- Ability to turn off NPCs and misc. throwable objects to save performance.- More environment choices (with less ray-inducing neon), including a VERY basic environment for performance.Others may disagree, but while the environment looks very nice and is lively (nice job!), my personal preference is the quality and performance of the table and game of pool.  I can run medium settings on my GTX 780 with reprojection, but I'd gladly turn everything else off if I could run high settings on the table itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw all the positive reviews and bought this believing it was a great game, and even still I was pleasantly surprised!! Pool Nation VR is truly a great VR experience and perhaps a showcase for what is possible moving forward. It looks terrific and the pool playing feels very realistic, enough that I keep trying to lean on the damn table that doesn't exist! I only have about an hour of playtime, but only because I haven't had much time lately. Stupid real life always getting in the way! ;) I really want to sink more time in this and can easily see my self spending hours in this bar playing pool with buddies. Great job on this one!! Totally worth the 17 bucks.Minor critiquesI wish you could play an actual game of darts, from my quick experience it seems the score resets after every three darts.I can't seem to figure out how to put a player name in the box. I don't wanna be ""player""!! Optimization. On medium settings I run 90fps, high 45ish fps, and ultra 30ish fps. I'm running an I7, 32g ram and 980ti SLI on an Asus Rock MB. Now I realize that VR doesn't utilize SLI, but I still feel like I should get higher than  30 fps on the ultra settings. Maybe I'm wrong here. At any rate, I list this as a critique and not a complaint because it looks fine and runs superbly awesome on the medium settings. 9/10 - Will keep leaning on invisible table.			",49,18,5,3,5,0,1

												Just bought this game when i came on sale - widely expanding my VR library.Alright - where do I start?This is a game yes, but I think of it as a tool.A tool of social interaction.I've limited experience with 8-ball, and have only played the little we did during recess in school, so that's a point to have in mind. Well, I just got the game, jumped into my first game and was in a lobby with a british dude, whom I barely understood due to his /jargon/ ( what's it called in english? Accent?) Well, this guy was a nice lad. He was talking a lot, I think with someone in his room, but also to me. We were playing and chit-chatting. We were playfully interupting eachothers plays and cues just for laughs. He was aiming his shot when I put a chair on the table interupting everything when he burst out in laughter. It was just as much interaction as it was playing pool.10/10 best experience ever!			",125,17,4,5,22,3,2

												As a child, this game is exactly what I dreamed VR would be. I feel so lucky to finally be experiencing it. I loaded up the game and spent what felt like 30mins playing several games of Pool and trashing the bar with a few guys from Germany. It turned out I was in there for 3 hours which is the longest I've ever spent in VR. I was totally immersed.The physics are great, the graphics are amazing, there's plenty to see and do and the social interactions are the icing on the cake. This feels like a lot of time and care has gone into making it and it feels like one of the first fully polished experiences for this gen of VR. I'm really looking forward to spening a lot of time in it.			",89,26,12,4,28,1,1

												By far the best best VR game I've played and enjoyed on an ongoing basis (100 hours nearly).  It's a highly entertaining enjoyable experience, made better when you can compete and interact with other players.It defiantly needs better multiplayer options however.  A better robust matching system, the ability to customise your sessions and more focus on the pool aspect.I'm hoping the next update addresses some of these shortcomings as it's strength definitely lies in it's MP experience.Overall it's a great title and has plenty of further potential if the developers listen to the players.

												Amazing game the VR multiplayer is stunning with seeing each others headset and controllers and being able to talk you might as well be in the same room very surreal in a good way.. The VR interactive bar with tables, darts, dominos etc is very very immersive. Multiplayer is essentially inviting someone into your house and with the current vr pricetag pricing out the trolls its a great MP experience to boot, normally with game industry people or high end enthusiasts interested in just have a good bit of bar talk and a good game of pool.Was up till 4am playing MP with some USA guys last night, still stunned by the experience this morning awesome and I see its looking to be imporved by the devs too!Dont forget to play with the giant dominos too, free the inner child and go wild!

												This is my first review of any VR game on Steam as I was compelled to encourage you to do one thing ... BUY THIS GAME.I own virtually every game on steam for the HTC Vive and this one is by far the most immersive IMO. Everything is interactive. Multiplayer is well done and keeps things fun. I'm a very casual pool player. Don't even own a pool table. Doesn't matter. This game makes pool fun for everyone at any level. The price, graphics, multiplayer, and immersive quality make this a no-brainer.			",36,7,6,0,25,3,2

If you dislike pool, don't buy this. Otherwise, get this right now.It's an amazing experience. I got so immersed in my game that I find myself leaning over the table, barely able to reach the cue ball, just to get a shot in. The table isn't there, of course, and I could just walk through the table to easily shoot. But because I felt like I was in a bar, and I felt like I was playing pool in real life, I found myself leaning. It's great.The game is very nice, graphically. The sound is good, with the thuds and scratches of the pool balls sounding realistic. There are jukeboxes in the bar, but there isn't a whole lot of song selections. I didn't mess with it myself, so there may be more options available than I'm not aware of.As far as the gameplay is concerned, it feels very fluid, and the controls are fairly simple to learn. Having to aim both the cue ball and where you're going to strike the cue ball itself is a little tricky, I've found, but that's more of a player being bad kind of thing and not the games fault. There's single player, with multiple levels of difficulty to choose from, and multiplayer. I've played a few games of multiplayer, and it was a great experience. There were no hitches, both of us moved fluidly, and the voice chat worked flawlessly.I did experience a few bugs, though, such as the game telling me I was supposed to hit the solid balls, but then calling a foul on me for hitting the wrong balls (I was actually stripes). A few times the game called a foul on me for scratching the cue ball (hitting it into the pocket) when I didn't. But these experiences only happened one time each, and I feel that they'll be fixed soon.I cannot recommend this game enough. If you're not a fan of pool, then the novelty of being in a bar, throwing objects around and playing darts isn't going to last you long enough to justify buying the product. But if you are a fan, or even if you don't really like or dislike pool, you should get this. It's just an amazing, immersive experience.			",308,31,8,55,20,2,36

												Everyone with a vive is buying this game and I can certainly see why. Its polished, fun, and has working multiplayer - something rare in VR right now.  The physics feels impressive and it really does feel like you're playing pool.  The polish level is also very high, especially for VR which unfortunately attracts shovelware developers.  If you have a small-ish VR space like I do, this game will definitely make you wish for larger space so you don't have to teleport for every shot.But, its just pool. There's no crazy game modes or anything.  This isn't a complaint, but its important to know this game is faithful to real pool rules and  a high level of pool simulation.  Personally, I find it very relaxing, but I can see how others might find it boring after a while.  I have read the devs want to add more mini games. Currently you can play darts in the virtual pool hall. I guess we'll see when that stuff comes out and how it affects the game.  I would love a real human avatar, but asking for that kind of thing this early in VR might be too much. Still, highly recommended. One caveat: Your mic is on by default in this game and it is not push to talk. The other player can hear everything you say, and often your breathing. I would have greatly prefered push to talk or muted by default.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												Very good VR game with atmosphere and a great multiplayer aspect to it. Only problems I can see are the size of and overall doucheness of the AI characters in game. There are only a few rules in a Pool hall and one is do not sit on a Pool table. No matter how big your♥♥♥♥♥♥there is no reason to park your♥♥♥♥♥♥on a table.Darts should be a real game and not just some side attraction. Music should be able to play your own in the back ground. The Tv's should show sports, wet t-shirt comps or at least horse racing (see Australian version below). Topless wait staff, High Vis shirts and $2 coins on the table all need to be incorporated to make an Australian version with the odd glassing happening in the background.The whole 'bar' seems a little to middle management after work drinks and not really Pool hall like.But game is great and one of the better titles on the Vive ATM			",291,102,7,28,44,2,24

It's fun, you can hang in the loung with a real beer in your hand or koolaid, its wonderful.  Since my room scale is bigger than the average human here, I was able to place a few chairs so when I'm shooting pool and between a shot, i can sit on a virtual chair that i placed a real chair in my real physical spot as well as a beer in the spot where in virtual reality is a beer on hand.  Please don't try this at home.  ONly for proffesionals.hope this made sense.  BURP!			",335,83,16,26,40,3,19

												Feels like pool and plays closest to the real thing more than ANY sim I have ever played.  A transcendent experience. A real glimpse into what the future can look like for VR in terms of the way we socialize and play together.  I highly recommend stacking a couple boxes so you DO have something to lean on.  Something for other Devs to note:  The ""wheelchair"" or ""walker"" locomotion that is enabled by gripping the hold buttons is a touch of brilliance and works pretty awesome for this game.  I have not played any other VR games that use this but its one of the best methods of movement i've found without having to Teleport.Things that can be added: shot calling OR just add a free table where balls can be taken back out of the pockets and people can play with house rules.Bugs i've foundOther matches starting in the middle of a match already in the processShot timers stop working for no apparent reason.

												So yeah...when I fluffed shots, I did have to check to see if anyone had seen me, and if so, give an incredulous glare at my cue as if it was broken in some way. It\'s realistic, in other words.The table is a bit \'fast\' compared to the ones in British pubs, but otherwise the physics of the game is very close to reality. It\'s a shame that you can\'t put the ice buckets on the somewhat un-interactive denizens of the bar, but I guess if that was possible, it would be a different game entirely...Not played multiplayer yet: I\'m still getting the hang of not having anything to rest your weight against: an unfortunate side effect of it not being real. So, like all other video game sports, it can only be an approximation of the real thing.Overall, it seems to be a great game of pool so far. It\'s a lot cheaper than playing down the pub too: proper VR awesomeness at a sensible price.			",156,48,8,11,29,0,26

												Just great.  I've had a blast in this so far.  No gamebreaking issues.Pros:- Matchmaking seemed to work quickly on day one.- Game looks great (though the people are a little weird.)- Controls are slick and easy to grasp.- Physics are great, though I couldn't get a masse to work.  Basic english on shots work fine.- Community has been great--3 good sports and no ragequitting or anything. (A note on this--you have the air of being in an actual bar and playing with a real person so I felt some of my real life tact kicking in even though it was just a video game.)Cons:- Performance is a little iffy, (GTX 970 and an 8-core I7) I ran on medium settings and had solid 60fps.  No motion sickness for me.- I couldn't figure out matchmaking options, but I can probably do it with more tinkering.- The bar environs will likely get old, as well as the soundtrack.  Hoping for new halls.Overall, this has been my favorite multiplayer experience that I've tried so far, and will be a great multiplayer game for those who want something at a relaxed pace.

Posted: June 2, 2016
												Initial thoughts from Vive owner, and old-school 9-ball tourney player.Environment: Very immersive environment, I initially forgot about Chapperone and tried walking around the table as though it were real. It was nice to sidle up to the bar and pretend to order a drink, and throw bottles around. The sound effects from the bar get repeitive, and the AI ""extras"" just repeat the same motions, but they're not meant to be the focus of the game.  I do like that you can wander around the bar and find a few quiet spots, but there's little else to explore.I'm 6'1"" tall, and all the AI extras seemed like they were 5'0"".  This, combined with how ""low"" the tables feel, it seems there may be a slight scaling issue.  It would be nice to adjust player height, or be able to adjust vertically with the grip movement.Interface: The controls were very good and responsive, and once you understand them they feel natural and intuitive.  I am especially a fan of using the grips to move the table around the user - this let me line up shots naturally as I normally would, as well as let me stand in the middle of the table so I didn't have to reach too far into cyberspace that I'd fall over IRL.  The grips felt like using ""wheelchair"" mode, and was by far the best-designed part of the game.I was a little disappointed with the ""fine tuning"" aiming helper - it definitely helps line up shots, but seems to have the same sensitivity as normal shots (only it locks one hand).  But this is a minor issue.Game/Physics:  This is the #1 most important issue for hardcore pool players when evaluating a pool game.  The physics are ""okay"" - it's no Virtual Pool 4.  Cue-english seems to work somewhat, though the table feels slippery, so english doesn't affect it as much as expected.  The pockets on the tables feel very sloppy, at times too tight, at times too wide.  Ball contact angles are pretty solid, so after some mental adjustment you get the feel of how the game wants to be played.For other objects, physics seems janky - beer caps and dice barely bounce at all, while bar chairs will bounce all over the place.  I'm not a dart player, but I felt like I could get to learn the proper throws for darts.Overall:  If you're into billiards/pool, you'll have a good time.  There are only a few game modes, doesn't seem like you can choose different tables or environments, so it's a pretty limited experience yet.  I haven't had a chance to try MP, but unless networking code is wacked out it should feel similar to playing the AI.  If you're looking for deep career-mode style pool with ladders and locales, it's not here.  If you're not into pool much you may need to pass, because throwing things around a bar at short people who don't respond to you gets old pretty quick.7/10 - recommended for pool fans			",97,24,3,10,35,4,11

												TLDR: If you enjoy pool and own a vive buy this.What an incredible experience Pool Nation VR is. I am running an old i5-2500k and a nvidia 970 for reference.The graphics in this game are top notch. You spawn into a bar with weird npcs silently dancing/shuffling in the corner, TVs showing ads for a pool game, a jukebox, dartboard, and of course the pool table. The default quality setting of medium did not allow me to hit 90 fps so the reprojection was kicking in and fps was 45. Turning the quality to low, while sacrificing some visual fidelity, allowed my system to consistently hit 90 fps with a minor hit to graphics. The main attraction for this game is the multiplayer. After starting a game and getting someone to join it becomes a very interesting social experiment. I have played with many people, the vast majority either have their mic muted or have not figured out how to setup the vive mic. Others speak languages that I have no clue what they are saying. A handful have actually spoken Enligsh (I am a stupid American and don't know many languages) and that is where the majority of the enjoyment from this title has come from for me. Playing with a random person, talking as if we were in the same room and playing pool. It is an incredible sense of presence for me and really makes me feel like this random person is in my room. This is where some caveats come: this is the internet and people are not generally known for demonstrating common sense or respect for anonymous people who they will never see in real life. This can lead to people messing with you, some do it aggressively with spamming beer bottles, smashing lights, or the destruction that is the jukebox.The majority of the people I have met have been cool dudes that are as impressed with the game as I am and just want to play a game of pool.I strongly encourage players of this game setting up a real life table to lean against and steady shots on. This helps IMMENSELY (use the arrow keys on the keyboard when you are in game to change the height of the table to match yours). If you have a vive I recommend you give Pool Nation VR a shot. I am terrible at pool in real life (sort of) but with ghost balls (cheating, sue me) it makes the game a lot easier and it allows you to have fun with people a world away. Last note: The 'hulk mode' reorientation/locomotion was extremely disorienting and disconcerting for me when I began to play it, this has largely gone away and I have acquired stronger VR legs throughout the games.Oh ya and HATS. I got a pirate one (arrrr) and a cowboy one (yeeeehawww). See you in game!			",437,68,12,29,53,7,38

												This game has convincing physics and feels pretty much like the real thing. The force feedback of the controller on hitting the ball feels spot on as well. I'm no good player by any stretch of the imagination and after 8 or so rounds got enough into the game to beat the easy AI. Time to step up to the next level.On the negative side, the performance could be better. I had to switch to low settings for a stable framerate, but even then it still looks good.Overall, this is a very polished VR experience that feels like a proper game, and I do hope that we'll be seeing more games of this calibre for VR.

												This game is absolutely amazing.The graphics and physics are very realistic.  So realistic even, you'll want to lean on the table as you play only to discover your floor instead.I love how you can play other mini games like air hockey, chess, darts and more...The controls are very intuitive and easy.  The ""hulk"" movement system is very smooth and should be implemented in other games as well.  I would like to see a game of table tennis being added in the future.There are a few minor points I would like to see improved though.There don't seem to be many online players.  It can take while before you find people to play with.  This game should be cross platform with Playstation to increase the general player-pool.Also, the speech audio could be slightly improved.  Such as when a player speaks further away it is more silent.  Because when 6 players are in the room speaking with each other, the dialogue can get very chaotic and it can be hard to know who's talking to who.  And I would love the ability to listen to my own music on the jukebox.But apart from that, this is a must buy! The developers definitely earn the price tag for this game.			",75,11,2,1,17,2,6

												Great game! I\'ve only played about an hour, but I\'ve really enjoyed it. Playing multiplayer was a neat experience. I think I spent more time exploring the bar and objects than playing pool. I think this is a must have game for vive owners. I\'d love to see future upgrades for mini-games, music, and interaction with other players. At one point I set my vive controller on the edge of the pool table to do something. About a half second later I heard my controller hit the floor and remembered I don\'t have a real pool table! Lol. Good job game devs!			",29,20,1,2,17,2,0

												Mostly good for the pool, but has a few other games.  I wish they'd run it more like Rec Room with a central nexus that everyone appears in and then you could build groups from there.  Still, worth grabbing if you're into bar games.			",56,28,3,2,11,2,1

												This game is outstanding. No other VR game has made me lose myself in the game like this one. When I go for a shot and the chaperone fades in I'm legitimately surprised most of the time. It looks great, performs mostly well (they're investigating performance issues), and lets you kick it with interesting folks from around the world. If you have a vive this is a must buy.

												This is absolutely the best thing I've played for the HTC Vive so far. I wasn't sure about buying this new game at first, a lot of indie VR games cominng out are gimmicky and just plain crap. When I saw that you could pair up with others online and play I thought it would be fun, I wasn't dissapointed!The graphics are really really good, it's not too blurry as a lot of VR games can be with the current generation of hardware. At times it can be difficult to tell if a ball is stripe or solid when it's far away, it's not a big deal to just move your head in a bit closer and have a look. The physics of the pool table are about as good as they can be!I usually complain about everything but I don't really have much to say here. All I can think of would be a couple of feature additions such as the ability to change the way you look in game, maybe the option to use your own music on the juke box, and maybe to join games as a spectator (just hang out off to the side of a game). It would also be nice if they made it so you couldn't actually move yoruself over the top of the pool table. I don't really see how they could do that so I guess that's why they didn't do it lol.The only issue I seem to have found with this game is that the button to put the pool stick away doesn't always seem to work when I tap the button, it's not really a problem but it's something I noticed. I may even be doing something wrong to cause this idk.I'm very excited to own this game and I look forward to any and all updates they may release for it =]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While playing this game I accidentally knocked over a full can of beer.   I immediately rushed to grab it and stop it from spilling except there were two problems:  The can wasn't open  The can was in VRI really surprised myself with my default reflexes of ""oh♥♥♥♥♥♥I better catch that!""  So basically this is Pool in VR.  More ""Virtual Pool"" than  ""Virtual Pool"" is... (though I would have argued Virtual Pool was pretty realistic back in the late 90's).  You have a few tables, a jukebox, a couple of dart boards, a bar with a bunch of bartenders doing the ""I gotta pee"" dance. A few bar patrons also doing the same ""I gotta pee"" dance.  And that's enough to remind me of weekends hanging out at Rusty's Billiards. The coolest thing is, you could play darts if you wanted to, you can change the music on the jukebox (though it seems like they only have a handful of songs), you can conjure yourself up a beer... bottle.  It's empty though, so no getting virtually drunk and starting a virtual bar fight.There's also a multiplayer mode which I have yet to try but it looks great.  There's only one thing missing:  Something to lean on as you make your shots.  If I had a real world ""surrogate table"" to play against, this game would be so very awesome.   It's still great though, don't get me wrong.  It just kinda ruins the immersion when you have to hover your arms in the air while taking a shot.  Things I liked about this game:   They really nailed the bar atmosphere.  The only thing that would make it more authentic would be to have it filled with smoke and have some arcade games off in the corner... Oh and maybe a selection of cue sticks to choose from and some chalk for the tip of your cue.  The tables are my favorite color for pool tables (though I could see some people wanting the traditional green felt)  Darts!    They give you 8 ball and 9 ball at least. I would like more game options (rotation? Straight pool?) but 8 and 9 ball are a good start.  Makes good use of all the available room scale game spaceThings I didn't like:   Aiming without something to lean on is really awkward and ruins the immersion (This is not really the game's fault though)  The people seem to be a BIT on the small side.  Like the height is ok, but their body size is super skinny...  it's a small complaint really because the main focus is the game, not the people standing around, but I feel like they could make the people a bit wider.  Imagine a 5'2"" girl stretched out to 5'6"" and that's how it seems  Squish her height back down to 5'2"" and she looks fine, but stretched out she seems unnaturally skinny...uncanny valley style.  Only two pool games (8 and 9 ball) and the dart game seems like there's not much to it yet other than throw the darts and look at the score on the wall.I really didn't have that many complaints with this game, except for the AI really is kinda lame at the easiest level, but it always is... I feel like the AI lets me win on the easiest level, and the level 3 AI is the closest to the real ""novice"" player. So anyway, my recommendation is: find something like a barstool to lean on so you can take your shots more realistically.  Don't forget to pick it up and carry it with you (or else teleport everywhere) or you might be tempted to put your hand down on thin air and fall to the floor.This game is definitely worth buying.

												[after 30 minutes]I've only had 30 minutes to play, but first impression is very positive. Graphics are great. Controls are great. Presence is great. There's a good teleportation system--I was able to play just fine with about 4 square meters of space.You can move the whole room around to get a good angle, and it's not very nausea-inducing if you look at the table while doing it. There's a grid that appears around you while moving the room, which stays stationary and keeps you feeling anchored in space.It's a bit weird to line up your shot when you can't rest your hand on the table, but you can lock it in place so you don\'t have to worry about holding it still while you follow through.It felt more natural than any computer pool game I've ever played. I even found it easier to line up my shots when the ""ghost ball"" aiming aid was turned off.[after 90 minutes]Still really impressed. The resolution of the Vive is a noticeable limitation on long shots. I ended up using the back of a recliner as stand-in for the table itself. With a steady bridge hand I started making shots much more often.The atmosphere is tuned really well. There's movement and noise around you enough to make you feel like you're in a bar. I would say it's like a pool hall, but the only pool noises are the ones at your table. But the atmosphere is never so loud or animated that it distracts you. They clearly put a lot of work into the setting and it paid off.I have not had jutter playing on medium quality. High was manageable, but not smooth enough for extended play in comfort. i7 6700k w/ R9 Fury			",98,25,5,28,42,3,33

												This game is an absolute perfect fit for VR, with intuitive controls and an accurate physics model this is a must buy for anyone interested in pool or snooker. I played throughout the Beta of this game and the devs made constant tweaks and updates during it\'s development which is a really positive sign. In the last update they enabled proper spin/english on the cue ball so it follows natural paths off cushions along with an easy to use height adjustment hotkey. This enables players to use a real life table to lean on when taking shots just like real pool, this increases emmersion and comfort during play. There is an option to use a ghost ball if you just want to play casually but I prefer the realistic feel of playing snooker/pool at home with the guides and aids turned off.This game is multiplayer online and I would say this is probably one of the very best experiences currently available for virtual reality so far. I have made some videos on YouTube and recently included a brief review of this last update, just search Falandorn on YouTube and click my uploaded videos.With all the current options it is just impossible not to love this game and they are looking to keep developing it in future too. Wholeheartedly recommended! I was lucky enough to receive a free copy as a Beta tester but will buy this game out of principle.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I played pool with some random guy that felt like he was in the same room with me. We took turns putting garbage on the table to make eachother's shots more difficult. He won, and I then I shot him in the face with the cue ball. A+Edit: Only thing I would recommend to dev is scaling the NPC's a little larger, they are just a tad small. Maybe adding one of those basketball arcade games. Amazing Game!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												SportsBar VR:~~~~~~~~~~Hey guys, I know a fantastic bar where the atmosphere is great - good music, TVs everywhere to watch your favourite sports and plenty of games to play.  You can’t miss it! Put on your VR headset and it should be right in front of you! Come on in and let’s have fun at SportsBar VR.SportsBar VR is a casual / sports simulation game where you immerse yourself in a virtual bar and play a variety games, the likes of which can be found in real bars and clubs. What a cool bar we have here – there’s an old-style jukebox in the corner, several pool tables in from the bar. Oh, have a look at this! Let’s play rampball, darts, air hockey . . . what’s that? You want to play chess? Be my guest, here is a chess table and right beside it a checkers table, too. I’m off play to something else for a while. There are fun games in this venue and the most important point is that they are easy to play with the Vive controllers. I had a few turns at pool and air hockey against online opponents and I must admit it was fun. I really like the feel of pool cane - I was surprised how realistic it was; just brilliant!The rampball was ok; you have nine balls and if you reckon you’re a top baller, show us how to get nine hundred points with nine balls – I’d love to see that!  The darts game was ok, too, but I personally did not like the feel when you throw the darts; you either throw them too softly or too hard, the motion is not quite there in my opinion. I was better at throwing darts at the balloons and seeing them fly into the air! As for the air hockey, that was good too, as I mentioned above, but it took me a while to get properly used to the mallet - it could be a little bit smoother. There are also objects that you can pick up to throw at people, or even build a house of chairs, books, dominos or cans of beer. Yes, there are bottles of beer that you can smash against the wall, but I prefer to juggle with them!You’ll receive presents too; how nice is that? With these you came customize how people see you online. There is also the option to upload your own music.SportsBar is graphically polished.  The controls with the pool game are great but need to be better for the darts and the rampball in my opinion.  The atmosphere is spot on and now I can go to a bar without leaving home - safer and healthier. Positives:~~~~~~~ -	Polished Graphics-	Several games to play-	Great atmosphere-	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	Controls could be better in some games-	No trading cardsThe bar atmosphere is well done. Are you ready for a game of pool, darts, chess and more? Take your pick, mate - we’ll be waiting for you!6/10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												I don't usually post many reviews, but I really wanted to leave a positive review of this game, because it's the most fun I've had in ages.If you own a Vive, do yourself a favour and buy this. And then play it with online multiplayer with a friend. It's just a nice combination of an actual fun game (the pool part), together with a scenario that is full of little details and can be used as a mini physics sandbox.Plus, the game is super polished and full of nice usability touches. Teleporation, summoning the cue, moving around the world - everything just works really well and slick.Highly recommended!			",110,51,11,9,25,2,15

												Why haven't I reviewed this game yet? This is easily THE BEST BUY for Vive now bar none. The only way you could fail to get good value from this buy is if you hate billiards. It has online coop that works, and social people can talk, or others can just stand silently and play. They recently added in air hockey, there's a set of large dominos you can setup and tip over, and a digital dart board (that said, throwing darts in VR is anything but easy. Well, throwing them is easy, throwing them accurately...not so much).The physics on the ball are good, and supposedly if you turn off ghost ball and some other feature you unlock 'pro mode' where the ball physics are more or less perfect to real life (the only issues you'll have with ghost ball on will be trying to do backspin across half a table length or more; it won't curve durng the shot as it would IRL).English (the ball physics property, not the language) is supported, so you can safely backspin a pocket shot to recall a ball across the table or avoid pocketing the cue ball. Jump shots also exist. Oh, and the AI has many small increments. You'll find an AI opponent that fits your skill level, I promise. Seriously, out of all the paid-for games on Vive right now, the ratio of cost:fun for this game is easily #1. You will not regret this purchase.			",55,9,0,4,6,1,10

												This is one of the most immersive games I have experienced in VR so far. I actually felt like I was in a bar playing pool and chatting with a real person. All of the people I played with so far were really friendly. The physics is perfect and with the haptic feedback it actually feels real when I hit the ball. You can also play darts and break bottles or chairs while waiting for your opponent to finish their shot. The AI is good and the harder difficulties provide a nice challenge. The game looks good on medium and I get a stable 90fps with my 390x. In my opinion this is one of the best VR games out right now and I highly recommend getting it if you enjoy pool.

												Probably the best use of VR to date. This is the perfect example of where VR is going. There is something jaw dropping about seeing another person in the same room as you in VR, the sense of pressence is unreal. Even though you can't see their body, just controllers and headset, you know how they are positioned in your room and then... They start chucking beer bottles and chairs at your face and totally ignoring the game in front of you. It's like your internet personality meets real life. It is beautiful.			",132,14,9,8,14,1,3

												 I'm a pretty amateur pool player and have on a very casual interest in real life in pool.  I mean amateur in the ""oh look I hit a ball, yay"" kind of amateur.  Yet I love this game.  It's one of the best, most full featured games on the Vive currently.  The Pool Hall itself is fully realized with loving detail to explore.  A full physics engine lets you mess around with basically anything in the environment in some cool ways.  Menus are a breeze to navigate.  Playing pool feels very natural and inuitive after only a few minutes.  I don't know if these skills I'm gaining would transfer that well back to real life, but I have a feeling at least the knowledge I'm gaining would.  At the very least, I can already feel a real sense of progression in my ability after only playing a dozen or so games of this and that feels great. Now if the developers could just find a way to make self aware AI for the sole purpose of letting me make my opponents feel shame when I beat the AI.  I want that birthday hat wearing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to feel HUMILIATION when I take him down.Pros:-Great looking game with a nice hazy hool hall atmosphere; amazing in VR-Great online multilplayer.  Finding random games or inviting friends to play is a breeze and very snappy.-Great unlock system with hats, new pool tables, cues, etc.-Great inuitive controls that feel very natural-Nice assists for new pool player such as the ghost ball telling you where your ball will hit before you shoot.Cons:-Could use some sort of Single player ladder/tournament (right now just AI matches which are still a good deal more fun than you'd expect though)-Only two players per game/lobby.  It would be great to let more people hang out in a game/hall or have multiple games going on in the same space.-No Self Aware AI to make victory over robot overlords feel totally sweet. If you have a Vive this game should probably be in your library.  Even if yout have that much interest in pool. It's one of the best, most polished games on the platform right now and it's a ton of fun.			",395,101,5,47,29,8,60

												Great game and lots of fun/ The multiplater system works very well (kudos for allowing AI play while waiting). Physics are pretty good. Balls do stop at pocket edge about twice as much as in reality pool (guess they need to round bevel the felt near pockets more). Once and a while we see some impossible spins (too curved). Twice I played a legitimate game and sunk the eight ball properly but the game would not end and I was forced to forfeit. These are minor complaints. This is easily the best game in VR if you even slightly like pool. Graphics are stunning. There is plenty to play around with (nearly everything is interactive). I wonder if it is possible to have multiple players playing several tables in the room? Can't wait to see how this game progresses. It is fantastic as it is.			",64,50,5,4,72,7,3

												Just purchased and played this game.  After playing around with the physics in free play for a bit, and playing against the AI, I jumped into a quick match against another person.  While we did play a couple of games of 8-ball, it quickly devolved into stacking chairs onto the other pool tables, throwing darts at NPC's, and finally trying trick shots around strategically placed beer bottles.  Without realising it, almost an hour and a half had passed.So all in all, pretty much an accurate simulation of a night out shooting pool at the bar!			",197,49,1,34,42,3,40

												Very fun VR experience, but would work better with 2 people. Thankfully it has online play, but is fun regardless. It features darts, air hockey and pool games. Darts is...functional at best. With no real weight to the Vive contollers, it's hard to throw consistently. Pool is the main attraction and works surprisingly well. Provided you have good tracking in your VR space, you can place shots accurately, and you can either play solo, play against the AI or online.Just remember: Don't try leaning on the pool table!

												Great game, physics are pretty believable and the addition air hockey and skee ball are just an added bonus.MM has been acting up on me lately, not sure why. If you like pool and dont have a table I think you will definately get your money's worth with this game! The potential of MM providing willing opponents is very enticing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutly amazing! Pool is fun anyway but to meet up with other people in VR is really beyond everything. Just play and talk and do funny stuff.. it is like the person you are playing with is really standing next to you.  There shurly will be more social games likes this in the near future and that is the right way VR should go			",50,20,0,0,11,3,1

												This is actually a very good showcase for VR.  I actually lost myself in the bar as I crashed my way around the table.And its also better than real life pool.  You can walk through the table to make the trickier shots if you need to.Pros - Very immesiveNice environmentGood ball physicsDarts inclusion is funCons -Can be hard to aim your shots (mainly because of focus depths).Only two pool modes (I'm not including freeplay because it has no objective) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the ultimate man cave. And the addition of adding your own music and video makes this so much more enjoyable. Pool and air hockey feel so real it's just creepy. Now if they could somehow add cross platform play so I can play my PSVR brother from across the country I'd be even more amazed.			",41,30,2,2,35,7,1

												This game was a mix experience for me.  The graphics are great.  There's plenty of awesome things to do; darts, dominoes, air hockey, and obviously pool.  But alone the game quickly gets dull so you will want to play with someone. I don't know if there's just not many people playing, server issues, or just my own internet (which I doubt), but if you do ""manage"" to find someone to play with, unless they have a mic, the gameplay isn't much better.  I did request a refund, but here's why... I spent 30 min with the game my first time to find someone to play with and came across no one.  I tried again the next day and DID find someone who didn't speak my language AND he was AFK.  The game then continued to pair me up with this individual over and over, but FINALLY I found someone, but... he didn't have a mic.  We played a game of pool, threw around a couple bottles and darts, and shook hands when the game was done and went on our ways.  It was an enjoyable experience, but for the amount of time and work I had to put into finding someone versus the enjoyment I had made the game not worth it for me.  I do think the game is awesome though, it has a lot of opportunity for friends to have a good time in a virtual bar and do what ever they want, but if you don't have a friend who also has an HTC Vive, you might want to reconsider.  I really do think this game is more tailored towards players who just simply enjoy playing pool or two friends who have a Vive, just don't get your hopes up with trying to find multiplayer.

												A very well made game VR game, one of the few which is quite polished and well thought out. I've so far done 2 games on my own in free mode and 1 online game and it was very fun. The physics feel great, and the game was clearly well designed with the limitations of current VR room scale tech in mind. Particularly handy is the teleport function which can snap you to the edge of the table in one location, facing the table, very handy! The cue is also very well designed, there's a grip function which feels very natural for holding the cue straight as you try to hit your shot, which would be otherwise impossible without a table to lean on. Amazingly I can play this game with relative ease even in just standing mode in the tiny space of my bedroom, whereas other room scale games have me carrying my PC out to the living room for more space. Highly recommended to get with your new Vive!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
