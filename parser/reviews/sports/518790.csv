It's completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over Rotwald area, listening to rain, storm, forest, just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day. For real it's best audio-video application for PC and when it comes to give true nature feeling  Call of the Wild is beyond any competition for years. It's great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax. Not to mention You can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here.Night hunts or ability to seamless walk/trek/hunt/ in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong. Especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight...Feelings , presentation and realism are above perfect. If you have ever been on real hunt just buy it. Game have some UI bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches. No other problems.Shooting and tracking are real - it works exactly the same in Real life - some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome - but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it - this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well.

Night hunts are just thrilling - imagine rural field after harvests at midnight , full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds .Yes You have head lamp and if You miss vitals or hit [like in real life] big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after.Searching for animal at night are just amazing! Check my uploaded screenshots to understand !YES YOU CAN TURN OFF ALL HELPERS [ very detailed and lot of options to  choose from ! ] and act like in RL.To say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game [35 years old here] and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life. All works the same - animals reacts different , depends when bullet hits, etc. Together with video-audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job. No one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than Expansive Worlds did here.

This game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all. And all of them are well tested and realized in the game. If You ask yourself ""is that feature is here?"" - answer YES it is. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885844967 If you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it's best title ever released. There is no better PC program that can awake love to the nature than this game [and please all eco terrorists who don't even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still  as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life] .Details are just breathtaking ! Shoots are dependable by range, wind, position, after unlocking some skills and perks [ great by the way , very good mechanics and very real too ! ] . Someone really knows how to present real hunting!And if you only have occasion just listen to Pines waving on strong wind at Rotwald mountians at first reserve. Did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing? Good. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885526048 Forget about The Hunter - just sink into this title and beg Devs to develop it further [its just great joy to simply walk in this game] - personally i will pay for all DLC for it , and im sure we get some free dlcs too.You are like on real hunt here in Call of the WIlds , im playing on I5 Haswell, 16gb Ram and 1060 Geforce , all on ultra and high - and trust me - stable FPS around 50-60 , and DAT FEELING along with excellent sounds [you will hear very high range of nature sounds, different for each bush, plants, grass, day and night or even part of day or night ] . There is NO DIFFERENCE in visual or sound presentation with normal, real life hunt.Im completely shocked - Light in this game works like in real life too , you will almost feel wet cold mornings, warm sunsets, scary storms. Just like in real life simple walking through woods [hello no one generic fragment of land, each is handplaced and designed like real life, no boring terrain all over the map].About bugs - i havent noticed any in game about what is essential - hunting , tracking, playing .There are small and very minor buggies with UI but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews. If You are hunting in real life, if You love nature, if You hunted long ago, if You are interested in hunting, if You are looking for best looking game on PC , if You are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application , if You are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts [not so embarassing like in the hunter online - all is really better here ] - JUST GO BUY and THANK Devs for realizing every hunter dream ! http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=885651194 ABOUT ""BUGS"" : Shortly: Leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead.Longer:And please stop listening people about shooting - it works exactly like in rl life - not only shooting [wind guess [after perk - eralier by observing nature], magnitude setup [after perk] but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit.If someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can't understand that hit which lands on ""soft"" part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs. If You want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books. Devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known, just look at older brother theHunter Classic.And i bet this wonderfull game, Call of the Wild will become it's successor.There are many ""headshooters"" from stupid fps games around here , who never hold and fire from real gun. Trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be. Not only visually [dat scopes GOD! almost smell rubber near eye] , but what is most important from shooting mechanic. There is Bullet drop, wind , calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system.  SO ALL OF YOU COD/CS SONS GO SCREW YOURSELF KIDOS.See You in the wilds !!!Developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it's best and most realistic hunting experience ever created. I will gladly pay for future DLCs, and remember about some freeLC too. Just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my first review of a game, but I though this game deserved a review as it's been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion. I live in South Africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it's something I enjoy. What I enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature. You have to patiently stalk your prey, following spoor (tracks), looking at their dung, checking that you're not upwind. It's not easy, and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey.So in context of this game, I never thought I'd ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as I get in real life. But I was wrong. This game does really well in making you feel like you're in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design I've seen in a game. It really is stunning. I often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me. The beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game.The actual hunting part has been done extremely well. In this game I've felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life. Patience is key. Checking wind direction, following tracks, listening for your prey's sounds, looking at your prey's dung etc. has been really well thought out and implemented. It can take hours to find and hunt the prey you're looking for, but it feels worth it. I've seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews, and I have seen a couple, but none of them were game breaking in my opinion. If that is what is holding you back from buying this game, then let me assure you, it's not that bad. The bugs aren't that major, and I have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine. My settings are all cranked up and I'm running a GeForce 970, 8GB RAM, Intel i5 2500k processor, and have experienced no lag or crashes.If you want a game to get lost in, that takes time and patience, that is beautiful and realistic, then give this a go. I hope they bring out an African map in a future DLC!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get something straight right off the top here... this is, by far, one of the most graphically beautiful simulations of an outdoor environment currently available.  Period.  I've been gaming for over 30 years, and this game, with it's accurate global illumination and sunlight simulation, is one of the most immersive experiences I've ever seen thanks to their Apex open world engine.  This is the kind of thing that the next Elder Scrolls game NEEDS, and it's almost worth the $30 price just as a walking simulator alone!  Yeah, it's THAT good.  Even the audio is fantastic... realistic bird calls, buzzing insects, breezes blowing through the trees, etc....it feels like I'm actually walking through a woodland setting.  It's awesome!Note: you need a reasonbly good PC to get all the eye candy at anything above 50-ish fps and people with lesser machines have complained about poor performance.  I can max out all details at 2560x1440 and get between 50~60 fps.  (See the bottom of my review for system specs.)But anyway, the graphics and sound goodies are where the list of awesome things about this game ends.  I really WANT to be able to recommend this game, but the rest is a mixed bag of bugs, broken features, and insanely baffling design decisions that leave me not only nearly speechless, but also more than a little♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off.  Back on release day, BluesNews.com posted an article that said that this game had been release as Early Access, but the article was in error because it was, in fact, a full release with no mention of Early Access.  However, that's EXACTLY what this game feels like, and if you haven't been to the forums or read a lot of other reviews yet, you'll see that plenty of other players say the same thing.  Normally I'm pretty forgiving of bugs and whatnot, but in this case, I just can't cut this much slack.Some bugs have been fixed with a recent patch, but it's far from enough, and some of the worst bugs still remain.  Some of those most obvious bugs involve the animal AI, which is ironic considering the fact that it's a core element to the entire purpose of the game,  For example, it's common to encounter animals that don't seem to notice the player and will stand completely still as you walk right up to them.  It's like being in a ""West World"" kind of place where the animals are robots and they sometimes malfunction.  They also get stuck in terrain and rocks, causing them to run in place indefinitely.The whole game has a ""console-ish"" feel, like it's made for kids or something, compared to Expansive Worlds' other game, theHunter Classic, which is much more comprehensive, although doesn't look as good.  Pretty much everything in the game has to be unlocked by visiting points on the map or shooting certain animals or whatever.  You have to earn cash to buy lures, ammo, weapons, and everything is laughably expensive.  I suppose this is a viable method of giving the player a reason to keep hunting, but it also lends to an ""arcade-like"" experience.  They claim the game went through beta ""testing"", but if that's true, then their beta testers were far less competent than they needed to be.  Or maybe the testers reported the bugs and the devs chose to ignore them.  Either way, most of the problems this game has are inexcusable and could not possibly have any sort of intelligent explanation as to how they made it into the final release.Other issues that drive me nuts... - Placing a waypoint on the map does NOT put a marker on your HUD or the Hunter Mate device, which requires you to keep opening the map to make sure you're heading in the right direction.  100% useless feature. - The compass is supposed to allow for ""free"" or ""fixed"" rotation, but it's always on ""fixed"" regardless of the setting. - The Hunter Mate randomly stops showing the track directional cones while you are tracking animals. - Keyboard & mouse players cannot move slowly which means you're always making maximum noise.  (You have to use a game controller and the analog movement stick to ""sneak"" successfully.) - Occassionally, a random deer or two will come out of nowhere, running in a perfectly straight line, and hit you at full speed, causing health damage as they continue off on their merry way.  Frightening. - Animal tracks sometimes double back on themselves and then disappear, even though you don't actually see the animal cross your path as the tracks indicate. - Animals often give ""warning calls"" to let you know that your presence has been detected by either sound, scent, or sight, even though you're A.) not making any noise, B.) down wind, and C.) visually obstructed by hundreds of meters of solid earth, otherwise known as a hill or mountain.  There's some debate as to whether or not the animals actually have the ability to detect you or perhaps their behavior is mostly random.  (It seems random to me.) - Even though the visuals are stunning, the water reflections are CRAP.  I mean, absolute garbage.  You'd have to see them to know what I mean, but I find it absurd that so much of the game's engine is so beautiful, and then they totally ♥♥♥♥ up the water reflection shader.  The water looks much better if you just turn off the reflections.  Not as realistic, no, but still acceptable. - Rain sounds rapidly cut off/on while standing near any body of water.  (Sort of sounds like the ""whop whop whop"" of helicopter blades.) That's not an exhaustive list by any means, but if you want to get an idea of the other issues people have discovered, head over to the discussions and check out the Bug Reports section.  Sure, the game is still playable, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't get some entertainment out of it despite all the times it has made me cross-eyed with rage, but if your'e the kind of person who expects near perfection from their games and is easily annoyed by really obvious bugs, I would avoid this one, for now at least.  Maybe check back in a few weeks or so and see if the game has been patched up some more, but as it stands right now, I can't recommend this game.Specs:  (no overclocking)i7-6700KGTX 107016 GB RAM500 GB SSDSoundBlaster Z			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is from the perspective of someone who has been a huge fan of theHunter: Classic for many years and have quite a bit of time and money invested in it.Call of the Wild is a beautiful game environment and solid hunting mechanics; which will feel familiar to veteran Classic players and not too daunting for new hunters to the 'series'.I've seen a lot of people ask if this is anything like Cabela's. I would have to say that CotW is FAR superior to Cabela's; but still maintains a 'casual' hunter feel to it. There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues). Pros: -Gorgeous graphics-Great sound design-Reserves are very well designed and visually interesting.-Dynamic weather system is well implemented.-Smooth animations and weapons feel like they have weight.-Players can jump! This might sound ridiculous to put on a pro's list; but it's one of the biggest features I wanted in Classic.-Stalking animals is MUCH easier. This could also be listed as a Con.-Progression system with XP, Money and Weapon skill, that will keep you striving to improve.-MASSIVE hunting reserves.-Similar game mechanics to Classic, that makes the game familiar for veteran Classic players. -Good tutorial and hint system for new hunters. -Much further render distance for all the long-shot enthusiasts.Cons: -A few UI issues (unable to click some elements, or non-responsive elements)-Experienced a couple of crashes due to entering the System Settings menu. (work-around is to change settings, then restart the game. Another suggestion is to disable cloud-sync in Steam).  -Animals aren't as 'hard' when it comes to Spook range and flee distance from weapon firing. -MP has a few issues. Most noticeably with desync (shooting animals that aren't actually there). -Joining an MP game can spawn you out of bounds, or with 0 health. (This isn't game breaking from my experience as it respawns you near the host. )-Can't quit to Main Menu - only to Desktop.-Can't progress your characters environment/lore/tower unlocks in MP. -No in-depth stats tracking and weapon skill progression compared to Classic. -Progression flow is a bit off (Receiving missions and being advised to use specific callers; which you can't yet unlock due to level or money requirements)-No truRacks system.-Some may find the game too grindy to unlock new weapons and itemsAll in all, I would still recommend this game in spite of its launch issues; if you can tolerate a few bugs. If you are expecting a 100% flawless release, then perhaps give this title a miss until the developers have ironed a few creases out. I'll happily update this review in the near future to accurately reflect any developer changes to anything listed above; or anything new they introduce.I hope this helps!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok so, here I am. One of those guys who's going to give the game a positive review. I've read many of the negative reviews and most of them are actually fact based and have legitimate complaints (instead of people who just hate hunting games saying they hated it.  If you're listening, don't play warcraft if you hate elves and dwarves, and stop playing grand theft auto if you hate cars.)   So, yes, the game has many issues which need to be fixed ASAP and many others which we would all like to see dealt with over time. Having said that,  this game was a great way for me and a close friend to spend some time walking through the woods, when we are too far away to do it in real life. (not to mention, regulations on hunting here are a bit more strict than in game where you can bag 6-7 deer in one evening haha)  The scenery is great, its well done, has a ton of variation, and lots of space. Its also pretty simplistic in its design, not a ton of gimmicky stuff that isn't needed... Have you been way out in the woods before? Its a lot like this game shows. The feel of the firearms is good, the sounds (when they work) are good, the animal behavior is above exceptable, the game offers challenge as well, since you don't start playing, and an hour later have every piece of gear available. I like the ""grindy"" aspect of it. Maybe others don't but I call this a bonus. The game is quite relaxing and slow paced, perfect for when you need a break from the typical ADHD shooters of our current time or bucket-of-ice-cold-water to the face pvp most online games throw at you.  I like to put this one on the big screen in the living room with a fire going and an ice cold lager, and take my time looking down those fields and wandering the woods. Definitely a relaxing, low stress title here.  So, what needs fixing? well...Plenty.   I'll write more about it in suggestions, and hopefully some Devs can take a look at what I have to say!TL;DR    Yes its not perfect, but with some work it easily could be one of, or even THE greatest hunting game title (depending on what you're after)  Is it worth the cost?  I'm going to say yes, but only with the stipulation that they continue to work on it, and provide the community with more content and bug fixes without asking for more money.EDIT:   wanted to include what i posted in suggestions.Ok, so I've only played about 10 hours so far, but I thought I should write this while the thoughts are fresh in my mind.  I'll start by saying that I gave this a positive review in steam, and suggested people take a closer look at it.  I spent quite a few hours last night having a lot of fun playing multiplayer with a close friend of mine.  We talked a lot on discord and discussed a few of the issues people are complaining about, as well as some of the bugs and issues we encountered ourselves.  I think this game is really good already and potentially will be amazing.  Having said that, here are a few things I would like to draw some attention to (in no particular order);1. Option of ""exit to main menu/home screen""  I really think this should have been here already, and many agree.  Exiting to desktop is a bit annoying, especially for people on my friends list who see ""mike is playing, mike stopped playing, mike is playing"" lol.  Lets add a ""quit to main menu""?2. In Multiplayer, only the person hosting is able to interact with the (?) on the map. As far as we could tell last night, only the host is able to fast travel as well. This is a huge disadvantage and also makes no sense. It would be nice to say ""hey, lets all meet at the lodge/outpost for a moment and restock and regroup"" or something. It can take a while if you get separated to walk all the way to your friend!  Not to mention, wandering up to a landmark or lookout and not being able to do anything, or being unable to build a blind, etc.  Lets make it so anyone can use these things!3. Money.  So, I have no huge issue with this but I wanted to add a few personal points here. I think the money system should be scaled a bit.  I'm going to use $, so please euro players, etc, bear with me (i'm canadian but I'll use USD).  A box of ammunition doesn't cost 300$ in real life.  and the normal hunting rifles a regular person buys (i'm talking AVERAGE here) are maybe 2000$ or even less.  (I bought a browning for 800 once, and it even came with a scope).  I think charging 30,000$ is a bit high. Perhaps have the money earned cut down a bit, and then scale the cost of things for a bit more realism.  I'd suggest 20 rounds of ammunition for lets say 45-50$4.Sound issues.  Some people don't have this, but a few I've spoken to do. I don't know about you but for me, there is nothing worse than waiting an hour for that perfect tag to show up (deer, etc) and lining up your perfect shot and then ""silence"" when you pull the trigger.  It's quite anticlimactic when that happens. Not to mention the calls sometimes being silent, or rain sounding a bit buggy, etc.  I hope these sound bugs are eliminated soon. Not a deal breaker for me, but should be addressed.5.Here's one I haven't seen anyone mention. Why do female characters run like the flash? Friend of mine literally leaves me in the dust when we're moving together (and yes I triple checked, i'm running, not walking)  She ran about 85% faster than my male character. Is this a bug or intentional? Do male characters get some other bonus like carrying more weight or something? (not being sexist, just asking)  Is there a point in playing as a male when you can essentially speedwalk as a female?6. Wildlife changes.  Bird hunting should be added (and forgive me if it is but I haven't unlocked it)  if you're going to have shotguns in the game, there should be geese, duck, turkey, pheasant...whatever.  As far as I can tell this isn't really a thing. Can anyone confirm? I've not read anything definite so far, but some have told me there is no such gamebirds added. More wildlife would be nice too, but mostly just the bird hunting (a favorite of mine in real life) is something I'd love to see.7.Group activity.  It would be fun in multiplayer to have some quest/challenge that is co-operative. Maybe a party system or something where if 2 people collaborate on a kill, they share the rewards, regardless of who pulled the trigger. 9.I've heard this mentioned before but,  seasons.  Would be kind of interesting if you could make some selections when starting a multiplayer like winter, rain on or off, night only, day only, fall, spring...etc.  Some other maps/terrain variations in general would be nice (sort of goes along with that)  Just vague ideas I'm throwing out here. 10. Firing range, practice. Something like that might be useful for those who have never hunted or shot in real life, or are new to these types of games.   Well, that's all for now, I welcome any comments and bumps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Updated review after 52 hours in and 4 updates.TL;DR: this game should be marked as an EARLY ACCESS GAMEWhile I can understand the dev's motivation to urge users to report bugs, I cannot fathom how they can release this game as a ""finished product"" but treat their customers as early access testers.Bugs I've encountered:- Animals get stuck and stand still. They cant run away. You can pet them.- Sometimes you get stuck in a bush and then die of falling damage.- Trashiest, clunkiest and buggiest UI ever. Even after the patch you have to (at least) click twice on stuff and pray for it to work.- Apparently not only the wildlife, but also the UI buttons require a hunter's precision. If you don't click on a specific area within the option you want to navigate through, the game won't recognize your click (UI is absolutely buggy and has ""hidden hitboxes"").- Map doesn't center around you when you open it. First few moments upon openning the map have to be spent on zooming in/out and finding where you are.- There seems to be no consistency regarding the ""loudness of the sounds"" you create. Crawling through bush X in this area is silent. Crawling through bush the same bush in another area is suddenly loud. Also wind and rain seem to not have an effect on your (displayed) sound-level.- After playing some time with your Phone (ingame item that helps you tracking) out, your fps start to drop from 50+ to 13. Only happens when the phone is out. Then the next bug kicks in...- Suddenly all tracks vanish and don't ever appear again. Renders tracking impossible. You have to restart the game. Going into the menu and back ingame is not possible, since there is no button to return to the menu.- The scope on the rifle bugs out as soon as you start using a bow. Use a bow and your rilfe's scope will be rendered useless (don't use a bow).- Not receiving skill points all though I get notified I got one (?)- Not receiving perk points all though I get notified I got one (?)+ Many more bugs OTHERS discoveredTechnically not a bug, but simply bad design:) You can't walk through some bushes (which is fine in itself), but in some areas they are placed en masse which turns said area into a maze. You have to navigate your way through hip-tall bushes that in RL you wouldn't even need to bend but here they are WALLS. Try to jump over them and you die of falling damage (that is a bug though).

												Alright guys, so after playing this game for a bit,  I find a lot of good things.  The graphics are outstanding, the hunting is fun,  however I feel like there should be some more content in the game,  its good but could use some trap/skeet ranges or something,  maybe some more guns,  and FISHING,  the devs should add fishing.

												I would say in its current state don’t buy it unless you really like the original thehunter. Right now there are a lot of bugs and glitch’s. This game should have been an early access to be honest. Overall the game is pretty fun, the graphics are fantastic, the side missions are fun yet challenging and the overall realism is pretty good. I would say after 3-6 months this game should be in a good state for a purchase but right now I would say wait a bit. 7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tl;dr:This game looks absolutely gorgeous, the performance are great (i5 4590 and a GTX 970, 40/50 FPS at Full HD with Ultra settings) and the gameplay is fun albeit slow paced, suited for both casual and hardcore gamers.There are some bugs to be ironed out but I haven't found anything gamebreaking yet.The most annoying thing is the inability to select the walking speed with mouse and keyboard (it's possible only with a controller) but it's already been worked on. - Fixed with patch 1.2I've also found out that for now some achievements can't be unlocked - Fixed with patch 1.2No crashes on my side but I've read reports of freezes/continuous crashes from Windows 10 users, so if you're not a Win7 user I'd advise caution buying right now Pro: Beautiful graphics and sceneries, really good audio compartmentWell optimized: an i5 4590 and a GTX 970 are enough to play at Full HD with everything maxed Ultra settings* (maxing Shadows causes FPS drops in various places) with 40/50 FPS stableFun (albeit slow) gameplay, suited for both casual gamers and hardcore hunters: the game helps you find tracks, downed animals and even collectibles, and you can tailor your experience by enabling/disabling each option individuallyNo microtransaction or additional fees Con: The UI is pretty buggy and not clear to read, especially the ingame map and manual UPDATE: after patch 1.2 the map is still kind of glitchy but the ""noise/visibility meter"" has been fixed and now works properlyIt's currently impossible to select the walking speed using mouse and keyboard, which means that you'll always make a lot of noise scaring animals. Devs have announced that they're already working on it and should be addressed with the next patch - Thanks to patch 1.2  is now possible to do so even with keyboard and mouseThere are many other generic bugs but the devs are really active and have already released four big patches to address most if not all of the gamebreaking onesWildlife's AI has some flaws but I haven't noticed totally unnatural or crazy behaviour - UPDATE: 15 hours in I've found a single case of animal stuck in place, besides that the AI feels really natural (shot a buck, almost been charged to death by him while the other does of the pack ran away - it was awesome)Around half of the achievement are bugged and can't be unlocked, mainly the trophy-related ones - This is now fixed and every achievement unlocked but not awarded due to the bug has been credited to me as soon as I loaded my savegame ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game should have been an early access title.Random crashes, bad multiplayer, bad AI, wonky menus are just a few of the problems I have with this game. With that said, I'm still having fun with this game. But that is primarly because of the people I play with. The game does have a good base, but it needs a lot of polish and expanding.Simply put: This game needs the Early Access tag for me to recommend it.Edit: Removed ""very slow progression"" from my list, since they fixed this in the latest update.

												My review is based on how the game is NOW and not what it COULD be.The game is stunning, i have everything set at max and its awesome id love to see a VR version. The sounds are great infact the whole FEEL of the game is really nice.Im not a hunter, never have been and never will be and at first i had no idea what im supposed to do in the game. There is no TUTORIAL and the basic guide at the start does well in starting you but i needed to watch a few youtube videos to help. I played for around an hour just wondering around in crouch wondering why i cant find any animals. Found a rabbit and killed it, felt awesome but nope rabbits dont count. At that point i was going to quit but i stook with a little longer and i finally found a deer. Boom headshot, but wait it just ran off. Ok so apparently headshots arent the best way to kill an animal. So i followed it and managed to get another shot at it and managed to kill it with one more shot. Went upto its body and harvested it and was presented with a screen which showed an xray of the animal and alsorts of cool info and that was me hooked.The game does have quite a few BUGS, i wouldnt say they were game breaking bugs but they can be pretty annoying. Id have a look in the TECHNICAL ISSUES discussion to see more on bugs but overall ive enjoyed the game.So why am i giving this a NEGATIVE REVIEW. Well its mostly because the game feels like an early access game right now. The DEVS seem to be fixing bugs and hopefully will listen to the public and make a few changes and add a few things. There is also talk on PAID DLC which id prefer them to focus on the main game first but this game does have serious potential and i will change my review accordingly.In short the game is playable and very enjoyable if you can stand a few annoying bugs. If your the kind of person who hates any kind of bugs id suggest adding this to your watchlist and checking back in a few weeks/months. Unfortunately there is no NEUTRAL option on here so i have chosen NEGATIVE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												POST 1.21 PATCH:LOTS OF GAME FREEZES... STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.Post 1.2 patch:None of the big 3 bugs fixed, disappearing tracks, crashes and Zombie slow walking after interrogating lots of tracks.They have managed to 'balance' the cost of ammo (ie now costs 3 times the amount.)Seriously, did anyone other than the 'realism above fun' brigade ask for this?   Animals freezing, getting stuck on terrain and ignoring running players that's what needs fixing, not trying to stop players buying all the gear due to getting ingame currency.Fix the animal AI, that'll add to the realism.  But therein lies the problem, they know how to raise the price of ammo and not a clue what to do with the animal AI, otherwise it would have been fixed in the Hunter...Just thought I'd share my last hunt with you:Killed a coyote for a mission, but it didn't count, found the answer on the forum, you have to hold the .270 whilst harvesting it.  A fixed is promised.Start again, shot a deer with the bow, harvested it.  I found a coyote and tried to use the .270 Huntsman, but the scope wouldn't work, because I'd used a bow first... a known bug .Start again, made sure I looked down the rifle scope first, to stop the  bow bug.  Shot a nice Stag for a mission with the bow, the game locked as soon as I shot it. Had to restart my computer, otherwise it will lock up again.Immersive, Realistic?  I'll leave it up to you to decide.Updated 28 Feb. 108 hours!As Stefan asked to let let him know how I like it after the 1.1 patch, I'll post on what bugs are still extant after 1.1 (along with the new ones it has caused):CONS:1. Game can crash and lock up the pc with loud audio, no 'COTW_F stopped working message'.   This didn't happen for me before 1.1.  The program needs to be stopped with the task manager.This happened to me within a couple of minutes in game and kept happening until the pc was restarted.  Happened yesterday to a friend I was in TS with.2.  The Zombie speed bug is still there after you interrogate a lot of tracks, having to select HM then a weapon, to get around it, is a pain.3.  There seems to be a finite amount of tracks, a few times in a long hunt, animals I have shot and killed have left no tracks, it was pure luck I found the body. (I tried using the light in case it was a day/night problem.)4.  UI still clunky, .270 hollow point ammo still locked even with sufficient rifle skill, unlockable Stands... STILL!5.  Animals stuck in trees, rocks and the animation where the animal freezes and does a slow piroutette is hilarious.6.  Animals reacting to callers, regardless of species, if you don't have a certain caller, use anyone, it'll work.  Both predator callers use the same sound file, but there again a lot of animals use the same warning calls... still not fixed.7.  Animals in groups ignoring shots, allowing the entire herd to be killed. (Not sure whether this should be a pro!)PROS:1.  It is very pretty, which is the main theme of all the positive reviews.2.  Positive reviews make a great deal of how realistic and immersive it is, if you have frozen, 'rotating on the spot' animals where you hunt, then this game might be considered realistic!I'll say it again, this could be a cracking game... I'll post more after the next big patch.Another update, 53 hours in, but first, some quotes from positive reviews:'There are still a few launch issues and bugs however, which really should have been ironed out from the Beta before retail release; including some issues that aren't dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in theHunter: Classic (specifically MP issues).It has some buges, but I believe those will be patched soon.'There's a plethora of <10 hours played positive reviews coming out, it's just a shame the IP addresses aren't displayed ;)Ok, on with the review:A few crashes, but not enough to make me give up on it yet, Ooh I'm stubborn!Today's highlights:Thanks to the posts in discussions about how to change map without restarting (Kudos to the OPs), I went to North America.  I had difficulty walking without treading on animals, so different to Hirsch!  I could see for miles and levelled up so quickly, it made me look as though I knew what I was doing. (Which my TS mates know to be untrue.)Problems with North America:Some buildable items don't appear on the map and aren't buildable.Shot some animals which don't leave tracks (this was just before the game crashed.)Some of the animal audio clues are very slow or looped, actually I rather like this, it made me laugh to hear a 10 times slowed whitetail call, talk about a wet F**t!Thank you to the people who've added me and asked me whether to buy it on the strength of my review.  I'm new to this and I'm trying to do it as honestly as I can.Update after day 2:A positive note!I only had one crash on startup and zero crashes whilst ingame.. I believe in giving credit where credit is due and the hotfixes appear to have lessened the crashes for me. (As they did in the beta hotfixes.. so why weren't they included in the release version?)I am, however, amazed by the state in which this game was released... this is the official workaround for being unable to change key bindings ingame:'Disable cloud saving on Steam (Properties -> Updates -> Untick Steam Cloud Synchronization)Go to Documents\Avalanche Studios\theHunter Call of the Wild\Saves open your save folderOpen “keymap.json” with a text editor of your choice (e.g. Notepad)Manually adjust keybindingsSave file and start the game (keeping cloud save disabled until you have started it once)'Quick question... this is a release version and not early access?  If something as simple as keybindings is screwed up, then it doesn't bode well for the game.Ok, into day 2's review:I played this game a lot today, 30 something hours in (including it's older sibling - the beta!)A few observations, it would be nice if:1. I could go to the map and not have a random view nowhere near where my player is, at a scale where I could see where I am.2. Red Deer, Roe Deer and other animals didn't share the same audio for warning calls. (Reported in Beta)3. The hit boxes worked (even some of the EW affiliated tubers made mention of this).4.  I didn't sink into the ground in open fields at night.5. Squirrels and rabbits didn't sound as though they weighed 20 tonnes ingame, they are the loudest animals when they are running around.6. When you brush against foliage ingame, the sound comes from roughly the same direction of that the foliage is in... otherwise it could be a 20 tonne squirrel.In summary... despite all of the above, this could be a cracking game, what's letting it down at the moment is the shooting side of it.  I had great fun running round and unlocking stuff and doing the odd mission, but as an immersive hunting simulator - forget it.Day 1:It's the Beta, stuck animals, COTW_F crashes and, as an added bonus, if you've been a member of the Hunter for a while, you get the chance to buy, with ingame credits, an extra rifle and ghillie suit... hardly a bonus.I'm so disappointed with myself for falling for it yet again, when will I learn?  Answer... when the first DLC comes out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am a fan of thehunter classic and invested a large amount of money into it, so I was eager to play this new game. They have the right idea but honestly it should have never been released in the current state. There are bugs everywhere from clipping through the ground if you go prone, to a graphical glitch with the scope to animals acting in total bizzare ways/ bugging out all together. I regret the purchase. My advice would be don't buy it and wait to see if they actually fix the game. If everyone runs out and buys this it will only encourage the company to release unready games in the future as part of some sort of money grab. If they take pride in their work they will fix these bugs. It looks like the game need another month or two of work on it before it was ready for release. The game may be worth picking up in the future but only if they fix these issues because its unacceptable when I come across several bugs within the first hour of play alone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In germany we have a saying: ""Der Fisch fängt am Kopf an zu stinken."" which roughly translates to ""the fish rots from the head down"". You can feel that talented and passionate people are working on this game. It´s just a shame that someone decided that the game had to be released in a barely finished state. Overall the gameplay is great but there are quite a lot of litte things and glitches that add up and can be frustrating. From stuck animal herds, to crashes, broken scopes and unresponsive menue buttons you´ll see it all. I really miss a better highscore system or trophy room of some sorts. You have a list with your scores but it´s really basic.   It´s hard to recommend but I still enjoy the game. The two, beautiful maps are huge and the gameplay is for the most part quite solid. The game just feels rough around the edges. Also it is good to see that the developer moved away from the awful free too play model of their previous release.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Okay ... so this are one of those games you want to take your time with and appreciate what this game has to offer.After playing an intense CS GO comp or some COD. You really want to immerse yourself into this game. Like trust me this game is really, really good. The graphics in this game is super gorgeous. If it was a girl.. I'd marry her.The hunting is superb. There is nothing more satisfying then killing a animal after hours of walking and tracking.And I don't mind the walking because I just love to take in the scenery and the rain and the sounds and the rest this game has to offer.The sounds are soooooooooo good. The rain wants to make me sleep. The thunder wants me to grab a blanket and go hidein the cubboard or somewhere. All I want in this game is vehicles. Would be cool to drive around and sometimes when you too lazy to shoot. Just drive over you're deer. EZ PZ ! 0_0 . Some glitches here and there but nothing too intense. Well done the developers!

												This one hurts... I was really looking forward to it, but it lets you down hard. It has the potential to be a really good game, but unfortunately it's way too far from finished. For every reason to play, there is, at least for the moment, two not to. I don't even know where to start, but here goes.The bugs... this game is so broken.Disappearing animals, disappearing tracks, the photo missions are a bloody mess (the patch didn't work), sometimes your scope sights work, at other times it just looks like you're looking through a tube on top of your rifle. Over and above that, I've experienced three complete system crashes. Just not good enough. The walking... oh my good gods, the walking.If you're looking for a game that's more of a hiking simulator than anything else, you've come to the right place!Everything is so bloody far away and while you can fast travel between base camps, you still have to discover them. Walking 4km to a mission is not fun - even if you can shoot a few things along the way. This is especially fun when you've walked more than 3km and your game crashes. Giving me an achievement that I've run an ultra marathon doesn't help either. This isn't called The Marathon Runner. Progression... making me work my♥♥♥♥♥off for something that's worseFirst of all, skill points and perks. Their effects are nominal. You don't actually feel like you've progressed at all. The ability to judge an animal's weight doesn't work, because the developers never really got around to sorting out the whole kg/pound conversion thing just yet. Then, of course, you have to choose whether you want to range your sights, or judge the windage of your shot (the windage often differs significantly from the general wind direction, because, you know, deer farts and stuff). Secondly, the progression of firearms. THIS! I worked my way up to the .338 - they don't say whether it's a .338 Lapua or Winchester. Regardless, both of these cartridges are renowned for their accuracy. Not in this game though. 0 accuracy. 0. Nought. You work your way up to the best (and most expensive) rifle in the game and it can't shoot straight.Lack of contentTwo maps, each with their own animals. But it gets old quickly. The missions are all the same, the amount of weapons are ridiculously small and the ""balancing"" (I presume) between damage and accuracy just means that one is slightly less crappy than the other. Having said all of this, it does have a few good points. The hunting is fun and it'll keep you entertained for a few hours. The game is beautiful - the terrain is awesome and the animal models are pretty good. It seems that the developers are pretty keen to improve it, but I'm extremely disappointed that it was released in this state. This game is not finished and letting people buy it so that they can help you pick out the bugs is total BS (even though it is an often too common thing these days). Again, this has the potential to be a really great game, but for the moment, I'd steer clear.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok，I am from China. BUT want the developer can see my evaluation , I will write in English .  I think we only experience hunting from this game . BUT the hunters life not only hunter , they will be  tired or hungry .  I think this game can divide  into the survival mode and hunting mode .   Someone may just like hunting and have fun can play hunting mode . The other players want to experience whole hunter life  can play survival  mode .  The  cooking and make clothes from animal fur may give players more sence of achievement .It's a good game , it's make me quiet  by  call of the wild .			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EDIT TO REVIEW:So I've been watching this game closly and the devs are very very active in fixing and tweaking the game. They've fixed some issues I've expressed below so I now have high hopes for this game. It's not perfect but the patching makes me hopeful. My experience with this game:-Decide to try stalking a deer-Follow closely behind on although never getting to see it because it can hear me crouch walking through foliage made of old sun chip bags-Crouch walking for an hour at least, get acheivement for tracking 50 tracks for one animal-Another hour later finally see deer glitch humping a rock, I could walk up to it and it would keep glitching-Decide that wasn't rewarding so move onto another deer-20 minutes later hear one mating call-Crouched and moved toward it-Rinse repeat 50 or so tracks later I have a clear shot-Aim scope, a third grader could hold it more steady-Decide to try prone, my guy must of grabbed a handful of foliage and duct taped it to from of scope-Take a shot from crouch, headshot-Deer runs away like nothing happened-Figured ""Well it shouldn't take long to bleed out""-Investigate blood splatter ""flesh wound""-Stayed stationary for 10 or so minutes, had cup of coffee-Track blood trail-50 or so blood splatters later decide to let it bleed more-I go to town, shop at the mall, go on real hunting trip, shoot deer in exact spot as on game, it bleeds out within 15, carry deer back to truck, drive home, gut deer, hang meat up, smoke a good amount of it, go to college for 4 years, get married, have kids and realize I left game running, go back to check it-Track 50 more blood splatters, finally find deer-Take another shot, body hit-10 mote blood splatters later finally find deer body, victory-Rifle skill +1-Can't buy anything useful from shop without genociding all deer-Any real hunting equipment you need 40 hours of gameplay to actually get toActual Review:-Weapons: It takes far too long to level up to the point of unlocking a new weapon, and even longer to get the cash for one. It seems like when I earn enough for one weapon I've unlocked the next one and have to choose to earn enough for that one or buy the lower weapon class one. I realize using different weapon classes provides an integrity bonus, for example using a lower calibur bullet on smaller game gets you more cash. I'm not sure if I understand this entirely not being an avid hunter.-Codex: Very bare bones for information. Doesn't quite explain the most important issues like how to use certain equipment and why the highest calibur rifle has an accuracy of 0. Looked for a wikia and didn't find much. But I shouldn't have to use google to have a base understanding of a game.-Callers: Very very useful, almost to a fault. I've been hunting only a few times in the real world and callers have not worked so well for me. It seems like I just sprint through the forest, hear a warning call, use the correct caller and wait. Seems like the other methods of hunting in this game are much more difficult and I find myself using callers to farm money for hours just to buy a new rifle.-Leveling up: Extremely slow leveling progression. I have 35 hours and about 150-200 animals hunted. I'm a total level of 15. Very few skills I can get and very few perks. I understand hunting is a time consuming activity and a simulation should be as realistic as possible, but it seems like grinding levels takes the fun out of it.-Glitching: I've experienced many glitches. I press ESC and it sends me to another reserve, after taking a shot with the perk to stay scoped it shows me down the barrel of the gun instead of scope, serveral several animals are stuck on rocks and trees, [E] Inspect stays until restart of game, certain items requiring 0/0 skill remain locked through entire game, animals remaining upright after death, after coming out of aim it auto spins me 90-180 degrees instantly and animals shot over ~300m don't take off running.It is a beautiful looking game and has a lot of good aspects to it. But the gameplay seems underdeveloped.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Update after 60+ hours:I decided to quit the game for now, it is simply unfinished, too many issues. For many people, including myself, the game randomly freezes which is equal to crash. Two weeks passed, 4 patches came out, but this issue have never been adressed. I've had enough. Yesterday I  returned to the store GTX1080, which I bought specially for this game. I was hoping to enjoy it as long as the original game. But it is very far from enjoyable. I mean, in 4K it looks stunning, easly the most beautiful game I've seen. However, after the excitement of graphics faded, there was nothing left that would have forced me to play. I'm not even talking unique antlers, leaderboards and competitions, you better forget about it. I mean everything in the game is unfinished or broken. Weapons, callers, animal AI, sounds, menus, descriprions, every aspect of the game works wrong. And this is a very serious obstacle to immersion and fun. A few patches that are released, do not fix anything. I know these developers since classic. You can ask them for months to fix autoreloading... Here is a new game, and again the same problem! 7mm/.338 auto-reloading after each shot, not allowing me to follow wounded animal with sights.  Deer bleat caller has slow-motion behaviour, and is imossible to switch to another item. While jackrabbit caller for some reason can be interrupted instanlty, but the sound continues to play. Map is terrible and slow loading, focusing at random point instead of player. Waypoint doens't work. Even when you need to mark a spot you standing at, it's impossible to do. Weapon and ammo descriptions lie, penetration/expansion is mixed up. Another insult to common sense: 45-70 caliber in this game is so weak, it's the same as .243,  both ammo are class 2. Animals follow calls like a zombies. I made a video shooting deer with an bow, they all come back to call in a minute, even wounded ones! I can go on forever....I know most of this issues will be fixed in a couple of years. But I'm not going to wait this time.EW_Anna, this is all just words, the fact is that you released a poor quality product that should not be allowed to Steam. When the game started to freeze every 5 minutes, I asked for refund, which was declined. You all knew the game is unfinished, full of bugs and not tested properly... I can't respect decisions like this._____________________________________________________________Original review:Extremely bugged and bad optimization(GTX980 1440p 40fps). The game wouldn't save some settings after restart. Have to click 60 times to decrease mouse sensitivity from 80 to 20, why there is no SLIDER?! Still mouse moves too fast, and the game resets setting for me every time! Sometimes it's impossible to exit in-game menu (only to desktop), pressing the button does nothing. Once I lost the progress on the map, and so on.. Considering return because of that.Graphics look good, especially close vegetaion and foliage. But on the distance not very impressive. Reminds me the same old classic hunter, which I have played for more than 1000 hours total..I disabled all arcade elements I could. Still there are signs and pointers flying everywhere. The game is very easy, the main goal is to kill everything that moves(or stuck). In the classic game I enjoyed walking a long distances through beautiful environments, searching for a monster buck, trying to avoid other animals, almost never shot does and small bucks. There was a leaderboard, daily events, personal galleries, trophyshots, and we could discuss our trophies, and so on. For me this was the main point of the game. It was fully focused on quality, not quantity. Here we have another story - kill 'em all, this is how you get xp and money to unlock unlocks, so you can unlock more unlocks even faster. All antlers look the same, there are no unique racks, no scoring system, no trophyshots, no reason to play after everything has been unlocked. I'm not interested in just shooting the same animals over and over again, when there is nothing to discover.Wouldn't recommend at this point, at least because of bugs. As for the gameplay - may be they will improve it later, but I doubt it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a hunter that hunts in Louisiana and Mississippi this game does an amazing job at giving off the vibe of hunting, but it needs a lot more things added to it. I was pretty disappointed in seeing that the game did not have the REMINGTON R-15, SAS Rage bow, or the Taurus Raging Bull... Seeing that the devs launched what they call a ""full released game""  instead of an ""early acess game"" i find it hard to believe they will add a lot more new things into the game (PROVE ME WRONG DEVS).. Really enjoying the game but the 30 bucks it needs more things in game. The game sounds are SPOT On and done very well. Some minor bugs, but nothing to gamebreaking. I give it a 7/10 for now. LETS HOPE THEY DONT GO HUNTER PRIMAL ON US AGAIN!Pros-2 Big maps that take place in 2 different PLACES-Single player game follows multiplayer gameplay aswell-Fast travel system -ieach district of the map, you'll have 1 or 2 spots in which has some type of hunting stand in which you can build an assemble.- Little collectibles hiding around the world-Outpost in which you can buy ammo, scents, callers,guns, and clothing-Scoring system for the animal you killCons-Game store does not sell any kind of feed causing you to explore the world to discover a feeding spot that the animals go to.-Cant climb the ladders -Game has no tree stands-cannot deploy your own stands nor buy your own stands  (The game has pre built foundations for you to build in certain parts of the map)-Scents, callers, guns, and clothing are TOO OVERPRICED-No Vehicles???? Atleast give us ATVS-Can only have 1 profile on game-Lack of firearms inlcuding bows, rifles, pistols, and shotguns-NO Crossbows AT all-No turkeys, No Alligator, No Mountain Lions to hunt			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say that this is perhaps one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. The scenery and the level of detail from terrain to lighting effects is amazing. I am running it on maximum setting. Visuals are absolutely stunning. There are couple of things I'd like to see addressed: 1. Addition of a vehicle would be welcome. The area is expansive and talking simply takes too long to get from one area to another. Of course, the point of the game is to walk the vast terrain, to observe the pray and scout locations. It's a simulator in the true sense of that word. But having a vehicle to quicly reach a hunting area would be great. Yes, there are check points with fast travel, but it's not enough. 2. Walking noise could be improved. You have to move very very slowly to avoid making noise. That's also a very realisting idea but taken a little too far in my opinion. 3. Tracking animals is unreliable. At times the track simply stops as if the animal was abducted by aliens. At other times it reaches a point where it goes in a circle. It's a little frustrating when you track game for a good while only to reach a dead end. 4. Some bugs. Although the developer seems to be very engaged. It's a minor problem at this point. No crashes or anything. Just weird visuals. Once I shot a fox that was standing next to another fox and the second animal didn't even move. Just stood there. I could walk up to it and shoot it point blank. Odd. Unless he ""froze"" on purpose which I doubt. Overall, very unique experience. Visually stunning. First hunting game I bought. It really is great and I would recommend it. Happy Hunting!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don´t buy it just yet. It has still the same bugs as in the closed Beta and the game runs horrible on an up-to-date highend machine. When your game crashes just because you go into the menu you know the game had no quality control at all and people already reported this stuff in the Beta. I will change this review when those bugs are fixed. But until now safe your money, since this game is not playable at all. There are early access titles on Steam which run better and they claim to be an Alpha while this piece of junk here is a full release.Edit: Managed to play the game with lower resolution. Then it´s not crashing in the menus and runs fine. It seems to have a fundamental problem with 4K. Besides that I encountered several bugs within 10 Minutes of gameplay. Animals who are stuck or have an AI Error seem to be normal. Have a look for yourself, i found those animals who got stuck and I am using the vanilla version of the game without any tweaks. http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170473272/191B82F70B8DECECE8F02BD5E88E89C6B8F1EFBF/http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/80340029170472927/744691DE65F8235912E1489D4FE6D4A4EA41CB17/This, the broken menu, the tiny content and the simple but broken AI shouldn´t be in a full release like this. It´s not even branded as an early access title but has more bugs than most of them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game itself is absoloutely amazing and breathtaking, and if it worked correctly it would definitely be worth $30, however, it is so buggy that its almost impossible for alot of players to play.I have never in my history of playing almost exclusively early access games seen a game so buggy, and this game is considered full release. SLI isnt working properly, and going into 4k causes mem leaks and crashes, that and there isnt a way to go back to main menu from the game that i can see without exiting the game. There are tons of other bugs, wait till they iron them out before you purchase because this developer is kinda notorious for leaving things unfinished (looking at the hunter primal).

												Give it a chance, I actually refunded this after 2 hours but something drew me right back.I have played just about every hunting game since the mid 90's and out of all those games, this has the magic of some of the very best. (BTW - you can disable most HUD popups and the ""Deer icons"" are only tutorial, don't be like me and think it was a full time feature!)For an ""Arcadey theHunter"" - as many (included myself) branded it - it certainly does not feel like it when you dig deep. It is not a shooting gallery, dont expect deer to just wander past you - in some aspects its even more realistic than Classic.For example -- View distance is FINALLY increased meaning that looking into the distance is actually important now.- Night hunts - call them unethical all you want, but get out there with your headtorch under the stars, the moonlight glowing on the ground and the beautiful sounds of owls hooting in the distance makes it an unforgetable experience. I actually prefer to hunt during this time.- Animals actually have a more believable routine (Wild boar are rarely seen  out in the open during the day, only venturing out after dusk etc) You also have feeding spots and bedding areas which they return to.- Graphics - wow - honestly I cannot work out how some people have slated the graphics as merely ""OK"" because the visuals are simply mind blowing at 4k on ultra. It is so inviting you actually want to explore the (HUGE) map. Walking speed also feels more realistic and not just a geriatric shuffle.- The little things - bushes actually make noise now so it effects how you stalk your prey. The grass becomed flattened behind you and animals, leaving a very realistic looking path. An IN GAME mission journal. The majority of threatened animals can harm you if cornered. Animal tracks last longer than a few hours. The sounds are beautiful, the animations are fluid and there is ample map to explore and discover.One of the best things is the sense of progression this game gives you. You do not start with all the gear, you have to unlock it with ingame money and levelups so there is an actual goal to play towards. The downsides are - - Generic deer antlers - I can only hope the devs listen to the pleas of fans and change this.- Some optimization issues for some but they said from the start, this is a HIGH QUALITY game - do not expect older machines to max it out.It is far from pefect, needs a bit of polish and bug fixes but my god, its a fun game. Whine all you want about it ""not being a finished game"" - while it may not have the amount of animals or the sophisticated TruRACS system, its certainly giving me alot more enjoyment than classic ever did.

												**This Review has been Updated****Update: Since the update, I have noticed that the small animals(ie, rabbits and squirrels) are no longer wearing rain jackets, and thus no longer sound like they are running through empty bags of Doritos. However, when tracking a moose that I shot, I completely lost the blood trail randomly. I don't know if this is a new feature or what, but the moose circled around in the area of an old trail, and while I found plenty of tracks, I found no more blood trail which is key to finding a wounded animal and keeping on the right track. That could have been an issue on my end, I suppose, and I'll have to look into this a bit more in order to determine if this is some sort of bug. Also, it is obvious that the crouch-walking works better now in this new update, and you get spotted less frequently when you are crouched and moving. On the downside though, you walk painfully slower when traveling this way. But I suppose that's supposed to be realistic, so that's fair.**Is it worth buying at this point? That's for you to decide. There are both positives and negatives about the current state of this game, keep reading. Starting with the Positives about the game: The settings are great. From the visuals in the scenery, to the audio with raindrops and the wind blowing through the leaves, the background really is pretty stunning. You don't have a wide variety of animals to shoot at this point, but those that you can they look very well done. The animals also sound really good, and often behave like wild animals. If you don't get good shot placement, you can very much rely on having to track a wounded animal for some time until you can either finally put it down, or it eventually succumbs to it's injuries. The little stories in singleplayer and missions are also pretty neat. And on to the Negatives: Why do the squirrels and rabbits sound like they are wearing little little rainjackets when they run around? While the game animals sound fairly normal as they walk through the grass and brush, the smaller critters sound like they are wearing plastic as they romp about the trees and meadows. Nothing breaks the immersion as you're sighting in on a large buck as you suddenly hear a pair of squirrels wearing windsuits dashing about the boulder you've perched on to take your shot. And as you suddenly look around to see what is going on around you, your buck notices the movement and shoots off like a rocket into the safety of the forest as you silently curse the creators of these squirrels. Also, at random times, the game suddenly decides that it's done playing nice. And your leisurely stroll through the meadow as you search for a black bear takes a sudden turn as you notice that you are now walking in slow motion. So you switch for your tracker to a rifle so you can walk a bit faster for a bit, but soon you're still forced to a virtual crawl as your walk becomes visibly slower. And so you have to restart the game. Sometimes, you come across an animal that is stuck in some way. Sometimes it is stuck between a tree and a rock, for example. At other times, it's stuck in a loop, walking or running in a sort of circle. And so you fire a shot at the stuck animal. Sometimes you'll kill it. Sometimes you'll just scare it, and it will run faster even though it's still stuck. Now and again, it'll take one hit, but it won't kill it, even though it just runs faster and faster and as you shoot at it over and over again-at times you'll see the shot take effect and it stumbles to the ground-it'll get back up and refuse to die. And you'll have to restart the game because you're never going to kill it. Sometimes you'll shoot a stuck animal, and no matter how point-blank you shoot it, the bullets magically fail to hit their intended target. Other times you'll clearly and visibly hit the animal, and it'll eventually run off. But when you come up to find the blood trail, you'll see that there is no blood. Even though the animal clearly fell the ground and got back up to run away, there's no blood. You may have hit it three or four times, and there's no blood trail. And when you eventually give up, you suddenly notice that you don't see animal tracks anymore, and if you fire a shot at something, it magically misses(although it does expend ammo). Sometimes this can be fixed by fast traveling to an outpost. You might think that the negatives outweigh the positives. Or vice versa. And that's up to you decide. For me, even though the game is currently frustrating at it's present state, I still enjoy it. The visuals are well-done, the animal movements are excellent, etc. But it's also frustrating and a little buggy. The immersion breaks at points(especially when you or a small animal moves through the brush and grass), the game crawls at times, and you sometimes can't hit what your aiming at even if you could literally touch the animal you're shooting at. Would I recommend this game? Yes, with the caveats that this game is currently buggy, but I do believe that the developers will get it fixed. The makers of this game have done well with other games in the theHunter line, and there's no reason to think they won't get these problems fixed. For that reason, I do recommend this game.

												tl;dr  I like it, but it is a $30 USD Open Beta at the moment.The things that work in the game are good.  It feels a lot like theHunter Classic from several years back, but without subscription fees. That's the best thing about the game.  There's more here at launch than the Classic game had at launch, which is also a plus.The problem is that it is absolutely riddled with bugs, poor design decisions, and a lack of certain features which made the Classic game fun to play for so many years.  It easily could have used another 6 months to a year of development before release. Or at the very least, released it as an Early Access game, because that's essentially what it is at this point in time. The Good:  1. The hunting is great.  Aside from a few bugs and other minor annoyances.2. Graphics are really nice.  Easy to immerse yourself in the world. 3. No subscription fee. I've been waiting for a subscription-less Hunter ever since the Classic game released.4. No microtransactions or other real money purchases. All the weapons and equipment are able to be bought in game without having to pay real money for them.5. Xbox One controller support.  Seriously this is great. With as much walking and creeping around that you have to do, it's nice to just use the controller and sit back relaxed.  And you can still use the mouse to shoot if you want. I've been using the controller to move, and the mouse for precision shooting. 6. The game is self-contained. No more having to go to theHunter website to setup your hunt and launch. The Bad:1. Bugs. Bugs everywhere.  From sounds not being played, to hunting structures not allowing you to build them, to animals getting stuck in the scenery, it is absolutely riddled with bugs. 2. Progression system feels poorly designed.   It takes forever to acquire enough ""experience"" to unlock new weapons and gear.  13 hours into the release version, I'm level 9 and have unlocked 1 gun, a bullet type, and maybe a caller?  The perks and skills system could use a reworking as well.   Apparently at least one perk doesn't seem to work for anyone.3. No global leaderboards or competitions.  What's the point of harvesting a great trophy animal, if you can't see where it ranks compared to other people, or enter it into a competition? The competitions are one thing that really gave the Classic Hunter such longevity. 4. The missions.  One of the first missions you get is to ""photograph"" a deer for a woman's book.  I want to hunt, not take screenshots. Adding to the frustration is that it seems like you have to do this in a very specific area, and at a very specific distance from the deer. Apparently you get more photography missions later, that get even more specific.  Maybe this could have been more fun if they actually modeled the camera like a real world DSLR set up for wildlife shooting. Instead the game's camera is basically the HUD removed, and replaced with a grid. No zoom controls that I could see.  So basically your smart phone from 5 years ago had more features in the camera than this one.I'm pretty much ignoring the missions right now unless I accidentally trigger one.Could be Better:1. A lot of things could use a bit of rework or tweaking.  One thing I'd like to see added is more fast travel options. If I build a hunting stand somewhere, I'd like the option of fast traveling to it like you can do with the outposts. If the devs don't abandon the game, and continue working on it, it has a lot of potential.  I mostly like what is here now, and I could potentially spend a lot of time with this game.  It wouldn't take a lot to flip the thumbs down to a thumbs up. Mostly fix the glaring bugs and maybe tweak a few of the systems in game. That's not asking much.  I just have a hard time fully recommending the game in its current state.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok I dont normally write reviews but for this one I felt I had too based on others negative comments as I nearly didnt buy this game as a result of those negative reviews...If your like me and you always read reviews before buying a game and are normally put off by negative comments about system performance but accept that a new game will always have some bugs then this is aimed at you.I run an I7 6700K 16GB 980TI and have no issues running this game at max settings.The visuals and sounds of this game are simply great and the size of the open world is huge. If your worried about those saying you spend a lot of time walking about doing nothing, yes you will spend a lot of time walking around trying to find animals only to never find them as they see \ hear you coming before you see them and scare them off. Or you find the animal your tracking it sees you and then runs off... But isnt that the point... Its a hunting game its about tracking and not being seen, its about a slow methodical approach, its not supposed to be easy and if it was we would all moan and say its too easy and arcady...In summary I would say you need patience to play this game, practice to get better and yes a few bugs to be patched by the developer. But while your doing all that you will be walking through lush amazing enviroments thinking wow the grass and trees actually move with the wind in the right direction and I need to pick my path so I dont get heard stomping around unlike other games.As for bugs I have encountered three so far:(1) GAME DOESNT ALWAYS LET YOU LEAVE A MENU WITH ESC LIKE YOU SHOULD. For this I found choosing another menu topic and then hitting ESC works fine.(2) MAIN MAP GOES FUNKY OR DOES NOT START CENTERED ON YOU. For this I simply zoom out then back in again or exit and re-enter main map and it is fine then.(3) DIFFICULTING SWITCHING WEAPONS & ITEMS FROM STORAGE TO BACKPACK. By far the biggest bug I have found and only way to resolve is keep entering and exiting storage until it will let you select and drag an item to your back pack and only do one item at a time before exiting and coming back. THIS IS STILL NOT A GAME BREAKER.....			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An early game review:So i think most people reviewing this negatively are being way dramatic about the state of the game. It's a bit buggy but it's nothing that cant be fixed with a good few patches.This game is one of the most beautiful games out there right now, runs fine for me personally, quite well really.Points starting from bad to good:- Yeah there are bugs, for sure. Menu buggitude, people sayin bears are bugged a bit too. And whenever i would harvest an animal my game settings would get reset. Im hopeful these things can get fixed pretty easily tho. As far as stuck animals go, as a game developer, problems like this can be really difficult to solve and are common in a ton of games. I think they should maybe look into it but im not going to blame them too hard if i see the occasional stuck animal. i only encountered one stuck animal in my play time and it was just a dinky rabbit.Edit: After some more time i have noticed a few more stuck animals which is unfortunate but not game breaking really, id say youd end up seeing one stuck animal per 2 hours or so of gameplay. Some more bugs as well such as scope clipping and bugged animation on scope zoom, some fps drops wen tracking animals long distances using the phone thing, and game freezing occasionally, sometimes recovering other times not. - Some people talking about the game being too easy and too many animals but id like to know what game they were playing because for me, trying to get a good shot and then not being able to and spooking the animals and then having to track em down for like an hour without seeing anything,, i dont think the game was too overflowing with animals. However there are a lot more animal calls sometimes it seems, which i think is fine and turning off the audio visualzation is good idea as well.Edit - A little more detail on this: Sometimes there can definitely be quite a few animal calls, a lot more than were in theHunter classic. Personally i dont really have a problem with this as they are just calls, and they arent distracting if you have the vocal visualizations off. While running around you are likely to never actually see any of the animals calling unless you run into a field where there may be a few animals grazing (but this doesnt feel unrealistic to me at least) but it does hark on to my point about sound where animal calls are louder than they should be really. Maybe putting the calls on a seperate audio slider or something. Its also important to NOTE: if you hunt out an area and scare off animals its totally quiet out there. So in all, i still dont feel there are ""too many"" animals as the likelyhood of encountering one is not astronomically high or anything.- I've seen some people say its lacking content? But from what i can tell the maps are huuge and vary pretty good in the areas and there are a fair number of animals to hunt right now, as well as a fair amount of weaponry. The game is not like a full price AAA release, its half that in fact, and, if you were to compare it to theHunter classic, this game is a bargain. If you wanted to do any of the stuff in this game in classic youd be paying for a membership and paying real money like $5 per weapon. The game has plenty of content for $30 with more to come in dlcs. -This game however, does not have a lot of the features that classic has in terms of competitions and leaderboards and community. I think this is intentional and likely to stay that way. Both games serve a purpose, and the purpose of this game is not to be exactly like the last one, but a more standalone experience not tied down to microtransactions and a separate launcher with community stuff and accounts and all that jazz. This may turn some of the more hardcore hunters off, and if it does, then i dont think this game is for you.- Does not have free look to detach look direction from walk direction. That would be a veryyy nice thing to have and i dont know why it isnt in already.- Uses a progression tree in terms of weapon perks and various skills. This is a highly subjective way of doing it but i think it is a fine way to do it. I dont think its anything special and is highly debatable but i dont think it should be a turn off. It just allows for progression of the game and your character, which by the way, theres just about no character choice options... this easily seems like one of the most underdeveloped things. but eh.- Sound is very immersive and well realized. Ive seen some people complain about the sound being bad somehow but this is crazy talk if you ask me. Maybe im just not hardcore enough of a hunter to really understand but i think some people are just babies.Edit: while i still think sound is very good, some things ive noticed after more time are music cutting out randomly, bear calls being cut short, and sounds of russling and animal calls being a bit too loud.- A quick graphics review: The game is gorgeous. Hands down the best nature ive ever seen in a game. If i had to gripe about graphics at all as a hardcore graphics enthusiast, shadows are pretty blocky, but they can get away with this because there is a ton of foliage to break up the shadows so that you wont notice unless you reeallyyy look at them. Still a higher res shadow option could be nice, but i think they used resources freed by using lower quality shadows for more impactful features elsewhere. The clouds if you look at them too hard are obviously just moving textures in the sky but whatever really the game is about nature not clouds and they look pretty good when not viewed under scrutiny. Water reflections are a bit low res.. i know reflections can be intense but at least an option for some higher quality reflections would be nice. Also about reflections, and this can be an issue with water effects in a lot of games, around edges of objects where water is in the background there is a weird halo around them, not a super big deal but very noticable. No option for anti aliasing??? this is a weird one but i guess there is AA applied somewhere at least, maybe tied to quality setting, but not cool at any rate. That being said, i havent really had any issues with aliasing, its not a jag fest like some games are. And you would think this would be too with all the foliage. And don't even get me started on the foliage, its so dense and detailed and even reacts to animals and players to the point where animals leave paths through the grass as they walk, easily the best foliage ive ever seen in a game. Overall, Beautiful game.I think that covers most things.Conclusion:The game is pretty good for the price. A must have if you like walking simulation and hunting experiences.Perhaps hold off for a month or two until some of the more glaring bugs and finicky-ness is sorted out if that kind of thing bothers you.

												The Game is really cool and fun, im not sure if there is an option to put out your own blinds and feeders, it would be really awesome if there is an option to do so. THe graphics are great, the framrate has micro stuttes for me, but im getting constant 60 fps, ultra 1080p with my gtx 1070 and my i7 6700. I wish they would add a vehicle like a atv or utv to make getting around easy and fun. This is the most impresive hunting game i have ever played and really excited about the potential, these devs really know how to make a good sim hunting game. I would definetly recomened geting this game if you are at all interested in hunting/fishing, amaizing experience all around. This is my very early thoughts of the game as time goes on i will most likely write another, im new to ""The Hunter"" games i dindnt pick up the f2p classic because of the micro dlc, i love the one time pay.

												The Hunter was and is still the most realistic hunting sim with the release of Call of the Wild. You can start in one of the two gigantuous reserves, in the 2 hours I've played so far I've just seen a very small part of it. The whole game is about waiting for that right moment to take your shot and is very zen like to play overall, since you have such beautifull surroundings.I was really hyped when I saw the upgrade in the graphics compartment and even more important NO MORE LICENSES!!Where is this review coming from you wonder, well I used to play the original and really enjoyed it with many hundreds of hours. Don't be alarmed by all the negative reviews, since the game is still under development. The game is surely no arcade shooter do not be silly everyone, the ingame helpers are great for newer hunters and can be turned off accordingly under the gameplay menu.For 30 euros you cannot go wrong here, since you have full access to all the species and stuff you need to hunt them. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has a lot of bugs, needs serious polish, and feels like a beta.  That being said, this is the 1st decent hunting game released since theHunter, the market doesn't really have any competition.  Cabelas, hunting unlimited and games like that are too casual to be taken seriously.  This game has potential, its still fun even with all the bugs.  If your a nut for hunting games like I am this game is for you.  If you don't like hunting games, or like arcade hunting games, this isn't for you so don't buy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Incredible graphics and sound design along side some great gameplay features make this the best hunting game out there and a must-have for any real life(or not) hunter.I've played theHunter since 2009 so I was very hyped when they first announced this. I've only experienced one bug thus far and my game hasn't crashed yet.Definitely recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I so badly want to give this game a good review but in it's current state I can't.  At first everything was great, but the longer i've played, and then stepped into multiplayer, the amount of bugs, gamebreaking bugs is staggering.  Its almost as if the 90% of the development time went into making the game look pretty (and it does).For one, deer can very easily get stuck or spawn being stuck.  Out of the 12 deer I have found 4 have spawned into an object making them a free kill, and 2 have wandered into a wall or rock making an easy kill.  The animations are equally bad, there is many times where animals are doing their moving animation when they are standing completely still, it just looks really ... out of place when you see an animal moonwalking.  They can also be quite dumb and not even notice you shooting at them.When you enter the systems menu it says press ESC to quit but you can't, it doesnt work, you have to click on options again to re-enter options to escape.  On the main map the waypoint you can place down is invisible on your huntermate (and completely invisible in multiplayer to everyone else) and doesn't show up till your very close to it.  You can't exit back to the main menu (to join multi) you instead  have to completely quit the game (same with switching from multiplayer to single) ...Then into multiplayer where is when more bugs appeared.  One of my friends for literally no reason moves at slower then everyone else when we do the same thing (has nothing to do with weight, he is a starter character too).  You can't join friends game as you spawn under the world when you try to join from friends.  You can't unlock any locations or waypoints or outposts in another persons game (only the host can).  Sometimes there is large dysync issues between the animals.  The textures and animations for player models are all over the place its hilarious at times, one of the characters shoe textures are linked. Switching from bow to rifle causes your rifle to be unable to zoom in on your rifle so you have to relog to fix it, making it impossible to use your bow and rifle at the same time.Like I can go on and on, this is stuff that shouldn't even pass alpha yet it made it into release, its extremely troublesom that a company cares SO little about its product its willing to release it in this buggy and unfinished state so mass amount of people will return and downvote the game ... what the hell were you guys thinkingI will still play this game because I am enjoying it, but I am downvoting it because you should avoid this buggy mess till its fixed (and i'll change my review then)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over 40 hours on record. Still plenty of things to do.That's a good start for a review! :)So first of all, you need a pretty powerful machine to have this monster of a game run without crashes. I'm using an i7-7700 with a GeForce 1060 and 16 GB of Ram. Game crashed only once since I got it, which was after 6 hours of play and on patch 1.1, so a long time ago.The 2 reserves are amazingly detailed, and with patch 1.3, 4 and 5 the hunting part became more accessible. This feels great and immersive, and I have friends getting new computer equipment just to play this.Finding the outposts is one part of the game, which will get you on the road for quite some time. Outposts are still (unfortunately) the only way to fast travel, so to complete your missions, you will need them. Just finding one might get you more than 15+ minutes, especially without using cheat maps and going by all the lookout stations.The game, the animal tracking (dead rabbits to follow when going after coyotes since 1.5! Yeeah!), the shooting, rifles and bows, it's all good....Could use more animals to shoot...Ducks, Geese...Meh, even fishing could be cool in there...Enoy this version as much as possible, because I don't think the console version coming up has any chances to deliver.A good and solid 8 out of 10.

												Excellent hunting simulator... For the most part. Real hunting involves patience, and so does the hunting in theHunter: CotW. But that patience also has to be extended to the acquisition of all the gear, which requires a great deal of grinding to eventually access. Also, unfortunately, the game does have a few UI and menu bugs(like changing the FOV back to default after alt tabbing). But overall, I find it to be a relatively challenging and engaging hunting sim, with possibly the mosts realistic foliage I've ever seen, and it's always satisfying when you land that perfect vital shot into your quarry's heart. If you have patience, you will love this game. Otherwise, probably not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So in it's current state I can not recommend  theHunter: Call of the Wild™. Right now the game is a bug-ridden mess with terrible UI. The whole experience has a very early access feel to it.Other than that the graphics and the scenary are really pretty. But that shouldn't be the reason for a purchase.I say just wait for now and don't buy. Wait few weeks. Maybe by that time the game is going to be patched and some of the nasty game breaking bugs will be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
theHunter: Call of the WildGameplayIt needs to be out of the way first, theHunter: Call of the Wild is about hunting wildlife. If you are okay with that, then the game is going to be pretty much what you expected. I played the original Hunter quite a while back and I was not able to get into it for some reason. theHunter: Call of the Wild seems much more streamlined than the previous game which was pretty inviting for me as well as new player to the series. theHunter: Call of the Wild puts you in the boots of a Hunter in a huge open world with the prospect of hunting virtual wildlife. That is pretty much all the story that is present in the game, because even after the narrator telling you a few lines and giving you some quests, it is pretty vague. Do not go in expecting a brilliant narrative adventure out of this game. Now, how does the actual hunting holds up.For the most part, the hunting in theHunter: Call of the Wild is pretty solid. You get all kinds of tools at your disposal to hunt down the surprising less diverse wildlife. From noise maker to sprays to attract your prey towards a location and then putting a bullet through their lungs, that is the game. theHunter: Call of the Wild does falter in the skill tree it uses to unlock all these fancy tools and you really need to grind your way by murdering quite a lot of fauna.  This requires a lot of patience and time and might frustrate some players. You can unlock Far Cry 3 like towers which show you points of interests on that particular part of the map. The gun recoils are nice and feel quite good to use.Don’t expect to go in all bullet blazing though like a Call of Duty game. theHunter: Call of the Wild requires you to be patient and wait for the creature to be at a perfect position when you take the shot. The animal can even run away wounded and you will have to follow its blood trail to track and hunt it down. theHunter: Call of the Wild is at its best in these moments, I remember trailing a rare bear for some time following a blood trail it left and finally catching it a water body it came near to drink. It keeps you immersed in these moments and truly feels like something special. The wildlife is also very quick to react and they make the world a living breathing one. But in theHunter: Call of the Wild you’re basically like a god. It is nigh impossible for a creature to kill you unless you stand right in front of a bear. Even the fall damage from a high outpost isn’t enough to actually kill you. I felt bad for these poor creatures who were just waiting to be preyed upon. There is no food requirement, nothing that can force you to tense up. You can go hunting in the night and there will be literally no other danger. While there is plenty of wildlife to hunt, the diversity is pretty low. More often than not you will run into yet another bear or deer and it gets very repetitive after a while. You also have to walk a lot which is expected but it won’t please most of the audience. It is not helped by the fact that theHunter: Call of the Wild is extremely buggy. I can’t recall how many times a creature clipped through the trees, my bullets just whizzed past the animal’s lungs without hurting it and the constant crashes are enough the annoy anyone out of their wits. While the multiplayer works fine when playing with friends, it seems that this game is not really made for it. Too many hunters spoil a game and it is very much true here. VisualsVisually theHunter: Call of the Wild looks stunning. From the god rays of the sun to the gentle breeze flowing through the forest, it is one of the prettiest games I’ve played. The animal models are also really stunning and the game just takes your breath away quite some times with the beautiful vistas it presents. There is a fair amount of visual pop in and there are some really hilarious visual glitches which might break your immersion sometimes but overall it is pretty beautiful. What is a letdown though are the human models in multiplayer. They look like someone put a bunch of dolls in a jungle and that does help the game.SoundExcellent. From the animals sounds to just the rain pattering on the leaves, everything is done beautifully. The only trouble is when you walk through a water body which is when your shoes make more sounds than a bear who is ready to mate. But overall it has an excellent sound package.OverallI can’t help but like theHunter: Call of the Wild. It has its problems and it does certainly feel like an early access game but if you want a proper hunting game, theHunter: Call of the Wild should be your choice. It needs some polish and more content but as it stands, it is a solid hunting game which sports outstanding visuals and excellent sound design. It is not for everyone though and you should keep that in mind if you are purchasing this game.

												It has the most beautiful forest I have seen in a game yet.Multiplayer works pretty well (2 players).Walking trough the forest feels AMAZING. Not only the graphics, lightning and weather effects but also the bushes trees and grass, which react to your and the animals movement. Hell, I could play this game just walking around in the beatiful environment. In high grass you can clearly see where you or animals have traveled, as a path will be visible. The sounds of the animals are spot on as well. If you turn off all the help such as highlighting of spotted animals or trails, the immersion is pretty good. However, there are some bugs, for example the attacking animation of european bisons seems to be a bit broken. Some time the multiplayer might crash as well (I had one akward moment where i coulden't see any more prey or animals downed by the other player but bloodtains and stuff were visible, or one time where the headlight went on and i coulden't switch it off). And in multiplayer its seems like only the host can discover places and build stuff. They will be marked for the other player in his session but he cant get XP from them or fast travel to newly disovered huts, only when he visits those locations in his self hosted games he can that.Still, the immersion, the graphics and the gameplay feel spot on and I can only recoomend this games to players who enjoy the tension of searching for a target and don't mind spending much time walking in a beautiful virtual environment.Sure there are some bugs but restarting the game always helps and within the 14 h playtime on clock they diden't happen that frequently (maybe 4 restarts needed and 1 crash). Which I can forgive as they still continue working on the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is in BETA status atm. I would like to give a neutral rating if that would be possible. I had and have fun with the game, but there are tons of bugs and problems atm. On the other side this game has so much potential. If u like the Hunter and hunting aka slow paced gameplay overall and have a good pc and can live with a not perfect game you can buy it, especially its not expensive. The Devs can turn this into a Hunter Primal 2.0 Fail Game or they can make the best Hunting game out there. Lets see and hope the second thing happens. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've refunded the game for now, I will repurchase it once the issues I currently have with it are addressed.- No bullet entry/exit wounds ""I'm speaking of dynamic decals"".- Unrealistic bullet penetration, bullets cannot even penetrate the neck of a small deer not mentioning torso shots.- No bullet impacts on any material, also known as splash ""useful for seeing how far you missed your target"".- Performance isn't the greatest 55 fps average on a gtx 980ti msi 6g OC edition and overclocked i5 to 4.2ghz.- Cannot get points for shooting rabbit/birds with shotguns. - No ability to zero your rifle.- Animals do not seem to interact with each other.- Animal AI bugs out making animals run in circles. - Automatic bolt cycling ""It should be set so you have to manually manipulate the bolt to cycle the action"".- Tracking on the map is very buggy. - Animals are capable of running very far distances even though they are seriously wounded and catch some amazing speeds considering their condition.- No ability to change the walking speed to aid in sneaking ""developers check out the system escape from tarkov have implemented into their game, it would be IDEAL for this game, no seriously check it out"".Now to the things I do like about the game.- Amazing audio.- The graphics are very very nice indeed however they start to lack at a distance and leave a lot to be desired in contrast to the up close visuals, up close is truly gorgeous besides the floating rocks.- A decent selection of weapons but something that should be expanded upon.- The weapons feel very nice compared to thehunter: primal.

												Its very ovious now why so few was allowed to beta this game.  But as it goes with these companies is... Why have a Beta and release the game with nothing done to the bugs that was reported?? How is it... You can be walking around hunting and all of a sudden your Rifle just leaves your inventory?? Sound quits for no reason.  Game loads with no sound. Game loads but forgets the Resolution you had set for the game.The folks whom bought the game here on Steam have the option to get a refund before 2 hours played. Others whom got it from Amazon are stuck with a half full glass of dirty water. approached as a cash grab and hope it all gets forgotten.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I usually don't do reviews however, I seen some of the reviews and decided that I should give my input. As an original ""The Hunter"" player I had high hope's for the game. I wasn't disappointed. Overall I think they have some issues to work out but I am having alot of fun with the game. I only have a little over an hour and a half into but I'm having fun.I seen a review about the amount of animal spawns and in which case they are correct...Theres ALOT of animals to start off with. HOWEVER, if you read through the tutorial you will read that the more you hunt the more pressure you start putting on areas. Therefore, hunting will get more difficult as you play.The only bug I have noticed is sometimes when killing bears they don't like to ""die"" they just stand straight up untill you ""trophy"" them. I'm sure theres lots of fixes and updates to come...I can't wait to see what's out there! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												with a price tag on this game, i cant recommend it as it is now. its is wayyyyyy ""early access"".problems i have been facing in the 8 hours i have played:1)Randomly, after opening and closing the map everything becomes sluggish and wont return to normal unless i pull out the GPS and put it away, not everytime, but still. also, you have the option to place a marker on the GPS map, but nowhere on your HUD does it display the marker, not on your compas or on your gps handheld, so everytime you want to make sure you are still heading in the right direction, you have to open the full page map and check. this is why the sluggish bug is annoying, because you are constantly opening and closing the map.2) invincible animals. I have put multiple rounds into multiples animals and they wont die. I mean, 6+ shots into the vital region of a moose with no effect. a straight up vital shot on a bear, it charged me, stopped and sat down after clawing me, shot it in the head (not joking) and it ran off and procceded to waste over 45 minutes scouting a blood trail until giving up. this is beyond frustrating. I do not know how the mechanics work of an animals health and vital regions, but they are clearly broken. a white tail deer cant be gut shoted 4 times and simply walk it off.3) killed animals dissapear before i can claim them. I have had multiple times were i succesfully dropped a target at a great distance and it took me so long to walk to where i shot it it wasnt there. mutliple times. kill a deer, bear, moose, elk.... spend over 30 minutes REAL TIME walking to it (was on other side of massive lake) for it to not be there.4) weather makes no sense, had a thunder storm with clear skies. constant fog off on all day. rain with clear skies. yes hunting season (fall) can have crazy weather, but not every damn day is a storm of the ages. tune it back a bit please, or give us the option to turn off weather effects5) store inventory is weird and buggy. no notification of a transcation. just asks ""are you sure"" gives yes or no option, but the yes or no option stays up if you click yes and nothing tells you a purchase was made.6) there are still mechanics in this game from when it was the free-to-play. you can rest at a cabin to fast forward time, it has a cooldown if you use it often, but has option to spend cash to override it, didnt remove any of my game currency when i used it, so i think its still left over from f2p. this might also be why the marketplace is all goofy, still havent transitioned over from their microtransactions.7) some of the ""immortal"" animals"" show back up dead after a fast travel. but its beyond annoying. a huge part of the game is tracking, when you claim an animal it removes all the tracks and blood spots of that animal. but witht eh above problems it makes tracking a shot animal impossible. you have an entire traits tree you can invest in for it, but with no animals dying when shot, or disappearing, it leaves massive amounts of previous tracks and blood trails that constaly overlap fresh game trails, ruining the game.8) guns haveing confusing stats. i hunt, so i have some knowledge about calibers and which you would use for what, but i doubt everyone who buys this game does, and the stats for rifles dont really have a ""firepower"" category for the less gun savy people. or atleast a ""recommended use for the following animals: x,y,z"". and with how grindy this game is to unlock and purchase guns, it sort of needs that to avoid wasted purchases and just user friendly UI9) all animals are the same model, there are no ""big"" or ""small"" bucks, all look like monsters until you go and claim them and see the points givent. this is a hunting game, there should be spikes and two pointers and all that.at the end of it, id play the eff out of this game if where fully complete, but is far from it. i have 8 hours logged, and about 5-6 of those hours are tracking down blood trails of immortal deer or hiking to dead ones that aren't there. ultimately save your money and see if it comes on sale for a summer or winter steam sale, because they have months of patches they need to do before its ok to play.

												This is the most beautiful game I have played in some time. I would say that the game is quite modestly priced for what it provides, but it is clearly a hunting experience more than a hunting game - so it's not going to be a game for everyone.Headshots at low calibre ""bug""Most of the negative reviews I see claim ""bugs"" for what is actually how ballistics work in the real world. Example: lower calibre headshots will often not kill an animal. Many of the animals use their heads for fighting for goodness sake! I have (in real life) shot goats in the head and have the animal up and leave. The skull on many animals is very thick and therefore you're aiming for the heart/lungs.Negatives:- The Skill/Perk/XP/Points system is insane. Obviously, this is a leftover from the game having P2W/F2P mechanics which I am glad they dropped. But it's left us with a pretty terrible and confusing system that is incredibly convoluted. It doesn't rise to the point of a negative reivew, but it's close for me.- Multiplayer is a little buggy at times. Not overly so, and it's been acknowledged by the devs and they're clearlying targeting patches to this. It's still very playable and enjoyable.- The range of weapons available is pretty low.- The amount of equipment available to upgrade you weapons was much lower than I was expecting. While some of this would be quite ""game-y"", I was expecting being able to customize your weapons and equipment more according to how you wanted to play.Positives:+ The game is the most beautiful game I have played a in a long time, hands down. They're using dynamic color grading, volumetric lights, dynamic shadows... I mean just everything and the results are superb!+ The map(s) are staggering in their scale and attention to detail. They're hand made and they are huge. Much bigger than ArmA.+ The performance of the game on a high-end PC is excellent. Don't expect to run at ULTRA on current gen hardware, and don't be mad about that! The game is made in such a way that it's going to grow with hardware and that's great.+ The pacing of the game is really superb. It strikes an excellent balance between requiring patience and keeping something happening to the player.+ Post kill review screen. You see the pose, entry, and damage modelling for what you killed. Absolutely amazing and makes your kill ""story"" fantastic.+ Tracking is exciting and the classic ""easy to do hard to master"". This is a well designed mechanic that leads to excellent pacing.ConclusionIf you are looking for an arcade game, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a hunting game this is a fantastic find. Even better with friends! It's modest price is worth is alone for how beautiful the terrain is to explore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[Edited 20/02/2017 1711hrs]I'm not usually inclined to write a review but i feel i ought to for this game, i will do my best to keep this updated as time goes on.For those of you that have played thehunter classic i wouldn't recommend it, for those of you that havn't played thehunter classic i still wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend, there are far too many things that the classic has or did better that dont exist in this new release to make it worth buying. A visual representation of where my view on this game is at the moment. I don't recommend  | I recommend[--------------------------//-|--------------------------]Pros:- Jumping! brilliant feature! Having the ability to jump up onto rocks above open terrain, go prone and wait for unsuspecting prey is a brilliant feature, personally i much prefer looking at terrain for firing positions than using the pre determined structures.- Not having to use your Huntermate to track animals, although it does aid you with an easy to follow cone of direction, you can quite happily walk with your rifle in your hands and track animals which helps dramatically in reducing the time to take the shot, nothing worse than cresting dead ground to find the animal standing mere metres away, with only your phone in your hand.- Having Need zones on the map - whether it be drinking, sleeping  or eating, you are given a time period in which animals of that type will use these need zones,which helps dramatically at ambushing prey and also giving them a less random feel, they live somewhat structured lives.- A few different ammo types per weapon, allows you to pick and choose which type of arrow or round you would prefer to use, Softpoint or Polymer.- Easy to see and understand unlockable skills, this gives an RPG feel to the game as you feel you are progressing toward something, it also gives you the choice in which areas you would like to progress, whether it be stalking or ambushing, and perks for the type of weapons you use most.- Vast expanse of land to hunt on, this game truly does feel vast with two large reserves to hunt on, both with different landscapes.- The sheer amount of animals on each reserve is staggering and i doubt you have to go particular far in any direction from any position in order to find them wandering around.- Animals regularly herd together, the most i've seen so far was about 30 odd whitetails wandering together at the foot of a valley, it truly was a sight to see.- Hunting animals in the same area means animals will start to avoid that area until it has ""cooled down"", animals with their skittish nature will avoid areas in which they feel threatened, you will still see animals in these areas just less of them, and the more you hunt in the same spot the less animals will wander into it.- When walking through particular thick vegetation/trees you hear the sound of your nylon jacket, which is incredibly immersive, however rabbits running through the same vegetation appear the make the same noise, i didnt know rabbits were made of nylon (i will admit that after several years of neglecting ear defense this may just be that my hearing is shot and that the two sounds appear to me as the same sound)- There is a guide available by Daniel which shows you how to make your game less blurry and sharper, im enjoying the game more now that i have wiped the slober out of my eyes.- No microtransactions - probably the biggest selling point of this game.- Heart rate and stances effecting weapon sway, this prevents you from being able to run and gun accurately (not that you would neccesarily want to but a good game mechanic to have)- When in the prone position grass and foliage infront of you inhibits sight picture on target, personally i love this, it requires you to either crawl forward to flatten the grass then crawl back in order to optomise your firing postion, or move to a spot where grass wont effect your sight. - The ability to turn off tutorials / mission system / multiplayer nametags / downed animal highlight / spotting outline / audio clue visualization / spatial tracking cone / Points of interest / need zone icons / track effects. Turning everything off gives you the ability to hunt with your own hearing and sight.- Animals leave ""channels"" in long grass and brush, this helps when stalking or chasing down a wounded animal as an almost perfect trail is left behind.Cons:- Graphics, the graphics are OK but are incredibly hard to run for those with dated PCs, i would go as far to say it is heavily unoptimised. Even with the ability to max any modern released game you will be pushing 30 - 60 FPS with medium/high settings in which the foliage will look less than realistic.- The horrible grind to unlock weapons/lures/etc in the shops - you have to harvest an outrageous amount of animals in order to unlock even the most simple lures or weapon of choice, i feel you should be able to buy any of the kit from get go.- Animals very rarily spook, you can shoot and harvest one only to walk a short distance and repeat, gunshots/running for the most part dont have a very large spook radius.- Fast traveling is virtually non existent which is a pain as you have to take time to travel to need zones or particular favourite spots, the ability to put down tents in TheHunter classic sorted this problem.- No ability to errect your own structures, such as tree stands, 360 stands, ground hides etc, the fact that TheHunter classic has this feature yet the new edition doesn't is a real shame, it feels like a real step backwards.- By Comparison to TheHunter classic there is very little equipment/weapons/lures available, which i hope with potential future DLC will be expanded upon, again a step backwards.- The game states that clothes do not have any effect on whether animals can detect you, this again is a feature that is included in theHunter classic with the addition of Ghillie suits, 3D sneaky clothing etc.- The bugs although not game destroying are rather annoying and with some fairly simple bugs i am astounded that this game was released with them, and that after days after release they still persist is mind boggling.- According to the games sound indicator, you give the same amount of sound crawling slowly as you do running.- No ability to range your rifle to anything other than the pre determined 100m.Overall i feel this game is headed in the right direction but as it currently stands lacks some pretty major components of a hunter game, i feel a mixture between this and TheHunter Classic would be ideal, bring back some of those core gameplay elements whilst also bringing in better optimisation and bringing the grind feeling down to a nice enjoyable level and giving the player more freedom on what to hunt from the get go.Having said all that i still feel a burning urge to make this review even longer and do a side by side comparison of the two games which would show you just many features/gameplay aspects have been removed for the sake of improving the graphics, there are so many!

												I absolutely LOVE this game, the graphics, sounds, day-night cycle, weather system, ballistics, animal behaiviour, are very well made. yes, it has some post-launch bugs, but even the big AAA titles have those and getting day 1 patches so thats no reason to bash this game. In my opinion this game is a hidden gem, that with a few patches will become the best hunting sim ever, i already have 20+ hours of gameplay, and i loved every single minute of it, even with the afferent bugs.

												This game is great fun, plays just like theHunter classic. I haven't had any issues with crashes like most others are complaining about, but then again im not playing on a potato.There are quite a few bugs here and there but nothing they can't patch pretty quickly.The only issue i have is the ammount of animals on the Lake map is way too high, im getting warning calls left right and center and im not even moving. I feel like the sound element to it or sight is not working as intended.But in all the game is amazing, looks amazing and runs amazingly.P.s who the hell done the UI design lol? an apprentice?EDIT: They have fixed quite a lot of bugs now with the latest 1.1 Patch. So that's something! Like i said above, these other issues are going to be seen too fast.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, before I get into this, for some unknown reason it is showing myself as having far less time than that I have clocked on on AMD Raptr.... I have tons more hours and have been playing a fair bit!So let us dive in by starting with the basics!Graphics: The graphics off this game are amazing! Seriously they are so good that you can only wish you can play on max to truely enjoy the game for what it really offers, thankfully I can so on this basis I would say the graphics alone are 9.5 out of 10 because they are that good!Audio: The guns sound good, the animal noises are good, rain, thunder, wind all are good but there are problems.  Example, you can hear the rain hammering down when walking but turn around and no rain sound at all, face forward and raining.. It's spinning the mouse to get different sounds which is amusing but a bad bug from my point of view, so I would say here 7 out of 10!Controls: The controls are simple to get used too, but the menu system controlling is horrible and buggy I found, the same as my wife and close friend.  Controlling through the menu is buggy and glitch as hell but if you are rating the walking, moving, gun, swapping etc, it's spot on so I would say 7 out of 10!Gameplay and everything esle:  Now the game! Yes, this game has it's fair share of bugs and problems.  Some are more problematic than others, while some are just pure annoying!Right now as I write this review, if you start a solo game and want to change to multiplayer, you have to physcially close the game down and reopen it and select multiplayer... The same the other way around! Once in a game there is no backing out to the main screen, silly idea!Walking and the level of detail though in this game is amazing.  The grass moves when you go through it, the same as tree's and the grass leaves an imprint on the path you have followed.  Seriously the level of detail is amazing!There are two worlds and not enough animals I found! One German world (Which my wife and I with a friend found this world to be the prettiest and hardest to do) and an American world which seems bland but both worlds seem to have barely any animals in them... I think if I remember correctly there are 12 animals in total in the game and it is 6 per world, which sucks.  The worlds on the other hand are MASSIVE.  It takes a long time to walk around and often get bored a little walking and side tracking to look for fun stuff.  You can fast travel to a safe house if you got them unlocked, but that is ONLY once you unlocked it.There are no vehicles in the game which sucks because they would be amazing to have I feel like many others and many others not, but then it is your choice if you wanted to use them!This is a slow paced game, so no run and gun.  Expect to take a long time, going slow (Which is often frustrating for me at times because it feels so slow I need to sprint)Would I recommend this game? If you are a big fan of hunting games and want something that is going to draw you in and keep you focused and enjoy a slow pace simulation style game then this is the game for you!I am swinging towards a 78% yes because it is unique and offers a fun amount of hours in the game! It is also multiplayer which is a lot more fun as we know with others.  Just the bugs are slightly annoying right now, no vehicles and limited hunting is a little off putting, otherwise good job!

												Lovely game, stunning graphics.Please do understand i love the game, i will keep playing but this should not have been released yet.We should be spammed with hot patches , but the patches are far betweenFull of gamebreaking bugs.- Tracks disappear when there is to many of them.- You can not save the game where you at, so it you have to walk to area where you was hunting again if you restart the game. (pitcha a tent and sleep trough the night/saving the game would be nice)-It did not run stable on my high end gaming machine, on my server i do get the +60 FPS in Ultra stable.-Some menu items doent stick and switch back to a previous or the default value,-Animals get stuck in trees, edge of the water or in some deadend parts of the map.Beside those there some annoying glitches and things.-Sometimes your scope glitches.-Sometimes your stuck in the ground comming out of the map (a jump fixes that) -You can buy one scope and fit it on multiple guns.-Animals sometimes act like idiots, just skipping about or not moving at all when a gun is fired near them.Some stuff also need work or clarification.-I spend more then 14 hours gametime to get a picture of two bears-The numbers for the gun and ammo specs do not make any sense to me.-An ingame tutorial would be much appreciated-Most hunting stands and blinds are in spots that dont make sense, some look out on a big tree or a rock. If you would go trough the trouble putting one up you make sure you have a premium unrestricted view.-The animals should interact more. I have seen a bear sitting and a dear bumped into him but he did not care at all.And last but not least;IT FLIPPING RAINS TO MUCH.This is a game, a single player game, let us choose if we want it to rain or not.It rains in real life, it is depressing, why would i durring my game time have it rain too?It is not even a realistic weather pattren, it flipping rains for 45 mitutes in an hour.If it would rain for a whole day in 1 in 15 game days it would be fine but how  it is done now is ridiculous.My faith in the ""no rain"" menu button that actualy sticks in a future patch is extreme high.Ofcourse it all going to be fixed and all will be honky donkey, but this should be tested before they relased the game.I do not want to participated in a payed betatest games anymore, this  game almost feels like a beta on the moment.Normaly i would have waited or not even bothered to write a review, but the review and the tumbs down maybe urges the Devs to put in some hours to fix the urgent things and keep us, the customers, informed. (known buglist, ATE for patches, much more official info on the proggress}/rant  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry bit of a long one The Hunter call of the wild is one of the most stunning games graphical I have seen  in a long time the views are stunning which gives the game a real feel I have spent a long time just walking around and soaking in the amazing views form the lookout points and just watching the day go by sad I know but hay paid my money my game to play.The gun physics are good not being a hunter in real life and not having any time around real firearms can’t honestly say what a real rifle should do whist crouching behind a tree trying to shoot a moose at 150m but for a game they feel nice the rifle recoil seem fair and the bullet travel seems fair what has to be remembered is that this is not a FPS this is a hunting game so no 360 no scopes here the game is trying to simulate a real hunting feel (as stated never hunted so what do I know lol)The animals look real nice even though their behaviour is some time is not realistic never seen a deer walk round in circles four times but on a whole they seem to do as they should solo walks and group feeding and resting Now down to the pros and consProsGraphicsThese are amazing great textures on the animals the map is first class the grass bends beneath you and the animals Weather The sunny days look great with the sun shafts coming though trees and structures, the rain affects look amazing and the thunder sounds kudos to the sound engineers AnimalsThe animals are modelled and animated to a level which cannot really be complained about the behaviour of each species is slightly different every animal will give a warning call just to let you know you are getting to close but the red fox will be gone before you can even see it the bison on  the other hand will stand they ground for a little longer and may even turn the tables on you with you get them cornered Equipment They is a good selection of weapons in the game ranging from rifles to bows you start off with a single rifle for free and the stock ammo is free to buy the other weapons unlock on a rifle score points system the news guns are expensive which depending on your view is a good or bad thing my view is that this is a good thing as this makes you weigh up the options whilst buying new equipment thing like new calls will bring in small less value targets but with the numbers you can harvest will bring your money back up but this will is countered by the problem that hitting larger targets with a smaller calibre weapon will mean you have to track a wounded animal further cutting down on the number of harvests on each visit Cons Weather It rains a lot in this game be this just that the sound engineer had to spend days getting rain and thunders sounds so they put a lot in to make in worth their while I don’t know but it just seem to  rain all the time Animals I have seen on a few sessions animals getting stuck on trees and bushes I know people will say easy kill but in a game that is so amazing to look at a black bear doing the running man at a tree breaks the immersion Other Just a couple of things that made me scratch my head when I saw that they we not in the game at release and sorry to the devs if these are been implemented after this review (as if they read this lol) track ir not supported this was supported in the last the hunter title but has been replaced not to much of a problem as this do’s not really affected the game play but would be nice to have the ability to look around whilst walking as in real life, also the trophy shot has gone which was a bit of a surprise as the photo with your kill is a big part of hunter sharing with friends and other hunters a like I have seen an option on the main menu for a gallery which i have to hope means that it will make a return in a later patch My view The hunter call of the wild is the stepping stone from the hunter we all wanted this is not a game for people that are wanting to just walk in to a field and shoot 15 moose and walk away With the success of the hunter series so far this game has the potential to have the same success and in 8 years time have a still booming fan base  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is glitchy, buggy as heck, continuous frame drops and I have a newer Graphics card and system so that isnt the issue. The sound clips out where either its too loud or all togther you cannot hear any sounds in the game for a bit such as gun shots or animal noises or even the environment, and all together it just was not what was expected which was a major let down. It was upsetting as I wanted to get by and just say ♥♥♥♥ it to the fact that the frame drops happened occasionally and the sound wasn't the greatest but not the worst just more of an annoyance. But when I could not harvest my kills from the obnoxious plethora of animals that would just be stuck running in the same spot or not responding at all, It made it feel unplayable. I had looked forward to this game very much as I was a fan of the orignial TheHunter but this was a major let down and in no way an exeperience like its predecesor. Sadly I would not recommend this game as I thought I would have. 4/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The hunter call of the wild is a beautiful game. As you walk, you cant just stop looking at your surroundings. Not just for animals, but just to look at the beutiful of the world. This game is so immersive! There are time my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest when you see a big buck or an elk. But with every game there are some drawbacks. One I think the progressive system is realy slow. This can be good or bad. For right now it is ok for the lack of content but when the game starts getting more content it may cause an issue. For gamers who can only paly for an hour or two will have some problems getting all the good stuff. Also the lack of content, its not bad because maby you always stick one gun or weapon and you might never want a new one. The content of animals certainly is not he issue nor the world you can exsplore. Its the weapon chocie. Not as big as the hunter classic which disappoints me but maby soon we will get more. Finaly, bugs. Usually bugs work in your favor. There is no game breaking bugs and also the game runs well. I hope this review helped you decide if you want to become a hunter in The hunter call of the wild. Also this is a must have for people who love hunting games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my second edit of this review, this time I'm going to be bit more in-depth.The game is well worth the $30 price tag. The game is gorgeous and contains 2 massive, interesting, and varied hunting reserves. I have yet to even explore more than 25% of each reserve.In my opinion the game has enough weapons for now, I've yet to use anything other than the starter rifle. The ammunition prices could be a bit more modest but I suppose it does encourage you to conserve ammo and take safe shots.The game still has a few AI bugs and UI problems here and there but after today's (3/3/2017) patch, I haven't experienced any crashes and have had more success in-game as a result of the sneaking fix. This game is relaxing, even if you don't enjoy hunting in real life (I don't) this game is still very enjoyable. Take a break from hunting and go out and explore for some artifacts, lookout points, and lore points.A few things I would like to see in the game:-Portable Campsites - Pack a tent for a mobile outpost (does not have to contain shop)-Tree Stands-Jonboats or canoes for navigating the rivers, lakes, and ponds of the world.-Fishing-Able to complete missions and unlock outposts/lookout points in multiplayer.See you on the trails!

												I must say its a great game, best hunting simulator I have ever played. People are moaning that its got its bugs and the developers are working on that as they are bringing out patches quite often to fix this which I dont mind. Compared to the classic 'TheHunter' its a very big step up, much better game play and NO RETRICTIONs on the animals which you can kill. Some people may get frusted if they have never played a hunting game like this because if you run everywhere and keep calling the deers they will just run away, to those people I do say pace yourself and leave the calls to every 4-5 in game minutes for calls and before you know it you will turn around and have a whole load of deer surrounding you, I wish I was joking but  its happened to me multiple times now. TLDR yeah it may be buggy but its a damn good game. Buy it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game where genuinely there are some beautiful scenes, but patience and understanding mechanics are required. In this case, hunting expierence helps too.But don't not buy this game if you have never hunted. It is a beautiful game in itself. I find myself more looking at nature and enjoying the beauty of this game more than aiming and shooting at something. But then it can be difficult to get your target in your sights. But from my expierence in the woods, that's what I am used to.After putting a few hours into The Hunter: Call of the Wild, I enjoy it. I plan to put more time into it over the years. Visually it is a very beautiful game. If running around looking for the 360 no scope is your thing pass on this game, but if you are looking for a peaceful tranquil game where you can enjoy the simulated nature found inside this game give it a shot.

												Short Review: The best hunting game I've ever played. It does have various bugs that do cause minor inconvenience at times. I simply haven't run into any problems that won't be fixed in a reasonable time frame. I can't play this game without stopping to appreciate the beautiful world they've created. I thoroughly enjoy the shooting mechanics in place for this game. I'd recommend this game to anyone who can appreciate a calm/casual hunting game with a decent amount of shooting mechanic depth. It's got plenty of content and land to explore. If you don't mind walking long distances and slow crouching for some period of time, you'll find this game to be quite relaxing! I expect myself to play a decent amount of this game before I get my fill!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												  i miss playing cabela's big game hunter (2002) on the ps2.  This game needs a lot of work and i really hope it does get fixed because its beautiful and mulitplayer will be fun. But all i saw was a deer running beside a bear and then they both get stuck on a tree and the deer takes 7 shots to kill then i kill the bear, then you get xp for both kills. it's poachjing not hunting :D. then after that I was trying to creep up on a elk but it saw me and ran away but it ran to a cliff and fell off and died which was pretty funny but then i jumped off the cliff as well and only lost 25 HP -.- then collected the animal turned around and saw a deer running away from me.  you run into animals way too fast and i even turned off all the hints and tracking stuff so i could be relying on my calls and sent but i still found animals no problem. I just think if they added that you have to buy tags for the animal you want and fix the AI making them not get stuck on♥♥♥♥♥♥and spread them out it will be a great game but for now i say wait			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game had high promise but they have unfortunately decided not to fix any of the bugs from the Beta session several months ago and don't really make any indication that they ever intend too.In addition, there is still no ultra-widescreen support for this game which is unbelievable in 2017, multiple crashing issues and poor performance overall. Alpha release at its best... I would reccommend waiting until they put forth at least some indication that they intend on working on these issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												[[Edited for typos]]Disappointing and confusing.Great audio and looks gorgeous but the menus were a bit broken (Esc to exit does nothing) and forgot my settings every few minutes. I couldn't reliably reproduce this, it just happened occasionally.Whilst I understand the hearing capabilities of my prey, the Sound Meter at the bottom right suggests that crawling prone through soft(!) grass makes the same amount of noise as running and jumping around in the water or dry underbrush, with a few patches of grass as exception.Crouching makes the same noise level according to the meter, regardless of surface. I think we may be missing a 'creep' pace option, tippytoe style.Gun level mechanic from the last game was better, I dislike the level gated firearms and items (more on that in a sec) and currently I'm not sure what my character is even doing on a hunting range when he messes up his reloads, wasting valuable time. Bit odd.I can't fathom why I need to be level 33(? going off of memory here) in order to purchase wind direction detector spray when the compass automatically shows wind direction /and/ there's a perk for it already.The visiblity icon thing was neat, I suppose.I think I'll stick with TheHunter Classic.

												I bought this hoping it would be The Hunter 2. It's more like The Hunter Lite. It's a shooting gallery with pretty graphics. The difficult hunts that made the original so appealing are replaced with animals everywhere with no sense of self preservation. They call constantly and let you walk right up to them before they run.. And they even call several times specifically to warn you that they are about to run. So you can just run around at a full sprint and wait for the warning calls then stop and shoot them. Often times a shot doesn't even spook near by animals so you can lay waste to entire herds in a short time. The leveling grind also promotes this style of gameplay, needing to both earn ridiculous amounts of cash to buy new equipment as well as needing a ton of XP to unlock the ability to even purchase it. On the plus side its pretty, the landscapes are massive, the draw distance has nearly doubled and the shooting feels a lot better than classic. The game has a lot of potential but this isn't early access, this is a full release and they have no obligation to change anything. This combined with the history of Primal leaves one with doubts about the future of this title. Hopeful doubts, but doubts nonetheless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just hit 84 hours, and I think it's time to stop.This game looks incredible, I've found myself taking tons of screenshots, especially for kills I was proud of. Let me be clear here, I don't like hunting, I don't agree with hunting, but this game is SO good that I've put 84 hours into it. The positives outnumber the negatives, but unfortunately the game has one whopping failure. So the game itself looks incredible, I've found myself reminiscing about holidays I've been on due to the realism and immersivety. The sounds fit in well with the setting (even if a few things could be worked on) The maps are huge and have some incredible points of interest that have clearly had a lot of time spent on them. The animals are difficult to hunt and you have to be mindful of many different ways in which you play in order to stalk an animal and get up and close. This is great! Going from scaring everything off in the vicinity to being able to get within 20m of a deer feels like great progress. The guns seem fairly priced, the missions tell you stories that are pretty interesting. You can choose whether or not you want to do a mission - you'd probably spend a good 50 hours walking round and exploring if killing isn't your thing. The game really is incredible. However, 84 hours in I'm here typing a review for a game that I don't recommend. So let me explain. About 20 hours into the game a friend asked me if it was worth buying, and I told them absolutely. 5 minutes later, my game crashes. My entire system crashes and I have to restart my PC manually. Frustrating, a waste of ammo and time, but no big deal. I reload the game, 5 minutes later, it crashes again. I get the frozen screen, sound loop, I can't alt-f4, I can't Ctrl-alt-delete. Again, I have to manually restart my computer. Turns out it's not just me getting this issue, so with the help of the discussions I try what seemed like 3000 different settings changes just to see if the game is playable. Next time I start up the game, I get 4-5 hours out of it then stop playing, seemed like something had worked. Load up the game again, crashes within 30 minutes. To this day I am still dealing with crashes that seem to have no correlation to any setting, any part of the map, any animal, anything. I've changed so many settings at this point that I'm literally just playing inbetween crashes and every now and then it'll crash so many times in such a short space of time I just give up.This game is literally incredible. I've had crashes ever since 16 hours and yet I've still put up with it up until now. But I cannot recommend this game. It's not badly priced, but this game desperately needed to be released as an alpha or beta. It's just not ready. There are some other bugs (floating guns, weird arm twisty thing, animals getting stuck, rocks killing you for absolutely no reason) but these do not break the game. They're few and far between and they're absolutely bearable. Sitting at my PC for 2 hours and having a game crash 30 times within that time frame is absolutely soul destroying. TO SUM UPIf you're patient, love hunting, fancy a walking simulator or even a fantastic hunting sim, then maybe give it a shot. If you want the game to run smoothly and want to play with friends, really really avoid this game. 84 hours and I don't think I'll be launching this game any time soon. I will say, the developers seem hard working and eager to fix the issues but this game was clearly rushed and isn't in a fit state to be released yet. I really hope they can fix it soon because it's such a great game, and has such great potential.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolutely loving this game!  Enjoying the fact that there are missions and you have to ""earn"" everything by gaining experience points which can be transfered to skill points to increase your hunting abilities, yes it is a little buggy but it is a fairly new game, the bugs will be ironed out eventually but aside from that it is awesome!  The graphics are quite high so I am having to keep everything set to low to be able to run it on my computer but it still looks awesome and realistic.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game. The visuals, when maxxed, are gorgoeus, almost photorealistic. Sure there are bugs, glitches, odd nuances that the game has. These can all be fixed by patches. The base game is fanstastic. The rush of killing a new animal, exploring the open wilderness. As long as they keep updating the game, this will probably be the best hunting game ever made. The game is really really relaxing, if you just wanted to relax before work or bed, hop into this for a little bit. I also hope they support mods, while I highly doubt it, it would be fanstastic to see people add new content. Overall, about 6 hours in, it's a good time killer, and the mechanics of the game are really solid, teh way you can see the kill shots and whatnot. Would recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												With only 3 hours into the game as of writing it, theres only so much I can say about it. Currently it feels like a Euro Truck Simulator 2 game, where relaxing and walking around is really fun and enjoyable, the immersion is lovely but as people said below there is  a tiny thing or two that you may want to look out for.Firstly the game might be frustrating if you're new and thinking you can sprint everywhere and noscope stuff, well stop doing that and if you refuse to and keep on noscoping then back into the cesspool of Call of Duty.The game is buggy, quite buggy but it seems fairly optimized with a R280x and 8350 8x core processor, I've yet to see any crashes and i've done most of the three hours in one session so it seems to be pretty solid from my standpoint.Now would I recommend it? Well if you want a game that is just about walking around and hunting with full immersion like listening on trance at a sunday, then hell yeah go for it. But if you want alot more then I suggest waiting until they fixed some of the bugs and add some more content.... What? I liked it! Sorry if you didn't.. jerks..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is AMAZING! I love how beautiful it is and how exciting it can be! I love how the skill system works as well as the item shop. Every animal encounter is so much fun. I already have 30 hours and can't stop playing. I haven't even explored 25% of one of the 2 maps. If you are into hunting or like exploring this is a wonderful game for you.However there are a lot of weird bugs in multiplayer and issues with the menu. Its pretty stable on my pc but I've had plenty of issues with not being able to collect my animal that I shot in multiplayer, as well as the shop menu having issues with the item pictures not showing up after double clicking an item. I kinda wish this would have been labeled as a early access because there are a ton of things that are not working right at times. I hate to say that because I don't want to take away from anyone wanting to buy the game... I love it and I really hope the Dev team don't stop putting out updates to fix these problems. I know I'll do my best to put in bug reports!But yeah worth the money in my opinion but that's me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gorgeous! Most gorgeous nature game to date.Even if you experience this as a walking simulator, it is the best. The gameplay turned out also nice for the non enthusiast I was with the theme.I turned a fan of Avalanche studios with Just Cause 2. Was quite disapointed at Just Cause 3, but damn... this one...

												Game looked ok to begin with  , but lack of interaction with the developrer and the developers  recent  hotly contested  hs 2.0 in THC and rendering 20 plus weapons useless to those who bought them with no compensation  makes one question just how much they gonna actaully listen to the community here. With all the current issues existings on both thier games and some for several yrs on THC  i would have to not recommend this game till everything is resolved if they ever manage to do that. And no one has any idea what the price tag for dlc will be but given the insane greed of this company one bet it wont be cheap.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm going to wait for a couple of days and if the problem still persist, I'm going to ask for a refund.Edit: Now there's already an update and I can play the game, I can safely say this is a great game for its price.

												All i can say is Wow.Played for 5min, got stick between two rocks and found myself in a loop of dieing/spawning every 3 seconds unable to open the menu to exit so i had to alt f4 just to exit, now i can't load back into the game because it crashes... I just... wowEdit after actually playing some: Yep bug ridden, no where near the content of theHunter: Classic. what bugs are there don't usually break the game, the pricing system seems abit weird.Looks pretty, only redeeming feature.Still can't recommend either theHunter CotW or Classic, I'll still play CotW only because you don't get extored playing this even though it has ♥♥♥♥ all content compared to classic.Edit 20/02/17:After sinking some 18 or so hours into the game and discovering some things.there's more animals then i first thought just the leaderboard doesn't track every species (not that it updates your kills anyway -_- ) It's still very... just... bugs, some of them funny but some make you want to rage, forinstance. i spent about 30min heading north to get to a lookout to find where that aera's outpost was, the outpost was on the other side of a mission i had so i went into the mission aera and chilled out, called some Fallow to me. i went to go into my settings option to turn my sound back up (because wind and rain will blow your ears out if you have headphones) and the second i hit ""System"" in the menu (where options and exit to desktop options are) the game exited to windows without a prompt, so now i have about a 20-30min run back up to that lodge as i've got a mountain to go around. As it turns out there's a bug that when you press ""System"" instead of opening the side menu that lists Options and Exit to window buttons, it just exits to windows... ♥♥♥♥ my life.The animal pathing is messed up, they're always getting stuck on rocks and running on the spot. and they act like skyrim horses when they don't get stuck.Exibit A

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=867566516Enough said.Some of the things in the game aren't explained properly and some are just worded wrong completely for example, one of the skills you can unlock is called ""I'm only happy when it's raining"" and there's two levels and they go like this.Lvl 1: Decrease visablity when it's foggy.Lvl 2: Decrease visablity when it's raining.See the problem? (This is a perk by the way, not something that disadvantages you), if you don't then my point has been validated.Multiplayer, It's still kinda broken. people are having more luck joining games but as we found out pressing F6 i think it's the multiplayer options for the lobby leader, just pressing that button was booting someone at random from our game so that was fun.Another issue i have is if you join your friend in MP, you both walk upto the other side of the map hunting and exploring on the way. If you find a lookout, lodge, point of interest, You simply can't interact with them which pisses me off for lodges. if you want to unlock that lodge you have to go back to single player and walk all the way back to the other side of the map and press E on it in SP.Speaking of pressing E on things it's a fun little mini game at points of interest, some of them i haven't been able to collect/interact with, some have been fine, others i have to run around them jumping and looking into the sky to get the interact option... and finally how many times andwhat i've been killed by.Wild Animals: 0Skyriming and simply falling down sheer clifs: 0 (I do it allot, fastest way to get down the mountain)Other players: 0 (if you get shot in the face the bullet impact decal is actually cement so go figure, were's actually statues hunting wildlife in the game)Trees: 4, Yes i've been killed 4 times by inanimate trees the second most lethal thing in the game.Rocks: 15, This is encluding my encounter when i started playing which killed me about 9 times respawning me in the same place to die again over and over, other times i'll just be walking along and stand on a rock funny and I instantly die sooo.... yeah.The good :D yes there's actually good.. well kinda.The game is very pretty and being an AMD Processor user i was greatful to realise their new engine actually spreads the load evenly over all 8 threads of my FX8350 and i'm actually maxing out my GTX 1060 running almost everything on ultra.there is however a slight kind of fuzzy ness i think caused by the Anti-Alisasing (for the record i have no idea what i'm talking about but it seems that kind of blurry/jagged edge look)There's also some issues where i'll play along at 50ish FPS in 1080p and then my FPS just tanks to 15-20 and it's eyestraining to play forcing me to restart the game (ofcourse if i haven't gotten to that unclaimed lodge i have to do the walk all over again -_-"").Final Verdict:When this game works, it works in the most epic of fasions and i've had some rather intense encounters with Fallow deer. after following a herd i engaged some distance i finally found one that had dropped but i was then attacked by two cornered fallow, ended up using iron sites at 16m and lungshotting one that charged me while the other charged me right after and got away before i could get my bearings and get shots off in its direction.However in my opinion the game needs allot more polish and it should not have been released in its current state, I feel sorry for my fellow hunters who have to deal with the fustration of this game while it's being fixed and that's if it gets fixed. I've seen on a game news site they were responsible for Just Cause 3 and Mad Max, Mad max never had it's little niggles fixed like getting stuck and just derpy things and the short time i had Just cause i found it aweful to play, the controls and menus were just bad and poorly laid out and it shows how they've made the menus in theHunter: CotW.Edit for update 1.1:This game has become a boring walk around shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥ by removing the work you had to put in to get the best stuff in the game they've literally turned their game into a feature bland theHunter Classic that looks pretty.

												Ok where to start this is a senic almost perfect game. but thats where it end as of now multiplayer is bugged.you cant apply settings in game one example is the aim mode toggle you can change it but as soon as you shoot it goes back to default. the crashes omfg the crashes. the original the hunter had problems for months and i fear this game will be simular to sadly.the where looking for betatesters those surly did a great job well done picking them... over to gameplay this sure have a more arcade angle on the hunting compared to the hunter original. a good thing for getting more players in to it. animal behavior  seems to be really strange in this game compared to the original. the hunter pressure is not working as intended i noticed the more i shoot in a area the more animals i see and hear should be the other way around i think personally i dont like the whole level to get gear thing i think the game would be more enjoyable if i could get stuff♥♥♥♥♥soon as i had money for it. wounder if you should get the game? at the current state i would put the value to $10 so thats my answer.

												This is the first review im writing. The reason is because i was so dissappointed with the Multiplayer. This should have been a early access game in my opinion. First off, the game does not support resolutions above 2000x and widescreens. So you have to downscale and miss the whole graphic part.Seccond off. Everytime you join a multiplayer game you start at the same point, and the game bugs so you cant access the different traveling locations.Been bugged 2 times where im tossed 150 meeters up in the air and die when i land.Also, you cant hunt together with your friends, you actually hunt 1 by 1. If you help spotting the animal, you get no points, xp or credits. You have to hit the animal in order to get XP. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game definitely wasn't ready for release. It's a (pretty bad) beta at best.After reading on the forums that Stefan, one of the developers, refuses to acknowledge one of the most game-breaking bugs (see below) and closes threads, I decided to request a refund.GraphicsThe game is pretty gorgeous looking, that's for sure. Good textures, day/night cycle, dynamic weather, wind moving leaves, grass, etc.I did experience a few minor issues though, like clouds flickering, the handheld occasionally being shown without its display (just the frame) or rain falling right through the roof of a deer stand (how there's still devs in 2017 not paying attention to something like that is beyond me).SoundSounds are very inconsistent in quality. Some sound very realistic with high production quality, others just sound terrible, with static noise at the beginning and/or end of the sound sample (at least when playing with headphones this was easily perceivable).I also repeatedly had issues with sounds ending abruptly (like animal calls or birds chirping) or stuttering, or ambient sounds like wind changing way too fast.Obviously issues like that are constantly breaking someones immersion.InterfaceThe menus are buggy, with buttons not always reacting to clicks. Some options like mouse sensitivity are also a pain to use, since you can only increase/decrease the value by clicking arrows to the left or right. There's no slider or a way to type in a value directly. Annoying, especially if the game doesn't save the settings properly and you have to re-do them the next time you launch the game. There's also no way to go back to the main menu -- you have to quit and restart the game for that (no joke).Several HUD elements don't scale properly when playing on a 16:10 screen. For example, the compass is oval, and markers on the map are oval as well. I suspect people with widescreen-monitors like 21:9 will be affected by this as well.There's also graphical glitches on the map, like terrain textures that aren't properly stitched together, and map overlays that are only partially visible.You can also disable certain aspects of the HUD (like tutorial hints or point of interest markers) or change how animal tracks are being visualized. Sometimes HUD elements can get stuck on your screen or behave strangely if you change the settings and don't restart the game afterwards.Animal AII'm not an animal expert, so I can't talk too much about this topic. But at least on two occasions, after firing a shot, deer ran away, just to come back several minutes later, walking right towards me, coming as close as 10 meters and not notice me at all. Well, I doubt any real animal would do that, unless they are suicidal.There's also reports of animals getting stuck, but I haven't seen that myself in game.Shooting/gunplayShooting seems weird. First I thought I'm doing something wrong, like missing vital organs, since I couldn't even kill non-moving small game from less than 50 meters. I then read in another review that someone was testing the shooting on stuck animals, and had to hit them with up to 6 rounds to kill them, from only a few meters away.A hunting game with broken gun mechanics. Awesome.PerformanceI'm on Windows 7 with an Intel i5-3570K (3.4 GHz, 4 cores, 4 threads) and a Radeon RX 470 (4 GB VRAM). I maxed out all graphics settings, only turned off motion blur. Resolution was set to 2560 × 1600 to reduce flickering of the foliage (native screen resolution is 1920 × 1200).I didn't measure the frames per second, but it was around 30. Which in my book is okay for a slow-paced game like this.ControlsMouse sensitivity is annoyingly low when using binoculars or scopes, even when set to 100 in the settings (the maximum). Maybe it's on purpose to make shooting more difficult, but then at least exclude the binoculars from that 'mechanic'.One severe issue is that you can't walk slowly when using keyboard & mouse, meaning your noise level is always at max when moving, no matter if you're standing, crouching or prone. For comparison, I tested it with my Xbox gamepad and it's fine there, but why would I play a first person hunting game on the PC with a controller?Now, as mentioned at the top of the review, several people have pointed out that issue on the forums, but it seems the developers just try to ignore it and refuse to acknowledge this being a major problem. Which led me to requesting a refund. Because it's bad enough to release a game in a state like this, but then trying to silence or ignore issues... I refuse to support stuff like that.If they fix all these issues (and there's a bunch more I didn't experience personally or forgot to mention) I'll gladly purchase this game again, but until then I recommend everyone to wait and see if the devs get their **** together.

												theHunter: Call of the Wild  is a different game then theHunter classic if you buy this game and thought it was thehunter classic 2 or something your wrong they never said it was. Both games are still being worked on and each game is for different people I think both are good games for people who want something different out of a hunting game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game. There are minor bugs, but I hardly notice them, the graphics are good, and I love the mechanics, such as tracking and AI. There are also the small things, like tall grass being flattened where you walk, that add so much to the game. It is well worth the thirty dollars, and I cant imagine exploring the entire map, it's vastness is overwhelming. My only complaint is that I think there should be more waypoints, I personally am very distracted by the smallest of things, and end up chasing a deer miles off the trail, making it almost impossible to reach my destination.

												Rather different from Thehunter Classic ( I got +1000 hours in that game! Beat THAT! XD). But still have to give it the thumbs up.Pro: Better graphics (duh). More realistic and skittish animals. More geniune hunting experience.Con: Skill tree. Makes it feel like a fps shooter. ""To earn X skill you need to earn X experience points.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's get it out of the way first - the environmental audiovisuals of this game are absolutely astonishing. Possibly the most beautifully realised and naturalistic open game world I've ever seen.Unfortunately the artistry, technical prowess and obvious dedication that went into the game world simply don't extend to the gameplay and UI. Quite simply the game should not have been released in its current state as anything other than early access, and the devs would be receiving a lot more support and understanding if it had been.Currently Hunter CotW is a hunting game where you can't quite trust that the casualised hunting mechanics are coming together properly. Bagging or losing an animal because the game glitched out rather than through your own skills or lack thereof kind of defeats the whole purpose. Numerous crashes, bugs, design flaws and gameplay oversights just add additional salt to the wound. I'll give it a positive review because even as incomplete and bug ridden as it is, the immersion from wandering around its incredibly realised world (and occasionally shooting things) is unbeatable. It just has a long long way to go to be considered a finished product.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 6 hours, as of right now, I can say that if you are interested, you should buy this game now. The occasional bugs are dont stop the game from still being enjoyable, and most of the ""game breaking"" bugs have been fixed, except for the crashing, which for me, I figured how to resolve. HOW TO FIX THE CRASHING: *at least for meAs soon as you start the game, immediately hit continue and dont spend time on the home screen. For some reason that worked for me, and I hope it helps other people. PROS/CONS:Pros: Animals are mostly everywhere making the game at a good pace, not to fast nor slow.Good sound designGood Graphics Wide variety of ammo types for each gunMaps are giantLots to explore INCREASED VIEW DISTANCECons: Cannot distinguish male from female calls unless you unlock the part of the skill treeFemale deer make male deer noisesAnimal AI is sometimes downright stupid, the animals walk in circles, get stuck in rocks ectNoise meter is full when crouching through short grassThats all I can think of right now, but I can say if you want it, get it now			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game! I love the whole concept of it, the graphics are really beautiful. For a game that run's an open world engine I can tell this one has been optimised well. The game always runs smooth and constistant, and the clever AI system really makes hunting all the more realistic. Please be aware that this game is also still buggy although the developers are still hooking us up with updates including fix's and so on. I've owned this game for 2 days and I'm already satisified with my purchase. If your like me and quite like the great outdoors but never really has the energy to do so, then I highly recommend this game. Cheers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are problems with this game don't get me wrong but isn't that the case with many titles out there. Take BF4 for example, that game was terrible are launch but it became through many updates one of the most played games out there. theHunter: Call of the Wild is a great game if you are looking to take a break from more mainsteam shooters like COD or BF. What other games allows you the track an animal and stalk it until you have the perfect shot that isnt from 2010 or requires you to buy licenses (sorry fans of the first game theHunter). I know this game has its problems but they have already released 4 updates and are listening to their fan base. The graphics in this game are out of this world and make you feel like you are right there in the action. Don't fall for the people saying this game is terrible for not having the best launch. I have enjoyed this game a lot and once they fix some stuff I will be playing it more often. Highly recommened this for the person that wants to try something new!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i hope u dont consider BEING ANGRY FOR SPENDING REAL MONEY FOR UNFINISHED PRODUCTWITH LOTS OF BUGS AND GLITCHES as being not polite. Oh yes, i am angry. CONFUSIONS:1. Why make the game requires latest graphic card when my high end graphic card can smoothly play much better graphic than this one? My laptop can play Splinter Cell Blacklist ULTRA SETTING without stuttering at all, but even in The Hunter Classic, the medium setting stutters significantly. The Highest Setting in The Hunter is still inferior to the LOWEST SETTING of Splinter Cell Blacklist, at least to my non-expert opinion. I am stand corrected as this confusion might come from my own lack of graphic card knowledge, but if my confusion is based on a fair ground, can the developer do something with/change the engine provider or does this has something to do with the graphic card manufacturers business politic?2. The developer is impressive in inventing a great concept of gameplay. That requires a great deal of creativity and careful fine-tunings. But i am very confused about the sound of some animals, like the Red Kangaroo in The Hunter Classic. When i had first heard the sound of them, i was surprised because i did not imagine such animal would produce that kind of sound, and it sparked some doubt in me too. So i googled and youtubed it. Turned out that the actual sound was very different. I checked lots of videos and none came up with the sound like the one in the game.I thought this game is some sort of simulation so it is really a turn off with that kangaroo sound thing (if it really is different from the real ones)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't buy it unless you want to feel like you are in Pre-Alpha testing! Freezes, crashes, bullets often don't do damage, Animals will get stuck in bushes or hover over rocks. Setting navigation is awful and clumsy. Switching from an animal call to a weapon will almost always cause your character to get stuck on whatever item is equipped. The list of problems goes on and on.  The landscapes and graphics are amazing at times but ultimately the game is ruined when you track an animal for 20 minutes just to have the game crash or to be unable to switch to your weapon to shoot it.

												It still has some work to do such as fixing sounds, animations, and quest. Besides what there is to work on this game as of release is very slow in pace for to unlock new items requires alot of time and effortAfter some time as I have noticed that the mission reset was from my own doing, for i was using the ""start new game"" option to switch reserves instead of using the map option too. As for my previous comment, the sound issues I have with this game are with the animals, in which i have experianced animals using mating calls as warning calls as well as female animals using the sounds produced by their male counter parts (ie. does grunting). As for my comments on the animations, they are bugged for example animals have delayed or unreponsive reactions to being shot (especially at longer ranges) as well some anmation issues with the callers. Other wise this game is fairly decent but can still use some patching for a better experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was super pumped to play this game, but....When I launched it I knew something was off.  The game seemed fine and had a decent frame rate on high settings.  I started to play and could barely move.  The game was running well, but the character would not move fast.  All the animals were moving at normal speed as well, making tracking and finding animals nearly impossible.  Because the game involves so much travel, I decided to ask for a refund because my character moved to slowly to properly enjoy the game.I have checked online, and this appears to be a common problem.Also, I watched many youtubers play the game before deciding to buy.  They moved MUCH faster and the game looked like tons of fun.If the devs can fix this problem, I would happily play it again.  The hunting itself was great, but after this glitch gets fixed, it could easily be a 4 star game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It definitely has its issues, mostly related to bugs and some optimization issues, but I've had a lot of fun with the game.  I have no history with the series or hunting games in general really, but I find this game to be incredibly relaxing and immersive.  The visuals and sounds are awesome as well as you watch day shift to night and storms suddenly roll in with high winds and heavy rain.  If you are on the edge it might be worth waiting a bit for another patch or two to roll in and see if it fixes some of the bigger issues, however I took the dive myself despite seeing quite a few negative reviews and don't regret it.Pros:- Great visuals- Immersive sound design- It could just be because this is my introduction to his type of game, but it was a thrill listening for and tracking down animals to kill.  I look forward to some more difficult targets that will require more time.- Feels welcoming to players newer to this style of game with a bit more casual presentation.  This of course could be looked at negatively to veterans of this type of game or theHunter Classic.- Speedy loading times.  I don't even have a SSD, but this game loads from the title screen into the game world very quickly which surprised me considering how large the map is.- Various challenges, quests, and lore discovery locations are sprinkled throughout the map, giving some extra activities outside of general hunting.- The two hunting reserve maps are massive in sizeCons:- The biggest issue right now is that with mouse and keyboard controls you have little to no control over the speed of your movement in each of the stances (walking, crouching, prone).  If you have a controller and test the movement out on that, you'll notice with analog control you can move the stick varying amounts to control your speed and subsequently the amount of noise you make.  Considering how important it is to try and remain silent in a hunting game, this is a pretty big issue at the moment.  Either controller movement needs to have that disabled and rework the amount of noise each stance makes, or keyboard needs an keybinding to slow your pace to a level that makes minimal sound.- While I've had no crashes (Update: I have experienced my first crash, so this does seem to be a relevant issue for many players), I have had a performance bug which was causing framerate to drop significantly when I was tracking an animal's footprints a lot.  Having too many of these tracking markers will cause the framerate to drop after opening the map or looking at your Huntermate device.  It would fix itself by either putting away the Huntermate or if you killed the tracked animal and collected your trophy.- Semi annoying menu bug that doesn't let you back out of the menu with escape unless the mouse is hovering over one of the items on the side.- A few of the animals I've shot seemed like it should have been a clean kill, but they would somehow get away with just a minor wound and run off.  More often than not I found success with my shots though.- Animal AI was a bit wonky on at least one occasion with a fox that clearly should have been trying to run away, but instead was running circles around me like a friendly pet dog or something.  Perhaps it was being aggresive and trying to attack or something, but it seemed a bit bizarre with it essentially giving me an easy kill.- Right now it is limited to 12 different animals.  These do have variations to discover, but it would be nice to see some small game targets and birds as well.  I'm assuming we'll see this added down the line at some point when they add some of the planned free and paid DLC content.- The menus ui and control of them in general just feels like it needs a rework as they look and feel like a placeholder that has been in the game since an earlier state.  There are also some issues with the controls when managing your storage where it just seems to completely break when in that particular menu and you have to back out and open it back up to do anything.

Original review 17/02/2017Positives: Sound is incredible. Environment is gorgeous. Weather is fantastic. Tracking seems markedly better (though the new huntermate is practically useless). Animals react to being hit instead of just running and are visibly hurt when running away. Bears attack deer (hilarious). Weapons feel nicer.Negatives: BUGS, EVERYWHERE. Animal behaviour seems to be much worse than Classic, though could be bugged like everything else. UI sucks, buggy and badly designed in places. Mission progress resets if you change reserve. Changing reserve allows you to fast travel to any outpost you want and claim the XP again. Scoped weapons can bug out and prevent you from being able to see anything. More bugs. Bugs all day.Feels rushed to production. Full of bugs. UI design is not great and the bugs in the UI make it even worse than Classic's UI. There's currently more wrong with this game than right, which sucks.UPDATE 05/03/2017Played a few hours this morning, seemed less buggy.• Menu works generally as expected.• Animals still run into trees and rocks and inexplicably turn and walk directly away from you all the time only to return when you call them. Still don't seem to have the level of intelligence they had in classic, either.• Scopes on rifles still buggy, even when you're not using a scope they can bug out now too. • Temporary hunting stands buggy with bows (arrows shoot into wood instead of where you're aiming), not sure about rifles.Tried to play this afternoon, crashed twice in 5 minutes. Still not recommended.One last point I'll make is that I've realised, even though now it's less painful than the first iteration, the progression system is infuriating. I'm not saying it shouldn't be part of the game but its current implementation makes the game boring and repetitive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a beautiful game, the graphics are stunning.  However, it has many problems.The bad:1 -The animal AI is pretty bad, they just kind of derp around until they see you or you shoot them. I literally got headbutted by a moose that didn't even see me, it was just running and I happened to be in its path. 2 - The noise level your character makes is way to high by default, the only way you can move without spooking animals is to crawl prone, or mash the move button and take one step at a time.3 - Your character gets stuck on random things for no reason.4 - Theres no anti aliasing that I can find in the graphics.. like.. why?5 - There aren't tags, so its just kind of a ""wander around murdering animals"" simulator.  This is a plus for some people id imagine, but not for the hunting simulator croud. 6 - Your character moves sooooooooo slow.  Like its really annoying.7 - The only way to get other equipment is to collect animals, and you need to kill like 50 deer to get a new rifle/scope/ect.8 - The skill tree is very poorly done.  Like one of the traits is ""See 15% less during fog"".  Like... what?  How is that a perk?9 -Theres a bunch of pointless♥♥♥♥♥♥on the map.  Like theres just random pillars out in the wilderness that give you ""lore"".10 - There isn't much for a tutorial in the game.. it pretty much just drops you into the world.11 - Bad frames when foliage gets really thick.The good:1 - The tracking system is very user friendly. Although not realistic.2 - The map is very good looking.3 - There are 2 zones you can hunt in, and both are very large.4 - Theres plenty of action.  This may not be good if you are looking for realism.Thoughts:This game defintely has potential, but in its current state it seems unfinished. Theres plenty of stuff to hunt if you are looking for an arcadey hunting game, that's multiplayer. But if you are in the market for a simulator, I'd skip this one for now. 5/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sorry, but this game is UNFINISHED. And:The amount of bugs is unacceptable for a game costing 30€ and being not early access. Some of the bugs are not even bugs - they are just a sign that the game is not ready yet. Example? - No EXIT-button in the menu (it seems due to the fact this game is obv. a console-port from work in progress --> yes, you will play an alpha-version on PC from a console-port which is not even released yet in 03/2017)- menu is absolutely horrible, buggy, ugly and unfinished. It's a conundrum how to put sighs and amunition on a weapon --> as mentioned, it's obviously a rough console-port- menu stays open in the background - so during game you change options, map or even fast travel incidently when 'hitting' something with your mouse which is hiding behind in the hidden but open menu (edit: solved with patch 1.41)- sounds are missing, too loud, not playing sometimes or not fitting (for example in muliplayer you can hear callers extremly loud even when it comes from a player on the other end of the map)- descriptions for some amuntion and options is completely wrong or reversed or do not work at all- why the hell you can find a scope for revolvers in the section for riffles? This is no serious bug, but shows that the developers throw this pre-alpha-game on the market even without ironing out the most visible errors- crasehes to desktop are very common for lots of users. In my case I do suffer it accidently over a period of timeThe game seems very unbalanced. And I think, the developers know it. What else could be the reason, they changed for expample the price of amunition and DOUBLED it. This is no tweaking of the balance - this is reinventing the game settings. There is no possibility for changing the game hardness. For beginners it seems to be good, running in ZOO full of animals. But for advanced guys this is no fun. Too  much animals in the game. And part of the animals are completely AI-buggy. Example?I hunted down approx. 15 deers in the northern part of the US-map. They stood in shallow water and did not react when shooting on them or on they neighbours. Other animals stick in rocks or trees. Or do not react at all. Example (not my clip):

Sorry - but I can not recomend this game due to the fact, that CORE ELEMENTS of this game are messed up. Edit 11.03.2017:After about 60 hours playing this thing, it suddenly started to crash every 3 minutes. In both maps. With same PC-configuration, even without changing anything on the PC (it's the gamig computer). I regard it as completely unacceptable by DEVELOPERS and PUBLISHERS to release this game and/or not willing to give a refund. The problems did not start inbetween the first 2 hours of playing - so STEAM is not willing to take back this bug-feast.Edit 27.03.2017:Patch 1.4 and still no real progress. Players find NEW BUGS en masse, weappons are out of order, developers are still not able to ad a simple button in the menue, UI has still very serious bugs, animal-AI still extrem bad and for lots of players the game does not even start!But developers have a new information for us:THEY ARE WORKING ON THE CONSOLE-PORT to XBox and PlayStation! Great. They are concentrating on real important topics:Make MORE money! Do not listen to customers, or even try to iron out bugs. Make MORE money!Happy Hunting!Edit 29.03.2017 Patch 4.1:Small patch, UI ist still a mess and partly not functioning. Players report newe bugs or bugs beeing solved now reactivated (for example dying instantly on game start).Edit 31.03.2017:Now due to my repeated criticism in the forum I have been BANNED. But not even banned, ALL POSTS, ANSWERS (even very constructive to help players overcome bugs) have been DELETED. Everything without a trace. And I am not the only one...Edit 23.04.2017:Called for a return of this product on Steam and waiting for answer. I would be sattisfied even by having returned 50% of the price. After serveral patches there is no real progress in making this game a FULL and playable one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This could be a great game, there are just way to many bugs atm.The UI is horrible. Many buttons dont work. You can't exit to main menu. You have to close the game and launch it again.The whole system to buy new guns, and ammo is so poorly made. I really hope this and many other issues will be fixed. If the game becomes playable, I will make a new review			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely stunning game in terms of graphics and even audio, just the sound of the wind gusting by or the stunning vistas, heavy rainfall and animal vocals makes this an immersive game set in nature.The map is enormous, the scale is just simply put insane, you can walk for hours and hours and it won't get repetitive as it feels like its several maps in one with the diversity each area brings.Not to mention the amazing grass effects, you could if you want track an animal by following the grass it flattened, and you can also see your own and other players their paths, ocassionally i also used this to get a clean prone shot where normally that wouldn't be possible due to the grass being in the way.But each game comes with its downsides and this game also has no shortage of those.The gamebreaking ones to me were:In Multiplayer only the host can unlock map objects, such as hunting stands / outposts (important one, they allow fast travel)Animals get stuck, from my 12 hour experience i would say i have seen 1 in 8 getting stuck, mostly on edges or rocks with bears being a big outlier as i have seen 1 in 4 of them getting stuck.The UI design is unintuitive, being unable to exit to menu and aspecially when it comes to loading ammo/scopes onto a weapon, it's also impossible to read some of the descriptions as the text moves offscreen, and in quite a few cases i saw what i can only describe as a alpha/beta-like placeholder text for some of the ammo/scopes.Some minor issues/bugs i had were:Some crashes when tabbing out and back into the game, i fixed this by adding the ""/Borderless"" in the steam launch options.Sometimes got a bug with my scope being off center forcing me to restart the game, the adjustment ontop of the scope itself became my crosshair, unequipping etc didn't fix it sadly.In Multiplayer when another player jumps its heard across the map, i suppose this might be an engine issue as it also happened in the previous hunter game with someone reloading.When you fatally hit an animal they sometimes do this weird freeze for up to 1 second and then start to ragdoll, i would love to see this changed / fixed so that you feel more feedback from the bullet impact and it kinda just looks awkward as it is currently.Animals don't spook enough from gunshots sometimes it feels asif they don't even hear the gunshot, i've been able to shoot up to 3 animals ocassionally before they even started getting spooked, i would like to see the range that animals get spooked by gunshots increased.Animals don't seem to interact with eachother, i would've hoped they would introduce something like this, i believe they added something similar to classic with the introduction of wolves so it would be nice if this could be added eventually.And finally theres just too many animals on Layton district, i would prefer it if they were a bit more rare or more easily spooked just recently i shot 5 bears within 10 minutes and before that about 3 within 4 minutes, one of which was stuck underneath a bridge, although Hirschfelden seems fine.It's also too easy to spot an animal by zooming in on where its call came from, it feels like its fine when you are scoped out and they callout as it covers a wide area but you can zoom in to get a pinpoint location on where it called out from, I'm not sure if thats by design or not but it makes it too easy, you can turn the call direction and other effects off in the settings, but it would be nice to have a middle groundI would still recommend the game to anyone remotely interested in the setting or who played the previous game, it does clearly have some bugs that makes you question why it was released so soon,But if they fix / change most of these issues, i can see this as one of the best games this year and i look forward to what content they might still bring out.All in all what is here is a gorgeous landscape filled with tons of animals to hunt, great gunplay mechanics such as bullet drop and organ hits, amazing graphics and audio, but also some of the worst UI i've seen in a while, and quite some bugs which hopefully get fixed soon.

												To start off with, this is an absolutely beautiful game. The environment is stunning and the texturing and animations for the animals are incredible. The sounds are amazing. They've definitely done an excellent job with creating a visually spectacular game. However, I don't want a hunting game that's just pretty to look at, and that's just about all this one is so far - pretty.It is essentially a very dumbed down version of theHunter: Classic. While they improved certain mechanics such as the tracking system - making it so you don't have to have the HunterMate in your hand in order to track animals - and a visual wind direction right on the compass, they drastically oversimplified others. Size/rack variations are practically non-existant from what I've seen thus far, small game other than coyote is present, but not able to be harvested, there's no trophy shots (although you can always just take a photo manually prior to harvest), skill progression is global rather than per-species, and is based on general XP gain rather than skill-specific XP, and many of the points of interest which say they grant skill/perk points do not actually do so.  Overall it feels like they've gone the way of a Cabela's game - going from a simulation heavy title to an very arcade-like experience.Hopefully a lot of those issues can be handled by an update. Until then, if you're looking for something close to theHunter: Classic, this simply isn't it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For fans of the subscription based classic, the new engine allows for a lot of previous shortcomings to be overcome. The draw distance has been extended and the vibrant environments are lovingly crafted and perfect to while the hours away in.However, a number of core features are sorely missing. The lack of an appropriate way to take photographs of trophies, no community wide competitions, and a lack of any trophy record keeping outside of raw statistics results in a game where every Buck is just a number.From the rushed and huddled menu design to missing fundamental features, this is a title with a lot of potential, but with a lot of confusing omissions.

												Just started playing this as most have. There are a lot of bugs but for me it is stable. I play on a rig that is able to cope with anything and  can play at Ultra settings with no problems and no crashes. Friends on I5 processors have had problems.I have a 2k+ profile on TheHunter so I know how this works.Suggestions...Use all your hard earned cash to buy callers and the first bow. DO NOT BUT THOSE TOWERS.you do not need them yet. That bow is awesome at close range.Problems I have had ...when i bought the fox caller my scope went foggy on the 243....go figure.The fox caller sometimes sticks and you can not do anything  but call foxes...easy answer...back up a bit and select a gun. The fox caller will start to work again.Seems likes foxes spook at 38m...regardless of what you are doing....seems scent spray is required.Great game ( the graphisc are awesome) and hopefully the devs will take note of this .  Got to  level 10 and hopefully will go furtherCheersDave			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I am conflicted leaving this game a negative review. For what it is, the game is very beautiful and is very well detailed. When you first start it up you will be impressed with the surroundings and weapon graphics. The phone UI is a little whacky. In fact the UI in general is kind of weird.The AI is bad... really bad. When you first start, the game introduces you to tracking and killing an animal. This experience is pretty amazing. Then you go off doing ""quests"" and you realize that the open world AI is just flat out stupid. Animals walk into things. Deer literally keep coming back to the scene of the crime using the caller, until you murder their entire family. Getting into a hunting blind is cool... until literally everything becomes blind to you. I was calling for deer and a bear just walked up and stood there. Shot it in the neck for an instant kill and got a lot of XP.Sounds are amazing, for a while. You hear wind, walking through brush, rain, and trees all over along with the wildlife. But it gets repetitive and it can get really loud when you are trying to listen to things. When you hear the fog horn sound of a warning call, you will wake up the entire house with a feminine scream.All in all it's a cool game. But it is buggy and lacks real content. It's just a grind with a small variety of things to kill around you. I think this game could be amazing, and with some content and patches it probably will be, but for $30 I would just wait for a sale or some fixes. So my ""negative"" review is just one in waiting. I will pick this up again for sure when it goes on sale or a DLC comes out to fix and expand on things.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Editing review*2017-02-19Okay so ive been playing non-stop for the past days since release, i am now level 19.COTW still runs great and the bugs really dont bother me at all, but after playing so much, the flaws in the gameplay really become an apparent issue.Too many animals, they are everywhere almost all the time, very rarely do you go 30 mins without seeing an animal (usually see 2 about every 10 mins) which for a hunting sim is way too much.Warning calls are BS and should be taken out of the game. I feel like its the whole reason it seems like there is so much wildlife. you hear them EVERYWHERE! Yes you can turn the blips off but youre just putting yourself at a disadvantage doing so...No fun in that either.Tournies, truRAC and leaderboards need to be added ASAP if this game wants to survive aslong as TheHunter Classic has. Of course only after the major bugs are fixed!as of now this is my personal opinion rating, if you disagree dont feel afraid to comment.Gameplay 6/10Sorry its just to darn easy, tracking is useless, unless it shoot the animal you are aiming for and there is almost no bullet drop.Graphics 10/10Its ♥♥♥♥ing gorgeous guys, seriously looks amazing, other then some muddy leave textures every once and a whileSound 9/10All the sounds are amazingly well done, Wind, rain and thunder all at once kills your ears and is way too loud. also rabbits OP!If youre a hardcore hunting fan just stick to classic unless you have money to burn, until they release patches.I am still reccommending the game, ive loved all my time in it so far! there are just a lot of gameplay issues!*release review* feb 14thCOTW imho should be at minimum labeled as ""Early Access""there are some annoying UI bugs, ive crashed twice over the span of 12 hours, which really isnt bad.Ive had almost no issues with the game, other especially with AMD have it bad i hear.The Hunter Call of the Wild is, is a lot of fun and well worth the 35$ for me. but its far from finished, right now there is no tournaments, and leaderboards which really makes hunting sort of meaningless unless youre in a MP server where you can see other players top score.for 35$ it has more than enough content for me until the patches (hopefully tournaments) start rolling in.Nice physics, great graphics, runs crazyyyy smooth, honestly feels like it runs smoother than classic version. and not a god damn cashcow like classic aswell. if you want more content, then play classic but its going to cost you a hell of a lot more than this game will. I can see call of the wild being amazing if they do everything correctly.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In the games current state, I do not recommend.theHunter: Call of the wild was a HUGE dissapointment to me. Coming from the classic ""theHunter"", beleive me when I say, I feel cheated and as if no effort was put into it. theHunter brought more diversity and unique opportunities than this game. I can only hope in the future they plan on adding more, as in, treestands, blinds, and water game. Also in the original theHunter something as simple as having a trophy count and trophy shot/picture brought more to the game than call of the wild has. The initial realease was a hot piece of garbage as the menu was broken, animals being stuck, spawn system way too high in areas, and etc.They turned this game into your average objective based game while taking away the uniqueness theHunter had to offer. Pros:GraphicsCons:No diversityNo trophy system or trophy shotGame still in beta after initial releaseNo effortNot a simulationMultiplayerI can see great potential for this game, but I hope they make the necessary additions to help improve.

As of this post I am level 15, 20+ hrs, Several Weapons and 100+ Animals down... Never played the OriginalFirst Impressions: I love it, great game, somewhat unfinished but everything these days is. A lot of people expect a finished game upon release which I find silly... Expectations of games in the modern day is insane, people think every game is a AAA title will hundreds of millions backing it. While the game isn't finished and many bugs are still out there it isn't game breaking and I have had no issues progressing. I had to adjust playstyle to accomodate bugs, mainly making too much sound while moving in any kind of stance (this includes the lower noise perks).I think give this game a little time and things will iron out, not all bugs are going to disappear but they will fix the major ones or at least I hope they do.Animals: The Animals are great, a huge range to shoot at and the bedding/feeding/drinking zones make finding a required animal a lot easier. The movement is pretty solid along with the animations of reactions to bullet fire or getting hit. I see a lot of people complaining about not being able to down a deer with the starter rifle and sorry to say but you are just a terrible shot. A heart or decent lung shot is going to drop a deer straight away if not a lung shot is going to have them run an extra 50m then die, anything else is just punishment for a terrible shot. Leading animals also appears to work well, more often then not I am able to get a 2nd or 3rd shot in before the animal is in cover or I have lost sight.Weapons: These are fine, I never played the original but having a background in FPS I am able to aim the rifle and hit my target at anything under 200m pretty easily. The 223 is a neat little fox hunting rifle which I have used on countless foxes including my 48,000,000 score kill (another bug). I have recently unlocked the 270 and it will drop pretty much any deer with a chest/shoulder shot. Progression on weapons is fine, its not too slow and definately not too fast. I would like to see more customization however this could happen in the future.Progression: Currently I am level 15 and it hasn't been a quick ride, having explored 80% of the map and killed over 100 animals it hasn't been easy. With that said I do like the progression, it isn't fast and I really have to work at it to get the unlocks I want. There is no quick level option in the game (that I know of) so doing what I am doing seems to be paying off in the long run. I also like how you have to progress with the weapon of choice, instead of just having a level requirement to shoot the best gun in the game. On that note by the time you unlock a better rifle you should be a better shot with rifles.Graphics: Amazing, running a 1070 makes this game look noice. Having played a few open world games now this does look amazing. From what I have heard from others this does look better then the original game which once again makes a lot of sense.Bugs: There is a few, a few really annoying ones which have turned away a few people I know.... That is fair enough and I respect that... However... Coming from Classic and expecting a polished game with the ability to just jump in and shoot whatever you want with whatever you want is not going to go down well.Overall: I would give it in its current state a 6/10 with the opportunity to hit 8/10 if the main bugs are fixed. I love how the game plays, how it looks and the progression. I love a challenge and having to really work for those quality kills, I will continue to play the game and looking to get some of those later unlocks.TL:DR - Overall great game for someone new to theHunter series, also for those looking for a hunter sim, different from Classic game, harder to bring those on Classic in current games state... Definately potential if bugs are corrected.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The most beautiful environment i've ever seen.. NOTE: This is the only review i've written on steam since i've found no game really in need of it.I started playing the old hunter game as an escape with one of my friends and it was all right but this one is one of the best games i've played. It's so relaxing so stroll around without any competition tracking down your prey and then taking a well prepared shot. The two maps that are available are huge and has by far the most beautiful scenery and environment that i've ever seen. Walking around the huge maps really takes your mind of everything in life, add some calm music and i'm in total bliss. The sounds made for this game are amazing and it's so much so that you might for a second actually believe that you're in whatever forest or field that you're currently tracking prey in. The game is so calm, the only thing that disturbs the peace is your bullet leaving the muzzle.I found this game awesome to play with a friends and ganging up on some resting bear that just happens to get shot 5-10 times it's just friggin' hilarious and also brings time to talk about other stuff that might not even be related to the game. Now on to the bad parts, the game in single player for me is running flawlessly on my setup and i have no issues at all really except for some minor bugs that won't really affect the experience.On the other hand, multi player is riddled with small bugs that actually stack up, one of my friends game crashes all the time whilst mine doesn't and i have almost the same setup as him. The mission system doesn't work in multi player, menu's will click without any warning and i have accidentally kicked friends from the multi player game by accident because of this. If you're the host you can still locate landmarks/cabins and get the experience and lore from interacting with them, BUT your friends that are clients on the server can't which hinders the experience on their part since they can't progress in the game world when they play on your servers. But this isn't really a problem if you switch between host/client from time to time. You're usually not even concerned by this since you always get sidetracked by prey.I can wholeheartedly recommend this game for those with patience with some minor bugs. I would agree that this game should still be in a Beta stage. But it is so immersive that i'm glad that i can take part in it right now.If you're constantly annoyed by bugs and can't let go. Then this game might not be for you right now. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's as step up from theHunter: Classic in some areas and a step back in others, however it's a good platform to build on like they did with Classic.Pros: - Updated graphics, some of the best scenery you will see in any game. - Hunting pressure, new mechanic to make it difficult to hunt in areas you've already hunted.- Improved animal behaviors. Animals will give warning calls, mating calls, and can be found in large heards.  There was also the addition of ""need zones"" that you can discover such as sleeping zones, drinking and feeding zones where you can find specific species at certain hours of the day.- Night hunting, with the help of a headlamp. - CoTW replaces a membership pay model of Classic with a RPG system that makes you gradually unlock new weapons and equipment through XP, also has a pretty neat skills/perks system that really adds some flavor to hunting. Cons: - Lacks the diversity of theHunter: Classic. Only 2 hunting reserves at the time of launch, a handful of weapons and a pretty small roster of game to hunt. - Scoring system seems wonky, not a huge fan of the ""consecutive harvests"" idea. The game awards senseless killing and not being patient and selective like it should be. - Small features like trophy shots and trophy galleries not available at this time. Guessing in the future? Not sure why something like this would be cut from the game.- Performance issues, some people complaining about crashes/bugs. Latest patch addressed some issues though.-  No mobile tree stands, or tents. You have to discover outposts around the map and use them to fast travel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Game has potential, but in this state, its not ready for full release I would say.It needs a bit more work, and to fix some of the major issues:* The Menu UI has allot of problems, and crashes often, very difficult to use.* The game Only runs 60 FPS on 1080p.* Capped to 30 FPS on 1440p and 4K. :(* No option for any AA (Anti-aliasing) The feel of the Game is much like the previous Hunter Game, but now feels a bit warmer to the new players with the Tutorial in the beginning, and the added skill and leveling system.I will keep the game in my steam game library, and give the Devs some time to fix the major issues, and check back later.

												I was an avid fan of The original Hunter even with microtransactions, so when I heard about this game I was super pumped. The game doesn't disappoint for $30, there is still a good bit of bugs and gameplay fixes to be made but it's definitely playable. The new trick for this game is to run around until you hear a call then then hit the deck, call for the animal (if you can't call that animal, crouch and crawl to the sound being very careful not to spook it). Also aim for the neck for any animal except foxes and coyotes (this sucks if you know anything about hunting and the bread basket rule). Also don't listen to any of the asses complaining about this game, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. They're just a bunch of whiny children who have to nit-pick every small error in a game that just came out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quick review since I only owned the hunter for a day or so.. Pros-Great graphics-Great sounds-Pretty Realistic hunting experience-Multiplayer with friends is quite fun-Decent price-Has Potential-Devs care about our comments and reviewsCons-Menu/Exiting or changing servers can be quite frustrating. Possibly just my menu bugging out-Some animals act very abnormally (Shoot a moose and it runs in circles at 60km/h)-Buggy animals such as.. after shooting a deer it stays standing and alive but it's really dead.. animals getting caught on trees while running and keep running in place.. Shooting something 10 times with the right caliber point blank but it just walks away as if nothing happened.So far that is what I have experienced, I don't regret buying the game but I feel that it was released a bit quick, I see it more as a beta with alot of potential. The bugs have not happened very often to me yet so i'll stay positive because I feel this game has much potential. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Contrary to what my profile shows, I have more than 10 hours experience to back up my opinion of this game. I am not ashamed to admit that I bought this game today, and that I trialed it with an illegal copy of the game. Point is I've bought it now and at the time of writing this have tested it on version 1.11. I'm not even one to play many FPS games, let a alone an FPS game that simlulates hunting and as such requires you to be patient while moving veryyyyy slowly and cautiously so that you do not disturb your prey.  This is something new for me as a gamer who needs relatively paced gameplay with action at least every now and then. I was drawn in by this game's graphics presentation and this ultimately led me to try out the game. To my surprise, the gameplay also started to appeal to me after getting the hang of it and now I am convinced that this game deserves a try. If you like survival type games, rather come to this with a fresh perspective and you may enjoy theHunter for what it is and not for what it isn't. Also, there are several glitches that I have encountered but none were too detractive of the whole experience. My only gripe with this game so far is the inventory management system, which seems to bug out a lot depending on whether or not I am using KB/M or a controller at any given time. Devs, you have surpassed my expectations of this game, please fix these issues and more people will come to realise the potential of what you have made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is overall pretty fun,Pros:-Absolutely beatiful graphics and very well optimized. -Very realistic in all aspects.-Good value for what you get.-I think if you like hunting you will like this game.Cons:-In 10 hours the only bugs I found were with the sound of the game, the normal sounds are always there, but when it's music, sometimes rain, or even when you use a deer caller, somehow the sound gets glitchy, the deer caller I can't even hear it most of the times. This sound glitches don't often occur (besides the animal callers), but it can still be annoying.I think it's wise to follow the patches of this game, if the sound is fixed, it becomes an extremely good game for those who like hunting or wilderness.

												This game has lovely graphigs a few sound bugs that are easily fixeble. Runs at a smooth 60fps, It can get a bit stale with all the wainting and tracking can get frustrating. But when you finaly kill the animal you have stalked for so long it is so satisfying. I give this game a 7/10, I highly recomend it			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												 the best hunting game ever made in my opinion..!! it needs better performance tweeks. because if you have a computer with the minimum requirements you will probably be getting 3 fps on low settings :D l tried the game on my laptop with a i5 6700 and a gtx 950m and was getting 25 ish fps on low settings.!!   if you are a hunter in real life you will defenetly enjoy this game alot. it is not an arcade style gameplay like alot of hunting games out there. it is realistic. there is alot of bad first day reviews on here but l have belife in the devs that thay will pollish the game with patches.

But very very fun and nice to relax to and way better then the prevous hunter game! Also the grass is dynamic, and moves when you walk through it, Looks so good, Shoutout to who thought of that in the dev team			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game.  But let me start with the cons:Slowest walking simulator ever made.  They need to increase run speed by about 30%,  as, when you're traveling at running speed, you generally don't care if there is prey nearby that will run.  You're just trying to get where you're going.  And as there are no real ""save"" points, you always spawn at the last outpost you were at.  It can take forever to get from one place to another and it just takes tooooo lonnnng.   Maybe make it so you don't need to jump to get over fist-sized rocks when climbing uphill, while you're at it.  I shot a moose, which glitched out- shot it again, then again, at point blank, then it rand at lightspeed away into the distance.  F that moose.  At one point I jumped near a small waist-height tree and immediately died.  Game is buggier than a termite mound.  I wish you could save at any point, and start where you left off, or maybe have it autosave every 10-15 minutes in case the game crahes, instead of at your last outpost.  They're miles apart, and take forever to get back to, so if you do die jumping near a tiny tree, you're going to cry when you respawn miles away.Pros:Apex engine is beautiful.  If you have the gpu/cpu to rock this at ultra, it's stunning.  Audio is gorgeous as well,  it puts you right into it's world with all of the ambience you'd expect from a living forest.  Tracking and hunting remind me of Witcher 3 without all the Noonwraiths.  I've only been playing the Pacific NW-ish map, and I really like the mission-giving walkie-talkie guy.  It reminds me of firewatch, but not as linear, with no plot.   This is a great game to play when you're tired of getting smashed in the face in For Honor or need a break from anything competitive or serious.  It's calming, slow, and patient.  I have an i5 4670 and an R9 290, and can play this at 1440p with most settings at ultra but a few turned down.  Apex engine is beautiful - but demanding.  Another thing I wish they'd fix is the cost of items.  The progression system needs skin unlocks or something to motivate you while you save 30000 for that one rifle.  Plus skins are cool!  People love skins!Overall, there's a LOT to dislike, but TH:COTW still has somehow won me over.  There's a lot of heart in this game.  And a lot of shooting things in the heart, I suppose.  This will remain in my rotation as the game I play to chill after a stressful day.  Overall, recommended if you're looking for something different and don't mind early access (because that's what this really is, feels-wise).  If you have the cash, it's a fun diversion.  They've been steadily ironing out the bugs, and I look forward to future updates.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the game is fun and addictive, the graphics are great, a little buggy at times. there is a few things that I would love to seeI would love if there was other forms of transportaition.It would be nice if the doe had its own bleet call instead of using the same call as a buck for the mating call. like in real life lol.The animal AI should act more normal. Some of the walking sounds dont match the ground you walk on.Maybe the ability to walk slower with keyboard and mouse? Maybe a guide arrow that points in the dierection of the pin you place?also what are the random blue location markers?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's as step up from theHunter: Classic in some areas and a step back in others, however it's a good platform to build on like they did with Classic.Pros: - Updated graphics, some of the best scenery you will see in any game. - Hunting pressure, new mechanic to make it difficult to hunt in areas you've already hunted.- Improved animal behaviors. Animals will give warning calls, mating calls, and can be found in large heards.  There was also the addition of ""need zones"" that you can discover such as sleeping zones, drinking and feeding zones where you can find specific species at certain hours of the day.- Night hunting, with the help of a headlamp. - CoTW replaces a membership pay model of Classic with a RPG system that makes you gradually unlock new weapons and equipment through XP, also has a pretty neat skills/perks system that really adds some flavor to hunting. Cons: - Lacks the diversity of theHunter: Classic. Only 2 hunting reserves at the time of launch, a handful of weapons and a pretty small roster of game to hunt. - Scoring system seems wonky, not a huge fan of the ""consecutive harvests"" idea. The game awards senseless killing and not being patient and selective like it should be. - Small features like trophy shots and trophy galleries not available at this time. Guessing in the future? Not sure why something like this would be cut from the game.- Performance issues, some people complaining about crashes/bugs. Latest patch addressed some issues though.-  No mobile tree stands, or tents. You have to discover outposts around the map and use them to fast travel.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was an avid fan of The original Hunter even with microtransactions, so when I heard about this game I was super pumped. The game doesn't disappoint for $30, there is still a good bit of bugs and gameplay fixes to be made but it's definitely playable. The new trick for this game is to run around until you hear a call then then hit the deck, call for the animal (if you can't call that animal, crouch and crawl to the sound being very careful not to spook it). Also aim for the neck for any animal except foxes and coyotes (this sucks if you know anything about hunting and the bread basket rule). Also don't listen to any of the asses complaining about this game, they don't have a clue what they are talking about. They're just a bunch of whiny children who have to nit-pick every small error in a game that just came out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Game has potential, but in this state, its not ready for full release I would say.It needs a bit more work, and to fix some of the major issues:* The Menu UI has allot of problems, and crashes often, very difficult to use.* The game Only runs 60 FPS on 1080p.* Capped to 30 FPS on 1440p and 4K. :(* No option for any AA (Anti-aliasing) The feel of the Game is much like the previous Hunter Game, but now feels a bit warmer to the new players with the Tutorial in the beginning, and the added skill and leveling system.I will keep the game in my steam game library, and give the Devs some time to fix the major issues, and check back later.

												I don't understand as to why people are giving this negative review's. It's a really good looking game with really good gameplay. Better than other hunting games I have ever played.I just wonder what's the future of the game in term's of more weapon's, and other feature's. I hope they add thing's like ATV's and other offroad vehicles along with more maps that are bigger too. Aside from that the game is a worth a buy and is really gorgeous.--------edit review------------Ok so now I ran into some bugs, that being animals getting stuck on random terrain and weird spawn issues with deer. I came up on a hill and found like literally 15 fallow deer all just in one place and cant move. I went up close enough to actually be able to pet them. On the plus side, they look good. So far these issues seem to be something that is fixable in the near future.....but the forums don't allow us to post subjects. So this is a serious problem with communication.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This review is for solo play only, I haven't tried online play yet.  The game feels like early access (particularly because of the UI being unresponsive at times) but it is in a highly playable state at the moment. I've spent 5 hours so far, and I've enjoyed the title. Other than the UI occaisonally taking two clicks instead of one I've only seen one bug, A deer was stuck in a tree trying to run away. Not exactly the end of the world, as you see similar pathing errors pop up in Bethesda games. The environment is very well rendered, effects like tall grass getting stomped down as you walk through a field were a nice touch. Probably one of the most relaxing games involving shooting I've ever played. Provided support and development continues, this is well worth picking up. Particularly if you enjoyed the original 'TheHunter' but were put off by microtransactions. Wait if you're worried about the title being dropped, otherwise give it a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a amazing hunting game, it has very good graphics and sounds , its playability is very smooth , the map is so huge it seems endless , you start off with a low end bolt acition rifle which is meant for small game but it is possible too take large game down but you need a vital hit and a lil bit of tracking it down , but dont worry you can buy better weapons in time the game has ingame money that you earn from your kills , exsploring ,quest, selling certing stufff to a npc you may find on your journeys (note this on selling i havnt got to that point in the game but i heard that you can from a quest) and you allso get a reward by turning in historical artifact im thinking its pretty rare to find them i only found 1 myself , ok by doing all those things you gain XP so that you can lvl up your hunter you will get points to use for passive and your active tree perks.. im not saying this game is 100% prefect but to me it worth every penny for the amazing open world map .

												This is perhaps one of the prettiest games I have ever played. That being said , it's got alot of kinks to work out. 1) Some animals are complete morons. I call them and not only do they get close. They get close enough to touch and just stand there. Pretty easy to shoot a deer at 2 ft.2) Tracking is fun. But sometimes the deer path in such a way that actually trying to figure out were the deer is .. well is nearly impossible. Hopefully they will make it so you can erase tracks that you have already went over.3) Inventory and management of. It's a mess atm.4) Map. Why my game runs great until I pull up the map I'm not sure. But when I pull my map up it goes laggy. VERY laggy. AND 5 This is what brought my experince to a halt. For some reason now I can no longer reload my gun. FIRE my gun and do anything that requires me to use left mouse button. And my mouse is fine btw. Can't HUNT if I can't SHOOTHopefully they will patch  some fixes for this stuff. Some major and some minor. But I would advise maybe waiting for a bit until they fix stuff. But if you have the $30 to blow. Pick it up and look the amazing beauty they have made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Haven't play much of it yet so not a really reliable review.The game looks and feels great as far as a hunting game goes. Compared to other hunting games that are all arcade point and shoot, this game is as close to real hunting that most gamers will get to. Having an open world where you can go wherever you want or shoot whatever you want is really all most people ask for in a hunting game. A few things I have noticed:-Deer dont seem to walk and act like deer, although they are still huntable.-The Sound effects are awful. Like minecraft sound awful. In a game where you are trying to sneak up on a deer, the slowest footstep I can manage sounds like Im kicking gravel down the driveway.A few things the game needs:-FISHING!!! The number of ponds and lakes that look perfect for fishing is immense. Add fishing to this game and why would I ever play another game?-More animals. Aside from basic deer, moose, elk and bear you can hunt foxes and coyotes. Also Buffalo. I noticed a distict lack of bird hunting. Ambient birds are loud and annoying and deserve to be shot.-Polish. The game is good, really good. but there are things here and there that need shining. If the devs are still updating we can only hope the game gets better.Don't let anyone talk you out of this game because of glitches or bugs or because it's hard to kill or track. Hunting isn't easy IRL.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Feel like pro hunter!!This hunting game absolutely sandbox and open world. Though there are some mission to boost your xp and cash, you are not forced to do that. You can traveling around the map and kill as many animals. 90% of this game is tracing the animals track. Lurking at their ""needs"" area, hit them, and track them then get the trophy. Get the exp to obtain new skills and weapon perks. There are still many room for improvement in this game like, weapon type, tools and gadget. Hope the dev often release new equipment and map. 9/10 for hunting game. Best hunting game i've ever played. Pro : - Stunning Graphic, environment and sound- Animal AI overall is good- HUGE MapCons :- Still many minor bugs like suddenly slow motion (not fps drop)- Animal stuck at tree - Lack choice of Weapon and Equipment- slow weapon/equipment change. it takes 4-5 seconds to change from rifle to binocular (not a fps drop) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So i've not played that much yet, but i think i've played enough to give it a pretty fair review.The game is great, it takes everything from classic and improves upon it and removes those damned microtransactions.I had a blast playing and it was thrilling and very rewarding to track down a level 6 black bear... except for it wasn't and the bear was actually stuck in som foilage. The game is pretty buggy right now and when i finally found another black bear the UI glitched out and i couldn't get my rifle back after I had tried to switch to a new one. The devs really went all in with this game and it shows. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are realistic and easy to distinguish from the ambience, and the voice acting is really good. Give this game a try and you wont get dissapointed. The devs will probably fix the current glitches soon, but even if they don't it's still a great game and you should try it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really like this game, I think it's a great hunting game and can be full of surprises and twists, like hunting a bear for a hour and it charges you from a under brush that's really cool, but what I HATE about this game is the ridiculous game breaking bugs that are abound everytime I log in. Such as not being able to switch to any guns or calls, tracks that are stupidly inaccurate and a stick pile that my friend got stuck on and died in (check my screenshots), oh and I almost forgot the crashes. But this game is promising and is fun if none of those things happen to you and I really hope the Devs get on this game and make it as best as it can be. (I reccomend because there is no middle ground option if there was I would put this review there)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												We know why you are here. Lets just get this out of the way right now. This has some of the most beautiful environments I've ever seen in a game. If you love the outdoors as much as I, then you where probably equally pained throughout the Elder Scroll's laughable attempts at wilderness. Skyrim's best just wasn't real enough for me. It all looked... unnatural, as if someone who had never been outdoors looked at pictures. The great outdoors got that name for a reason. This game understands. Freaking. Gorgeous. I play on Ultra with a measly 8gigs of Ram, GTX 970 and an i5 6400. It runs great. If the optimization is buggy, I havn't noticed.Next up, if you like hunting games, your options are fairly limited. The Hunter Classic, Cabela's Hunts, maybe Hunting Unlimited if you can stomach the ancient graphics and mechanics. Now The Hunter Classic is a favorite of mine, despite my low play time, it rocked. I'm currently getting into Bowhunting IRL, and when I play these types of games, I'm looking at Bows only. Make of that what you will.The Hunter Classic had a variety of weapons, animals, and reserves. In comparison CotW, is pretty underwhelming. TWO BOW TYPES!? WHAT IS THIS HERESY!? Not even a recurve, or a longbow, or more compound... just a beginner compound and a high end. A real shame, as I really like variety and the challenge that a recurve provides. Same with Shotguns, hope you weren't looking for a large variety here. Seems the devs liked rifles more, and it reflects in the quests, some require super long range shots... which rules out bows and shotties. You get a paltry two reserves.... but they are pretty dang massive. I'd say they are equal to ... the alaskan one from the Hunter Classic in size. Lots of little things to find, and things to do. Shed Hunting, Feed ground spotting, camp finding, dozens of quests, Animal variety is ... fairly small in comparison to the hunter classic. I don't think the game has Grizzly, Wolves, or some of the varieties of Elk and Deer. I also didn't notice ANY waterfowl, or turkey. Although the ambient animals are significantly improved. Lots more birds, rabbits, squirrels ( I think that's what it was.. scared the alcohol right out of me.)So what about the important stuff? The actual hunting? Its superb. When it works. The game seems to have alot more wildlife than the Hunter Classic, so you are in the thick of it pretty much every step. Hit that caller and watch a group of four just wander in. Its probably not realistic, but it gets you into the hunt much quicker. ...now if you don't have any experience with hunting games, you probably will make the mistake of thinking that the .243 you start with is somehow effective at hunting.You would be wrong.The .243 modeled in this game and the Hunter Classic is a pea-shooter, that probably shouldn't be allowed on Deer, I have no experience with .243 in real life, but if you don't make a perfect shot, expect that deer to run for quite a ways. Its a beginner gun, do not expect them to drop with one shot unless you hit the sweet spot behind the front legs kinda near the knee. God help you if you take pot shots at a bear... like I did. 4-6 shots to put down a charging bear is not pretty. You ideally want to upgrade pretty much immediately. Men use bows, as our anscestors did. Real Men use Recurves as god intended, but the developers are clearly not as concerned as I. Point is, the beginner rifle will give you a bad impression if you are new to hunting. Stick with it. ... then get a bow. ;) Nothin like taking that perfect bow shot up close, and watching that buck drop....oh and this might as well be a beta for how buggy it is. I have numerous screenshots in my 3 hours of play of animals getting stuck on vegetation. Really the only bug I've found. If an incredibly annoying one. You spook an animal it will sometimes just fly right into a bush or tree and get stuck. The Hunter Classic had some great bug fixing, so I'm hoping this gets fixed. We shall see. Oh and the tutorial is absolutely terrible. If you are new too hunting, please for the love of god youtube some videos. Animals are smart. You have to be to get them. Calls, Stalking, Tree Stands, and an incredible amount of patience apply here.FINAL VERDICT TOO LONG DIDN'T READ: Lack of weapons. Lack of Reserves. Fantastic game, gorgeous environments, pretty buggy, so unless you LOVE to hunt (Like me.) I would wait for a sale. That being said, I HIGHLY reccomend this game if you are into the hunt.

												i cannot recommend buying this game at this point.i am a hunter irl. i like hunting games.this game has the best graphics i have seen in a hunting game its amazing sounds and animals react very well but.i have met 5 animals that was running into rocks and they where not able to run around them i chould walk up to them and go around them, they where just running in the same place. ive got kicked off a cliff by the game. ive been killed by a bench at one of the look out's. the fall damage is messed up, you can fall 20 meters down without taking damage. there is way to many bugs in the game for me to recommend buying this game at its current state.

												I like it... Probably one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The landscapes are beautiful, and I really feel like I'm walking in a dense forest or an open field. And the rush of getting that perfect look on the animal and placing the round right where it needs to be is just amazing. The game is like a rollercoaster, at first you are bored and kinda tired of tracking things down and then BAM! Huge buck outta no where and you slam him down to the ground and 20hrs go by lol. But.. sadly it has its issues.. Lots of bugs, sometimes the textures don't blend right (I noticed the road hovers above the ground a touch) and things don't make sense like the soft rounds saying they do more pentration but its supposed to be the polymer rounds. Yea.. there is a lot of stuff that I could say bad, but I won't. Cause this game is good, but it feels like a good solid foundation. I hope and pray the devs give this game lots of love... and keep patching and adding to it for a long time. Cause if they do, this will be the greatest hunting game of all time. Please, please keep showing love this game and support the community and I promise the community will show the love right back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing only about 10 hours worth of gameplay I believe what this dev team has done is WAY beyond any other hunting game has done in years. Everything from the evironment and animals to the weapons and (tracking / blind) hunting mechanics just feels so crisp and real. I loved my time hunting in real life and I don't believe there is a more accurate experience than this.But of course the only proplem with this game is the bugs, lots of bugs. But the Dev team is constantly in contact with their customers and are doing their absolute best to make this the best hunting game of the decade.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Makes one recall the time spent playing Deer Hunter 2004 in their childhood.Didn't really like the previous theHunter games as they were free but required microtransactions for anything to be accomplished, but thankfully there isn't a single one in this game. Everything is earned in the gameplay itself, which is bloody marvellous.Another plus one such as myself appreciates greatly is the single-player (there is an option for multiplayer), which as the name would suggest doesn't require internet to play. It's great for us Australians stuck with less than 50kb/s internet on peak. The story on campaign is fairly neat too, thus far.For the price it's currently at (AUD$40), I'd consider it worth it. If it's on sale, I'd highly reccommend grabbing it. Consider the game for it's graphics alone if hunting isn't your thing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is worth the $30 and it is a great improvement over the last game.Pros:-No microtransaction (everything can be unlocked relatively easily, to those saying it takes ages you just have to stop scaring away everything you are about to shoot, I've unlocked 2 new rifles in 10 hours of gameplay)-Beautiful graphics (the optimisation however isn't the best for example having too many points marked on the GPS can cause lag when the GPS is open)-Easily the most realistic hunting sim (weapon ballistics, correct hitboxes for each animal)-Multiplayer is very easy to setup and is p2p (just invite your friend to your game and they'll be able to join)-Very nice sounds-Very large map and nicely decoratedCons:-Animals sometimes stand in place (haven't encountered this since patch though)-Average optimisation-Some animals for example rabbits and birds can be killed but you cannot harvest their bodies-You make way more noise than you should (having a walk button that makes you slower and quiter could solve this)-Sometimes the tracks are pointing in the wrong direction-Bears attacking you is a bit glitchy-Some form of campaign/storyline which is nice however they're basically just quests to go do thingsThings you should know before buying:-Only 14 different weapons without around 2-3 ammo types for each-This is a very slow paced game so you'll probably find yourself getting frustrated if you're sprinting around looking for animals to shoot-Map is very large and there isn't any vehicles however when you claim an outpost you can fast travel between them-Your shots can ricochet off animals and you'll probably get mad and think it is a bug like I did the first time it happened-It helps to know how to hunt in real life-Knowing where to aim is key-Ballistic system-RPG like leveling up and skill system however they don't make much of a difference-High end system is probably needed-This game has controller supportSo yes I recommend this game at it's current price of $30 with no microtransactions ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												**DISCLAIMER** This is NOT going to be a serious, well structure review so if that is something you are looking for then you are better off scrolling on.Call of the wild is my first real hunter game I've gotten into, I dabbled in the free to play version but once you realise how much of a sting all the micro-transations are then it can be an instant turn off for loads of people, including myself. But then this beauty comes along, a one time payment, everything in the game is unlocked and available to use (Outside of the ingame currency earned) and there is room for DLC in the future. I really hope they don't take the mick with it though.Gameplay wise I find it very pleasing, tailing and calling in prey to be shot is really satisfying, especially if the kill is a beauty. Patience is a virtue in this game thats for sure.Graphically it is stunning, you can check my profile for some of the screen shots but this game really has some stunning moments in the game, all made available to capture through the ingame camera (for added feels). If it isn't the wildlife that grabs your attention it is the landscape!A few bugs I've noticed so far is sometimes the hitscan seems way off, I'll aim for the vital organs but when I claim the trophy ive shot right up the poop shaute.. Another is that the callers seem to bug and wont go off when used. I'm unsure if this is an audio thing or if it actually doesn't work in game when the item is used. Lastly I've had a really rare bug where I can't toggle to other eequipment. It isn't holdstered and the symbol in the bottom right will change but the character won't take out the respective equipment nor is it able to be used.Overall I love this game, and I am sure to have many more hours! As mentioned I just hope DLC isn't something that takes the mick over time.. Last thing steam needs is another Train Simulator DLC mockery!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At its current state I can't recommend the game. I'll be waiting for updates and may change my review. Too many frustrating bugs are present in the release. Who knew you could instantly die from slowly walking into a boulder?UPDATE 1:Many, many bugs. Animals keep running in circles and get stuck behind objects. Finally scored that big game you wanted? Too bad, because we won't allow you to claim it. Love the sound of your rifle going off at that climatic moment? Too bad, because we won't play it. And so on and so on.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After read so much evalutions and the developer replies, I decide to buy this game base on the actively developer communication. Most reviews had focused on the BUG and crashe problems so far, I hople that further updates could make this a  better game. Looking forward to edit my reply after hours of gaming time.------------------------------------------------------------------------------The first two hours of game: the first two animals I got was two female deers which was stick into trees and I walk to the in front of the deers and then aim, shoot.-----what a newbie treating!The third animal I got was a bear! I was little bit of scared of the first time hunting this big and wild beast! I aimed from 20M far, I was too afraid to get any closer. Left mouse cliking, I got her. Then the gaint wild beats stick into a rock and yet keep running away from my bloody gun. I walked into the bear slowly and give her more shoots-------what a newbie treating!------------------------------------------------------------------------------Keep looking forward to edit my reply aft more gaming time.

												So I love this game. I'm biased I love hunting IRL, The game needs some features to make sure it lives up to the hypeOf the most realistic hunting sim, .Fix the bugs that are already In - I understand this will take time..Trophy shot. .Mobile stands? .hunting pressure issues.bow hunting issues - sights. (Area to train) - also hitting a 50kg for from 10m with a 70lb bow would go straight through..Selling ability for weapons. I have almost all of them and I use for them..swimming - common sense, I can swim he should swim.Possible vehicles? - boat? Atv? At the moment the game has a lot of issues. Patch 1.5 saw frame rates drop a solid 30-40per second.Animals are bugged out, and generally the game doesn't run fully smooth.All this said. The game is awesome! I'm hooked. Massive thumbs up. Keep getting the work in and you will have a product people love! Just don't go back to that horrid Pay to Play days.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Currently at 20 hours of gampelay in this and I can understand why the game is recieving mixed reviews.First off: Bugs. Yes there are bugs. The game was JUST released and by a developer who is small compared to other developers. Give them time. They actively listing to the community and review what is said. Bugs will be fixed, have patience.Some feel this game should be marked as early access. I personally disagree, for what it has it feels like a functional game, it just needs some patches/hotfixes. It is a full working game for the most part.The graphics are absolutely stunning, even on the lowest setting.If you've played The Hunter (Classic) you know what to expect, tracking, tracking, more tracking and finally the kill shot. This plays similar but the maps are MUCH larger. Hirschfelden is at least 6 times larger (IMO), the classic map itself is contained in the North East to give you an idea of size.It has a decent amount of weapons, good selection of rifles, handguns, shotguns, and bows. All the necessary callers/scents for the current animals, and they will be adding more as they expand their reserves, why wouldn't they? Look at how many animals and reserves they have in Classic.If you've never played The Hunter (Classic), this is not like other first person shooters, though I hope that would be obvious enough to not have to say. Keeping in mind that the Dev's will be releasing more content, and If I remember correctly the price should stay at ~$30, compare the average cost for the Classic game: weapons, outfits, membership fees, all the reserves and animals possible to hunt. You'd be talking potentially upwards of $60 if not even more (I've sunk more than I care to admit into that game and I still love it). $30 is NOT a lot compared to that, and it's on a more modern engine with planned content being made.For weapons each rifle and pistol comes with two different ammunition types that, I feel, are a little too similar right now. Shotguns still have three types of rounds.Animals now have different classes that are used for them (0-4 currently). 0 being Coyotes and Foxs, 4 being bears and bison. Weapons have a specific class type that can be used for any animal of the same class or higher (not effeciently), if you use a higher class weapon against a lower class animal it will ruin the integrity, causing lower payout and score (potentially score).Bows on the other hand have 3 ammo types, where each ammo type is a different class. I find that interesting because it makes it more versitile. Bows now take some getting used to due to the now random arrow off-set that can happen (The in-game dev's themselves state it is NOT the aim wobble but a different calculation) but is still a VERY powerfull weapon.All in all, I'd say $30 is definitely a very fair price for the game, in it's current status and obviously as more content gets released.EDIT: Forgot to add: NIGHTTIME HUNTING! I totally forgot about this. The game includes a FULL night/day cycle and you have a headlamp that is used to find tracks at night. This actually provides a bit more challenge because you can only see the tracks one of two ways: Stumbling over it or looking around with the headlamp on. I love the increased difficulty of this because it makes it more fun in my opinion. Couple that with the weather cycle that was heavily improved on compared to Classic (wind can affect your scent direction and distance, but also make you harder to hear), Fog makes you more difficult to see, and Rain can also affect how difficult you are to hear.

												This game certainly has some strong qualities. Great graphics. Excellent lighting effects, weather effects etc.Really large map. Nice weapons and accessories.Tracking system is not overcomplicated.But it also has some weak qualities. No vehicles on a ridiculously large map. You have to walk everywhere. All of the time. It's so boring sometimes when you just want to go from point A to point B.The level progression is insanely slow, to the point where it can take days to get a new weapon. No way to pause the game, literally, none. You can't rest without paying the money you earned from hunting. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in a video game. In the current state I do not recommend this game. It is good for just relaxing instead of going fast paced like in most games, but other than that it needs some serious improvements in those areas.EDIT: Still giving it a go. I just went up a tower to survey the land, with the intent on finding the nearest hunting camp afterwards. Fell off the tower, now I have to walk nearly 2KM to get to the new camp. All because there are nowhere near enough fast travel points. This is the main problem with this game. I hope things get better because once a few of these issues are fixed this could be one of the best games ever.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I really would like to give this game a good review. It's obviously made by professionals, and has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, it's just not possible to recommend someone spend $30 on this. There are too many bugs, and they're not just minor nuisances. It's irritating when the game starts up and the mouse cursor isn't locked to the screen, or you're just given the view from a player camera frozen in the air and you have to restart. I don't like it when you place a waypoint and it acts strangely, or the screen of your smart device disappears, or when you have to click a menu element five times to get it to respond. But when animals don't react to your presence, or when you shoot them and they freeze in place like statues that soak up your bullets, there's just no point in playing. The game's just broken, and you shouldn't buy something that's broken. Bugs aside, the only complaint I have is that the game is trying to be as realistic as possible, but the geometry of the terrain is just generic video game terrain that doesn't even remotely resemble reality. They could salvage the game at some point, but right now, don't buy it.Update:I originally posted this review after about 4 hours of play, and I had already encountered all of those bugs. I stuck with it, mostly to have something to do while I listen to podcasts, and the bugs just keep coming. No part of this game isn't broken. Every UI element, every interaction, every game mechanic is flat-out broken. It would be one thing if this game was in early access, but selling this a finished product is a stretch, if not downright deceptive. If they honestly believe this is a finished product, then they must not be anticipating doing the amount of work it would take to just be able to say it's not broken. That is worrisome.

												+10 hours since release and im enjoying the game so far. I havent tried the multiplayer yet so this is going to be mostly a single player focused review. For starters the game launched pretty sloppy for many, including my self, and many of the issues are still prevelent such as graphical glitches, crashes, and AI issues, sound issues. Since launch the game has felt like a unpolished beta rushed to meet a release deadline.The game over all plays pretty well for those who are a fan of The Hunter and already know what to expect. For new comers to the series It might be the only start to The Hunter they can enjoy since Classic has more of a F2P/P2W business model behind it and isnt very welcoming to new players since they are locked out of 95% of the great content in the game. If you are new to the series i would recommend picking this game up over playing classic first, if you are not a new commer to the The Hunter you might find this game a tad bit lacking in terms of equipment and features (dogs, tents, stands, tripods, scents, callers, birds, ducks, geese, blinds) so it wont fill those voids if you've enjoyed +100 hours with those features in your hunts. The game offers two reserves to hunt on and a wide array of equipment to use and animals to track and spot, Every animnal you harvest is awarded with XP and cash based on the difficulty of the animal, the weapon used and the shot placement and whether or not the animal died instantly or bled out over time. New features to the game are the new stealth mechanic, sight and sound now play an important factor as well as smell, the noob friendly meters on the HUD will show you how visible or how noisy you are in the environment, i found that the controller utilized these features better than traditional K/M. Progression in The Hunter is very different from other games and very time consuming, and given the unpredictiblity of many animals the game does not reward simple tasks and you will find yourself grinding or side tracked many times. A few new features to the game are ""need zones"", areas where animals migrate or congregate based on there needs at that specific time of day. NIght time hunting is also a new feature, hunting at night is alot more challenging than during the day you will find yourself wandering the game world following tracks since animals are usually quieter during the night. The new features in CofW are refreshing and a good reason to pick the game up if you like simulation or hunting games. Over all the core elements play well.  The game ran fine on a single Zotac GTX 980 on ultra for the most part with a Gsync display and Vsync turned on for many hours on end so its not a very demanding game if youve still got an older gen card in your machine. I have yet to test the game in SLi but for the most part it runs well without SLi.In review, The Hunter CotW is essentialy a bare bones experience of The hunter classic with an updated game engine and graphics and some unique gameplay features. I can see this game being polished and packaged really well in the future with a handful of updates and DLCs but for now you will only be getting a fraction of what The Hunter Classic has to offer currently.Graphics: 8/10Gameplay:7/10Features:7/10Content:6/10Over all: 7/10A solid game for sim lovers and hunters alike.

												Wow what an utter disappointment! The game was over-hyped and obviously rushed out in incomplete state. Numerous game breaking bugs and constant crashes everywhere! No matter how good it looks this is actually a downgrade from The Hunter Classic in terms of hunting experience. The Hunter CotW feels arcadey at best. no Trophy shots or display of any sort. Antler system is non-existant meaning you have dozens of deer clones running around, getting stuck in mid air...What an utter fail of a game launch. Out there with Arkham Knight dissaster for me!Refunding until the game is fixed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Me and the family decided to take a camping trip but after buying this, I told my wife to take a friend. Btw ppl stop being so lazy, the whole point in hunting is it takes time like fishing, you can't just run through the forest hoping to spot one, take it easy walk slow watch your sounds.  Only bugs I've noticed are when pulling up the map, sometimes you get big letters but it fixes fast and I have seen 1 deer get stuck on a rock. Over all this is best tracking and hunting experience in a game so far.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks beautiful and the sound is amazing. Great imersion. However, this product was not ready for release. It is full of bugs and it still crashes, although some patches was made to adress this. Furthermore, animals sometimes run in strange cirkles, gets stuck or suddenly spawn or despawn.Now, after more than 70 hours of playing I would really want to recommend this game. The good moments are sooo good. But unforlunatly they are overshadowed by the major bugs. I want to love this game. Hopefully, after some more patches, I might.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I figured I would write a review solely base upon the mixed ratings.- This game definitely has it's bugs, but none of them have been absolutely game-breaking.- Expansive Worlds has made a step in the right, non-greedy direction.- You'll want a fairly beefy computer, but performance isn't as bad as some people make it out to be. (I'm getting 60 FPS on average, with the occasional drop to 50. Specs on my Profile)- Graphics are seriously phenominal. The game really looks like the screenshots. I haven't played a game of such large scale that manages to accomplish as much detail as this game.- Some story-mode/quest missions available that give the game a little more direction and challenge.If you want the game, I would recommend it. Some of the negative reviews seem a little harsh. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL:DR - Its the most beautiful game you will ever see. The screenshots barely do it justice. Gameplay is pretty good, just what you'd expect from a hunting game. Multiplayer is very fun and easy to get into.-------------------------------------------Hands down, without question, THE MOST jaw-droppingly gorgeous game I have ever played. Turn your graphics up, your sound up, headphones on and just close your eyes. Its amazing. I moved out from the shadow of a tree into the sunlight and I would swear to you, I felt my arm get warm. THAT'S what kind of immersion this game delivers. You are going to walk around, ALOT. But once you come across the huts, you can resupply and fast travel between any you've unlocked. Hunting feels rewarding and frustrating at the same time. You need to move slowly, keeping an eye on your sound levels, but its only natural to want to ""hurry up"" and catch your prey. I found that after hearing an animal call out, it was easier to take up a good position, use my caller and wait for it to come to me. Multiplayer is very easy to get into and the fact that its up to 8 player co-op is pretty awesome. You can team up or go your own seperate ways and hunt ""alone."" You can even issue challenges and compete against one another. The mechanics themselves can be a big grindy. You need to make sure you try your best to take down your target with one hit so that it goes down quick and clean. You're pay for the kill will change depending on those parameters. It definitely takes awhile to unlock the weapons but everything is available ingame, no micro transactions.Shooting feels pretty good. Once you kill your animal and track it down (if you dont kill it outright) you can actually see where the bullet entered, what body parts it hit etc etc. Overall, I recommend it. Its absolutely gorgeous, 9/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Waited a long time for this game and fortunately it turned out to be everything I hoped it would be. There are some bugs and issues, but none have been in any way gamebreaking for me. The important stuff works.So here's some of the things that are great:- The visuals and sounds are gorgeous in every way and there's nice variety in locations.- The chase gives you the same kind of thrills as when you go hunting for real.- Tracking is done properly and is quite enjoyable.- Player movement and gunplay is spot on.- The statistics info on the harvested animal is done properly.Some small things that still need some improvement:- The menu and keybinds have some problems- Gear needs a lot more variety, since now there's only a fraction of the items from the original. But I guess that's the DLC plan...- Sneaking feels a bit dodgy and the vagueness of the movement sound UI doesn't help. Makes it a lot more difficult to track wounded animals.- The animal AI sometimes does funny things like gets stuck on things.- Freaked out wounded animals run around way too fast compared to the real thing.- It feels like the bleeding mechanic also needs a bit of tweaking. If you miss all the critical target hitboxes, the animal always bleeds at the ""Very low"" bleed rate, even with clear head- or gut shots. Also, wounds bleed more if you run, so running speed should affect the bleed rate.- I would prefer vehicles (or a horse) over fast travel any day.Conclusion: A very enjoyable hunting game and I expect it only to get better.

I see there are a couple of bugs (Main thing is that I noticed is the blood trails and tracks can be weird at sometimes) but if the developers fix everything and add more animals, locations and guns it will be the best hunting game made on pc by far. Another thing is that I feel like there should be atvs or some faster way to transport and adding like a hardcore mode where u have to eat and stuff would be pretty cool, as well as fishing!

												This should have been an easy recommendation. A lighter, better looking, more polished version of a great hunting game I've been enjoying for years. At first it seemed that's exactly what it was, but further playing revealed that the stealth system is totally busted, making it nearly impossible to stalk something using a keyboard. Prone movement on totally open grass should not be scaring deer into running off when they're over 100 meters away. Making as slow of movements as you can, avoiding foliage even, should not cause you to make the maximum amount of noise possible. Yet this is exactly what happens, all the time.If this problem is fixed, I'd love to revisit the game, but as it is now, it's just fundamentally broken.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game just came out, so use common sense and know there is going to be bugs instead of spending your money thinking its perfect.2. Im sure they will update the game so people should stop complaining about no competitions or trophy shot system. Just be patient.3. The game looks great atm4. It IS playable, just some bugs here and there, but it is somewhat arcade style atm. Im sure this is subject to change later on.5. Have a good PC. It's not always the games fault that it crashes as soon as you join. For the short time I have been playing I have had no crashes because I have a decent PC.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have a decent set of headphones and I know the direction of sound but apperently if a sound only appears in my left ear its infont of me ?My gun went quiet while shooting ?

												First off, to explain why I recommend this game:If you have been waiting for a hunting game to relive the old times like back in Deer Hunter 2005, this may just be it. However, if you are invested in theHunter Classic and have played that, you may want to stick with that for a while.As many have said, this game feels like a Beta title. The bugs are there, and while I haven't had anything game-breaking, they are still there. First, this game is beautiful. Just walking around, taking in the sights is a great experience that I find extremely relaxing.But, I have a few small gripes with the game in my playtime so far. For one, I feel like the animal AI is strange. The deer move at such a rapid pace, and trot around way more often than I believe is realistic. Even in the Hunter classic the deer were more docile and seemed to behave more realistic than this. I feel like tracking a deer is extremely difficult if not impossible. Granted, it should not be easy, but I feel like they just move too fast for you to effectively keep up.The noise mechanic is a nice feature of this game. However, I feel that the player character moves way too fast and makes too much noise. Sure, you must be careful and walk slowly, but I feel that crouch-walking the entire time is just not realistic/feasible. In real life, I can walk more carefully and tread lightly when needed. I know there are perks that can reduce walking noise, but it makes it hard to even kill anything and get to level up to get those skills. And then, since you have to crouch walk, you either cannot see the animals you are searching for, or you cannot keep up with a trail as the deer are moving away.I'm not saying we need slow moving, deaf zombie deer, but I think it still needs a little work.Now, I still recommend this game. I'm not a Hunter Classic player myself, but seeing how the devs have stuck with that game for so long gives me hope that they plan for this one to be around for a while too. I know tHuner Classic's subscription model might have been why they stuck with it for so long, so we will have to see. I do still have hope that they will fix this game and make it much better. The Hunter Classic 7 years ago would be laughable compared to what it is today. Let's hope they apply that work ethic to this title as well.If you're looking for a solid hunting game, that you can pay once for and get a full game, then I think this is your game... Once all of the wrinkles have been ironed out. But, if you're like me and just can't wait to jump in and scratch that hunting itch, then go for it! I will update this review as time goes on to see how well the devs keep up and fix the game, hopefully making it better!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Shot a fallow deer 5 times, tracked it for over 1 real time hour, game crashed before I found it. 10/10 too much waterEDIT:TL;DR - Enjoyable, feels like a beta but very pretty with an iffy interface, less of a hunting game and more an animal shooting game. Bows are OP. No microtransactions.After putting more time into this, I feel I can write a proper and serious review. At the time of writing, this game functions like beta. That said, despite being riddled with bugs and occasional crashes (though your mileage may vary on bugginess) this game is a graphically superb and worthy sibling to theHunter Classic, and I don't regret my purchase. My only major complaint is that they somehow managed to be less realistic in this game than Classic with both the general feel of the game and with animal behaviors - I feel I can describe it best in the way that Diablo 3 is not a dungeon crawler like D2, but a very large loot run. Similarly, you are placed in the vast reserve (and I do mean vast, the maps are colossal) with free reign over a never-ending hunt. It doesn't feel like hunting to me, it feels like animal shooting. Veterans of theHunter Classic (or even other hunting games, I suppose) might understand better than someone fresh to the genre. Animals, particularly female deer, are still dumb as walking rocks with the added bonus of sometimes running you over on accident in their zeal to be the first to stand as close to you as possible. Bright side? They don't seem to magnetize toward you anymore - they go where the call was and stick around the immediate area. You're free to sprint like a madman with (seemingly) little consequence. In fact, it seems rewarding by the warning calls provided by animals, alerting you to their rough location. Just crouch and spam your callers. Move toward them for increased efficiency. Animals also seem to be very nonchalant about gunfire, even within ranges where they would probably reasonably hear it. They also seem to not mind returning to the same area where you butchered several herd members already. That said - the hunting pressure system seems to mostly work. Animals outside the group (if there was one) you killed from are very unlikely to enter the area when attracted to calls or scents. They do, on occasion, wander through to get somewhere else, though.So far, weapons handle reasonably well and have satisfying sounds and animations, though I personally find the kick-up of recoil to sometimes be laughably extreme as an avid hunter in real life. The .243 is not as woefully pathetic as in Classic, and will absolutely do the work you need it to (until you can get the .270. Get it.). However, I recommend polymer tip bullets when available. They are a pleasant step up from the standard soft points, but certainly not a critical upgrade. Bows, however, seem grossly overpowered at the moment. Flesh wounds will have deer bleeding out in times comparable to decent rifle shots.The interface is a bit cumbersome and lacks information (e.g. current weapon scores outside of the shop, experience until next level, return to main menu button) that I would like to have access to, although this is more of a personal gripe than a point against the game. Most of the nitpicky issues I have with menus and interface are personal beyond being unrefined. The map also has the tendency to find itself focused on anywhere except where you are when opened.If I sound harsh on this game, it's not because these are glaring faults that should dissuade you from buying. This is a good game for the state it's in, but realize that it does have issues. I can recommend this to veterans of Classic that want a more streamlined and immediate hunting experience without fussing through menus and launchers or simply want to support Avalanche and Expansive Worlds. It's more of theHunter, what can I say? If you're on the fence or new to this series, perhaps stick with Classic until this game is fleshed out more.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When it works it's great, huge maps, great graphics. However, the current state of the game is game breakingly buggy. The menu screens have memory leaks for some, the inventory screens don't work, freeze, and don't transfer items for a lot of people. As of right now, with almost 6 hours into my save, the inventory system has locked all of the ammo into storage, and since it's bugged out and I can't retrieve it, it's effectively made it impossible for my to play any longer without starting a new save game.I like the game a lot so far overall, but until the bugs are all fixed I highly recommend holding off on purchasing this. Give it a month or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was excited for this game, but it has been a huge let down.Reasons to not buy this game/delay your purchase until patches are released:- Terrible optimization (I have a powerful PC, even on the lowest settings it isn't great. I currently use a R9 390 so Gameworks is suspected to be the issue, no surprise there)- Game breaking bugs (spawning outside of the map, spawning under the map, being stuck on the world screen)- Buggy menus (half the time menu category buttons do nothing when clicked)- Broken sound (any items I use including the rifle make no sound at all, even when the world ambience is working fine)- Clunky animations (e.g. when reloading the right arm of the player model has a muscle spasm)I'm sure after a few updates these issues will be resolved, but releasing a product in a state like this shows that the Avalanche hasn't given Expansive enough time to release a functional game. Will update this review when the game has improved.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been watching this game since it went into Beta. The graphics look great, but the developers just fall short on the basics...- 3440x1440 has message boxes showing up off screen. Only the edges can be seen, while all of the text and general data is offscreen. Making it much harder to tell what is going on in game. Wide screen and custom resolutions are just basic functionality that should simply work on ANY PC game. If you don't support custom or at least standard resolutions, then you can't really call yourself a PC game in my opinion.- Going prone on an incline causes a graphical glitch allowing you to see through the world. How did this ever make it through both QA and Beta? This is another bug dealing with basic functinality. How do you produce a game that allows for prone and crawling and never once notice the clipping? Either that or they were simply too incompetent to fix it, neither of which is a good sign.- AI got stuck in the water. Two deer were walking in the water and just got stuck on nothing. While this bug is a little more forgivable given that these types of bugs generally require very specific locations/actions, on top of other basic functionality it all just points to Devs who either don't care about the quality of the game, or who are too incompetent to ensure the quality of the game. In either case I do not recommend buying it, though I will say it looks beautiful when it isn't glitching out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well lets start with specs.MSi Z97 Gaming 5 MoboG.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 16GBIntel Core i7 4790K Devil's CanyonCooler Master Hyper 212 HSFUFSP Group Aurum Gold 750wMSi GTX 960 Gaming 4G (x2) in Sli2x 250gb Samsung Evo 850 SSD - Raid 01x 500gb Samsung Evo 850 - StorageWindows 10 OSWith my current PC setup I have 0 issues with running on ultra 1440p as far as graphics are concerned.The game itself is beautiful and very detailed.  I can't say that I have seen a hunting game with better graphics.  The inital tutorial (If you use it)  was very straight forward and gives you good information in regards to gameplay.  Full controller support is a + but I didnt see any tutorial telling you how to better learn the controls if using a gamepad.  I opted for mouse and keys after discovering how clunky the controls felt on the 360 controller.Played the game and streamed it for a good 7 hours solid on launch day.  During the time playing I noticed more flaws then animals.  The deer seemed to be more responsive to calls then in classic.  They will literally run up withing 10m of you just to immediatly spook and run away.  So keep your eyes peeled for that and make sure you dont call them in when they are slowly heading your direction or they may just run right to you.Huntermate bug.  Having the huntermate in your hand and then pressing H to hide equipment swapping around then pressing Tab to bring up the huntermate actually brings up what looks like the face of an otterbax that your phone has fallen out of!   Whats this?!  Sure you can Tab around and get it back easily but hmmm.People with a poor quality internet connection, or beloew requirement PC can still play.  But be aware that you will Croush, Walk, and Run at least 10x slower then anyone else in game and you will rubberband around and have glitchy player animations.  I whitnessed all of this while playing with a friend that I am going to build a new PC for. I unlocked the bow!   YES! now that I've earned 10,000 and change I am going to buy the bow and some arrows and give that a shot.    Supprise Supprise....  I have EXPLODING arrows?!   While luring in an animal there I was.... Tucked under a tree for better cover and got my doe lured in at around 15m away.   I draw my bow and wait for her to turn.   Booom!  I fired my arrow to notice a flash and a giant puff of smoke come off the deer I shot.   Realistic?!  Hardly.While in a game and checking out the menu I noticed there is NO way of going back to home screen.  You simply have to Alt+F4 or you have to X out of the game and restart if you wish you start a new hunt or go from singleplayer to multiplayer.There are no micro-transactions in-game and I feel this is a good thing!  I feel that with how they marketed the game you should have to work for your gear which in turn will make it more enjoyable.  Simply being able to hop in and buy the guns you want, and anything you need with a micro-transaction seems to bring out the boredom and fast.I think in total having TheHunter (Classic) since 2011 and putting in over 300 hours on steam and well over 400 hours with the launcher from the site.  If you are looking into a new hunting game and have not tried TheHunter (Classic) then that is the game I would go for.There are many other glitches and bugs I have not mentioned in this post for Call of the Wild but believe me when I tell you they are there.  Expansive Worlds released this game too early and didn't spend the quality time required from a dev team to iron out majority of the glitches and bugs you are bound to discover if you download this game.Sure you are going to have bugs in a game. But for it not to be announced as early-access or beta.  There are too many in this game for it to be launched as a complete title.TheHunter (Classic) also has a vast array of species for you to hunt.  There are only 2 reserves and limited species to hunt on Call of the Wild as of yet.I'll leave the decision making to you the gamers, but if I had to choose now after only being 7 hours in.  This game needs some serious work.  Oh.... and waterfoul hunting.  ;)-FoX ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like it! Alot, actually. I haven't had any of the notorious crashes or bugs everybody's been talking about so far. Being an avid bowhunter our in the real world, there's alot in this game for me to like. So, let's get into it:Pros:-None of that monthly payment crap they did with theHunter classic, which I never played because of that.-Gorgeous game, period. -Good animal models.-So far, I like the animal behavior. It seems realistic enough.-The needs areas. It's about as realistic as you can get to areas where animals bed down and where large water sources are.-The hunting pressure system. Finally, a game does it. If you hunt out of one area all the time you're never going to find anything in there because it's all been chased out.-Realistic scent and sound mechanics. Keep an eye on the wind and watch your step. Keep your ears open for calls.-The sheer amount of space available to you. The reserves are large, to say the least.-It's ****ing hunting!Cons:-It doesn't say it's in early access, but it pretty much is. The lack of content shows, mostly in the weapons department. The game could use birds and more big game, too. -No traditional bows. I've used compounds all the way up to longbows. I use a recurve during the bow season, so the fact that it's isn't in the game bothers me. The compounds will have to do for now. -Bleed outs. The fact that the feature exists at all is excellent. However, they bleed out way too quickly. I get that it's a shot to the vitals, but they aren't going to run a hundred yards and just drop. They hole up and lay down, pretty much waiting until they die. Granted, it depends on how badly they've been shot, bow or rifle, but right now the distance run by the animals after the shot seems rushed and artificial. I can't speak for the bugs, because I haven't seen any yet, truth be told, but I like what I've played so far.Definitely a recommend from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been playing theHunter classic for several years. I was looking forward to CotW. It looks and sounds as stunning as the game as potential. That's about it.-It crashes regularly, to a point where it locks up your whole computer and warrant a restart. I didn't experience that for a decade.-The game only supports a handfull of resolution, god forbids if you have an ultrawide screen.-Animal tracks completely disapears at some point, for no reason and with no way to bring it down, at all.-Animals are constantly calling and pin pointing their location to the player, it's a shooting range-Game has better support for controllers than kb&mouse (no way to move silently with a keyboard, no matter the stance)-The starting rifle is a toy and will hardly even pierce a small roe deer or coyotee's flesh even at a good angle. The solution is to aim for the head which is a nonsense in hunting.-The UI is clrearly your generic usual console UI,  plagued by bugs and inconcistencies.-There are no antler's variety-The grind is realAfter that rushed released It's up to the devs now to reach the amazing potential of Call of the Wild. Hoping most customer's first impressions won't be the last I still cannot recommand this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The menus are garbage. Like, seriously.The menus are the worst thing about this game. I would honestly not care if they went the simplistic route like you would find in theHunter Classic. The gameplay isn't bad, unless you decide you want to look at your skills and press ESC. Except wait, that will just close your game because it thought you clicked ""Exit To Desktop."" Then there's the fact that there is no leave game option, just exit directly to desktop. Why? Navigating to another tab (i.e. Skills, Perks, Map) will act as if you're double-clicking or just glitch out in some other way.My experience in game hasn't been bad, at least until the menus decide to frustrate me.

												first and for most.. all the bug that were in closed beta still here they sent out a link for people to sign up to join in an talk with the devs and who ever got in for the testing of it must have not play or test anything since the same beta bug are still here.. and for everyone saying this is realistic your full of♥♥♥♥♥♥i dont know about you but shooting a moose with a .243 is not realistic.. if i had a choice to set a price on this game $10 max so dont wast your money..*UPDATE*you have known of many problems with the game since closed beta and never fixed them.. wonder why the game isnt in as ""Early Access""??? and im sure you would not have all this hate from your dedicated players... we would see EA on it and say wow ok at least we know they are still working on it and should exspect bugs sure no prob.... but no you release a game that has the same bugs in it from closed beta... and now we have to wait for the community ONCE AGAIN to Fix YOUR F*K* up sneak should have been PRIORITIZED with the first patch... and your ask why is so many people mad at this game.... But im not mad knowing your track record with thehunter classic i knew from day one when i launched the game and it crashed with in 3sec of sitting on the main menue this is going to be a long road ahead of your customers an i can see why so many people asked for a refund.... EW has tied there own Nuse i just hope they dont pull the lever as well... game has a great potential... so i hope that EW can pull it off soon so we can still have good times in the game			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: March 7
												So I've decided ro review for this game as I see the previous hunter game didn't get much recommendations.Firstly, this has to be the most beautiful game I've ever seen, it smashes any other game in terms of realistic colours and lighting, the sun bouncing off foliage is exactly replicated in this game and looks photorealistic when seen.Secondly, the sounds are absolutely perfect, running through wetlands, rustling through bushes, all the sounds are perfectly recreated in this world, you can even hear the equipment your wearing rubbing against the objects around you.Now I get onto the hunting, which is in it's early days and constantly being improved, the devs are hot on problems, and I no longer get crashes. There are few bugs, when playing for an extended amount of time, tracks and scents seem to stop being generated, making it almost impossible to hunt anything.The actual hunting in itself is pretty decent, there's a nice flow to tracking to stalking to then finally killing the game, animals will nearly always hear you if you walk or run, so following a ""fresh"" track normally means crouching and taking it slow, running around everywhere wont get you any results, so if you're impatient, or don't like waiting 20-30 minutes + for a shot, then you obviously have never been hunting! It's not all about stalking though, there are open areas where there may be drinking, feeding or resting areas, and near there, is most likely a chance to build a lookout stand, this is great fun if you dont want to be stalking, but requires patience as the area around you may only be visited at certain times of the day, so time management is key with sitting and waiting.Once you actually find something to shoot, it's not a matter of shooting it ""wherever"" there is an art to knowing where and when to shoot, shoot them in the wrong place, and you're basically being cruel and irresponsible. shoot them through the heart, you'll most likely get a clean and instant death, and PETA goes home happy.When you DO kill an animal, you'll get a reward based on the following, the animal you killed, whether it has a trophy rating, how long it took to die, the integrity of the shot (the right weapon choice) and obviously where the animal was shot. Getting a gold rating is always a big thing in this game, the ability to track, stalk and shoot an animal properly and cleanly, and this game graces the player when they complete this correctly.Overall, some of the things I would like to see in the future include small game hunting, as an Englishman myself, I hunt rabbits with night vision, and do alot of pest control, night vision sights would be a great addition to the game, but also small game hunting. another great addition would be birds, pheasants for the english, ducks for the americans, would be incredibly entertaining and I look forward to what the game brings in the future.I would recommend this game if you hunt in real life, if you don't this might be abit dull if you don't understand why this game is so good, but if your looking to buy something straight out rather than pay a subscription, this game is for you.

												This game absolutely has the potential to be the best hunting sim one could ask for. However, it should never have been released in it's current state.Right now, it's just too buggy overall. Animals getting stuck on rocks, mission rewards not paying out correctly, nonresponsive and generally sluggish menu, etc.I'm sure all the above issues can be fixed with some time, but I can't bring myself to endorse Call of the Wild for now. If the situation changes and bugs are fixed, I will of course change my review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well... the game it self is beutiful. Walking in the forest with you trusty old shotgun while the sun is shining thrue the leafs, that looks stunning and feels good to. So the grafics is indeed very good! But.... the game is full of buggs and tbh it dosent feel like the devs are doing so much. Tracks dissapere, animals get stuck and you might die when you are just taking a walk. There is 2 Maps in the game. Both are in the summer. Idk why they dident make the second map winter.. Been playing +40 hours Now and i continue to find bugs.. So for now i Dont recommend the game. Mostly becuase the say that the game is complete But its not! Its an Alpha game that they charge a full price for.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a joke, not a game. I paid 30 euros to discover it has just two maps...wtf ? It's full of bugs from day one. This one of them which comes first into my mind:I went to system when I was in the game to make some changes. Guess what, you can't change brightness, there is no button for such setting and because of that screen colors seem washed up, it looks terrible. When I wanted to resume game the escape key didn't work, even if it says press escape to go back. This is, as almost all the launches of EW a  ♥♥♥♥ed-up job, like Whiterime ridge map in Hunter Classic. Don't buy this game, it's a waste of money. And that is not all. The so called bonuses won't work, they are ♥♥♥♥ed up even if on The Hunter forum a it's silence, no one from EW, despite the problmes raised, is there to give us an explanation for this new screw-up .  At the hour I write this review I still can't have the three bonuses promised. (A rifle for the classic and two items for this game I review in this very moment)PS - And guess what, in its first day the game was cracked , it's for free for whoever wanted on the web. If I knew it was so bad, I would have waited this moment instead of wasting my money on a crap game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have 380+ hours of theHunter: Classic under my belt so I think I've come to some conclusions after a dozen hours or so.I have had zero performance issues, crashes or the like to date and it runs slicker than dog poop on linoleum on my i5 and GTX 1060 6Gb. I don't find all of the claims of clipping and geometry issues to be any greater in extent than what I experienced in tH:C (theHunter: Classic, not THC). Is this a better game? Graphically yes and the gameplay is not far off of par in my opinion. They ruined the huntermate by changing a few things so that takes some getting used to. I enjoy the missions and perk points as a bit of a motivator to play and don't find the menu system to be all that difficult. Seriously so much salt over small potatoes.Yes, some of the animal behaviour is screwy and some of the calls seems a bit over the top but I would expect that with continual patching as seen to this point, some of this stuff can be tweaked.There are no micro-transactions or the idiotic 3 month license that tH:C forced you to repeatedly buy so this is a thumbs up for me. Haven't tried MP yet. May update if I do			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In short:While theHunter Classic could be called more of a hunting sim, Call of the Wild is an arcadey animal shooter, which was released utterly unfinished. Don't let the pretty landscapes and cheap(ish) price fool you; Avoid Call of the Wild like a plague until it's at least technically fixed and then hope they fire whoever whose idea this 'new direction' for the game was.Pros:+ Super pretty graphics+ No microtransactionsCons:- Unrealistic: Too many animals, which are near impossible to spook- Buggy: Encountered tons of glitches during 30min of gameplay- UnoptimizedMy experience:I loaded up the game and - after fiddling with the settings to make it run even semi-playably - decided to head out and find some game. Literally one minute after leaving the cottage I heard the warning call of a bear. I looked at the handy audio direction indicator and there the bear was, casually strolling at me. WTF?? I decided to take a shot at it. The bear reacted by taking a few running steps and then getting stuck on an invisible wall. I shot at it again, and again it took a few steps and stopped. This time it turned to face me head on and stare me with its big, quizzical eyes, as if it was hoping me to end its buggy virtual existence. I did.Now, in the original theHunter, running around and shooting your gun tended to have the side effect of making you unable to see a single hair of an animal for the next ~30 minutes. Not the case with this game, it seems! Just as I had finished slaughtering the poor Pooh, I SAW A BLACKTAIL DEER LOOKING AT ME, COMPLETELY PLACID. AND HEARD ANOTHER BEAR. What is this? Russian oligarch hunting simulator with tame animals tied down for you to shoot at on your private ranch?Thanks for turning the only somewhat respectable hunting simulator in the world into a dumbed-down shooting gallery for the Adderall generation. A bold move, I would say, as the niche appeal of the original game was the only thing keeping it afloat. Let's see how it pays off.EDIT: It is entirely possible the game was bugged and/or the game makes sure you see an animal the first time you play the missions. Or I just got extremely lucky. However, I wanted to keep my playtime short to keep my eligibility for the refund program, after seeing the glitches and framerate issues. I'm open to trying this game again at a later date - but at this time I cannot recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has alot of bugs, don't get me wrong it is playable but damn it has so much bugs.This is the reason why I dislike the game and it is the only reason:Furthermore the developers want to bring this game to the consoles which means that there will be less support on the pc version and on the other hand a extremly bugged version for the consoles because this developer team is really small.

												To anybody that likes hunting games i would recommend this game to you, it was huge maps, a variety skills and perks, multiple ways to hunt, and the developers are working hard to fix any/all problems that people are having with the game. There are a couple of problems i have with the game so far.1. In multiplayer the only the host can inteact with everything your friends or other players cant interact with lookouts, outposts, and undiscovered points on the map.2. Its some times feels like you go really slow out of no where kind of like if you were in slow-mo but only you this includes reloading, running, using lures etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Exaggerated negative reviews about crasches and bugsI have not experienced any problems, and the game seems to be at this time a much better option than endless subscriptions and pay items in the ""free"" version. Just a little small variety of weapons and species does not look optimistic and smells like some DLCs are coming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overall...probably one of the best hunting games to date. If you are looking for a casual hunting game this is it. Expect a lot of walking, a lot of crawling, finding animals needs zones to hide out at for awhile, etc. Cons:It feels like its early access. Currently has a lot of bugs and some game crashes. I still consider it worthwhile though, even in its beta state. The missions are kinda dumb. But you can just bypass them and do whatever you want. For example: the missions are currently arranged in a way that makes it almost by chance to complete some of them...such as the take a picture of 2 bears in one pic. I personally hate the photography missions. This will most likely be fixed at some point.... but the animals sometimes get stuck on rocks, or freeze in space. This also will at some point be added: more animals and more content. Pros:None of that monthly pay crap they had in the first one. This is the reason i bought this one and nothing from the first one. Free roam. You can follow the story missions, side quests, or do whatever you want. Some scenery is so gorgeous it could be a background for your monitor.Huge enormous reserves. I havent even been to every location in almost 40 hours of gameplay. Bleed outs from animalstracking.......you can literally spend an hour in real time tracking an animal that you shot, it you hit the flesh and no vitals. hunting pressure zones. If you shoot an animal in the same spot, they come around less, if not at all. History. Their past game shows that they will work one this game for years to come. Adding content, fixing bugs, etc. etc.Realistic features.... sounds, smells, and visuals can give you away as a hunter.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an excellent simulator of what hunting really is and should be like. There are some annoyances that I HOPE the developers keep in mind when releasing future updates, but for the most part the game is excelent.Pro's1. This game is beautiful. It is taxing on the system, but I am able to play on a steady 30 fps, and the textures are all at least 4k. Its amazing and I definetly applaude the developers for making it so.2. Realism of the process of hunting is outstanding. It goes through all the steps, and doesnt make it overly simplified to find prints or track animals.3. Animal diversity is also quite astounding.Con's1. The A.I of the animals needs a lot of tweaking. This is a problem that should be able to be remedied, but it is something that needs to be fixed in the future if the game is to be succesful. It kinda takes the realism out of the game when you finally track down a deer stuck in a tree, and shoot it point blank. Take collision with trees off at least?But other than that, the game is fineThere is not a whole lot more to a hunting game than what it already has guys. This isnt bass pro;s either, so they dont have an entire warehouse arsenal of hunting equipment for you to choose from. It's just the way it is and I can understand it.Overall 7.5/10, If the A.I is fixed 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Multiplayer dosent have any feutures from single player,  all u can do is shoot animals and get money. So when ur ammo runs out u have to go back to single player to get ammo. And there is no return to menu option. So if u want to switch from multi to single or the other way around u have to restart the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after 18 hours of play time I decided to review the game. From a hunters tsand point its is a game and is not 100% accurate. For a game hunting sim it is fun. Each reserves offers its own unique area and hunting. The rewards for killing dont seem fair based on what you can kill. There are some bugs with animals and wepons but nothing to major I have seen besides a animal getting stuck on a rock.I have shot and killed most of the animals with the starting weapon and poly rounds. (Bears,Deer,Elk,Moose,Coyotes.) I have not killed any bores or bisson yet with it. Grnated i have to do alot more tracking on bigger animals but hey its the fun part.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is actually really good, the gameplay is nice, there is a lot of things to consider be aware of like wind, bushes, noise you make and i like the fact that you have experience and gain levels and have to place perk and ksills points.BUT this game is also full of bugs, full of unlogic stats.for exemple the starting bullets will have a penetration of 40 while the ""designed to penetrate"" bullets will have 20.When you unlock a active perk, you cannot use it because you cannot equip it.When you purchase bullets you cannot know how many you have unless you equip them into your gun.The bullets weight 0.02 but will still weight 0.02 if you carry a milion of them.And even more and more...That game should have the ""alpha"" tag actually.Still I really enjoy playing it.

												As everyone already said, the grafic is really really beutiful, and the shooting part is just lovely.. one bad thing, and yes I have tried to google an answer; will there be more content? if you compare Call of the Wild with the Classic game, there is only 2% as much content in THCW than THC... Of course there will be DLC and it will cost, but comon, why release a game that goes back this far in content then the first?5/10 toasters, the grafic and the flow in the game got a solid 10, but you know why I had to lower the score.

												This game is as enjoyable as it is good looking; exploring dense forest, wavey plains and steep rock faces all in search of that perfect deer. You've got a decent selection of gear to choose from, such as bows and shotguns, bolt action rifles and lever action repeaters, scents and callers and ammuntion focusing on either penetrating thicker hides or causing more damage to the vitals. You'll be using these against several breeds of deer, fox, bears, herds of bison, moose and wild boar, all of which spread over two large open maps. One map takes place in Northern America and the other in rural Germany.This game still has a few flaws, however. The animal AI can sometimes get caught on the terrian or get stuck in pathing loop. Whenever you go prone, the camera can clip through the ground, revealing the vast nothingness below. The sound glitches and crackles when there is a lot going on.It you can look passed a few rough edges, you'll have a great hunting game on your hands. I've paid full price and I do not regret waiting for a sale. It you enjoy hunting games or exploring vast open worlds, then I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay:Its not Call Of Duty in the Forest, where bears on steroids, 50 feet tall attacking innocent topless girls in mini skirts, and u save them - (btw I would love this kind of game) - this is slow paced, hunting simulator. My last hunt was tracking black bear for like 20 minutes, and then hit it from 250 meters in the head. It really was like real life hunting - you have shot statistics after hit, where did u hit animal and the score. Its really interesting. I can suspect there will be more DLCs like Alaska with Grizzly bears and stuff like this - which will make this game only better.Graphics are great, and you really have feeling being in the forest, moving slowly tracking your prey - if you like, slow paced games, where you have to think a lot, a truly hunting simulation - it is game for You.

												Been playing for a minute now and have noticed a couple things that bug me, first in multi player everyone can hear the bleet call as if they where using it when they dont have it out. it only takes one person to clear out a entire session. also when using some calls i notice where the clip for the audio begins and ends. this is only when im using headphones. but lastly the acuracy on some weapons is extrememly poor mostly the bow butt some rifles included. also i wish i had better audio mixing setting for example being about to turn down the volume for some things like the calls and the gunshots. but not effect ambiemt noises when doing so. more settings in general would be nice. also their is currently at the time of this post a bug that effects your scope and makes you relog when it happens in order to fix it.all in all this game is like a 6 out of 10. i really enjoy it but the little things irritate the heck out of me.

												Great game with great features. My fewcomplaints arethe incompatibility of the controller with the map and inventory and basically the whole menu ui. The lack of power the players that aren't host have in multiplayer, such as not being able to buy outposts or unlock lookouts. Also if they just added all the features of the free (the Hunter) like the guns and all the animals and maps. Which i hope in the future they will. This game would be a solid 10/10. For now its an 8/10 due to the lack of things to do after unlocking all the items. Waiting for the patch where they take everything from their other game over to this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Everything about the game, graphics, scenery, AI and much more are 100% phenomenal. I have been complete emersefied in the game since purchase. I like everything about it and would recommened it to any one that loves hunting with a few exceptions as listed below. 1.) Sometimes the animals glitch out while walking/running or after being shot. 2.) So far i have discovered a few watch towers and 1 camp, which gives you rewards such as perks, cash or skill points. The one thing i have noticed each time is i don't actually recieve my perk points, has happened 3 or 4 times now and mainly on finding the watch towers and a couple other times on some other things. I do how ever receive them for leveling up though just fine. 3.) I don't know if it has to do with how im playing or not but there seems to be a bit of lack on animal species spawn rates. Out of the 16+hrs played i see an animal on average of 1 time every 45mins of real world time not game time. I do however know the game is different if a new game is started up again and i mean new as is starting all over at level 1. The first time there seemed to be more spawn rates. I only started a new game as i was only level 3 and the wife wanted to learn how to play as well.4.) Currency relative to game play builds and purchases. I feel the game is a little over priced on guns,bows and ammo as prices range from 10,000 to 60,000 for rifles and ammo starts as 350.00 for maybe 5 to 10 shells, as i have spent 1000.00 on ammo for the .243 (starting rifle) and received around 60-80 rounds. The building cost of the stands vs animal kill cash prizes and other world findings is a little high as well, say around 25% higher than i think it should be. Im all the time building stands and but that cost effected me being able to purchase better guns.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not every game is a full on shooter, Not every gamer wants a full time shooter. I played the original Hunter game and the Mini transactions were a big put off. If you liked that game but not the transactions, then this one is spot on. This is graphicly a lot better and playwise, a lot more to offer. I was hesitant as the original one left me feeling like an open wallet and that the game would require constant funding. This is how it should have been released to start with.Definatly enjoying my experience now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's fun. There's a handful of frustrating technical isssues that still persist after several patches but I'm enjoying the game anyway. However, I do wish serveral features had been carried over from TheHunter for the launch of CoTW but with any luck the devs are working on them now. This game will rank higher than the previous game for me personally once all the kinks are ironed out and we start to see a steady flow of new content but it feels like that is a bit far away from now.

												theHunter: Call of the Wild by Avalanche Studios, Expansive Worlds and astragon Entertainment might just be the “ground-breaking open world hunting simulator” you’ve been waiting for. The game implements realistic animal behavior, ballistics, and even weather cycles. There is not much of a tutorial and the player is dropped into the world with a gun and a map. Although there are initial voice overs and some tips, the player is pretty much left to their own devices.In regards to gameplay, the tracking mechanic can prove to be both frustrating and exciting. This is perhaps what lends it so well to creating an immersive experience that feels pretty real. While deer don’t have glowing prints, it is difficult not to feel excited when you realize you are getting close to one of the many types of wildlife in the game. It is also important to be on edge because many of the animals can turn and attack at a moment’s notice. It is hard not to feel excited when you finally line up that shot and pull the trigger. This game’s ballistics really alter the success of each shot based off of distance and trajectory so accuracy matters.However, I did find a few issues with the game. Due to the sheer size of the map and it being rendered all at once, the game is both beautiful and sometimes laggy. When prone I noticed that the grass does not connect to the ground, which caused clipping and obstruct the path at times. The most noteable glitch was a moose stuck in a hillside that would not die until it was shot five times. This is a big deal when ammo is limited and weapons are difficult to unlock in the beginning. There is also an auto walk feature, which is nice when walking great distances, but problematic when collecting trophies. This is because when doing so the game does not pause and you can walk off a cliff, be attacked by a bear, or both in my case.You can read the full review here {LINK REMOVED}http://bit.ly/GCypher7336 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												ALthough the equipment is extremely expensive the game is pretty good. It could be a awesome game if they would add a few things. First we need tents to sleep in at night to save our progress. Portable deer stands and deer feeders would be sweet. Also throw in the ability to use a campfire to eat and drinking bottles for a better feel of real life. It takes a while to level up. Cover scents and camo clothes should be unlocked from day one and alot CHEAPER! I definetely look forward to future updates.Throw in a atv for the long trails and you got a great game.LolOne last thing. A CROSSBOW would be awesome. Thanks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dont know why this is getting bad reviews. I played the first game and the feeling it gives you is like no other. This sequel based on the very short time i have played it (just a bit over an hour i think) is just like the first in giving you that feeling. Its very zen like.... until you find your prey... then the anxiety is turned to 11. Most games are incapable of doing this. This game is very special. If you have this on your wish list or it interests you. Buy it. Bascially the game drops you into the middle of a large german hunting reserve. It takes you on a short tutorial on how to move around and do stuff and then abruptly sort of lets you do whatever you want. If you played the first hunter game you know there is no real.... DIRECTION you are supposed to go. Its a hunting game so you have to find where to go. Be it in the form of a sound. a track. poop. or even an animal in the distance. Once this happens the game gives you directions to follow in the form of azimuth. And in the case of tracks , it points you in the rough direction of your next set of tracks which glow blue.  Its a very zen like experience. This is also the longest part of the game. It can take quite a long time to track an animal. My first play through was just 1 deer and it took 40 minutes. And I shot at it multiple times and had to start tracking it again. This is frustrating but realistic. eventually when you end up hitting a deer , depending on where , it will start bleeding. This will start leaking on the ground and giving you a new set of tracks to follow. If you shot the deer in a good spot. It will slowly or quickly start to bleed out. And you follow the blood trail to the body. Then you harvest the deer and get your points. There are other animals in the game but i have not seen them yet.It also has , what i would have to say the best environmental graphics of any game ever made. I dont know WHAT kind of magic the developers did with lighting and foliage. But taking screenshots in this game is almost as fun as playing it. If you are old enough to experience CRYSIS when it first came out on PC , you know what its like to be completely blown away by graphics. I have not had that feeling since today. It really is a technological marvel Give these devs your money. And make sure to leave a review. I dont understand where the negative reviews are coming from			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great fun for those who like simulated hunting. Anyhow there should be some added gamemechanics that would make the game more fun.1. Temporary tents / camping tools2. Cooking your catch for meals to keep your morale up.3. A bicycle that you could style to move around the huge park.4. Fishing.5. Decorating your bunk with your hunt.6. Cleaning and maintainance to your rifle/weapons.7. Firing range for practises.8. Make clothing have progression, better gloves and better clothing / shoes for hunting purposes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Beautiful game. Haven't been able to put it down yet. You can easily play this game for hours and not realize it. You have a lot to keep yourself occupied with. A lot of terrain to explore. Massive map. The only thing I can think of that would make this game better is fishing, tree stands, and that would be badass if you could somehow have hunting cameras.Some people are talking about glitches and bugs, but not sure what ones there are, because I have yet to come across one and I have put in enough time that I wopuld think I would have seen a few by now.

												I picked up this game and started playing it on average computer. It was nice but I realized it was not running as it should. I was ready to give it up. Then I decided to buy a new gaming pc OMG this game comes to life on a good computer, gone is the slow hunter. I am the Ben Johnson of hunters!! This game is amazing in so many ways.if you are looking for easy go play something else. You have to treat this game like real life. Do you have a tutorial in real life?? I don't! You also won't start to enjoy the game until you get to around level 4. Have you ever been driving late at night and you are a little tired on a two lane highway? You know when your trying to stay awake and think ever bush is a deer or moose about to jump in front of you?? This  game does that!!  You swear that I'm the distance deer are bushes you squint your eyes trying to see but no that's just a bush not a deer!! Lol The people that say there are no animals? Just like real life the animals on this game are WILD!! Do you think they want to be shot and killed and eaten by me?? Heck no. They run and hide when they hear your noisy♥♥♥♥♥coming. They smell your old spice aftershave you splashed on this morning. Don't be stupid!! WILD animals are smarter than you!!You have to go slow, sure you can run to a place. But then your sure going to have to wait for things to calm down again after all the human noise you just made!!I myself have encountered very few problems with the game now that I'm running a 1070 video card and i7 processor. I'm on max setting on everything and it looks and feels like real life.The calls take a bit to get used to. Start with the small black one it travels further. The deer will come to you after awhile in the right location. When they get a little closer switch to the can call. I had one today come so close he was almost on top of me!!! Then I was so excited I missed from 5feet  away lol . Just remember if you kill something move on because that area is full of the animals dead smell now lol great feature, it makes you move on and explore more.This is bar none the best and most realist hunting game out there by far!!  I have much more to unlock and I am super happy with how it's going so far. I can't wait to see what else is in here!Great game with so many options on what you can do. Walk around or just find a place to bring them in. Buy this if you have the computer to run it! And they taste great too!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game so far! I have never seen a game with this much atmosphere. I actually turned down the tracking highlights because you can actually track animals without them! The gras and terrain give clues and paths that animals have obviously taken. It is amazing! Great game. Definently worth the buy! They have GONE AWAY from microtransactions and have already added FREE DLC. NOW, there are a few glitches but they are definelty not game breaking. They also just throw you into the world which is quite fun and awesome to explore and discover all the amazing♥♥♥♥♥♥this game has to offer! for $30 this game is amazing.

With a little bit more from the dev team on fixing some of these issues this is goiing to be the best huntingg simulator for along time to come I do recommend the game to anyone with a higher spec pc			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Buggy but brilliant. There are numerous UI glitches, an interface that is half missing when playing on 21:9 resolutions being the most noticeable for me, goven that the critical display of ammo, visibility and noise are off the screen. The map is very clunky as are all the menus.However, I have never felt so immersed in an environment. They are huge, gorgeous and full of wonderful ambient sounds and changing weather and lighting. I really hope the devs can bring the rest of the game up to the same standard but in the meantime I am simply enjoying the escapism of wondering through these worlds.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An entertaining game, but more often than not, it freezes every 10 minutes or so.  Frustrating when you try to reach a destination or see a nice animal, and then it freezes, forcing you to start over from the outpost.  If they fix this game, it would be worth getting and playing.  Also, the game is missing a exit to menu button, which is like building a house without a bathroom.  Your only option is to exit to desktop, or let the game crash on its own.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gameplay:Its not Call Of Duty in the Forest, where bears on steroids, 50 feet tall attacking innocent topless girls in mini skirts, and u save them - (btw I would love this kind of game) - this is slow paced, hunting simulator. My last hunt was tracking black bear for like 20 minutes, and then hit it from 250 meters in the head. It really was like real life hunting - you have shot statistics after hit, where did u hit animal and the score. Its really interesting. I can suspect there will be more DLCs like Alaska with Grizzly bears and stuff like this - which will make this game only better.Graphics are great, and you really have feeling being in the forest, moving slowly tracking your prey - if you like, slow paced games, where you have to think a lot, a truly hunting simulation - it is game for You.

												Outstanding looking game with a lot of potential, but the game is basically an Early Access title. Lots of bugs that needs fixing and there are some problems within the game such as the currency system (takes like 4 hours of hunting to get 1 rifle that is barely better than the first one you start with), and the travelling in this game - oh man.. There are 2 maps in the game that are both vast and beautiful, but you have to walk/run EVERYWHERE. There is a fast travel option but you need to travel to the hunting lodge in order to unlock it. Basically everything in this game needs a slight tweak of some sort. The devs have been communicative and I trust that they will straighten things out to make this game what it needs to be.For now, I can't recommend this game until they fix some of the major problems and add much-needed content.

There are a couple of problems i have with the game so far.1. In multiplayer the only the host can inteact with everything your friends or other players cant interact with lookouts, outposts, and undiscovered points on the map.2. Its some times feels like you go really slow out of no where kind of like if you were in slow-mo but only you this includes reloading, running, using lures etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After patch 1.5 I would recommend it. You get a LOT for 30€. Two Massive reserves with best representation of digital nature to date. It took almost 70 hours just to explore all points of interest, lodges, outposts etc. on both maps. While hunting in between of course. Enough different animals to keep you busy for a while. The game still has some minor problems and a few major ones for a couple of players. Devs are fixing bugs on a weekly basis. DLC's paid and free will come. A truly relaxing and beautiful game. Just opening a cold one while walking around and taking pictures takes the stress of the day off. P.S.You need a decent PC. Well done!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
