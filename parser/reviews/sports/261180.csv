												As a projectile fighting game Lethal Leagues core is simple: hit your opponent with a ball to score and ultimately win a match.You can try a bare bones prototype on reptile games' website to see if you like that concept.Like many other recent small competitive games this one challenges the player with high risk&reward as a single hit from the ball is a knock out. Although if you or your team hit the ball last it won't harm you.The intense fun of this game starts to kick in once you've hit the ball back and forth a few times, ever increasing its speed to ridiculously high levels (speedometer at the bottom on the boombox). Normal hits only increase the ball speed by 1, charged hits and smashes however double the speed. With more speed the hit lag will increase, the screen will shake, the background will change, intense visual effects will ripple across the screen and the characters will throw catchy phrases at each other as they hit the ball. Next to jumping and swinging you can also bunt the ball to slightly decrease the speed and carefuly set up your next attack.The movement mechanics are very solid. You can move right and left as you jump, you can tap for a short hop or hold to jump higher and stay in the air longer as well as press down to fall faster.The selectable characters two major mechanic differences are their method of gaining height (high jump, wall jump, double jump, wall ride, ...) and their special move, which can be activated with a full special bar (builds up by hitting the ball).Next to online and local multiplayer with up to 4 people there is also a single player challenge with 10 increasingly difficult stages to beat in sequence and in local multiplayer there are 7 levels of AI difficulty with the highest one still being a challenge even if you are already very good at the game - although not as engaging as a good human player will probably be.And it's a damn lot of fun.Raced to the top of my most played game ever list during beta testing.

												Honestly a great game that I didn't think I'd stick to for so long, even though 80% of my playtime was spent vs North American Players the community was willing to accept me and tolerate as much of my lag.... as they could (I'm Antarct---- Australian) :D:Great Game 9/10, could use some better palettes and have a tutorial with parryingIf you're willing to treat this as more than a party game, Lethal League has great depth and offers the potential for insane rallies far beyond the scope of ballspeed :D: with a great community to boot (just join the LL h̶u̶b̶c̶h̶a̶t̶ discord https://discord.gg/zSB7ZAe feel free to ask for games or just hangout).

												As a big fan of local multiplayer games, I originally got this thinking it'd be a fun couple hours of casual fighting with a group of friends. While it was certainly that, I never expected to get so deep into (what I deemed as) a ""party game.""The online community is fantastically rich- Just hop in the group chat, and you're bound to find a match with someone of whatever skill you're looking for, or someone to help practice a specific tactic, or just some casual FFA fun. There are tournaments hosted every weekend, and virtually everyone in the community is a blast to talk to.But the game itself has a depth I have never seen before- I have over 100 hours logged of high-skill matches and tournaments, and I am still finding new strategies and mechanics to use. My current repertoire is even missing two mechanics that I know, and with those two, there are plenty of uses I haven't even thought of.The depth is incredible. The community is great. The style is fantastic, and the play is like nothing I've seen before. Buy the game- You won't be disappointed.			",369,93,7,27,21,3,22

												This game takes the old school two-button skill games and gives it a flavor like no other. It's like being put in a racquetball room with dodgeball rules. The ball can get to ludicrous speeds! But if there is any lag at all whatsoever, it will be difficult to achieve.There's a baller OST (not many songs though), a nice variety of stages, mostly aesthetic, but still provide a variety in size and significant difference with candyman's special--and a handful of characters with subtle but important differences in their traits. I highly recommend this game as it is online play, amazing with friends and absurdly addicting for such short matches!I hope there will be a way to chat with opponents in the game, at LEAST in the lobby. You can not communicate to them not to start a match because you are waiting for more people or if you want them to ready up for the game. 9/10			",659,175,12,86,58,6,54

												The online is incredibly good, which is to be expected from GGPO.  4 player games tend to lag/desync a bit, but as long as you are not playing across countries, it handles it well.  1v1 online is nearly perfect from my viewpoint.Controller support is also good, I have tested 4 different controllers, all of which worked.  Only a few required minimal key binding.Gameplay itself is of the ""simple to pick up, hard to master"" variety.  Great for local party/competitive play.  Its fast paced, and has a lot of ""epic moments"" for all your friends to hype about.Not much content to be honest, though the game is obviously about multiplayer, and they do have a few modifiers to change things up.  But this is an important note, if you don't have good internet/local friends, do not get this game.  Though I doubt anyone reading this falls under this category.I personally like the art style, I have heard a lot of people complain about graphics.  I don't really need to review this though, if it looks ugly in the screenshots, you will find it ugly in game.Boss soundtrack, as in GOOD electronic music, not try hard dubstep.If my review seems badly written, it is because I am not a writer.  But you can trust me on this, Lethal League is amazing for what it is, and is definitly worth the asking price.  Anyone who is shying away because it is ""too simple"", there is a lot of depth/mind games to be had in hitting a ball back and forth(as silly as that sounds).  Is it another Nidhogg?  No.  Another Divekick?  ehhh, maybe, depends on whether you hated Divekick for its gameplay or for other reasons.  To me, this seems like a similar concept to Divekick, though better polished, different gameplay mechanic that is more hype because of its faster/more deep nature, and a better presentation.  This game is definitly better than Divekick, but still holds the similar concept of simple but hard to master.In the end, yes, I do recommend this game.  This game will entertain you and your friends for a long time.If I have not answered your questions/concerns about this game, leave a comment and I will edit the review.""I am terrible at this game.10/10  Would noob rage again.""Edit: Nominated for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.

												Lethal League is a 2D fighting game, but unlike traditional fighting games you don’t use fists or kicks or any kind of combat moves. You pick a character and hit an anti-gravity ball against your opponents to beat them, the ball speeds up and bounces harder off the walls with every hit it takes, reaching unbelievably fast speeds - particularly when one charges the hit. All this makes it hard to avoid the ball and also hard to hit the ball. Each player has a certain amount of lives per round and lose them by getting hit with the ball. Once all your lives run out you’re done, and the round ends when there’s only one player left in the game.Pros: ++++ The game is good fast-paced fun, the latency is very comfortable.+++ The audio and visual aspects are very befitting of each other, especially the effects and art style.+++ Music is awesome, fits perfectly with the battle atmosphere.++++ Hitting the ball feels solid, firm – making for immersive projectile battles.++ Different modes: FFA, TEAM DEATHMATCH+++ Different characters make for different moves/special moves.+++++ ”No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥”Bittersweet:-/+ Gameplay is easy to learn but hard to get good at, practice makes perfect and provides hours of fun.-/+ Speed cap for the ball is ridiculously high, might as well be infinite which makes for difficult but impressive moments.-/+ Limited player choice, however they are very stylish and have different colour schemes.-/+ Player base has cool people, but it’s not very big.Cons:-Not really anything negative about the game, if I had to name something it would be the lack of characters and small community.Final Opinion:All in all this game is addictive, exhilarating and a massive amount of fun. It’s as if Super Smash Bros, Pong, and whichever traditional 2D fighting game you can think of had a baby. Easy to pick up, hard to master. Art style, music and gameplay go perfectly well together for an amazing fighting experience.Liked this review? Join my group and follow my curator page. ",625,160,19,61,32,3,48

												This game is the perfect example of how you simplify a fighting game to its roots while maintaining all the depth and metagame intact. Lethal League is a 3 button game (Hit, jump, stall/counter) where your goal is to hit your opponent with a ball, the ball builds speed with each hit and you have to be in the proper position to hit it back to your opponent while trying to not get hit by it.There's a limited roster of characters but all of them are very unique, no character plays exactly the same which makes every matchup very fun.This game also has a superb sountrack and an amazing netcode (GGPO) with up to 4 player online multiplayer.This is one of the most fun games i've played in a really long time, however there is a huge con to all of this, the game's asking price is $13.99 USD...Sure, that isn't much, right? it's the price of ""X"" or ""Y"" so it's not a big deal yadda yadda. However the game is truly lacking on the SP content, there's only a mode where you play against the CPU and a pretty barebones ""Challenge mode"" (Arcade mode) so there really isn't much outside of playing it against other people and even thought that's the main point of fighting games there's so many other games (Skullgirls, KOF) that at least cover a bare minimum of a Story Mode and a proper Arcade mode while also having very good tutorials (Skullgirls) and really good challenge modes (KOF Trials) both which have been in multiple sales for less than half the price of this game.The game is virtually dead on arrival, very much like Divekick (Even though Lethal League is incredibly better on every single aspect). It's almost impossible to find an online match because no one really is playing it and the price tag does not help the situation and it's a HUGE shame, because this could've been a smash hit that everyone would be talking about.Bottom line, this is one of the best fighting games you could ever play if you're either a veteran or a beginner, but i can't recommend this to everybody because the current price tag is not really justified, wait for a sale and buy it, maybe then more people will be playing it after they discover how amazing this game is.

												This Game is fantastic, if you have Friends!I played this Game with my Brother and Friends, and we had a lot of Fun for 13 Hours. The Gameplay is very simple. You choose a Character out of six.Every Character has their own ""Ultimate / Special Attack"". For example one Character can eat the Ball and spit it out somewhere else. It's getting really hard, when the Ball reaches a speed out of 10.000+Multiplayer is quite dead, even after Hours of searching. So if you have Friends, go for it!If not... Think for yourself it its worth it. Story Mode is kinda... meh...*RECOMMENDED AFTER ALL*			",657,193,24,70,31,10,51

YouTube™ Video: Lethal League Review 

			Views: 1,138		

			Episode 48 - Lethally addicting Review by 16-Bit In today's episode we take a look at Lethal League! Make sure to check out written reviews and plenty of other well done reviews and recommended games...		

HISTORYReleased in August 2014 and developed by Team Reptile and based off the flash game prototype bearing the same name, it’s Lethal League!As of this review the game is on version 1.07.12STORY AND WHAT YOU DOIn Lethal League with no real context or story, you play as up to 6 different playable characters who face off against each other in an arena in up 4 players at once, the goal simply being to hit the ball at one another to knock them out.With each consecutive hit to the ball, it gains speed, which can make things very interesting, very fast.The game also has a number of different modes from online, to versus, to an extra menu with different things such as a tutorial, training mode, as well as the challenge mode which basically acts as the core single player aspect to the game itself.THE GOOD-Quick and easy to pick up and play gameplay-Addicting-Different game modes and options to choose from-Competitive and great multiplayerRight off the BAT pun intended, one of the best aspects to Lethal League is the pick up and play nature of the game itself, it’s easy to learn and you’ll be smashing your opponents in no time flat, the game features an easy to learn tutorial to help new comers out, but the concept itself is pretty easy to wrap your head around.It’s also extremely addicting, the first time me and my friends started playing this together we couldn’t stop, the quick matches and nature of the game itself lends to the addiction factor big time and it works beautifully.The gameplay itself is fairly unique, almost reminding of pong on steroids with a gorgeous art style and blazing soundtrack to boast its intensity, the game is easy to play, but definitely takes some serious skill and good timing to master it.But easily the BEST aspect to Lethal League is the online multiplayer, whether you’re in a team or free for all, Lethal League truly shines when you’re pitted against your friends as you battle it out and make the ball reach absolute insane levels of speed.You’ve also got access to a variety of different game options if you’re hosting, from changing the speed of the ball itself when you hit it, to a big ball mode, team versus matches, free for all, and a mode where you basically have to hit the opposing team’s target at each end of the map to gain points.The character roster as well all have their own unique abilities as well to mix things up, and you unlock different skins for them as you progress the game and earn “experience” allowing you to level up and unlock the different skins for them and overall really adds to the addictive nature and replayability of the game.Over all, we had TONS of fun playing this for hours on end and is easily one of the best competitive games I’ve played in recent memory.THE BAD-Few core game modes to choose from (not much content) *Minor*Honestly I don’t have much to talk about here, Lethal League does what it does very well, I had no major issues or never felt something was unfair or over powered and the game is very well balanced. Probably the only issue I have is the lack of content, despite just talking about the different game modes to choose from, Lethal League outside of what I mentioned doesn’t offer much for core game modes.If you’re looking for some beefy single player content, you won’t really find it here, sure you’ve got a versus mode where you can pit yourself against the PC at different difficulty settings, as well as a challenge mode that you can beat with each character to gain some achievements but honestly this felt nowhere near as compelling or interesting as the multiplayer.As for the multiplayer, once you’ve played as each specific character, and played the different maps and fiddled around with the match settings a bit, you’ve pretty much seen everything this game has to offer you.But to be honest, this is all pretty minor and I can easily see myself coming back to play this.THE UGLY-Not graphically impressive, it’s quite literally based off a flash game after all-What it lacks in graphical fidelity it more than makes up for it in art style-Amazing soundtrack-Odd game crash during multiplayerWhere we discuss the graphics, soundtrack, and technical aspect of the game.Lethal League won’t wow you in the sense with amazing textures and particle effects like some games might, which is obvious considering the game looks like something you could find on Newgrounds.But what it will wow you with is the fabulous art style it boasts, from the different scenic backgrounds, to the character models and general presentation, what Lethal League lacks in big budget impressive graphics, it more than makes up for in its amazing art style and presentation.And one thing that really adds to this is the AMAZING soundtrack, this is easily one of the best sound tracks I’ve listened to in a game in a long time, the art style and soundtrack over all give me almost a Jet Set Radio vibe, and I love it.However, not everything is perfect, we did have our fair number of freezing issues during online matches, as well as the odd game crash or two in my 5 or so hours I’ve spent with Lethal League, but overall the gameplay itself was bug free during our experience and most of the crashes and freezing were during the online match making.FINAL THOUGHTSAs I said earlier this is probably the most fun I’ve had yet so far with any indie game and I highly recommend you give Lethal League a try if you’ve got some friends looking for a fun, unique, and competitive game, despite some minor technical issues we had, playing this was an absolute blast.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group ",127,18,3,9,10,1,4

												10/10 No weak sh*t.Ok let me start talking seriously here, it's you vs a bot or a local friend, or an online person. there's a ball you can hit and by doing so the ball will change to your color and it won't hit/hurt you, on the other hand it will hit and take out your opponent if he/she doesn't hit the ball back at you. Every time you hit the ball it will increase it's speed/velocity, and hitting it in a certain way doubles the speed, so it will become more and more challenging and hard to hit the ball.Also, this deserves a notice of its own, the online playing is amazingly smooth, just fantastic. Hard to notice any lag.Personally, I'm loving the game, and i think it's well worth it, but it's basically match after match playing against 1 to 3 other opponents. there is a ladder challenge single player mode which will get harder and harder the more levels you finish, with some changes like going against a huge boss character, or the ball being huge. That's what's in the game, and if you think that's not enough to make you jump and get the game, then wait for a sale, but if you want to go by my opinion, i think it's well worth it for the fun and challenging experience you will get from it.More info here[www.ksalue.com] ",589,105,8,19,53,5,36

												SUMMARY: Its like smash and pong on crack. Very fun to play with friends or on local co-op. Gets more and more intense as the round goes on and both parties are screaming their asses off as the balls pierces the fabric of the earthEXPLENATION: Its a fighting game where the player chooses their select character each with its own special ability that is more or less balanced. The object of the game is to hit a small ball back and forth, changing its colour to the player that touched it last, if a player who is not the same colour touches the ball (as in not hit it) they die and lose a life, zero lifes left and the player is eliminated. Now heres the kicker, as the ball gets hit more and more, it gains more and more speed, extreme amounts of speed one could say and the colours of the game starts changing to match the intensity and the speed that the ball is going at. All while a kickass soundtrack plays in the background. Definetly a fun game although I wish more people played online :(			",571,124,20,77,45,2,55

												There are many games which have multiplayer mode and only a number of them ends up as global hits which are played by lots of players and in which connection issues are rarity or aren't issues at all. While this game isn't this kind of title yet, I need to say this game is a little gem which should shine really bright in near future. But let's start from the beginning.Lethal League is a game where your main goal is to control ball and hit it as hard as possible to hurt your opponents and knock them down, while also using unique techniques limited to each of playable characters. Sounds simple, right ? But I assure you it's not that easy, especially when the movement with which ball move after few hits may reach RIDICULOUS speed and hitting the ball itself (or counter it by pressing X which is a kind of a block which stops the movement of it) may be a really tough challenge. This game will test your dexterity, reaction time and timing, which are really crucial here. So in other words I would call this title easy to learn (it's literally jump, hit and block buttons), but hard to fully master. Graphics are as simple as in screenshots, but I need to say they are still estethic and look nice with bright colors mixed in (I also like in overall the style game brings with interesting characters). And I need to mention one more thing, which is really, REALLY crucial - music. My gosh, music in this one is one of the best things I heard in gaming history. Electronic climates created by really talented artists like Grillo, zeroSCAR or Klaus Veen fits the climate of the game perfectly, while being perfectly well made. I would say music alone in this game make this game worth to purchase, it's THAT good. To sum it up game is really well made flash-like game with incredible competitive potential. Game basics are simple to learn, but this game has this crucial element, which make it fun, challenging and mostly work like some sort of a drug, which forces you to play it as much as you can. I give it 9,5/10 as I feel 5 characters is kind of a small numbers of possible options if you ask me. But I assure you - this one will become one of the best gaming hits ever. At least it has great potential to become one.			",1813,794,55,260,232,18,292

												Fast-paced non-traditional fighting game that relies less on player execution and more on getting into the head of your opponent. One of the freshest takes on the genre I've seen in years.

												Game is fun!I've seen many call this game ""Smash Brothers meets Pong"" and that's roughly correct. Lethal League is similar to Smash titles in its ease of access (being pretty simple to understand and play) and its competitive depth. Its similar to Pong in being focused around the ball, the one lethal element of the game. You and your opponent(s) are striving to hit this ball, tagging it to yourself and making it lethal to your opponent until they successfully hit it back (or miss, get hit, and die). The ball will steadily speed up after every hit as long as players remain alive, ramping up the intensity. Continue this until all but one player have lost all their lives, and only the champion remains!Local and online multiplayer are supported, with 2-4 players. You can play 1v1, FFA, teams, or strikers (similar to soccer) modes. There are a couple different ball types you can try as well to mix things up, along with general options (stock count, time limit, etc.) There is matchmaking, but it's not skill-based (the community isn't large enough to support skill-based matchmaking anyways).The game is great if you want to just hit buttons and peg your friends with baseballs, and also great if you're looking for something with competitive depth. While the execution barrier is fairly low, you have a lot of freedom of movement/options, and the smarter and more experienced player is still favored to win. Regardless, the game does a great job of hypeing the player up, as hits take progressively longer to complete as the ballspeed increases (giving the feeling of them putting more and more force into the ball), and the screen starts to shake, the background changes, 'impact distortions' occur, all the colors go negative, characters get speed afterimages, and finally the stage goes completely white if you get the ballspeed up enough. Each notch of this progressively makes things more intense, especially the first time you see them!The only drawbacks to me of this game is the playerbase size and occasional crashes. This game has seen occasional boons in playerbase (usually following sales), but on average there's about 60-100 people playing at a time. Games go fairly quick, and you usually won't be waiting more than a minute in quickmatch queue (at least during peak EU and NA hours), but you may run into the same people multiple times. What you don't have in quantity, though, you do have in quality. There's almost always a few people in the group chat willing to play, and many are experienced players who are welcoming and helpful. The competitive LL community is, overall, one of the best communities I've been in.The other drawback is a recurring crash that can occur in multiplayer games of more than 2 people. This only occurs maybe once every 6-7 games, but it can get annoying fairly quick. Fortunately, the game loads almost instantly, so getting back in the action is fast. It's annoying but manageable.I highly suggest you try this game out, especially if you have friends to play it with. $15 may be a bit expensive for some (it was well worth it for me, 450 hours of play and counting), but I would definitely recommend this to anyone at $10 or less.

												This is by far the best ""casual"" fighter in the market. Excellent sense of depth hidden in simple mechanics. When you start out it seems fairly simple like the prototype, but the bunts, supers, and character movement really make the game engaging as time goes on. For example Sonata feels extremely weak early on because of her slow hitting motion and jumps. These are offset by the best early super which is you can get easily while staying high in the air and getting free hits in. Candyman's strengths are obvious with his portal super grabbing easy games off of weaker players but tends to not be as powerful as players get better. Raptor has solid movement and has one of the best late game supers by (fully?) removing the hit stop animation making it sometimes impossible to hit back. Switch seems to be a mid game character with fast movement and his super which redirects the ball. His super has some good potential to net kills fast but becomes much harder to use later in the game. Latch is an all game character with the most broken super which can almost always guarantee kills after 128 speed. The only problem is the online which suffers from is lack of players for non-American/European people. The entire time spent writing this review I have been sitting in queue and still haven't found a game. If you don't have local friends to play with or a tournament scene for this you might not have the best time with this game.			",91,8,5,7,8,0,8

Review in English/Spanish Análisis en Inglés y Español: English:  Fun game with unique art style and a pimping soundtrack, gameplay is simple but addictive yet I can’t fully recommend it. Lethal League focus is on multiplayer but it's somewhat dead as finding a match can be problematic, only after looking for people in the forum or chat was I able to  play online so bear that in mind.The game also has a single player mode but it's pretty short.  Español:  Juego corto y entretenido con un estilo visual único y una banda sonora bastante guapa, es algo simple pero altamente adictivo. Desafortunadamente no puedo recomendarlo por completo pues Lethal League se enfoca principalmente en el multiplayer el cual parece estar algo muerto, en varias ocasiones estuve buscando una partida y no fue posible jugar en linea hasta que busque por otros medios (foros, chat) y eso señores, es una patada inmensa en las bolas.En definitiva, un buen juego mas no lo compraría a menos que tuviese amigos con los cuales hacer co-op.

IntroductionHave you ever wondered what it would be like for superheroes (or beings with superpowers) to play various sports? Perhaps dodgeball? Or baseball? No doubt they would take things to a new extreme, with smashes that break the laws of physics and reaction speeds at mere fractions of milliseconds. Lethal League is a little like that. Imagine Super Smash Brothers but on PC and instead of fighting, you're essentially playing dodgeball in a fairly small arena. Things can get real chaotic, but boy is it fun!GameplayLethal League combines sport, with a highly competitive and slightly strategic game that requires you to have good timing, or a good understanding of angles. This does not mean it's a math or physics game. It simply means Lethal League has an extremely high skill ceiling whilst having a very low barrier to entry. Anyone can pick this up with their friends or play vs bots and have a really great time, and those with the best reaction times can duke it out for the top spots.Your goal is to eliminate all your opponents, by hitting the ball into them. The standard game mode allows you to tag the ball which puts it in your colour and makes it pass through you (so that you don't hit yourself). You can also disable ball tagging for a much more challenging experience. Each time you hit the ball, it goes a little faster. You can hit it up or down depending on whether you are in the air or on the ground. If you smash a ball (air hit) the ball speed is doubled. Now this is where the real fun comes in. If you manage to get 3 or more smashes in, the ball speed is going to ramp up so fast that it quickly becomes a blur of lines in various angles. This is where a knowledge of angles can help you to overcome your opponent. The maximum speed seems to be capped at 1 million. As you break through known speed limits, your hits gradually have a longer delay but the ball speed is so fast that it becomes ALMOST impossible to react to it. You're likely going to struggle with this until you learn the timing windows for various hits, and it is oh so satisfying to counter a ball ping-ponging across the room at over 100,000 (whatever the speed measurement is) into your opponent.You can also bunt the ball in various directions, temporarily slowing it down and allowing you to regain control and possibly change its direction. This is used in combination with regular hits to quickly rack up speed or pull off an unexpectedly fast smash, because bunting a ball reduces the delay on a hit (even the insanely fast ones that require 2-4 seconds of delay) to almost nothing. CharactersThere are 6 characters to choose from and each of them have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Some of them can jump higher than others, some can jump off walls indefinitely etc. This alone would make it fun, however the devs decided this is not enough so they added special abilities. Where do I even begin? Special abilities can drastically change the course of a match in an instant! By hitting the ball you gain charges of your special meter. At 4 charges you can use the ability by double tapping the regular hitting button. Each character has their own unique move that you'll discover on your own, and it adds so much more fun to the game along with previously mentioned elements.VisualsThe visual style of this game is unique, but still quite simple. Characters have some lovely color variations and stages are fairly well designed.AudioI absolutely love the music in this game, as well as the other assorted sounds in the game. When you break the sound barrier, the hit sounds are so impactful and sound like rockets or small bombs going off.Other ThoughtsRunning at 60 FPS is pretty much required to be able to learn your timings properly. The first time I ran the game, it had some very weird frame drops that may have been an issue on my side, but it initially turned me off from the game. However subsequent play sessions did not have that issue, so it must have been some other unrelated issue. The game is very lightweight and runs flawlessly.I would have liked to see more characters in the game, as 6 is hardly a roster of characters compared to other games in this kind of genre. I mean not even the Scout from TF2? That's an iconic character that would have been perfect here.SummaryLethal League is the type of game you can pick up at any time and play with friends. Even as a solo player, you'll find that the bots are quite challenging, and there's enough single player content to keep you interested for even a couple days. The gamplay is fun and rewarding, and is definitely worth checking out if you're interested in a fun, fast, sport-action game.8/10 - The game that destroys friendshipsIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Lethal League is a what you get when you cross a fighting game with dodgeball in all the best ways.  Players jockey to control a small ball, hitting it around the screen in an attempt to knock out eachother.  Every hit on the ball speeds it up, and it quickly moves from an easy to predict slow moving projectile to a streak that bounces around the screen, ricocheting off ceiling, walls, and floor to take out players.  This simple set up leads to an exciting and incredibly fun game.  Unlike most fighting games, there are no long lists of special moves to learn and memorize (each character has slightly differnt angles they will hit the ball at, and a special move that can be powered up during play and used, but no difficult button combos are required for any moves).  This makes the game very intuitive and easy for players to jump in and start playing, even if you are not into fighters.  However, the interplay between player and their specials does lead to a suprising amount of depth in the combat, and learning the timing to intercept balls as they come off of other players at higher speeds will take practice.  If I had any criticisms for the game, it would be that the simplicity of it can be a double edged sword.  Games can start feeling repetative during long play sessions.  Game options can extend this a bit, but in the end most feel gimicky and I find myself losing interest after 30-60 minutes.  However, that being said, I still find myself coming back to this game to get in a few quick rounds against friends when we don't have time for a long playsession, or to finish out a night of gaming.  And that is where the game shines imho, quick bursts of action and excitement when I don't have the time to spend hours playing.This games perfectly fills a niche in my gaming library.  It is well worth the price (and worth getting a few extra copies for your friends as well).  An unreserved thumbs up from me.			",58,24,0,16,13,0,15

												Lethal League (LL) is the quintessence of competitive arcade gameplay. Being completely free of over complication, Team Reptile have fortunately channelled the most special elements of the nostalgic games of the golden era, where a sole focus on gameplay has driven design and development. The result being a game with no apparent story, not character progression, and no cheap ways of making you feel as though you should be playing the game, instead it slaps you in the face with a fresh take on Fighters, that is plain and simply, unsullied fun.The gameplay and structure of LL lends itself perfectly to the resolution of longstanding disagreements (1-on-1 Fights), bouts of personal worth and glory (4 way FFA), and also to bond-building exercises (2-on-2 Team Fights). The beautiful thing about the simple gameplay is it works so well not only in the hectic 4-way FFA, but also in 1-on-1 combat, where the simple mechanics eventually boil down to a game of whits, where you are more trying to force the other player/s to swing at the wrong point, or you are trying to think and act fast enough to catch them off-guard.That long winded jargon can be distilled down to; this game is perfect for playing with friends, and that is exactly how it should be consumed. This game has one of those qualities where if you get served too hard, you will hate it; so take it in with friends and you will instantly see the gratifying outcome of learning together, while also pulling off some badass manoeuvres resulting in you all squealing like manly Girl Scouts. We have not tried it in Online Play as my internet services would make the game run like an interactive slideshow. But we can safely say that by grabbing a few ales, a few controllers, and huddling around your PC, you will be parting in the finest display of competition I have seen in a video games since Mario Party 64.Team Reptile have not given this game a huge amount of content, with 5 characters and 6 Levels, BUT, the content in the game is so perfectly polished, I question whether the development team is really as small as they say. We would love to see more playable characters and levels in the future just to give the game that bit of spice, but where it stands now is a testament to where AAA game development falls short in modern game development; where such heavy focus on being the next money making machine makes games lose that…specialness.From a developer’s standpoint this game has soul, you can feel the love that went into it when you play it. So get it, you won’t be disappointed.3 / 3 Worth Playing-C ",4,0,0,1,0,0,1

												It is one of the most addicting games I have played in ages. Best described as Battle Pong on Steroids with a hint of baseball, the aim  of the game is to bat the ball back and forth between you and your opponent until one of you slips and gets hit. For such a simple premise it is really a challenge when battling against other players and CPU's, thankfully though with the very tight and responsive controls, any mistakes the player would make would entirely be their fault and not due to the game.

												Lethal League is a truly hillarious, over the top take on pong and fighting games.The general concept is to defeat your opponentt and reduce their stocks (think smash bros) by smashing them with the ball. The ball will deal damage to your opponents after you hit it, but can be hit by them, which can then cause it to deal damage to you. As in pong, you keep rallying the ball back and forth, with it getting faster and faster until one of you is hit, at which point you lose a life and the ball resets. What sounds like a very simple concept rapidly becomes a hillarious series of ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments in which the ball is going so incredibly fast that you'd think it impossible to hit, but then someone does, and it gets even faster.Throw in a bunch of colourful and creative characters and stages, along with an incredible sound track, and some very fancy and flashy visual and sound effects that wouldn't feel out of place in an Anime or Manga, and you get an enjoyable and hillarious experience.Would reccomend playing with friends (up to 4 player) for added hillarity and fun.

tl;dr -> Ultimate dodgeball - but with objects to hit the ball at your opponents - that can get to Dragon Ball Z-level speeds and ruin friendships forever.My brother was really interested in this game, so I got it for him - eventually, I got interested enough from watching it to buy a few copies for myself and some friends. If you like projectile-based fighting, multiplayer frenzies (both local and online), flashy animations and trick shots, and simplistic (but very fleshed-out) gameplay mechanics, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very good - the character models are nice, and the level of detail put into the visuals is well-done. The music is set to a single, level-specific track, but the playlist is pretty good and matches the atmosphere of the game. The special effects are fantastic, and the background will even turn completely white once you achieve ball speeds nearing 1 million. The controls are easy to learn, but mastering them will take a bit of time. The practice is great for getting you familiarized with the gameplay mechanics, and there are many well-written guides available to teach you the advanced techniques. You can play with a controller, and I personally prefer this over the keyboard. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, the most challenging thing being how quickly you can understand the timing mechanic. The main goal in Lethal League is to hit your opponent with the ball. By default setting, you cannot get hit by the ball if you've hit it last (indicated by the ball's outline matching your assigned color). If a ball is ""tagged"" with your color, it will pass through you and any allies, however, you can also hit it again. Each time you hit the ball, it's speed will increase and your special gauge will fill up by one bar (to a total of 4). Bunting the ball and hitting it before it touches a surface will fill your special meter by 2 (and serves other purposes). A bunted ball will have a pinkish outline, indicating that it is a ""free"" ball - anyone can hit it, and it is not hostile to any player until it is hit. When a burst (round) is over, the first player to have been knocked out in the previous round will have possession of the ball, indicated by a matching outline around it. After a few seconds, however, it will lose it's outline, allowing anyone to hit it.At higher speeds, hitting the ball will cause a hit lag animation, where your character will stay in one spot to charge up, then release the ball. During this time, all other characters can move around to try to position to hit or dodge the ball. There is a mirrored ball-release gauge at the bottom center of the screen, which is a critical tool to use - it will show you how long you have before the ball is released from the hit lag animation. Traditionally, at slow speeds, the gauge will fill up super fast. Bunting is important because a successful hit following one will shorten the ball-release gauge time. The different characters telegraph their moves, so bunting during a long rally (back-and-forth hits) can really help you throw off people's reaction time if they're expecting you to hit a ball immediately back at them. Each character has a unique special, and many of them allow you to do things like bypass the ball-release gauge time (causing the ball to be released regardless of the gauge status), redirect the ball's trajectory (especially dangerous when people have positioned in an angle to catch the ball), or even curve the ball (super awesome trick shot potential). One character has a special that allows the ball to phase through the map (so instead of bouncing, it will continue through and appear on the opposite side). The characters also differ in playstyle, and you will notice things like quicker hits for some, higher jumps, longer hit range, etc. One character, Sonata, can double jump. Raptor, who cannot double jump and has a fairly short vertical range, compensates for this by being able to wall hang and wall jump. Latch can, well, latch onto the wall, moving up and down freely. If you and an opponent swing at each other at the same time, you will clash, pushing each other backwards and stun-locking you for a few seconds. This is especially dangerous if you are stun-locked by an opponent who just finished hitting the ball forward because it will instantly hit you. This game really rewards skill and patience - if you just spam the hit/bunt button, you will get hit by the fall often because it takes time for each character to recover from the hit/bunt animation, leaving you vulnerable. You can even do something as face the wrong way, and will meet a sudden (temporary) death.There is a singleplayer challenge mode you can do, which has the same opponents regardless of which character you pick, and a unique boss match. The game's AI is fairly challenging, and at times seems to randomly turn up to a ""destroy all hope in the human opponent"" rating. There are other variants to play, like a score attack (versus stock), and a team scoring game where you have to hit a target on the opposite side (you cannot hit each other in this mode).Overall, the game is extremely fun, and will be enjoyed by people who like projectile-based fighting.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews ",250,87,0,51,38,2,49

												Legal League is a wonderful simulation of the Legal systems of many countries across the world. The league of five Lawyers meet up day after day battling for justice in their countries, and working nonstop to get the just jurisdiction. All the Lawyers have wonderful story lines, such as Raptor Attorney at Law constantly struggles due to being young, however in the court he is very agressive and a wonderful Lawyer. The hardest part of Legal League is when you travel to Somalia and try to convict various people of their horrible war crimes on behalf of the United Nations' Legal Department. This is evident as Somalia has not had a fully functioning government and thus Legal system since 1991.Overall Legal League has show a great deal of the world's Legal Practices and thus recives a 10/10 for being such a great and interesting educational experience. Thank you, Legal Team Reptile for creating and expressing your works in the legal side of the world.			",220,32,8,48,23,3,52

												I've been playing this game for a decent amount of time now, and I have almost nothing but positive things to say about it.- It's a very fast paced game with a rather high skill cap to achieve.- Easy(ish) to learn, and all around fun to play for hours on end.- A somewhat small yet very friendly community towards all players.- Community held tournies keep the playerbase intact and alive.- The game can be played with either keyboard or controller with only slight advantages using the controller.- The game is brutal with it's matchmaking and really lets you know what you're in for when you face opponents with over 1k+ hours. (It's okay to suck, you'll just suck less next time!)- The game runs smoothly consistently; ie: no sudden frame drops, no visual tearing, etc.One of the only bad things I've found about this game so far is how long it can take to get a matchmaking game sometimes, but the gameplay definitely overwhelms that con so it all works out in the end.I give this game an honest 10/10, it's really a great game but sadly doesn't have as much of a player following as I wish it did.

												This game is just INCREDIBLE. Fun to play, takes about 30 minutes to get to the ""decent"" level of skill, but a lot of time to master the game, giving it some replayability. The characters are diverse, each with their own unique special moves and hit angles, and best of all, it's getting constantly updated and rebalanced if need be. The community is constantly growing, and the game has a great competitive side to it. 10/10, GOTY 2014 for me. It's just that good, try it, seriously.			",46,1,0,1,1,1,0

												This game is a wallball-esque/tennis combat system where you time your swings and kick the ball back to the opponent in hopes to hit him before he has time to respond to the ball. Sounds too simple to be fun, right?Wrong. My friend and I bought this game as a bit of a joke but ended up playing it for hours. I had raw fun while playing this, the kind that you experience only rarely in quality indie titles like Hotline Miami, Skullgirls, etc.With 2-3 different game modes, 6 characters, and 7 maps this game is quite small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in strength. The characters are unique, with mildly entertaining special moves for each of them. The maps each have their own music (The music is surprisingly good in this game). The most interesting aspect of the game is the D-pad+Y shout out. You can taunt, or interact, with your opponent by stating,""Oops"", ""Wow"", ""Nice"", and ""Bring it on"". The tricky part of the game is the ball speed. As you paddle back and forth the ball speed will increase and you'll have to be much more instinctive about your response times. I saw an achievement for 1,000,000 ball speed. My friend and I have only gotten to 1,000. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it worth $10-$14? Not really, but you can always get it on sale. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lethal League is an extremely fun fighting game up to 4 players fighting with super balls to take down each other.Seriously it's very addicting if you have friends to play with.You have ""Free for All"", ""Team Deathmatch"" and ""Strikers"" modes, and several characters to choose from and each character has unique movements and abilities.However, i never found a multiplayer game, i think the game is dead, but had a lot of fun playing it locally with my nephew.Technically the game is smooth, bug-free and very stable while the graphics are cartoonish.Single Player: 7.5/10Multiplayer: 10/10Totally Recommended to buy it if you have friends, if not check the forums to get players to play together.

												It's like a mixture of Mortal Kombat and Pong, a great game for playing with friends; however, most people I know own a MAC and I can't play with them.  It is still a ridiculously fun game, even if none of your friends can play with you, especially 1v1 battles.  And when the ball speed is to the max when you start, it's even more difficult and fun.100/100 Would buy again.(Note: There used to be 5 characters to choose from [Raptor, Switch, Candyman, Latch, and Sonata] and they've added a 6th recently [Dice] and it's a great addition for people that have a difficult time playing this game.  Down side is that his jump is half of what others are and he's quite slow.  His ability is like a Yo-Yo movement.)GET THE GAME WHILE IT'S HERE!!!			",47,5,1,2,7,1,7

	TL;DR: I reccomend Lethal League to people who have friends that also play Lethal League. Pros:-Good music-Easy to learn, hard to master -Good controls-Fun with friendsCons:-Small bugs-Boring single player-Not updated too often-Matchmaking is clunky-Costs too much (I recommend waiting until this game is on sale or buying it off G2@)Rating: 7/10Honestly I have had some of the best times with my friends playing Lethal League. The feeling of tying all of your hits together and taking out your opponent is one of the most rewarding feelings I have ever had in a video game. This game has been fun (for me) ever since the day I got it to now. Although I love this game very much, I don't think it is for everyone. If you don't have any other friends who own this game, then I think you should either buy the four pack, or just not bother buying the game. The single player is boring and repetitve and the matchmaking isn't really worth your time due to connection issues and bugs.			",53,4,2,2,11,1,6

												A unique, fun and quirky fighter where the aim is to hit your opponent with a ball you hit at them. You could argue the premise is simple and the lack of story mode may put people off.

												TL:DR Whether you're good at fighters or not, this game is extremely fun and easy to learn, BUY IT!Alright. Welp. This game is GREAT. Lethal League is a unique fighting time that's pretty much based on timing. You must hit the ball in time so your opponent doesn't kill you. You're basically playing ball tag with your opponent. You try to hit the ball to each other and whoever hits too early or doesn't pay attention will get hit and die. I'm kinda bad at explaining this so maybe it doesn't sound like the funnest game, but trust me ITS FUN! You know one thing I really like about this game? Call me a f*cking casualist if you want, but, ya know, it takes more Rythm than skill. This game you can ACTUALLY WIN without hours and hours of experience. Unlike Skullgirls, where you need to watch sh*t to learn combos or take hours to learn on your own or even been born in the 80s playing fighters at da arcade. The thing is about Skullgirls, if you go in online with a couple hours of play, you'll get the sh*t beat out of you. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm not really a fan of arcade fighters. My issue with dem arcade fighters is the crazy♥♥♥♥♥combos you have to make to do powerful attacks. But, anyway yea. BUY LETHAL LEAGUE!!! It's a competitive and Casual game!			",61,3,1,5,2,2,4

												The core gameplay of lethal league is quite fun and it's an incredible concept. However for a game that relies so heavily on multiplayer, it's hard to find a game online without lag or connection issues. There is overall quite a lack of content as well. If more people were playing online then I would recommend it, but the game offers little outside the online play.			",16,1,0,2,0,0,0

												I eye my top-heavy crocodile opponent from across the field as a purple coated ball begins to spawn between us. He points his stout towards the object, knowing that he's going to smash this into my cold, yellow face. Not today, Latch. Not today.The ball materializes and we rush towards it. My cane is already extended for an over the head smash to hit the reptilian foe below me. Time seems to stop as I connect with the latent power resting within the ball. The crocodile was quick to react and seemed to stop all momentum I had with my initial hit with one tap of his nose. The ball soared over me, and before I connected with the ground the crocodile was already rallying the ball against a wall, hoping to power up another devastating blow.I rush to intervene in his sadistic wall-ball ritual, tapping the ball out of his rhythm at an upwards angle. Furious, Latch's eyes glowed red towards the cane that brought an end to his games. He claws the wall in front of him and begins to climb up its structure to catch up to the ball. Flipping outwards, he catches the ball in his mouth and my world goes dark. All I can see is the crocodile's burning descent from the wall, his eyes reflecting my helpless yellow face.I jump upwards to dodge the assult, but Latch releases the saliva-covered ball angled with precision towards my jump peak. The counter at the bottom reads into the hundreds, and I know that reflecting this is going to take all the luck in my thin smiley-faced bones. My cane relexively reaches in defense, and this was all the luck I needed. The ball's momentum is reversed right at the crocodile's pointed nose. But what stops him from doing exactly what I just did?I try to land a second hit and throw Latch off his prediction. He sees this and attempts to outsmart my own moves. We negate each other's attacks with a twang of cane and stout, the ball landing just behind Latch. I see it bounce off the corners of the rotting arena with bliding speed, and I process that it's coming right back at me. Cane out, I bunt the ball directly downwards into where the crocodile attempts another intervention. His tail whips around, but he is too early.The ball lightly bounces off the top of his scaly skull, and he's sent below the arena.BURST 2, BEGIN!			",111,11,0,2,5,0,5

Verdict: BUY. THIS. NOW.OverviewI'm not one for Fighting games. I never could get those complicated button combos down.I liked Super Smash Bros. in the first two iterations, but from Brawl on it just felt like... something was missing.And while I like the simplicity of games like Dive Kick, the limitations on the controls limit my interaction with the game itself and thus my investment.This game is like all three rolled up into one perfect dodgeball.The mind games and opponent prediction of a fighting game is all there, and immensely gratifying.The controls are simple move, jump, hit, and bunt, which are easy to learn but hard to master.Each fighter has their own special move and strike ranges, some of which are easier to pick up than others, but everyone has a ridiculous skill ceiling to reach. (Don't believe me? Play a few online matches and you'll see what I mean)And the chaos. Oh my GOD the chaos. Imagine Smash, but you're fighting 100 people at once, all of which with reflectable projectiles that one hit KO. There are hilarious times, frustrating times, intense times, but most of all fun times.This game is essentially Pong, where your paddle has to swing, and can move around the entire map, losing a point only when it's struck.It doesn't sound like much, but *everything* in this game is executed perfectly.I have roughly 5 games that I will recommend whole heartedly, because I believe they are perfect experiences.This game has been in my library for about half a month, and it has been newly added to that list.MusicThe sound design, just force-feeds you adrenaline. Once the ball starts reaching hundreds of miles per hour you can feel the strength behind each swing with the crashing sound effects alone.Each stage has a unique song that just gets your heart pumping. Even in the oddball case of Candyman's ""Ordinary Days"", you focus a lot more simply because of the music and quite simply play better.GraphicsThe graphics look like something from the early 2000s.But don't let that take away from the visual design. No it's not using 4k 2440p ""oh my god I can see his nose mole"" realistic graphics. It doesn't need them, and it is better for it. Each map is based around a character and provides a little more insight into their background WITH the background. And god forbid you reach ball speeds above the thousands... Let's just say, that's a trip.Plot(As of my writing this) There isn't much (if any) story presented to you through the multiplayer or the Challenge mode (though there is a final boss), but this game really doesn't need one.You're playing this game to smack around your friends and strangers with thousand mile per hour dodge balls.Really, does it matter if there is no cosmic threat you have to defeat, or evil artifact you have to obtain? Hell no. Even if there was, you'd still smash their face in with the dodge ball all the same.Final WordsWhy are you still reading this? BUY THE DERN GAME AND START PLAYING!!			",148,55,0,20,5,1,9

												It's a fighting game, it's pong, it's expressive, it's a party game, and I never would have bought it if I wasn't introduced to it at a party, because trailers have a really hard time capturing why it's so much fun.The gameplay lives off a wide array of mechanics that are all accessed by basic movement keys and 2 more buttons. Different characters don't only have unique special abilities as showcased in the trailer but also subtle differences in the way they move, their hitboxes and the angles in which they hit the ball.At first, the game is just enjoyable without having any clue of what's even happening, but once you play more you get an idea of how high the skill ceiling actually is. To become a master, you don't only need high knowledge of/experience with the characters and perfect reactions, but also the ability to read, surprise and outsmart your opponent.

												This game is great AND YOU SHOULD GET IT RIGHT THE F*CK NOW!!!Seriously though, it's an awesome game which you should definitely check out. This game follows the style of several recent games in that it is easy to learn, but hard to master. The gameplay is very addictive and each of the 5 characters (with a sixth coming soon) has its own special, movement style and angles.Furthermore, you will find that the community is very friendly and eager to help a newbie. If you do not find a match online you can usually find someone to play with in the Lethal League chat (found on its community hub page).A prototype can be found on the Lethal League website here:http://lethalleague.reptile-games.com/prototype/Take note: as it is a prototype, not all features of the full game are implemented in it.Overall I would definitely say this game is worth its price!

												Just started to play and what I've seen so far is enough to recommend this game to everyone.Mechanics are rock solid (amazing with every game mode, from 1v1 to 2v2 to free for all)Animations are really well done and backgrounds are just as simple as fitting to create a futuristic (cyberpunk) atmosphere.Music, just a cherry on top, blends perfectly and gives a certain enjoyable rhythm to the matches.It's not a ""deep"" fighting game, but it is definitely a unique one (no other fighting/brawling games have a dodgeball-like mechanic as far as I know) and even if there are no fancy commands/moves it gets pretty technical with angles/feints/tactics.Again, strongly recommended to everyone.

Although the game has a lot of problem, the community has slowed down nowadays, and I don't really play it that often anymore, it's still one of the best games I have ever spent my time with.

												There’s so many addicting yet simply games, but Lethal League isn’t one of them. It’s a sort of a dodgeball, or squash rather, where you hit a ball (obviously) which gets faster and faster any time you score a combo. Your goal is to K.O. your opponent. Easy to pick up rules makes a very simple concept for the game that anyone’ll understand, but it gets so old very quickly at the same time. Seriously it’s just boring as hell. On top of that, there’s hardly anyone playing this game online. Still there’s a local multiplayer I guess, so if you’re into that kind of games than you’ll be happy about it. I’m certainly not, so I’m not recommending it.			",320,76,3,43,30,4,55

												I usually don't write reviews after only playing for a half hour. I tend to wait until I've either finished the game or played a large enough portion before getting bored with it to come to a valid conclusion.What I've seen of Lethal League so far indicates that it's a supremely addictive game. Simple mechanics are coupled with a very high skill ceiling and lots of challenge, which over the course of each match escalates to ludicrous heights. Each character has a very different set of abilities beyond simply tossing the ball around and the combination of a variety of characters make on-the-fly strategizing against them very entertaining. Overall I'd give Lethal League a big recommendation on that front.However, the connection issues are what absolutely kill this game for me at the moment. Every other match doesn't load properly and I've had plenty of disconnects even with players in my own region. Mind you that I have a 15MB/s (that's Megabyte, not Megabit) connection where my PC is connected via Ethernet cable and not Wi-Fi, so my connection is about as solid as you can get, and yet it still fails around 50% of the time. I won't cry about connection times since I realize that they're mostly down to the amount of active players, but once a connection is established, it's amazing how bad the game manages to function. Not to mention that when the game does actually hang up and never starts the next match, you can't simply get out again by pressing Escape or any other keys. You have to terminate the application with Alt+F4 every single time this happens, and it can get very annoying. I was fortunate enough to have bought the game with the recent Humble Monthly, so it cost me around $1.2, or 90% less than what's asked for here on Steam, which is why I'll keep the game and give it a mild pass in order to see if the issues get resolved in the future. But for the record, had I paid full price, I'd have refunded this broken mess immediately. Which is unfortunate, a game with solid mechanics and the potential for hours of fun is shot in the kneecaps by terrible connection issues.If the issues get resolved, I will edit this review to reflect any future changes made here.

												So basically you start out hitting a ball at pretty decent speeds until one of you gets their skull cracked open. The longer you survive the more ridiculous it gets, to the point where I'm pretty sure I was hitting the ball at light speed. It was terrifying and hilarious. Especially since faster hits have weird visual effects on maps (like, on one map all the windows break, an eclipse happens, and rioting mobs appear.) that then vanish when the ball is no longer being hit. Its like youre ripping into an alternate dimension.I should mention that my first (and so far only) play session lasted two whole hours, but felt closer to 30 mins. So, overall, pretty damn great. I usually complain a lot in reviews (...on Amazon. I rarely do Steam reviews) but I don't even have any complaints about this.If you're unsure about buying it, just do. You won't regret it.

												Great game. There has been many complaints about the lag but it works perfectly most of the time. In 30+ something hours, I only entered two or three online matches that were laggy. For some reason it lags with a friend of mine in private matches but no one else. Honestly, the fun is worth the lag.Favorite game on steam so far.Only problem with this game is that there isn't enough people playing it. I'm not saying that to praise the game, the community is seriously small :(Edit: Wow it's been a long time. Still my favorite			",103,12,0,11,4,1,5

												Well now that I'm almost at 30 hours of game time I might as well say something about it. I purchased this game right after seeing Total Biscuit and friends play this in his first impressions video for this game. It looked like exactly my kind of game, and it is.This game is awesome. There are many things about it that will remind you of Super Smash Bros. I'm an avid super smash brothers fan. I problably have played close to 10,000 hours of Melee. This game just hits the same spots for me. The controls are so tight and the animations feel so right. Every stupid little combos and moves you concoct feel so satisfying and absolutely amazing. The gameplay is very simple but to master it would take a very long time. At first it might seem like the game is just luck, but believe me, there is no luck involved and you will know immediately when you are playing against someone of a higher skill level than you.It seems like the game does not show you how to do anything other than the very basic stuff. You've got to figure stuff out for yourself in Lethal League and that is a great thing.I will be playing this game for years to come for sure and you should too!			",220,34,7,43,23,1,25

												One of the most insane fighting games I have ever experienced. Lethal League takes the fun party game feel, and colorful roster of characters from Smash Brothers. And combines it with the the most intense dodgeball game in the universe. The only way for you to knock out your opponent is to smack the ball in to their face. Bring in 2 or 3 of your friends and you have fun in its purest and hypest form. The single player is a challenge, especially the final boss. You'd really have to dedicate yourself enough to actually become skilled enough to stand toe to toe with it (or you could actually be good at video games, which I am not). Overall a fantastic fighting game, and if there is even a chance of it getting a sequel I'm all on board.			",143,21,1,10,9,2,5

												Fun game, can be crazy at times and I recommend using a controller because of the better control, only good for playing online against people because bots are terrible. Each character has a automatic modifier on the ball after hitting the ball 4 times. Dont play against bots because they are crappy and cheap to play against, they should remove the achivments for it and really fix them so they are more human-like on the reactions. ie. Following the ball and always hitting it the split second its near them. If you ever get stuck hitting the ball back to eachother when standing next to the harder level bot they will ALWAYS hit it the second the ball starts to move so its almost impossible to win, if you put a high level bot v bot in that situation the game wouldn't end.)

												The game is very fluid. The controls are tight. No graphics options but the game is really light, so not much problem there. Each character has a special ability, a 'parry', and some sort of jumping ability. And they all feel unique and varied enough to keep you occupied.There's 3 game modes (FFA, TDM, and Strikers which is like Basketball) and they're all fun.Hectic and fast paced, playing this with friends is a blast!

												Lethal League is a competitive ""battle pong"" that has you take control of one of six players, each with different styles of play, in a deadly game of tag-by-baseball. The fundamentals of the game are pretty simple: Hit the ball and it changes to your color and will damage every enemy player but not yourself. Bunting will send the ball upward and give you a chance to reposition for a better attack. Any time you hit the ball you build up a super meter that will allow you to perform a special attack once filled. The majority of strategy in LL revolves around two things: hit meter/lag, and angles. You'll need to pay attention to the hit meter at the bottom of the screen to know how much longer it will be before the hit lag ends and the ball continues on in play. Knowing when it will re-enter play will allow you to position yourself accordingly and begin your counter attack. Another important factor is being aware of the angle the ball takes (or will take if you can predict it) since knowing that will allow you to take control of it with your own strike or avoid getting knocked out. Lethal League basically has two modes spread across several categories: Versus (Online/Local/Challenge) and Strikers. Versus is the basic game mode where you have a limited number of life stocks and the game ends when you or your team run out of them. Strikers puts you in position of a goal that you must keep the enemy team from hitting with an enemy-charged ball. There is also a point game in the challenge mode which is like versus but you play until one player gets a set number of kills.Since the game only has six playable characters, six stages, and really just two modes (only one of which seem to be played online: versus). You'll probably find yourself running out of things to do without having a bunch of friends to play with. Not to mention the online community is rather small and it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes just to find a match, and when you do find a match, having any kind of lag between the players can make some rounds pretty difficult as the ball bounces and hit lag can become downright unpredictable. There are definitely some fun times to be had when you get matched up with a decent opponent, though.I would recommend grabbing this game somewhere around $5 or cheaper to really get your money's worth. It's not a bad game per-se, it just needs more content.			",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

												At the time of this review I have more than 400 hours on this simple 2D projectile game I never thought I would play much, Its very addicting and one of the few games you can appriciate when losing a match.For Each hour you play, You get better, there is a very nice skill curve and time curve. only when reaching the highest levels of skill will players start to platou their skill.This is the game to buy if you love spending alot of time to become a pro, and then want to 6-0 noobs every time.And then also have intense heart racing clashes with people around your level.Seriously fun game, but too many MLG weeabos in the community.Must buy, get into games fast and feed your domination addiction, you can play for a few just minutes a day and retain skill, not a high mantinace game.

YouTube™ Video: Lethal League - 4 player bonanza on Steam 

			Views: 742		

			This game is excellent fun, and gets pretty chaotic with 4 ballers at once. First match is with a highly agitated ball setting, 2nd match is more how it usually goes. Players are my nephews and me.		

No really. If you need a fastpaced, short but addicting game that's playable with 4 of your buds, or some strangers online, this is for you.Lethal League is comparable to a game of tennis or pong. Except totally insane and chaotic. And you aim to kill your opponent with the ball instead of passing them. While there's order in the chaos, nothing is more fun to get the ball speed up to insane heights and hope you survive. The game rules and controls are simple and to the point; hit the ball, bunt the ball and jump to avoid the ball, while trying to hit other characters with it. Each of the 5 characters has their own specific special abilities.There might be a learning curve when it comes to timing your shots and being able to track the ball the faster it goes, but with practice comes alot of fun, and when you master it, it gets EVEN BETTER. It's recommended to play with friends, locally or online, but randoms can be fun too if you find the right guy.GGPO, this game's online component, is a little more tighter than done with Street FIghter 3: Online edition, altho sometimes you notice people dying yet not, but the game is so fast you don't care anyway and adjust accordingly.If there's one slight I would give this game: Not too often, It can and will crash at a certain point, persumably one of the characters specials will hit the ball and might crash one of the players out of the game. It's a sad thing too, because other times it won't happen and gameplay flows fine. I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.All in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.Yeah.8.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game itself is very simple in execution and content. You hit a ball back in forth until one of you gets hit, but heres the catch.The ball doubles with speed everytime. Every hit you do will take longer and longer with the hit lag and bunting...Don't even get me started on the amazing drug that is bunting.I can drop out all of this game because you really need to play it for yourself.

												There's not a lot to say about Lethal League. And that's by no means a bad thing, I wish I could say a lot of things about this game, because I find it to be one of the better PvP games I've played in a long time. The game is simple: think of it like... racketball, with an anime escalation twist. Battle Pong. The game gives you a good amount of option, the characters are varied, and the game is simple enough to pick up and play, but just complex enough to really garner competitive spirit. My only complaint (and this goes for a lot of fighters, as well) is that certain parts of the system are not presented to player really at all. But other than that, Lethal League is a well crafted game that's simply a blast to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very fun unique fighting game that I quite enjoyed playing, especially with friends locally. The local play works flawlessly and is very fun, I just wish there were a bit more modes and content in general is all. The modes that are there though are great and I especially like the addition of the challenge mode. The online runs decent and is fun too if you have good connection. Overall, this is highly recommended if you are looking for a great multiplayer fighting experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, so first of all, some people think that the actual content that this game offers doesn't really justify it's price. I don't share this opinion, the game isn't really all that expensive and while the content may be limited, there is just a lot of fun to be had with it. However, I still strongly urge anyone who considers buying Lethal League to get some friends to play this game with and buy a 2 or a 4-pack and split the price. The multipacks are pretty good deals, and the game is the most fun when you are playing it with a friend anyway.Now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about why you should buy this game, because you absolutely should.Lethal League is a projectile based 2-D fighter with an interesting, kind of jet-set-like style to it. It features a surprisingly good soundtrack that really complements the gameplay as well as the overall feel of the game. Lethal League actually has very few mechanics, yet still provides a decent amount of depth, so it is pretty easy to pick up while being able to entertain and challenge you for a long amount of time. Basically, the goal in this game is to hit your opponent with an anti-gravity-ball which will cause them to lose one life instantly. You can hit or bunt the ball in various fashions to make it reach ludicrious speeds and bounce around in crazy patterns, and believe me, it's just mad fun. The sheer insanity of the gameplay paired with the incredible soundtrack and cool visual just makes it a blast to watch or play. There are currently six characters which differ in mobility and special moves, as well as the angles they can make the ball travel at.The game doesn't really offer all that interesting offline modes, but it's most enjoyable in multyplayer anyway. You can play free for alls, team fights and 1v1s. Lethal League, just like Skullgirls, uses GGPO and it results in super smooth feeling online play.So, if the concept sounds at least a bit appealing to you and you have someone to play it with, you really owe yourself to pick it up, especially since there are not much games that are able to offer you a similar expierence out there.

												You can't go wrong with Lethal League, a perfect mix of baseball and dodge-ball. Everything in the game is almost perfect, starting from its netcode, powered by GGPO middleware. You'll get tons of fun, with this addictive arcade style game. Windjammers' spirit is alive and kickin'!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The game itself is very simple in execution and content. You hit a ball back in forth until one of you gets hit, but heres the catch.The ball doubles with speed everytime.

YouTube™ Video: Lethal League - 4 player bonanza on Steam 

			Views: 742		

			This game is excellent fun, and gets pretty chaotic with 4 ballers at once. First match is with a highly agitated ball setting, 2nd match is more how it usually goes. Players are my nephews and me.		

No really. If you need a fastpaced, short but addicting game that's playable with 4 of your buds, or some strangers online, this is for you.Lethal League is comparable to a game of tennis or pong. Except totally insane and chaotic. And you aim to kill your opponent with the ball instead of passing them. While there's order in the chaos, nothing is more fun to get the ball speed up to insane heights and hope you survive. The game rules and controls are simple and to the point; hit the ball, bunt the ball and jump to avoid the ball, while trying to hit other characters with it. Each of the 5 characters has their own specific special abilities.There might be a learning curve when it comes to timing your shots and being able to track the ball the faster it goes, but with practice comes alot of fun, and when you master it, it gets EVEN BETTER. It's recommended to play with friends, locally or online, but randoms can be fun too if you find the right guy.GGPO, this game's online component, is a little more tighter than done with Street FIghter 3: Online edition, altho sometimes you notice people dying yet not, but the game is so fast you don't care anyway and adjust accordingly.If there's one slight I would give this game: Not too often, It can and will crash at a certain point, persumably one of the characters specials will hit the ball and might crash one of the players out of the game. It's a sad thing too, because other times it won't happen and gameplay flows fine. I'm expecting this to be fixed in an upcoming patch of some sort.All in all, an excellent fun and simple game that gets deeper the more you get into it, and a great way for a bunch of buds to spend some time smacking each other in the face with high velocity balls.Yeah.8.7/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Crazy fun game with friends.I first played the original ""Browser"" version of this game a long time ago.It was insanely fun then, and even more so now that they have an updated version.The concept is simple: You hit a ball back and forth, trying to knock out your opponent.The catch? The ball picks up speed. BIG TIME. There are 5 characters, and each have their own special abilities and characteristics. Some can cling to walls, Double jump, Skate along the ceiling, Wall jump, etc.They also have a special meter that builds up after 4 sucessful hits, allowing your character of choice to unleash their own unique special move.The animation is fluid and the environments are well done, and each stage comes with a pretty sick sound track.But back to the speed. The game picks up insanely quickly, and you can easily lose focus and get frustrated amidst all the chaos. (I had one friend who was turned away from thisgame just because it was way too fast paced for him)It's not for the weak. Haha.It's easy to master the timing, but I can also see how some people would think the game lacks depth beyond just hitting a ball.  I personally find great satisfaction going up against another person who can keep up.The matches are extremely exciting, and this is a GREAT party game to play locally.Hours upon hours of fun if you're competitve, and love getting hyped up during intense moments.Highly recommended... The price is debatable as far as content goes, but I'm the type of person whodoesn't care too much for that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What a fantastic game! I love simple games but full of style. In this game you and your friends one bounce a ball in the others, almost like a dodgeball. Each time the ball is hit it is faster to a bizarre speed. The game is very fun to play with friends. The graphics is very clean and a bit retro, with large images in pixel art. The characters are well diversified and very cool. The soundtrack is flawless and so important that there is a stereo in the game interface.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best way to describe Lethal League is as a simplification of the fighter genre mixed with a projectile game.Divekick did that in that fact that instead of having complicated moves, it became more about timing and mind games.Lethal League does that in your positioning, your timing (although its pretty easy to get good at that), and your ability to change things up enough to freak out the opponent. If you don't mess with their head, and you're both good at the timing and positioning, the game can go on for a long time.It's a lot about making less mistakes than the other person. In fact, that's pretty much how you win.But enough about that, why should you play this game?PROS:- Easy to just play, easy to get good at, but relatively hard to get REALLY good at- Can keep you busy with just the singleplayer, but has a decent online matchmaking system, as well as local and online 4 player, similar to smash bros- Good at not frustrating the player, the most fun way to play if the best way to win- Gameplay that manages to be fast but also slow??? It works, trust me- Awesome music- Funky art- No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥br>CONS:- Small character roster (Also a pro because it's easier to learn everything)- Much lower skill cap than other fighters (doesn't mean it can't be competetive)- Really grindy level up system (at least you get rewards for every level in the form of colour palletes and different balls which change up gameplay)In short, if you like unique fighters, or Jet Set Radio, or both (like me), this game should be appealing to you.Also a good party game.

												I said this might be the next Windammers, but it's a whole step beyond that. It's a 4 player party with working internet play that is essentially the time-tested gameplay of Pong mixed with the brutality of Super Dodge Ball at supersonic speeds. It just feels super satisfying to hit that ball, it's pure excitement. It's also got actually challenging challenges, working Internet play using the GGPO framework (which is a marvel in itself) and some unlockables.It's light on content, but when what you have is SO GOOD, i'm not going to complain about that. A nice simple game with askill ceiling of practically infinite height, the ultimate duel for bragging rights. If you take home 1st in this you will KNOW you earned it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is the perfect definition of 'Easy to learn, hard to master'. The playability is amazing, the fun with friends is unparalleled, and the epicness of making a great play, whether by chance or skill, is absolutely rewarding.This game made me scream and jump out of my seat as I have never before. Getting the 'Grand Slam' achievement left me without words, as it was epic.It only lacks a stable server base to play online, and also the capability of parting up with some friends on my local PC and then going online.Other than that, it's amazing. The drawing style, the soundtrack, the characters and their looks and abilities, the replayability, the dystopian-urban future. Excellent.Definetly a game worth buying.Would love to see an animated series of this 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're considering buying this game to play it with friends, stop reading reviews and just buy itIf you don't have fun, I will personally come to your house and refund you the money you spentFun party game with a very competitive multiplayer scene, similar to Smash BrosVery simple, intuitive mechanics - it's easy to pick up and play, while maintaining a high skill ceiling (see: candychaining)Some mechanics aren't presented with much depth in the tutorial, so consider spending a while on Google to learn about parrying and Switch's specialOnline will have you disconnect once or twice before you can connect to an opponent, but once you find a game it can continue as long as you like, I've had one 1v1 go on for a few hours - relatively short queues, 3 minutes is considered a long queue imoAll that being said, I picked up this game recently and have been hooked ever since, and I don't see myself losing interest any time soonEDIT: One year post-review and the online is mostly dead. The only people playing right now are the die-hards and tryhards, which makes it difficult to learn the game. Pick it up if you plan to play with friends or if the game is on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lethal League is a competative baseball/dodgeball hybrid that supports up to four players in one match. With each strike of the ball, the speed is doubled, sometimes even quadrupled (and in serious cases, maxed at one million). Maybe you and a few friends sit on the couch and hit the ball back and forth a few times. Maybe it's you and a stranger online. Regardless, every hit and dodge are anxiety and adrenaline riddled. With more than four friends who've enjoyed this game with me, we've never experienced any rage or upsetting losses, only awe at how insane it is to bunt the ball at such ridiculous speeds and then pelt it right back at the poor soul who bashed it towards you in the first place. Each character has a special ability that makes the matches all that much more interesting once they've filled their blue bar. Beware Dice and Candy Man. There's also an interesting secret character which you can play as in local matches; I'll let you google the code for yourself.My friends and I give this game a 10/10 for competative shenanigans and I give it a 9/10 for the minor network bugs. Worth the price, but I'm glad I snagged it on the humblebundle for a buck.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good gosh this game is one heck of an amazing ride.Your goal of the game here is to use your ball (it becomes ""yours"" when you hit it) to take out your opposition. What starts as a decently paced back and forth versus match quickly can turn into a frantic twitch batter as the ball flies feverishly across the sceen with each successive hit. The game is smooth and intense, the controls fluid and responsive, and I without friends now. Totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and get this game! Better yet, do everyone a favor and get the 4 pack so more of us can game together.Gosh I love this game, and you will too!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You like baseball? You like Street Fighter? Then this game won't be for you. You hit the ball in the middle to gain control and it goes just a bit faster.Someone else hits it, it gives them control and goes even faster.The ball can go up to 1 million in speed and then it can't go faster.You will get used to the game after a while and you might choose Switch. The most complicated person you can play on this game.Everyone has a special move by double tapping the hit button when you hit it. But with Switch you have to double tap the jump button to do his special. It's complicated like that.With this community base also, it's worth every dollar you use for this game.Just pick it up and play around in Challange mode or vs your friends or just strangers.Either way you'll have fun. The sound track is also amazing to listen to while playing this awesome game. Just pick it up.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Definitely my pick for the most fun to be had in a game in several years! Lethal League is a projectile fighting game which starts off easy to learn, then quickly scales into either a chaotic mess of fun to be had with your friends or a very interesting competitive experience. With a gameplay system that's much deeper than it would seem at a glance, Lethal League provides fun to whoever is willing to give it a shot, and I'd highly recommend you fork out a few bucks for the game that keeps on giving.It being a multiplayer game, it does suffer from the usual lack of opponents issue when you want to play against someone in less than ideal circumstances. The art of the game certainly isn't particularly striking or unique in any way, just enough so to serve its purpose. Lethal League also suffers from a lack of diverse content, but that's forgivable as what content there is has been polished to a mirror shine.Every shortcoming listed is easily ignored in favor of a Higher Fun, and you should definitely get in on the chaos everyone's talking about!

												Since Steam opened up Chinese region, a large number of Chinese players entered Steam. They no longer play pirated games, but pay for genuine games. Based on the huge population and excellent quality of the game, adding Chinese language support is clearly a win-win option, with a low cost in exchange for unparalleled reputation and substantial revenue, game makers really should consider it carefully. And as far as we know, compared to the quality of the game, the Chinese players prefer pay for the games which have Chinese language - even though it is not particularly good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The craziness that can unfold in this projectile fighter is off the charts. Despite having simple controls, the mechanics go deeper than just ""hit the ball and hope for the best"", as each fighter/character/baseballer has their own unique tricks and twists to their swings that tend to make things tricky in regards to retaliation. There's a distinct 90's-era style about it, as anyone who enjoys Jet Set Radio would be able to pick up on almost immediately; music included. It's also a blast with friends. A great game and experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game has to be one of the best 4 Player casual games out there on steam. Seriously, there is a real sense of competitive gameplay and smoothness in this game. I recommend this game to anyone looking for some quick free-for-all baseball action. Not that many characters to choose from, which is not really a problem for me but other people like fighting games with mor diversity. Overall 9.5/10.

												This game is.. good?It's fun when you start but I find it's not a very good ""fighting"" game.  It makes you hit a ball around the arena and if you get hit with the ball your out for the rest of that round.  It doesn't get interesting in anyway and every match feels the same, but the ball will speed up one speed unit.. thing(?) every time you hit it and the speed doubles if you do a ground shot.  It is defenitly a good game to play if you have two or three friends to play with because the game is very boring with only a CPU, and you will almost always win against the comp.  The one thing I do enjoy about this game is that each character DOES have unique features that actually can make a big difference in a battle.  Raptor has a wall jump, Candyman can jump real high and has slightly faster fall speed, and Switch can ride up the wall and on the ceiling if you run and jump at a wall from half way across th stage.  ALSO!  The stages.  They are all the same lay out like in most fighting games, since the game is kind of a, Cool, hiphop, street kinda game, the music is always fitting(if you understand any of those descriptions).Like most games on a modern platform there are a lot of Acheivements.  They all are pretty easy to unlock but one or two might force you to play more than you want to.  This game also has a level up system like in Injustice.  They only unlock extra skins for characters and maybe once or twice a new ball type but it isn't anything special.  The basic arcade mode is featured in this game, but feels very dull due to the small 6 character roster.  There's also an online battle mode but I NEVER found any one online so it's a bit nonexistent.I really wanted this game to be good but the small roster and some what dull gameplay don't really grab me.  But the music is very good and is a small thing to keep the maps fun.I think that with all considered, I give this game a rating of 5/10.Hope you can get more out of it than me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Before you buy it I would make sure your system can run the game because 2 of my friends cant even make it to the main menu.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally i think the game is fantastic to play with friends. I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again  - candyman has no heavy falling  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle - sonata  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points  - has a double jump - latch   - can climb walls   - largest hitbox   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught - switch   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)   - upward aim goes behind him   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter) - Raptor  - smallest hitbox  - can bunt if ball is above him  - fastest hit  - special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I recommend to get this game with a few freinds for a lot of laughs and good times. The contorls are easy to learn and the game is pretty straight forward. Hit your oppenent with the ball but the really good thing about this game is the time dialation when the ball breaks the sound barrier.  Definately a fun game to keep you occupied for awhile.

But the combination of a great concept, percise movements, and colorful world make this a must have for game night! ONLY downside I can state is the lack of characters. Six truely isn't alot.

Gameplay is extremely nice and simple. It doesn't try to be very complicated, which is very good. I believe Team Reptile knew what they were doing with this game, for sure. It does not have many characters but more are expected to come along. For how much I like the characters, I think they are very cool.

												To start off. This game is defenitly different than your average 2D fighter. With a very simular aspect of a Super Smash Bros. game, It's A four-player game with a objective that's not beating up another player until their health gauge is gone. Instead your hitting a ball at intense velocities slowly creeping up in momentum until one of the players hits it back faster or is knocked out by the ball. This is where it gets insane. Each character, despite its low roster, has special abilities to either make the ball move faster or cause insane mix-ups on the other players. They all have simular properties to SSB characters: like fast falling, Dash Dancing, and floaties. The big thing that you need to learn in this game is not really the technical prowess, but learning the frames of the game, predicting where the balls is going to go, and timing every hit correctly. Aside from all this jibber jabber, this game offers minimal stuff to do aside from leveling up, unlocking skins, and comepleting a offline challange mode simular to a arcade mode of somesort. The online takes a while to  find any kind of matches including 1 on 1 or a free for all battle but I have yet to run into a  match where it's just miseriably laggy. If you want a hype, over the top, different 2d fighter game; play this, enjoy it with your friends or go online and smash some scrubs. I'd definintly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The craziness that can unfold in this projectile fighter is off the charts. Despite having simple controls, the mechanics go deeper than just ""hit the ball and hope for the best"", as each fighter/character/baseballer has their own unique tricks and twists to their swings that tend to make things tricky in regards to retaliation. There's a distinct 90's-era style about it, as anyone who enjoys Jet Set Radio would be able to pick up on almost immediately; music included. It's also a blast with friends.

												Lethal League is a super fun, Smash Bros style (not objective wise) game that is extremely fun with friends. Now, if you don't have friends, maybe you shouldn't pick this one up, as the BOTs are fun, but not near as fun as playing with someone you know. While playing with my friend, with other people watching, I heard many ""dude that was awesome""s or histarical laughter as someone gets hit by a super easy ball. The gameplay consists of hitting a ball back and forth between 1-3 other players, if you hit the ball last, it is outlined in your color and is lethal if it touches the other player. The other player has to hit the ball back to make it their color and to try and get you. This simple gameplay leads to hilarious moments where people get lucky shots and send the ball back even faster to the next player. The ball speed is really fast and sometimes hard to predict when you first pick up the game, so you can feel a real sense of getting better as you play the game. Super fun game, the AI is good, but not outstanding, pick it up if you have friends to play it with.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												short version: worth the buylong-ish version: great multiplayer game that brings smash bros to mind in it's relatively simple yet chaotic gameplay. the kind of game thats easy to learn and hard to master. characters skills leave a nice twist on the gameplay. awesome soundtrack. art is pretty neat, especially when the ball really gets moving. leveling system unlocks skins, which is nice, but nothing game changhing, obviously. overall just a pretty fun game for fighting game fans looking for something new and different, but i doubt that it would ever be played hardcore mlg like street fighter or tekken. one thing to note, however, is that i DID buy this with 2 friends, so i've been playing with them pretty exclusively; if/when i get around to trying more of the single player or trying random multiplayer i'll update the review, but i wouldn't count on it since i'll probably forget/am incredibly lazy.solid 8/10.

												How do I describe this game?.......Lethal leauge is how many peopke describe it, a mix between PONG and Super Smash Bros. The main idea is you and up to 3 other players hit a small ball that seems to lack gravity or air resistance inbetween each other. When you hit the ball it get's 'tagged' with your color, and if someone gets hit with the ball when it's not tagged their color they're out.There's a lot more to it than that, like stage sizes and hit angles, but if you want a fun little game you ca jump into whenever and mess around with friends, or compete in actual tournaments, this game is for you.It's also a very chaotic game, however. At times you and someone else will end up getting one of you out, then thinking 'What the hell just happened?' And usually it can be a bit jarrring, especially at higher ball speeds when the screen starts shaking and you have to factor in hit lag.Overall, I give this game a 10/10. Really. I have no complaints.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was great fun. i know im late at reviewing it and most people probably have moved onto other games but if you havent gotten this game yet, definiately buy it. It is worth the money. the only problem i had was connection problems but that was like once every 6 games and only one person would drop from a free for all. I recommend to get this game with a few freinds for a lot of laughs and good times. The contorls are easy to learn and the game is pretty straight forward. Hit your oppenent with the ball but the really good thing about this game is the time dialation when the ball breaks the sound barrier.  Definately a fun game to keep you occupied for awhile.

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.

I beseech you, do not bunt the ball out of their reach just to strike it into the earth and then bunt it for a special. I can only hope you don't taunt after every win that leaves craters in the ground, walls, and ceiling.For the love of God, only get this game if you hate happiness and companionship.

												I guess I'll start this review like everyone else started their own review:No weak♥♥♥♥♥♥Lethal League is a projectile fighting game that plays like nothing else I know of. To make immediate comparisons, it's like Smash Bros meets Pong meets Divekick, with a lot of emphasis on the Divekick part. The goal of the game is incredibly simple: hit the ball to gain control of it, try to smack it into everybody else. If someone else hits the ball, don't get hit and try to return the ball.This game is deceptively simple, and I say this because even though the mechanics are limited, the ways in which you use those mechanics are actually fairly deep. You have two main actions you can take, you can hit the ball or you can bunt the ball. When you hit the ball, you can either send it flying straight, or angle it up or down. Bunting the ball will slow it down to its lowest possible speed and pop it in the air, giving you time to place your next hit strategically. Every hit will cause the ball to gain more speed, making it harder to keep track of, dodge, and hit.But it turns out that there's WAY MORE STUFF YOU CAN DO THAN THAT. There are six ways of hitting the ball: on the ground, you can angle it up, down, or straight forward, in the air you can angle it up, forward, or spike it to the ground. Spiking the ball automatically doubles the speed, so you can cause the ball to get faster multiplicatively by spiking it over and over again. You can also bunt the ball up, forward, backward, or straight down, giving you options on where you place the ball. Hitting a ball at the same time as your opponent causes you guys to clash and bounce off each other. And with the five characters, each one has their own super move, swing speeds, swing arcs, and hitting angles. This game hits every fighting game requirement in respect to its depth, but at the same time it has that appeal that Divekick has of being super easy to pick up.The music is amazing in this game, all the tracks are taken from independent music creators, and it sets the entire tone of the game really well. Tracks are intense and fun, matching the frantic gameplay. The sound design isn't shabby either, as the ball increases in speed you hear sonic booms, the hit sounds are really nice and snappy, this game loves to bombard you with its really solid sound design.The art style is really great, too. Well drawn backgrounds that aren't too busy, but are still dynamic and change as the ball moves faster and faster. The characters are really interesting looking and are animated well, and your moves feel like they have weight behind them.As for the online, it works beautifully. Lag is completely unnoticable, when it works it works well. I did have occasional disconnection problems, but it was pretty negligable as me and my friends could jump back into the game really easily if anything went wrong and pick up with a fresh round.The only possible complaint you can levy against this game really is that the content is slightly lacking. With only five characters to choose from and six stages, it might leave you wishing for a little more to play with. But all in all, this game is an incredibly solid mechanical marvel that is great fun with friends. I give this a solid recommendation; there's no reason not to have this in your library.

I mean that is if you like fast paced and intence party combat games with great music and satisfying yet simplistic controls. Each playable character is unique in their own way, along with skins you can unlock for further customization. As far as anything else the game seems to lack an extensive singleplayer or much in the ways of collectables, but it sure is a bundle of fun!

												If I had to give this game a tagline, it would be ""very fun, but really only if you have friends to play with"".Really, this game has the potential to be very fun. In the most basic game, you hit a ball back and forth; if it hits you, you're out for the round. And it gains speed at every swing. So pretty simple, really. And hilarious. You can play local multiplayer or online multiplayer, and there's also a single player mode (""challenge mode"") which is a set amount of matches against set characters and combinations. The game modes are free-for-all (just hitting the ball until only one player remains), team play (works best for four players, obviously) and strikers (hit the other team's goal instead of its players).The problem with this game is that if you're playing alone, there really isn't much to do besides challenge mode - which, honestly, I didn't find it as fun as multiplayer. You can try to search for matches online, but most of the time it's just unfruitful, and the online mode has quite a few connectivity issues, especially if the match has more than two players. The game also gets repetitive quite fast, and while leveling up does unlock new things, they're mostly skins for the characters (there are 6 different in the game) which are purely cosmetic and honestly not that rewarding.Still, if you have a couple friends willing to engage in some pong-esque shenanigans, maybe over a skype call or even some pizza at your house, I can recommend getting a multi-pack of this game and bash away.

A great online game, either via matchmaking or with friends - not to mention that this is an amazing party game.The hype can get real over the top in this game, and nothing feels sweeter than hitting a ball moving at 1,000+ speed.

												Personally i think the game is fantastic to play with friends. I saw videos of people playing it on youtube and loved what i saw. got in and realized... the game is hard, still fun, but hard. the ball goes up to high speeds quicklyso an average game is around 3-4 minutes at 8 lives starting at the default speed. there are a surpriding amount of strategies you can come up with after you figure out the nuances of the characters. my personal favorite is the fact that if you aim up with Switch (the robot skateboarder) the ball goes up and behind you, the hammer girl (Sonata) can change the ball direction with her special, my girlfriend even enjoys playing the aligator (Latch) because she can play ""Walligator"" by clinging to a wall and swinging until she can grab the ball and shoot it at me point blank. all in all it's a good gamesolid sound tracka ""challenge"" mode that reminds me of super smash bros classic 1P mode.art style isnt much at first but it grows on youminor connection issues in online multiplayerlocal multiplayer as well as onlineeasy to learn hard to master i would say (a lot of little details that make you better, but arent needed for casual play)-basics  - swing (hit ball, ups speed by 1) [aimable]  - bunt (knock ball up next to hit it gets bonus special meter) [aimable]        - once bunted the ball will move at a low speed but resume previous speed when hit by a player or hitting the ground  - parry (hit bunt during a hit to drain your special and knock back nearby players) [must be trying to hit the ball]  - slam (downward air swing that doubles the speed of the ball)specials and traits-candyman  - ball will teleport to the wall opposite the next wall it collides with keeping speed and direction, refreshed if CM hits it again  - candyman has no heavy falling  - candyman has the sharpest slam angle - sonata  - special hits the ball 3 times after release, can reaim the ball at these points  - has a double jump - latch   - can climb walls   - largest hitbox   - special eats the ball, carries it, and releases at speed it was caught - switch   - can scate on walls and cieling (limited time)   - upward aim goes behind him   - special is activated as a doublejump, if the ball hits switch during his kickflip the ball is hit by switch (counter) - Raptor  - smallest hitbox  - can bunt if ball is above him  - fastest hit  - special hits the ball twice and can change the direction of the ball on release			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the most interesting and inventive nontraditonal fighting games I've seen. Lethal League hides a ton of hardcore competitive depth beneath a deceptively simple and accessible surface. It also does an perfect job of making all the characters' playstyles and matchups feel unique despite the lack of large movesets, instead differentiating them through movement techniques, launch angles, and special mixups. An absolute must-play for both hardcore fighting game fans and casual players too.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I found this really interesting game on YouTube, and it looked appealing. So I waited for a good sale, bought it, and just had a blast. When I first saw this game, I thought it was your average fighting game that you could land all the sweet combos with friends. But Lethal League is so much more than just a fighting game. With the only way to blast fighters out of the arena using a ball that is consitantly gaining speed, bouncing, flying, and who knows what in any direction, this game adds an intense factor in trying to stay alive.I remember when I had three friends over and we all had out own wired controllers, so I suggested we played Lethal League. I had already been playing a lot of it, and they had never played in their life. Now, when I thought playing alone was fun, I never accounted having friends to play with. But when more people joined the game, it becomes hilariously joyous, with a lot of tense moments of only two people left and the ball being at over 1000 speed, some people figuring out new attacks, or people getting that three-hit wipeout, mostly on accident.All in all, Lethal League is a sweat-inducing and creative game, bringing a fresh idea to the fighting game genre, and one that works incredibly well. The multiplayer works great, hit detection is fine, the characters are interesting, and the gameplay is just plain awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Based on the time I've played so far I have to say that it's entertaining to play by yourself, and with friends it's absolutely hilarious. This to me is sort of a mixture between the classic game Pong and the Super Smash Bros series.The idea of making a fighting game where you don't hit each other but instead shoot a projectile at your opponents is something I personally haven't seen before.If I were to complain about something, it would be that the game should have more playable characters and more maps to play on. The game has a lot of potential but kind of falls on the lack of updates.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a good laugh.Also, NEVER underestimate the speed of a ball.

												My favorite local multiplayer / casual fighter game on the market, as I write this.It's simple enough for new players to pick it up and actually have fun immediately, with enough depth and split-second timing to keep things fresh. The mechanics are elegant and well-considered (unlike Divekick), there's some thoughtfulness to the action (more than Samurai Gunn), it's easy to see what's going on, and fun for any level of play (the bad part of Towerfall), and doesn't lend itself to standoffs or ever get slow (Nidhogg). The music is great. It looks bad, but don't let that stop you. Netplay is fairly good (!). My favorite local multiplayer competitive game of 2014.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For the love of all that is holy, don't get this game unless you want to lose any semblance of friendship you ever had in your life. I beg you, do not smack balls at speeds that put the sonic boom to shame into your friends' collective faces. I beseech you, do not bunt the ball out of their reach just to strike it into the earth and then bunt it for a special. I can only hope you don't taunt after every win that leaves craters in the ground, walls, and ceiling.For the love of God, only get this game if you hate happiness and companionship.

												I played this back when it was a free flash game. When I saw a full version was on Steam, I picked it up immediately. It's an extremely addicting game coupled with some pretty awesome music I might add. Easy to pick-up, tough to master (though you can get lucky at times). You will be spending most of your time in this game playing online, however, as there are few single player modes. It's a great down-time game, though, as an individual match is only between 2 and 5 minutes each.9/10, very addicting, easy to play, awesome music, wish there were a few more single player modes.

												Lethal League is pretty unique in the world of fighting games. The focus on a single projectile livens up an old genre with pong-like battle mechanics.Lethal League is also quite easy to pick up. The controls are simple, though there are a number of little tricks to learn, as well as ball trajectories. It will make a great party game, and it's a lot of fun for 2-4 players (the more the merrier IMO, though a good 1 on 1 can be intense).The solo 'challenge' mode is sufficiently challenging, and if that's not enough, you can also hone your skills against hard bots in versus play. As a solo player, you'll likely spend most of your time in online matches. My experience with online play has been good so far, often feeling as good as the local game.The art style is a matter of personal preference. I love it. I also love the way visual effects are tied in with the game's core mechanics, with distortion animations playing when the ball breaks certain speeds.The game's starting roster is small - just 5 characters - but they play quite differently. Some of the differences are obvious, like special attacks, jumps and special movement (like clinging to walls or skateboarding on the ceiling), while other differences are more subtle (like the angles of upwards and downwards strokes). There are rumours of more in the works, and it has been said that new characters will be added to the game in free updates.With all this in mind, Lethal League is a wonderful gem of a game, perfect for people who want something to play with friends, locally and online, and also great for competitive fighting game players looking for new ways to test their skills and reflexes without memorizing long combos.

												Lethal League is like a glorified Pong with a Smash Bros. skin. The basic objective is to knock your opponent(s) out using a ball that you keep knocking back and forth in between each other. Sound simple, yeah? But the catch is the more the ball gets smacked around, the faster it goes. Soon enough it reaches insane speeds to where you can barely keep up with it. The enviornment even changes as the speed gets faster and faster.The game is played in ""Bursts"", or rounds, and the ball's speed resets every round. The use of bursts make every round very intense and heart-pounding when the ball reaches the incredible speeds. Dare I say you may even be on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is great, too. Definitely fitting for the game, having nice funky tunes with you. Take a listen sometime.The characters are pretty unique in their own right. They each have a distinct character design and personality that you can easily recognize. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. Also, each of them have special abilities that have different effects on the ball, such as Candyman's ability to make the ball phase through the walls.In short, Lethal League is a fast paced, blood pumping action fest that you'll surely get a kick out of. I highly recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
