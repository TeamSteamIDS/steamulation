												Ehh. It's okay. The games are definitely colored a lot by nostalgia. The controls are kind of crap, the speed and timing are decidedly ""off"" on a modern machine, and the graphics aren't quite as good as I remember them being. That said, I'm reminded of how much I enjoyed these games in the past, and I'll definitely sink a bit of time into each one. It's a good chance to play all of these in the Amiga versions as well, which I never have done for all of them, for whatever reason.I wouldn't go out of my way to buy these without either the nostalgia factor or a keen interest in playing classic games. They're not the remakes - these are the originals. They were great at the time, but a lot of the interface improvements and so forth that you're used to seeing just aren't there; these games are 20+ years old, after all. Even so, it's a nice trip into history.I used to work for a company that was an offshoot of Cinemaware, for whatever it's worth; I've worked with several people who you'll see in the credits of these games. It may bias me one way or the other. I'm giving it a thumbs-up, but take that with a smallish grain of salt.			",844,307,14,135,127,9,171

												Only recommended for those who played these back in the day, I really don't think they would hold much appeal to anybody younger. The controls can be spongy, the gameplay objectives can be obtuse and a few of them just weren't very good games even in their day. I purchased this primarily with the following five titles in mind: Rocket Ranger and Defender of the Crown (which I originally played on the C64) and TV Sports Basketball, Wings and It Came From The Desert (which I played on the Amiga). Wings and It Came From The Desert still hold up respectably well. I've found that DoC and RR are a bit too frustrating thanks to the squishy controls. TVS Basketball was a fun way to waste an hour, ahh the memories of that darn Cinemaware team shooting 70% from the field every game... but it's not something with any real staying power. So I would give this a tepid recommendation to old school C64/Amiga owners who enjoyed some of these back in the day. Even if I'll likely not spend much more time with this collection, I've done worse for $8.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At the time these games came out there were three types of games: Old fashioned strategy games based on boards games, story games that involved a lot of reading with little possible action and the old standard side scrolling-style action fare. Cinemaware brought about the greatest change in gaming to date with these games. Games that blended, as seamlessly as was possible in the days of CGA graphics, the story with action. It is going to be dated for sure but they are still to this day good stories with a hint of action and/or strategy. King of Chicago was one of my favorites back then. It has a nice bit of randomness to it with a touch of sappy humor. ANd that is the attention to replayability they put into these games. Of course it is still a bit tedious sometimes but that is because of the age of programming. Well look, final verdict... If you are nostalgic for the old days then this is worth it for sure. If you want to learn about the olden days for a school project wait for a sale and if you still are looking forward to being a seniopr... walk away.			",122,19,2,23,34,2,56

I also covered this game on my retro YouTube show.If you're an old school Amiga fan, you probably know the catalogue of Cinemaware, a publisher who released a series of unique games that were technical showpieces for the platform. This is a compilation of some of their greatest hits, with both Amiga and DOS versions of the games available. The DOS versions are a nice added value I suppose but they don't look or sound nearly as good as the Amiga versions. The wrapper on the collection is also decent and offers a few options including save states. It's basic but does the job.One thing to note is that most of these games have not aged well at all. If you have fondness for them from back in the day, you'll probably still enjoy them. However, if you're a gamer who didn't grow up with the Amiga, you'll likely find these incredibly frustrating to play, even if their level of visual and audio fidelity doesn't bother you. This is a collection for old school Amiga/Cinemaware fans and those with a genuine curiosity for what these historical games were about. If you aren't those things, you'll probably use this for a few minutes and give up.			",748,151,15,54,55,3,73

												Jacko Rating 8.5/10A pack of old school goodies with both the Amiga and PC versions, thank you Cinemaware for releasing these classics in original format.  Playing It Came From the Desert again made me feel like I was back in high school with a opened Jaw expression due to the top end graphics and game play back then - this was one of the best games of my youth.If you are an old school gamer like me then just buy this now and be done with it :)  A true trip down memory lane to be had here.For those PC lovers out there who questioned us Amiga 500 gamers back in the day take a look at the difference in versions of these games and tell me you wouldn't have gone Amiga for personal home computer during this era of games.  My only hope is that Cinemaware releases updated versions of these as they did with Wings recently, if this does happen I can die a hapy man.Old Schoolers Enjoy! ",80,31,7,7,12,2,2

												If you want to get this for Defender of the Crown, STAY FAR AWAY.  The game is bugged and not how you remember it.  Your home castle isn't even in the same location!  The music is of lower quality as well.. More tinny.  I suggest searching for ""Amiga Forever"" and spend $10  for the Value Edition of their Amiga Emulator.  Then you can play Defender of the Crown just as you remembered it (and you get a working Amiga emulator to boot).			",316,43,29,12,17,3,21

												Ten dollars for this collection is absolutely stellar. They are what they are... Emulated classic games, with all the pros and cons of the originals, including floaty controls and lengthy load times. But the emulation is spot on, and the graphics remain surprisingly decent given their age. I would have a tough time recommending it for anyone who had never experienced these games, but for someone aching for nostalgia of some of the best games of the Amiga era, I can't recommend this package enough. Ten dollars is a steal for such a compilation of Golden Oldies.			",131,35,4,20,26,2,50

												Wow, I remember thinking these games were great when I was growing up. I am much older and wiser today. However, I am not wise enough to stay away from this one even at at a $1.49 sale price. Seriously, all kidding aside, in my opinion these games as they are presented in this bundle are not very much fun or very playable. There is no sound and no joystick control in the PC versions (DOSBox). The Amiga emulation, while offering sounds and joystick control, are a tad sluggish. There is not much, if any, documentation for the games. I am sure one can find ways to tweak and tune DOSBox and the Amiga emulator to make these more enjoyable as well as finding documentation for the games on the interweb, but I think I am just going to move on to something else. The nostalgia is great but it kind of ends there.			",51,6,0,12,11,0,16

												I used to play a handful of these games back in my Amiga days. After I bought my Amiga 1000 the first game I got was Defender of the Crown. Back then the graphics blew me away. Especially coming from the graphically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Commodore 64 I had before that. (and the C64 was a great computer too.)Several years later after I upgraded to an Amiga 500 I played classics like It Came From the Desert and Wings and more.Today I don't think to many kids would buy this anthology. It doesn't have the appropriate amount of bling-mapping kids these days require and, to be honest, the controls do feel a bit ""off"".No, this collection of games are for those who played them back in their youth and enjoy the nostalgia kick you might get from replaying them. Or, it's for the individual who might play a retro classic much like a film buff might go back and watch an Orson Wells film and appreciate the film/game for what it was and the technical ability to make such a classic.But that's not everybody.Anyway, it's unfair to judge any retro game by modern sensibilities. That is graphics, gameplay, sound and etc. so I will not apply a score. These are simply games that defined a great part of my youth and Iook at them for that and I replay them to relive that.

												Perhaps to due licensing issues ""The Three Stooges"" is missing from otherwise almost complete compilation and definitively a must have!For the asking price, I expected inclusion of 'gallery of game memorabilia' such as 'orginal box cover art', 'manual' and 'extra goodies'. GOG do offer a bit more than just the core game at considerably more cost being sold individually that ought to be included here. Example of compilation done properly was 2001's ""Atari: Anniversary Edition"".Amiga versions are vastly superior sound and graphically to PC offerings which could've been left out. Owning the originals of quite a few of these games on both platforms, authenticity has been lost as a result of some weird decisions made by the developer. Most annoyingly stripping out mouse support in some games that originally supported them notably ""It Came From the Desert"" series reverting to keyboard control for both Amiga and PC versions. The same game on PC uses tweaked Beeper (Speaker) for digitised sound effects (not music) which is supiciously absent whereas it runs fine from my original in DOSBox with mouse support, music and digitised sound effects.  Only buy it on discount otherwise you may feel cheated.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, I only played It Came from the Desert and was very disappointed in the lag between scenes.  The music is not playing when it should, but the visuals and context of the story are all there.  I would probably need more time to see if I would really recommend this to my friends.I can honestly say I played this when it was new on my Amiga 2000 (I still own this game), so I have a good starting point for my review.I have played this on emulators that worked better than this version.
