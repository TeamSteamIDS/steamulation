								Hey there! I am a (actualy quite new but eager) fan of your work and came along Chalo Chalo while playing Ibb & Obb with a friend of mine. A few hours later, we were eight people sitting together and yelling curses at each other while playing your game :blueduck:No but seriously, pretty cool game! You can easily turn it into a drinking game if you want, and people can join or leave the game without realy breaking the flow or tension. Thumbs up!			",66,7,2,7,6,1,9
