MiniGolf Mania plays and feels great. The controls are tight, the camera system works well, the powerups are pretty fun, but there are only 9 holes right now (launch day; 3/25/16). I mean, what is here, is great. I am excited to play some local co-op this weekend. There is no online multiplayer.I played through the existing 9 holes twice in about half an hour, solo style. It is probably the best minigolf game I've played.I am going to give this a thumb's up for being fun for a mere three bucks, BUT you need to be aware that while the developers may add more holes, it very well could never happen.

												First  review  ever: Recommendated,  but only if you want minimumal content and no Dev. communication or updates. Minigolf Mania  has  the  best `feel' of any minigolf game on Steam. It's very  simple, and the TALENTED Devs do a great job in making the game play and feel  easy to pick up and enjoy.  These guys know  how  to make a  quality simple  game.Sadly just like No Man Sky, these  developers  have  zero communication  with  the  buyers  of  this  game.  They  promise upgardes  soon, and never  deliver. Seems  like  they  simply:  do... not... care.  A hole/level creator  could give the  community  a great  tool  to  expand this  game (and have others to increase sales),  but  it  has  never been released. No  multiplayer,  but  co-op.  and the  worst  thing:  JUST NINE HOLES!To  sum-up. Fantastic potential, zero updates  for almost half a year. NO COMMUNICATION.  Many buyers of this  game   feel  slighted as  well as believe that this  has  been  bandoned.  I  hope  not! PS:  So if 3 dollars  is  okay  for  9 holes,  I  reccomend it,  but just nine holes... I  am  going  to say- No.  Sorry, cause  the  engine  and  working of MiniGolf Mania are wonderful!			",52,35,0,45,19,4,31

												Only nine holes at the moment which take about 20 minutes to beat. Solid control system and worth the $3.I look forward to more holes and a custom map editor that the developer has mentioned is on their to-do list.			",639,169,27,93,52,8,96

												Great game, alot of fun, great controls, great camera. I only have two complaints. First, there is only one course, and secondly the camera likes to clip through the floor now and then.			",35,17,1,2,27,4,5

												This game is good and easily worth the 2 quid. Play in the living room on the TV with friends. However gets dull quick without new courses and editor. With editor though will be great. Can't wait to make some courses			",49,1,1,5,6,1,2

												We liked it.All of the controls are solid, and everything acts as expected.  It was fun to play through as a family (local) and I suspect we will play through quite a few times more before we're bored of it.The only real downside is that there are only 9 holes, but the 9 holes are all very nice and for 2.99 (half of a trip to Starbucks) I can't really complain.  Hopefully there will be more holes added in the future.  Even if they're 1.99 per 9 hole DLC, I'd buy it.Good work.  Fun game.			",138,11,9,12,20,5,14

												Pretty nice little golf game. Emphasis on ""little"" for sure though.This game is fun enough and fine for what it is, but it only has nine holes, which really isn't much at all. If this game ever gets more content (which judging by the post by the developers a month ago, it probably will, but it's slow going) I think this game will be excellent.			",97,22,6,4,12,4,5

												8 Minutes!  That is what this is!  It's a reasonably well done 8 minutes! Controls well etc but it's way too short to justify the price tag of £1.99!Iv'e read other reviews and seen this described as a demo and I am enclined to agree.Sorry but I can't recomend it because I do not think it is really a full game and don't think it should be sold as such!

												Now. All though I do recommend this game at a 3 dollar price tag. I could go through the only course in the game in about 20 minutes. It would of been nice to have a cpu player playing with me but it is only solo. And if there is cpu I can't figure it out. That I find dissapointing. The course is well designed. and it is fun for 20 minutes but unless you have friends that have the same game you might as well save your 3 bucks. 5/10 ",100,22,4,15,15,2,16

												Probably the only minigolf game without online multiplayer. ""Golf with Friends"" just came out also, it has 2 full courses, online multiplayer, and physics customization. This game read multiplayer on the right but is only local co-op. Get either ""Golf with Friends"" instead or the new ""Tower Unite"" game that comes out in April. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeit.
