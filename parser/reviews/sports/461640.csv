												This is a amazing game which I bought for only $0.89.I enjoyed this game totally and spend 35 hours on this game to play it to completion.What is really great about this game is the storyline.The story is not only very interesting, it also have a lot of very surprising twist and turn.When I get to the end I found that everything in the game world is not as it seems.Furthermore, I had a very warm feeling when I finish the game.I have a new understanding of what God and Demon means (in this particular game world).There is also themes romance, sacrifice, prejudice etc that makes the game a lot deeper than what it appears initially.I also love the way the game progress from beginning to end.It unfolds like a mystery novel, and I can also play several flashback of past events which helps me understand the story. Some of the flashbacks contains surprising revelations that totally change my perception of the protagonist and antagonist. You also play flashback of different characters each with their unique point of view and you get to understand their rationale of why they did certain things.  I would say that the developer of this game is really a Master Story Teller.This game is defintely not the mindless hack and slash RPG Maker story.It is also not the typical demon-destroy-the-world and you-destroy-the-demon story that is repeated in many rpg games. I would give the plot a A++.As for the downside, a few of the Steam Achievements are not working.However, the developer is actively trying to fix them and release patches of the game whenever he found a solution.In conclusion, this game is defintely worth the $0.89. I would even pay $9.99 for this game as it is better than many of the RPG Maker games that is selling at this price. I own more than 50 RPG Maker games, and I know this genre very well. Good job, developer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got this game from one of the RPG Maker bundles. At first, it didn't look interesting, but when you play it and know what it is about, probably your opinion can change.Story: The curse thing about the story is VERY interesting. The story itself is interesting. The characters have their own personalities. You'll can see some notable influences the story has with japanese culture. It's not a bad thing, but for some people, it isn't interesting. 8/10Gameplay: Well, the overworld gameplay is pretty normal, like any ""normal"" RPG Maker game. But the battles are a little intense, you'll actually use items, skills, even on normal monsters. 7/10Graphics: Is this from the Japanese DLC pack, or something? Anyway, it's good! The sprites are fine, and the mapping is admirable! The developer did a good job with some basic resources. 8/10Sound: The soundtrack is okay. It gives the game some good ambience. 6.5/10Final Score: 8/10. For a RPG Maker game, this is better than expected. The game have nice dialogues, battles that you don't just keep pressing Z/Space/Enter, the maps are well made... The only complain is about the monsters. They are a little repetitive and harsh. It would be interesting something like ""Major Greed"" or ""So-So Sloth"", dunno, heh.Personal Opinion: (Thanks developer for not putting random battles in those big maps...) I still haven't finished it, but I'm willing to. The price is okay, but it's a little cheap for a game that it's actually good for RPG Maker. Give it a try. Too bad those games have the fame of being rushed to be done, or simply bad :/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I want to love it! I want to keep playing it! The story seems amazing...BUT WHY oh WHY are the fighting system like that?? It's Final Fantasy type of fights ( amazing, love it) but real time - ish...Wich basicly means that the first to use things wins. So basicaly, when you have 20 items, you have to scroll through them while the boss is still attacking... you cycle through skills while the mobs keep attacking...Im sorry, but it just ruins it for me. It's insane! Just let me think this through!!Where is the strategy?? Im Tired of just spamming space bar to be the first to strike with a basic attack...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Will start with the fact that I expected practicaly nothing from a game I buy for 0,22 EUR, well I was in for a really good surprise. The game practicaly pulled me in with a nice story line and entertinment thro out the game.PROS:1. Awesome story.2. Simplistic and easy to understand3. Has few simple puzzls in it4. Has food crafting system5. Treasure searching systemCONS:1. In a way I didnt like that it had in total 14 different enemys, which made the combat more or less boring at some point.2. No gear or such kind of stat boosting option, except food, that you would need get materials for, but it might be for the best, as it didnt make you think too much.3. Some of the treasures/secrets are made in such way, that if you miss it at the moment when you first come to the area, well you can say goodbye to the secret and the ""Q"" at few of the missions is realy nearly invisable.Summing it all up, I would actualy be ready to pay 2.99 at the least for the fun memorys I gained from this game and the nice vibe it gives. Considering the price I payed and the fun I gaained 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let me start this off by saying that I don't really review any games, since most of the games I get are already popular. However I gave this one a shot...At first, I clicked on the game because of the animu picture. Once I heard the cheasy background music for the intro I laughed for a little, but decided to watch through it. Let me tell you that it was worth it. The game was $.89 when I got it as it was on sale for 55% off.The game feels like a classic RPG, and definately brings you back to the olden days of RPG - the ambiance, battle system, storyline, characters, and even the text boxes are reminiscent of some sort of Final Fantasy/Pokemon crossover. I personally love this game right now, especially for the insanely cheap price.If you have a few quarters left over from buying whatever it is you are buying, I'd definately recommend this game.PROS--Pretty good storyline-Good characters and character development-Fun and interesting battle system - active and somewhat challenging to be honest-Not a lot of glitches from what I've seen-Very cheap game-Your brother is a demon-cat thing-Nostalgia inducing-Pretty funny gameCons--A bit short-If you are even remotely near a demon (enemy) they will find you and attack you, Liam Neeson style.

												Holy CRAP. I just finished this game and -man- did it give me an emotional rollercoaster. My heart broke multiple times during this game. Characters were built realitistically, and with strong backgrounds. Story is top-notch, to which I couldn't predict the plot twists (which normally is a piece of cake for me). Combat kept me on the edge of my seat! Short. but sweet and definitely worth the money for the game. 9.5/10 with the .5 off simply because of the fact that it's an RPG-maker game with low graphics. Big whup.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Interesting story and excellent soundtrack, but the combat mechanics are annoying.  It's like a JRPG except your turns are timed, so you end up playing ""race through menu choices"" in combat.  Maybe other people like it, but to me it just turns into button mashing until you get to the right menu and makes it a lot harder to strategize in combat.  If this one had traditional JRPG combat, it would be a definite recommendation from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 About Sins Of The Demon RPGFollow the journey of Kenshi, a wandering demon hunter, and his brother, a demon cat seeking a way to return to his true form. Can they find a way to end the curse and save Lanistra? The Story in Sins Of The Demon RPGYou know that game that makes you skip your bed because you want to continue playing to see what happens next? This game is one of those. The story itself is quite simple if you take the whole bunch, but seeing how the stuff were presented to the player makes it much more immersive and touching, I simply loved how the things developed and at the end I had me like ""Gosh, I want more of this"". The only things that bugs me is about some realism questions like that 10 yr. old boy fighting at your side, but still, I must use the ""fantasy creative freedom"" in order to nullify the value of these question of mine. The Level DesignI'm a bit too overcritical about this since mapmaking is my biggest skill in RPG Maker, but still, this game managed to deliver a well made ""network"" styled maps that gives a good immersion and that I had a lot of fun exploring, for those who don't know that it, is that when maps are strictly connected one to the others, a.k.a., no World Map for travelling and etcoetera (This is not an actual a precise definition but you all must have got the idea right now). What I didn't like a bit was that some times the map feels pretty empty, in the sense like, there could be more details in some parts, but that's okay (I tend to give too much detail to my maps sometimes).Also, the whole country feels pretty small, I think that the developers could've used some graphical resources to make things more countinous. The GameplayOkay, what pisses me off as a developer is to adjust the gameplay in order to keep the difficulty okay (not too easy but also not too hard), this game make things works well, except that sometimes you can power level with ease by leaving and entering on it again. My suggestion to this kind of ""respawn"" is to respawn only certain mobs on the map, let me say, one third of all the mobs? That sounds like pretty reasonable for me, anything to difficult the power level can be used to that, not to mention that there's a way to farm money by making pork buns, and with that, I got like the main character with an ATK of 220 (I could've done more, but I had little time then). Recapitulating, the gameplay fits pretty well the game's purpose, the only complaint are those mathematical and technical questions about leveling up and money making, that doesn't actually ""break"" the game.All in  All Sins Of The Demon RPG	 is a very nice RPG Game!8/10 From Me Sweep ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just finished this game, and without a doubt, this is the saddest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed game I have ever played, let alone the saddest role playing game. The story in this game is extremely well written, and the world, the characters, and just the whole setting are engrossing and will draw you in. But it's all sad. You have happy moments, but in the end it all ends up being sad. It is also full of several really neat twists to the plot, although a couple of them you can see coming from a bit far away. It doesn't diminish their quality however.The rest of the game supports the story well. It might be an RPG Maker title, but the maps are well done, and all characters sprites are a pleasure to look at. The one thing you may have a problem with is the repetiveness and backtracking, as the entire game takes place on one series of interconnected maps spawninng about six areas with maps in between to travel between them. So you will tread the same ground repeatedly.The battles in the game are enjoyable and fast paced as it is set permanently to an active time battle system. All your commands must be chosen quickly as the enemies will not wait for you. The game has no additional equipment to buy, only items, and also several recipes which you can use to cook healing and stat boosting items. Money is easy to find as you can find various items to sell and then you can either buy items or cooking supplies.Although the enemies do suffer from a bit of repetitiveness as well. The games story does revolve around the seven deadly sins, but you will mainly be seeing enemies based on sloth, greed, wrath, and pride during the game; enemies based on lust, gluttony, and envy, only show up in single areas as you progress, and outside of this you fight bandits. Boss battles, outside of the first one, are usually against one of the more powerful enemies you haven't fought yet, or a huge group of enemies you normally wouldn't encounter together.I got this as part of a $0.65 bundle of titles but you should buy it on its own if any of this sounds appealing to you. Just remember to keep some kleenex handy; you'll understand why.A heavy hearted, teary eyed, JRPG battling, recommendation [full of sadness :( ]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great story written game. It has you hooked by it's story of how a boy learns about his true past and has to find those answers. I'm giving this game a 9.5/10 due to some little issues I had to figure out.Issues and some tips if you get stuck. 1) When fighting Shiro and he spams rice rolls (500 Health) = Making it impossible to beat. Tip:: Use your demon form and the first attack that does 4 strikes to lower the 500+ health. (Make sure you farm for Pork Buns and spam them on Kenshi).2) When fighting Isarul, make sure to farm for Pork Buns and get Kenshi's attack Damage when he is attacking up to about 8-1K in dmg. * Do make sure Kenshi and the party are at 12 for their levels. Do the same as with Shiro and it's a simple game here on out. 3) There was a slight issue finding some of the treasure with the map images. Besides that I would recommend this game.

												I was pleasantly surprised by this game. I was expecting a bland, generic game with no standout points, but ended up enjoying the story a great deal. While many aspects of the game itself are nothing special (art direction, music, skills, combat system, etc.), the writing, in my opinion, was good enough to distinguish the game from its peers in the genre. Added to which, at the price (especially on sale), you get a decent amount of game for your money.If you don't go in expecting too much, you may well end up enjoying your stay. Recommended for anyone looking for a light-hearted game, or for anyone with a passing interest in JRPGs.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got the game on sale figuring ""I'm paying £0.20, even if it's terrible it'll be worth it for the steam cards,"" and I was pleasantly surprised.Pros:-Engaging story, with surprising depth.-Interesting and likeable characters.-Decent combat, reminiscent of old-style RPGs.-Good length. Despite not being the 12 hours of gameplay promised, my first run of the game took 10.5 hours, so it's still very good for the price.Cons:-The combat is easily broken if you find certain exploits.-If you're an achievement fanatic/completionist, it's very frustrating to be forced to replay the entire game for one or two missed collectables.Overall a very enjoyable experience. 8/10.
