												A disgustingly bad business model on an otherwise fantastic game..**UPDATE!!** I just wanted to say that I recently gave the game another go and apparently they've added a free rotation to what kinds of animals you can hunt, kind of like different FTP games like League of Legends have a free character rotation that cycles week to week on what you're allowed to use, or in this case hunt. THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! It certainly does not turn the game completely around, but it's a start. I'll give credit where credit is due, but the problems that were always there still remain. The problem with this free rotation is that.. if your basic free ammo or gun can't hunt that specie.. then it's pretty much useless to you. You still have to buy the correct gun and the correct ammo to be allowed to hunt it. I'm not going to change any of my review beyond this part here, as I believe it's important to maintain records like this. Some info may be slightly out of date, however. Just keep that in mind.OLD REVIEW:It's such a shame when you come across a fantastic game that's ruined by one of the worst payment models in any game you've ever seen. TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.Can you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.Want the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.Oh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete ""missions"" which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.Would I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.Also, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party ""offers"" infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you ""aren't the target consumer"". For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.If the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.			",67,3,0,2,8,0,3

												Hello everybody,I play this game since nearly the beginning, have seen the initial developer go bankrupt and the new developer take over. I have seen month with nothing happening in terms of developments and I have seen the last few month after multiplayer was released with new stuff released every few weeks.If you love hunting simulations, theHunter for sure is the game you want. It's way more realistic then Cabela's games, it has pretty nice graphics and huge different hunting locations with many, many animals to hunt. Every species feels special and there has not been a really good hunting simulation since Deer Hunter 2005.- Pricing - The downside: You need to invest a whole lot of money. To really enjoy the game you need a membership for about 5$ a month. No membership and you can only hunt very few species, need to buy ammo for all but the default rifle and can't create multiplayer games. Sure you can stick with some basic guns, but to take part in competitions and finish missions you need a whole lot of different guns. Each between 3 and 5$. Not to forget, there are tree stands, ground blinds and tents you would like to use sooner or later because there are very few fixed hunting towers on the maps and... yes, each of these items is another 4,50$ from your wallet.Just a few numbers for you:All weapons with scopes (not caluclation different skins or ""premium"" skins)more then 150$All callers (no decoys, no consumables like scents):about 20$Decoys for one full area for each species:about 30$Clothing depends on what you want, so I don't add a number to this, but each clothing set is about 5$... and you guess it: Some work better in different areas or against different species.Stands and tents... lets say two of each for each reserve, you place them permanently, you don't want to pick them up after each hunt, so you can't really use the same two everywhere.more then 200$Sure, you are free to choose if you want this items, but to get everything out of the game you want this stuff. And more, every few weeks there is a new weapon, new cool cloth and your membership runs out every now and then. - Earn ingame money -There are ways to earn ingame money: Win competitions, but without spending money you can only take part in very few competitions and so the chance is low (and the prize money gets you nowhere). The developers also have partnered with third-party pages who offer you some money for playing other online games, taking part in surveys or downloading and using different applications. The results are spam on your email address, malware and a lot of these offers simply don't reward you.There is a different ingame currency you earn completing missions, but you can only use this ""money"" on consumables and you need a good bunch of weapons to finish most missions, so again: No way without spending money. There is no way to grind the gear inside the game.Without spending money you stick with the .243 for the free Mule Deer and you can unlock the Single Shot Shotgun to hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but you need to buy the ammo for it. That works with earned money for some time, but sooner or later you will run out of missions to do without buying weapons or a membership for real money.- Bugs -The game is full of bugs. I personally can't say there are gamebreakers, but animals getting stuck in trees, climbing trees, nearly all weapons stuck into your arm and broken reloading animations and other smaller and bigger bugs are around since a long time and often they return after a few patches. Gamebreaking bugs get fixed pretty fast but smaller bugs are often not relevant enough (and the fixes can't be sold like new weapons or cloth) so we will for sure see this bugs for some more time.- Community -Just have to add it now, after multiple insults from fanboys. This game has a small die hard community that are happy to have this game, due it's the only one of it's kind. This makes them accept and defend every action the developers take. Since this review I often got friend requests from some of these guys that have nothing better to do then to tell me I'm a hypocrit to play this game a lot and not remommending it in my review. That's what you get from the community if you are not a 100% fan and don't think it's okay to pay a small fortune for this game.- Conclusion -As said, I'm into this game since years, I love it and I will keep playing it, but since about a year this game is all about money and everything ingame is pretty expensive. Like with this the pre-release review postet on Steam, my personal experience showed me, that the developers break promises and contracts, lie in some cases, solve things always to their best and only communicate public what makes them look good.- Tipp for beginners -If you enjoyed the small free part, go to {LINK REMOVED}bit.ly/1oEMUr0 or google for ""theHunter 2014 box"" and purchase a key from the boxed edition of the game. For about 17 € you get 6 month membership (hunt all species, get free ammo for all guns) some starter weapons that allow you to hunt all species ethically and some additional gear. It's the best deal you can currently get as a beginner. This box is also available at Amazon and some other retailers if you want the box itself.- Update after some actions taken -Today the developers release a new .22 handgun and to make the game more realistic, changed the existing and wide spread .357 handgun and made it unethical for some species. What might be realistic is clearly forcing players to buy the new gun for about 4$.Changing already sold virtual items might be common but this change make this weapon pretty useless. Why? Because a lot of players have it. It's not a good weapon against larger animals and was pretty often used against birds, now the only animals it's good for are fox and coyote.The new reserve released some time ago included the new ""feature"" of climbing walls... what simply is a bad mini game and asks you to buy a new consumable: Climbing gear. Some would argue that it's purchaseable with gm$ and you can take 75% back if you remove it, but it's again something that will eat up the earned gm$ from free players and make this game harder to play for free (besides, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic that has nothing to do with hunting).

												EDIT: People are actually defending this? Compare the amount of free content to the amount of content you have to pay for. It's unacceptable to make me pay money to access that much content in a free to play game.It costs nothing to download, but I feel entitled to a refund.First of all, there was no tutorial for this. I was just thrown in, and expected to know how to hunt. I wandered aimlessly for a while, until I found some tracks. I followed them, and found some more tracks and some scat. There was so much scat, that I began to wonder if this animal was sick. I followed the trail for about one in game hour unril I saw it: a whitetail deer. Living in an area with a lot of rednecks, I was excited. Apparently deer are something you should want to hunt. I readied my rifle, and clicked the fire button. Nothing. Was the left mouse button not the fire button? The right mouse button readied the gun, so I figured the left would fire. Then a message popped up: ""You don't have the required license to hunt whitetail deer"". What? I just spent almost forty real minutes tracking this thing down, only to not be allowed to shoot it. This is a video game! I shouldn't need to buy licenses to hunt animals! And, since this was my first time playing, wouldn't it be nice to give me some licenses for free, so I can get a feel for the game before investing money in it (it's free to play, so I shouldn't have to pay to play it)! I quit the game, went to the store, and looked up how much licenses cost, only to see something that really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. The licenses are temporary! Are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me!?If you don't buy the licenses, this is just ""Hiking Simulator"". I live in an area full of hiking trails. I can literally drive five minutes, and find a hiking trail. I do not have a gun, hunting equipment, or hunting licenses. I played this so I could hunt. After playing this, I might as well just get all of those things, because it would be something I could make memories out of, actually go outside, and do with my friends.Valve, I am begging you, set standards for what can and cannot be free to play. I am asking that either this game be removed from Steam, or you make the developers add free content. I am not going to pay to play a game that is listed as ""free to play"". I will pay for extras, but only if the game is good.EDIT: Okay, so apparently I didn't notice that there is a tutorial. You people can stop commenting on it.Some people are saying ""well, it's a simulator"". Simulators don't have to be one hundred percent realistic. The buying lisences part did not have to be in it, and made the ""realism"" (it's just a excuse to have microtransactions) too much.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												How dare anyone call this product Free To Play [F2P]? The free content in the game is limited to one kind of animal, one map and default equipment. It is worse than a demo, or even a trial. Everything in this game is available after paying, constantly paying. Forget about ""I paid once, I will have it all forever"". Pay and play, pay and play.I wrote this review nearly a year ago. I just got in to the game, to see if anything changed, but nope. Hermetic and toxic community of theHunter, still does not know what Free To Play is, and call this neither demo, nor trial a Free To Play game, blaming everyone but the developers, for the reviews, and everything else. I do not recommend./Update.With 27.01.2016 update whitetail deer and pheasants are now free to hunt, while mule deer that was available, is no longer free. They gave us a whitetail deer, but took a mule deer, so just ignore that part. Pheasants are new, and on top of that 12 ga single shot shotgun, with replenishable ammo. Still far from calling this game FREE TO PLAY, but that is a step in the right direction./Update 2.You can earn em$, but beware, most of these offers are a SCAM, they either ask you to provide cell phone number, then ask you send a text message, and type in the number you received. It costs $, you do not earn anything, you pay for it. Sometimes you will albo be asked to put in all your details, as well as, credit card details. Do not ever do it.			",107,14,12,9,8,2,19

												To get any weapons and to be with any chance of actually finding something that can be killed you must pay a small subscription fee of £15.99 a year. After hours of searching I finally found a rabbit.  I tried to shoot it in the head only to be told that I am not permitted to kill it. I moved on and found a small bird. I tried to shoot it.

												Please read this if you are thinking about it!This game has potential But there's a Catch! (there is always a catch) Its Free to play, YesYou cannot shoot animals that are RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU if you dont have a License to kill them.EM$ = You use real money forGM$ =  you earn with missions etcI have played 74.4 Hours and in that time I have earned ""1721 GM$"" sounds like a Lot, What can I get for 1721 GM$?1799 GM$ gets me 1 day of Turkey License!!!!!!!!!!!!!!7 days = 3799 GM$28 days cost 7599$If you use real money1 day = 45 EM$7 days =95EM$28 days = 190 EM$£3.99 gets to 500 EM$ which is such a stronger currency by a stupid amount, So stupid that when my 3months expired and I checked out the prices, It wont even let me host a game because My subs ran out, But ive spent around £100 on items on this game,The items you PAY real money for ALSO have a durability, So that Premium item you bought gets deleted when you use it enough times, Oh right ok, Its a good game, But its a game they want you to get your money out so you can unlock the dam game thats ""FREEE TO PLAY"" other wise its just a Forest walk simulator, p.s Doc ALways messages you if you dont collect an animal that ran 342434 miles away to die.So over £100 spent on in game items and now I need to pay to unlock them again. ONLY HOST CAN USE ITEMS! So i cant use my ducks and canadian goose set up with my mates now unless I pay, Wrong wrong wrongDont regret wasting your money on this game like I have guys, Let me set an example for you.Thanks if you made it this far!

												It may be free to play but you have to pay for a subsciption (example: xbox live) to be permitted to hunt certain wildlife, tags for said wildlife can purchased with in game money and real money but it's expensive(small amount of tags for 12$-20$) and certain wildlife can only be killed by permitted weapons (example: rabbits may only be killed by a .22, shotgun, or bow) . Weapons and equipment can bought as well but the points to buy the items can only be bought with money in real life making it more difficult for the player to enjoy the game, if there was starter items such as tags for animals or in game money i would recomend it to friends. 4/10: score will change if listed above have been altered or more store options have been added			",57,2,0,1,2,0,2

												You can only shoot 1 of the 18 animals for free. Solution: pay for hunter licenses.You can only shoot deer, fox and coyote with the free gun. Solution: pay for more guns.You want to play with friends in multiplayer. Solution: pay a sub so that your computer and your internet can be used to setup a server.You don't get the carry capacity to do even semi-long hunts. Solution: pay for extra carry capacity.You payed for extra carry capacity but you still don't have the carry capacity to do awesome long hunts whole day long. Solution: NONE!!!You can travel free on maps from lodges but on all maps this is very time consuming with how they were layed out by the developers. Solution: pay for tents and camping equipment.You don't get free ammo for 32 of 33 weapons in the game. Solution: keep paying money for new ammo (hardcore simulator?) or buy a membership.You don't like your clothes or the fact animals can see you from miles away because there is no telling which bush actually gives you cover or not. Solution: Pay for clothing items.You're tired of stalking animals for hours before you get a shot at them. Solution: Pay for callers, decoys, ground stands, tree stands, tripods, scent lures, feeders, bait.I'm surprised the developers don't ask money for every footstep you take into the game.If you buy the $15 starter pack, you will be missing tons of guns and all other equipment that are simply needed to enjoy the game. But even if you spend $50 on the biggest starter pack, you still miss many equipment to hunt half the animals in the game and the weapon selection in the biggest package is rather sad (I wouldn't dare to say it was done deliberately to lure you into buying the more fun/better weapons later seperately wasting all the money you gave in the first place on guns that will be gathering dust).This is the best executed hunter game ever if money grows on your back. We're talking at least €200 here to start enjoying most of the full game. If you really want to hunt in luxury (it's a game, who wouldn't want to?) you'll start looking at a lot more money than that.The game is easily 8/10. The amount of money you have to throw at the game to actually get to that 8/10 makes it a 1/10 at best.My library hopefully shows I'm not one to be afraid to spend money on games. But these guys brought it to a level that I have never seen before. Congratulations on surpassing Korean MMO's EW.Addendum: subscriptionAnd what are people paying subscription for?Retextured or new weapons? Because you have to pay to get those.New animals? Because you have to buy licenses to hunt those.New equipment for the new animals? Nope not that either because you have to pay for all the new callers and feeders and stands.Multiplayer? Well they did add MP afterwards but it can't be it since an MP game is hosted on our computer with our internet connection. And they didn't spend any effort on making a standalone server or adding any useful filters in the client browser to warrent anything special. That is if you are lucky enough the client browser is working without big lag and there are none of the many connection and disconnection issues.New clothing? Again these cost money.New maps? Well it must be maps then since there isn't anything else. So we're paying €35/year for the 4maps? they added in the last 5years. Those are some damn expensive maps!We're not paying for continued development of the engine either.- View distance of 210m for weapons that can make accurate shots of 500m.- Trees that are literally square with highest ingame settings and the leafs are just flat green 'sheets'.- Game settings can only be adjusted outside of the game.- A fox and pheasant can just walk next to eachother because it's a fairytale land where all animals are big friends.- Mouse often feels laggy/jaggy however you want to call it. Many people have these small FPS drop problems and support just ignores it all.- The surface has the most annoying edges which makes it very awkward to crawl up to an animal and finding an angle where your gun gets enough depression.- Floating rocks, plants and trees everywhere you look on the map.I can go on further with a list of technical stupidities that were allready old tech 5years ago.

												I really had some good few hours. This was the first time I played a hunting game and I really expected nothing from it.But I was surprised how how good the game was from its technical view. It's not the best looking game but the flora and fauna really got some love and detail, the sound is awesome and the lighting and sun effects are also really nice.Really felt like being in the woods.Now here's the negative trait. This game's free2play model is nowhere near anything you might consider as free to play and fair. Everything costs a lot of money and either you join the membership or you have a walking simulator (you're only allowed to hunt rabbits and mule deers).It's more like a demo when you don't plan to invest money. The game even calls you a guest.  And oh boy, the pricing is insane. Probably a good hunting game, but I can't recommend it. It's a shame cause it was really an atmospheric experience for me.That said I think if you are a really passionate hunter in real life you would probably gladly spend money on this one and you would probably go nuts about all people who complain abouth the subscription model.

												This game is perfect for the adventurous gamer who enjoys spending real money on memberships, buying virtual items and buying the privilege of clicking on things that look different from other things. It comes with a decent selection of weapons - all you have to do is buy some ingame cash with your actual cash. Is a bear threatening your backside? No problem - just buy the bear hunting licence for a few dollars and he'll be toast. Wanna play with friends? That's great - slap some more dollars their way and you're good. As a free-to-play character you get one rifle and you get to hunt a whole two animal types.The visuals are fantastic for the year 2004 - I especially enjoyed having the animal I was watching at one point twist its head around and give me the bedroom eyes from behind before it vanished into the ether. Then my buddy sank into the river, where his eyes separated from the rest of his head.The F2P experience is, in short, a complete waste of time.			",79,2,0,6,5,1,12

												First of all - This title is fake!!! Is not Free to Play.If you are looking for a free to play hunting title i have to start this review with some bad news: this game is not free to play by most interpretations of the term ""Free to play"". As a limited member you can do the following:You can enter all the reserves and wander around.You receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller.You can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers. Hunting all other animals is prohibited!!. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.To shoot them you need to buy a license with real moneyUnlike other free to play games you can make points to unlock new content like weapons and other stuff. You are stuck with what you have and that is it.			",39,4,1,6,5,0,10

												This game looks like it has potential and is fun. However the 'Free-To-Play' label is misleading. After downloading the 2GB game I looked forward to shoot some helpless animals but, as soon-as I loading in the open world I had no idea what to do or get started. No controls or help menu was available in-game, so I had to resort to an online video on the internet.After getting used to the main controls I ventured out to hunt… I found a trail of a Blacktail deer and ID’d it with my gadget. A pop-up appeared saying I need a licence or a membership to hunt this animal. I then looked up to see what I could kill. Apparently there are only 2 animals you can hunt and 1 weapon you can use in this F2P game.I now know this Free-to-play is actuallya Fee To Play and Pay-To-Win game, with micro transactions, donations and memberships everywhere. Sorry, but I looked forward to play this game and not Pay-To-Win… It has really good graphics quality though.Rating: 2/10			",211,65,4,12,28,3,26

												Holy money hungry game.  Everything except deer (a certain type of deer) is locked behind pay walls.  I'm not talking about low pay walls, I'm talking about high pay walls.I just about bought the 3 month membership for all licenses because I thought.. Why not, looks like it could be fun.  But then I went to the store to check out the guns and stuff I could buy.  Well EVERY SINGLE GUN costs EM which is bought with REAL dollars.  There is no way at all for you to buy these guns unless you open your wallet.  Basic guns cost 5 dollars each and better ones well over 10.I don't mind the freemium models and actually spend a lot of cash on them lol.  But I have NEVER seen a game that is so blatently money grabbing as this one.  It is absolutely astounding how much  money they want you to pay to have access to the full game.  You could spend 100's on 100's of dollars and still not have unlocked all the content (and its not because there is a ton of content..).  Plus no matter how much you play you will not be able to unlock it without using a ton of REAL money.This game should be removed from Free to play because all it does is give you a VERY limited demo (I didn't have a license to shoot the anmal I found in the starter area) and then want money to do anything.Dev's like these should be BANNED from steam.

												If you've actually come to read these reviews before just downloading the game because its free, good on you. Dont be fooled, this game says ""free to play"" but is actually one of the most expensive games that exists. You have to pay to shoot animals, and if you dont pay, you can shoot like 2. You also have to pay for all the guns, all the maps, all the clothes, all the items, and everything else. The only things available to purchase with the free play ingame currency, are licenses to hunt other animals, but you need ALOT of money. One mission, say, tracking a deer, takes at least 15 mins, and at most (usually) 2-4 hours. This 2-4 hour mission, tediously tracking down a deer, making SURE that you never, ever lose it, and that you get all the tracking markers, will get you around 100-150 gm$. The first license available to purchase, is SEVEN THOUSAND. Thats 140-210 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ HOURS, to be able to kill ONE MORE ANIMAL, that you will most likely, NEVER SEE, and if you do have the grace and patience to track this animal for another 2-3 hours, killing it would be hard, and JUST LIKE KILLING EVERY OTHER ANIMAL. One last thing, you have a weight limit on what you can carry out of camp, and there are tons of different ammo types. If you bring ammo meant for a deer (that wasnt labeled as ""Deer Bullets) and shoot ANYTHING else, it just does not count, at all. So you better be prepared to not find an animal, and not shoot it with the guns, license, and ammo that you dont have, all during time that would be better spent buying a real gun and shooting yourself in the testicles, all so that another human being never has the horrid chance to experience the ""free"" travesty that is, ""The Hunter"".   11/10. Masterpiece.Also, credit for this review goes to my good freind, Wolf_Hunt, please, add him on steam. ;)			",87,2,0,4,6,0,1

												The steam page may boast the idea that  theHunter  is a  free  game. However this is more or less a downright lie. TheHunter is a game that is designed to make the free to play version of theHunter be extremely linear and boring but show enough promise into what the game  could be  if you payed for the membership. These micro transactions are thrown upon you at almost every second of this game. Want to play with a friend? Nope you have to pay! Want to use a bunch of cool weapons? Nope you have to pay! Can I at least hunt and kill alot of animail's? Nope! Without membership you can only kill and select amount of animals. Even if the shady transactions and free to play model were not present it doesnt get rid of the fact that theHunter never stops being a boring and extremely glitchy game. Actully shooting an animal is near impossible due to the very laggy movement. I found myself having a hell of a lot more fun using the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brick breaker app on the hunters phone in game than actully hunting, which is never a good sign. Hunting games can be fun and interesting but theHunter with lack of a better work screwed everything up and created a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥which is a disgrace to good games trying to get on steam these days.-AUS ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			",97,26,1,8,6,1,14

												this hunting simulation is very good, provided that you are capable to immerse in the sneaked slow pace of the prowling tasksit is perfect with 3D visionI have played an enjoying one-year/50€  ""tour of duty"" (about 170 hours) when the game wasn't yet on Steam, yet I discover that the pricing policy is the same: there is to periodically pay for almost everything, just like it were a real hunt (I don't know you, but I cannot roast and eat digital boars)will the publisher ever sort something out from all these negative feedbacks and transform this ""tax"" in a normal basegame+DLCs?

												I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :DPastry2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired.			",114,19,8,7,20,3,11

												BIG THUMBS DOWN.. I really like this game but well ya know since 2009 the game has been crashing and the fact that nobody can really host a server without it crashing and having to respend more EMS for more items that go away each time the server crashes.   Instead of fixing the game it seems like the development is finished.  THe only thing the devs are working on now it seems to be adding more micro transaction items that are not even part of the average hunters game/experience.  FYI Em$ 9362.00   That's my toal EMS Spent  Gm$ 3836.00 and that is my total GMS.. EMS is real money and GMS is in game earned currency.  Can you see the difference ?  I have almost $100 worth of real money transaction items and in 80+ hours of playing the game (check profile) I still have not made enough GMS (in game currencey) to even buy a gun. ALl you hear is people complaining about not being able to get anything without buying it.  THis is PAY TO WIN AND PAY TO PLAY there is nothing free about thehunter.  The Game Suport Is Non Existent as well..			",25,4,0,8,5,0,2

												Hello,This game could have gone somwhere, but seeing as the devs just want you to pay every few months or so to hunt all the animals I don't think it is going anywhere. If you just jump in you only get to hunt 2 animals, from what I have seen there is no tutorial to help new players out. Animals very rarely spawn in the time I have played 2 animals spawned and I coulnd't hunt eitehr of them because I'm not going to pay like $10 for 3 months to hunt animals.... The map is very bad it doesnt even tell you what the places are, most of the time I played it I was trying to figure out what the ""!"" sign on the map was :/ I do not recomend this game to ANYONE even if you love hunting games it would cost less just to buy like a $20 hunting game and hunt ALL animals instead of paying $10 for 3 months of hunting all the animals. If you want to even have a little fun in this game you HAVE to pay...I would probably give it a 2/10 and thats because I'm feeling nice today....			",110,12,1,16,9,0,4

												Hi everyone! Emotions overfilled me so i decided to share my thoughts about this game//Firstly it seems to be pretty nice game. I watched trailers and saw a man hunting with a bow!!! Its actually my dream ! So..I launched the game and some kind of menu in browser style opens.. WTF? I was scared :p But then i got used to it its actually pretty convinient thing. Then i pressed *HUNT* and spawned in some kind of camp. Graphics in this game are nice. The movement is awful because when i pressed *c* button to sprint it was a ♥♥♥♥ing walking speed  -_- But its okay too. Then i saw my first animal! It was a deer i guess..) I wanted to shoot it but didn`t want to miss so tried to get closer and spooked it away. I was a bit sad about this but i had even more enthusiasm.. Right after that i saw a rabbit and shoot it. IT WAS AWESOME!!! But i didn`t know what to do with the body. Like how to kinda claim it.. And so i went on.I found deer traces and tracked it down my GPS. After 30 minutes of walking ( actually it was nice cause the world detalised beautifully) i found My dear deer drinking water from the river. That time i was really carefull and started crouching from 2 km long)) And i crouched for my ♥♥♥♥in entire life but it was nothing because i enjoyed it. BUUUUT when I finally got to the      *sniper point*  and aimed at deer head IT SHOWED THAT I CAN`T ♥♥♥♥IN HUNT CAUSE I DONT HAVE THE ♥♥♥♥IN LICENSE!!! I LOOKED WHERE CAN I GET LICENSE AND SAW THAT IT WAS ♥♥♥♥IN 100000$$$$ This how my story ends. ♥♥♥♥ this game. It`s better be paid then be free but BASED ON THE ♥♥♥♥IN DONATE!!So decide. All things considered this game is really nice in gameplay way but ♥♥♥♥ the system of donation in this game. You can play this game with satisfaction only if you`ll buy this crappy license. I SAY NO!HOPE I HELPED YOU GUYS :PSorry for a mistake!!! There actually is few hunting available animals like deer and maybe others i dunno... But anyway. I don`t like this certificate paid system.

												Thats f*cking it! I'm going to write a review.. This is my first review and probably my last because if I write a review, trust me I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off as hell! And hell, am I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥of now!As you can see I played 700+ hours in this game and long story short, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. Believe me the game is worth paying money for, it’s WORTH IT’S MONTHLY prescription and please if you are here to play the game for free just turn around the way you came, this is not for you. It is only free to play as a DEMO, you get extremely limited options and playability. If you want to put money in this game it is definitely worth it IF NOT FOR;1)	The lack of multiplayer compatibility; (300 servers and only 5 you can connect to due to “could not connect to host”, “host has quit the game”(server still in server list 30 mins after the host quit the game already),  “lost connection to host”, server of my buddy up and running (TeamSpeak confirmed) and not in server list for about 45 mins, “error 16005” “I GOT IT”, “error 404 developer’s f*cks not found”2)	Abundant bugs (which NEVER EVER GET FIXED) and I’m not talking about the bugs previously discussed as connection bugs, I’m talking about bugs of getting stuck in scenery, floating ducks that stay stuck in the air (due to connection error again though), animals stuck behind trees and rocks, animals that have died on player side but not harvestable because of server misalignment,…,.., and the list keeps going and going3)	The developers don’t give a f*ck *(this is the most important part for my experience); They keep hiring new people with great new ideas about a new species like the “polar bear” (which you’re not allowed to f*cking shoot!, PUT YOUR DEVELOPING TIME IN SOMETHING USEFULL YOU IDIOT DEVELOPERS), persistent problems with connections which have been an issue and have been addressed numerous times by the community but have been left aside because getting new weapons and new animals is more profitable, priority is giving above all to getting a new skin on a new weapon which costs you another 5$ because the colour has changed on the weapon or because the colour of the animals has changed.4)	The game is not even near a complete stage, with its developers building on a broken game and making it more unplayable than it already is. They keep adding sh*t without fixing previous errors and by doing so they make the implementation of anything REALY worth it get drowned by the everlasting errors and bugs that follow it. The implementation of something good is followed by weeks, if not months, of issues resolving from this add-on and by getting the public back to the game the implement something new, which starts the hole sh*t train from the beginning.If you have not already turned around and decided not to look at this game, I tell you again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR PUT MONEY IN TO IT IN IT’S CURRENT STATE. I don’t think this current state is going to change to anything good in the foreseeable future as the developers just don’t give a f*ck or are trying but are so inexperienced that my 6yo niece can make a better running game. This game has potential but it should have been a Steam GreenLight game and not a finished one and the enormous ego that makes the developers not think about gameplay but all about money made me vote this game as DO NOT RECOMMEND. I hope to god that the developers are reading my review and start working on the issues that need to be fixed to make this game worth it. If they are not, be wary of my next review, as I will be even more♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off as I keep playing this game in the hope it becomes something it should be.(PS: this review was 16 pages long but I removed a lot of the swearing, reducing it to 2. If you read this all please rate funny or helpful in the hope it reaches the developers of Expensive Worlds) ",37,2,0,3,12,0,0

												I downloaded this game because it peaked my interest from the videos and because it was ""free"". I have never really been interested in hunting, but  I was pleasantly surprised with how fun and relaxing it was for the first few hours. After I finally hunted down my first deer and killed it, I was really excited to go back to the store and see would I could purchase with the money I recieved from my hunt. It was then that I realized this is absolutely not a ""free to play"" game. I understand that the developer has to make money, and I have no problem with them making the free to play members work hard for what they get, but it is literally impossible for free to play players to progress. The only thing you can really afford without paying is ammo, and it still takes a while to get the money for it. You don't even get money for harvesting your prey. You have to complete missions (which by the way, most require items that you have to buy in order to complete) to get the in game currency and the prices for the items that you are allowed to purchase with in game currency are astronomical. All of the weapons have to be purchased with real money. All outfits must be purchased with real money. The licenses' are available through in game currency, but it will take you a year of playing to get a 7 day license for one animal. The worst part is that the items in this game aren't even cheap. Almost everything is $3.00 and up, and that money will add up considering you have to buy basically each individual item (with the exception of some bundle packs).Most free to play games offer premium and free to play. Usually, premium makes it a little easier to progress and adds more content to premium members. Not in this game. ""Free to play"" in this game is literally just a demo. You have to pay to play if you want to do anything other than hunt mule deer, keep the same weapon, stay on the same hunting ground, make your own game, and constantly get kicked from games after doing nothing wrong. So basically.. you have to pay if you want to do anything fun, and that's why I got this game to start. I would not recommend getting this game unless you plan on spending loads of money.I also want to add a note to the developers. People will still spend money on this game if you make it more friendly towards free to play players. You are severely limiting the crowd of people playing your game by making it ""pay to play"". I know a bunch of people that have never had the slightest interest in hunting that would love to play this game. If you open up the game more, more people will come, and more people will be willing to support you and pay money. However, as of right now, I would not support this game because you have mislead me and many others that downloaded this game believing it was ""free to play"".My review will change if the developers ever decide to remove the extreme restraints that they have placed on the players. If nothing changes, they need to list this as ""demo"" and put a price tag on the actual game, because the store page is very misleading.			",10,0,0,1,1,0,0

												Combine this game with your TrackIR: It's like I'm really outside!But seriously speaking, I used to play this game a bit before it was on Steam. If you actually pay for your subscription and buy some guns and ammo, it's a very fun, comfy hunting game. If not, then you're♥♥♥♥♥♥outta luck. Don't believe the 'free to play' advertisement, this is subscription based game through and through.I'm still gonna recommend the core game itself since it's enjoyable if you jump through the hoops.

												I want to love this game. Which I do enjoy it alot, but what it comes down to is what everyone else says, PAYWALLS. When you start you get 3 days of unlimited tags for any animal which sounds great right? The catch is that you only get two guns, sure the 12 Gauge is permitted to use on A LOT more animals than the .243 they give you as well but once the three days is up don't expect to be able to enjoy the game until you spend $3.99 on some game time. But wait there's more! You still only have the two guns, one blind, one bottle of decent scent remover, and one call that only works for deer. So in other words expect to spend a ton of money on this game if you really want to play it. It's not my kind of game for that exact reason. Other than the paywalls this game is amazing. If they were to remove the paywalls and make you pay $30 for the game I'd be all in for sure but there's no way I'm playing any more of this. Hopefully the new one will not have paywalls but I'm not holding my breath.			",50,6,2,8,20,0,15

												TL;DR Great game, horrible pay to play system.This game would be great, if you just had to pay, say, $20 a month and have access to all content, but this is not the case.First, you pay about $3 a month to be able have infinite liscenses and shoot everything. But you can't shoot everything because the starting rifle only has specific species it can shoot. In order to get more powerful guns, you must pay real life cash. The conversion rate is rougly $1 to 100 ingame currency, but many weapons cost more than 500.This means you must pay $5 for an ingame gun along with the $3 a month to shoot a virtual deer that will most likely see/smell you if you don't pay for ingame camo which is even more expensive than the gun.*Edit April 11th, 2016, I accidently a word			",266,28,4,22,22,1,19

												I noticed theHunter was free to play so thought I'd give it a go. This is how my experience went:I load up the game and jump straight into the hunt! I familiarise myself with the controls and get ready to begin.I hike through miles of woodland, meticulously scanning the area for my prey. These are my woods. I am the apex                     predator. A god among mindless furry beasts. After what seems like hours, I see it. My prey. A 33.4kg female Mule deer. It hasn't seen me yet. My primal hunter instincts activate and I stealthily approach.I zero in on the deer. My deer. My trophy. It is in my crosshairs, I hold my breath, ready to fire, I was born for this. Everything I had accomplished in life leading me here, to this very moment...Balls! It suddenly spooks, and trys to run. I panic and let out a squeal, firing blindly. I see blood spraying everywhere. I had hit it, but the poor thing just keeps on running, trailing blood the whole way.Still panicking, I chase after the deer, following the trail of its blood. After 10 mins I find it...The deer, my deer, has collapsed from exhaustion in an alarmlingly large pool of it's own blood.It's in so much pain.It looks up at me.It knows.""Please, kill me."" It tells me with its eyes.Those eyes.I start to cry.I can't do it.I walk away.I uninstall the game.I still have nightmares about the deer.I start drinking heavily and consuming opiates to cope with the pain.It helps me forget.Life will never be the same.10/10 would suffer from PTSD and ruin life again.

You have to pay to actually get to the good stuff and worse of all, buy a membership and don't get items...Oh and also, this ""adults"" that are protecting this game with things like ""It's a game for adults to get away from stupid kids like you!"", they are just protecting a game that they can't get their money back.But, I got to admit, it looks to be a good simulator, but with all those cons, I wouldnt even bother downloading it....

												There are so many negative comments on this game because 'expensive worlds' want you to pay a lot of REAL money for weapons and equipment to play smoothly and comfortably. This is most annoing problem with 'expensive worlds' game. It is far too expensive compared to even better stand alone titles. You quickly find yourself spending over hundred dollars per year, while you can buy good new title for 30$ !!! check prices of equipment for only OnE GOOSE !!! - you can buy separate game for that money!! paying for ammunition for weapon you bought without membership??? are you kiddin??? they are just greedy thats why there is so many negative comments. like mine;) I'm not so stupid to pay them anymore, They won't see any of my money till they won't change their policy and prices. I prefer to invest in Far Cry Primal for example. Much better investment of Your time ad money. TheHunter community? mostly bunch of paid funboys, sorry to say that.

												YES....and.....NO!After playing this game for an unhealthy amount of time both on Steam and before it was released on that platform, it is probably time for a little review of this game that I love to hate and hate that I love. First and foremost: calling this game a ""Free-to-Play"" is like calling Donald Trump ""Mr. President"". They are both technically true but just seems like stretching reality a bit too much. Though it has to be stated that it has become more ""Free-to-Play"" than it used to be. Once there was a time where you could hunt one animal at one map/reserve with one weapon and be left with overwhelmingly many messages about all you are not allowed to do, what you can't shoot and where you can't go. At the time of this review you now have a couple of animals you can hunt for free with a couple of guns and even a couple more animals on rotation every week. Still you will not have a great experience with this game if you have no interest in putting any money into it. And that is what it boils down to....For hunter enthusiasts and others that are looking for a mostly realistic hunting simulator with a lot of variation, weapons to use, scenery to explore, competitions to enter and have a lot of free time on your hand, this would probably be the best thing you can find out there today. It becomes even better if you put in some extra money to buy additional equipment to make your hunting experience even richer. But you need to know in advance that it will cost you. There's a yearly subscription (can also get 3 months and 6 months) and tons of  weapons and equipment you can (and probably need to) buy. It uses an in-game currency, which you can get by winning competitions (for most animals every day in 3 levels of experience). Seems like a lot of chances to win right? Not so much. It is not often you get that winning animal, and it is not much you win for each competition, so it will take a long time to save up for useful equipment. If you really get into this game, expect to open that wallet to get stuff faster.That being said, I rarely feel ripped off with what I have put into this game. Sure, I feel that for what you get of updates and new things in the game you don't really get enough for that yearly subscription. Any new added weapons and equipment is not included in this subscription and has to be paid for seperately.  Expect to get one new reserve and a handful of new animals to hunt, plus up to three hunting towers included for free a year. It has to be said that of the vast amount of equipment and weapons are optional and very few affect your chances of placing higher in the competitions, but rather make it more convenient when hunting. I.E. buying and placing tents gives you more places on the map to spawn, other items makes it easier to get in closer to the animals, like blinds and tree stands, while you can also buy camping equipment (consumable) to fast travel between spawn points. Next to the joy of just hunting pixelated animals that behaves relatively realistically and animates well and joining competitions there is a rather large set of missions to complete based on specific animals, specific maps or specific weapons. Unfortunately to complete all these you will have to buy a lot of the weapons and equipment as they are simply needed in certain levels of the missions (Like ""shoot two Cotttontail Rabbits with a longbow from a tree stand""). Completing missions earns you a secondary currency which can be used to buy certain items (mostly consumable ones).There is also ethics to consider. You can't just run around shooting any animal you see with whatever weapon you have at hand. Specific animals have to be shot with a proper weapon and with proper ammo. You can't shoot a rabbit with a shotgun with slugs or shoot a grizzly with a .223 bolt action. Each weapon lists what animals it can be used for and you don't really need many to cover them all. If you buy one of the Starter Bundle Subscriptions you get a selection of weapons and equipment.There are also achievements to be earned in the game. They are not of the most creative part and mostly contain harvesting  a set amount of a specific animal and harvesting a set amount of animals using a specific weapon next to walking distance and time spent in the game. The points you build up here is basically your hunterscore that is used to progress you through levels from beginner to intermediate and further to elite. The higher the level, the bigger prizes in competitions too. Other than that it doesn't do much but placing you somewhere on a leaderboard.The graphics in the game is quite nice, though a little bit dated. The graphic engine used is the same that was used in Just Cause 2 I believe, with a few modifications. The reserves are rather huge and it will take you hours to walk from one side to another. There are 36 animals (soon 37) to hunt on 11 reserves as of november 2016. The reserves offer variations in terrain, animals, geography and seasons. Something for everyone in other words. The sounds of the animals and the weapons are also mostly well made with the occational time when you can clearly tell that it is a recording and a bit too loud when it rains. Speaking of weather. That is probably one of the things that is not technically good in this game. You wander around and you see sun and blue sky in every direction and then suddenly it starts to pour down like there's no tomorrow a second after. The weather effects in this game needs a big overhaul.Then there is of course a handful or two of small glitches and bugs that never seems to get fixed. Rarely gamebreaking but can be irritating non the less. Even more irritating when it seems the developer is too busy creating new things they can sell with ""micro""transactions to do anything to fix what is broken. One has to take into account that it is a niche game and a small develop team basically working 9 to 5, so one can't expect too much. With the resources they have they have certainly made quite a game over the years and it is ever evolving, so there's that atleast.It is worth mentioning that the game has to have an online connection too, or you won't be able to play. If the server goes down so does your game. An unfortunate but nescessary evil in the game model they are running. Luckily it doesn't happen too often, but if it happens friday night you might likely have to wait to monday before they fix it, as it seems the devs have a monday to friday work schedule. Well, to end this rambling and finish this review:If you like a realistic simulator where you sneak, stalk and search for that one big animal to win you a competition and if you aren't worried about paying for your entertainment then you should definitely check out this game. It can be highly addictive, but relaxing. Slow, but thrilling. It is a game you might find yourself coming back to over and over again.However, if you are looking for free entertainment and a actionful game with a lot of running around then this is definitely not for you. You can walk around here for an hour without catching a glimpse of a single animal. Running scares the animals away as they can here you from a long  distance. It does not get much slower paced than this.You need patience in this game.If there was a neutral grading of this game I would probably neither rate it up or down, but seeing that I have had countless of entertaining hours in this game I feel I have to recommend it, even though it is definitely not for everyone and I would never ever EVER call it ""Free-to-Play"".Side note: You do not need to be a hunter in real life to enjoy this game. I have never in my life hunted or killed a single animal and probably never will. Pixelated animals however needs to watch out ;o)For what the game is, not looking at what it claims to be, I'd rate this game a 7/10Happy Gaming!			",703,637,38,102,124,8,148

												Most of these reviews are compltely inaccurate, mostly in the form of sarcasm. Facts:Alphafact: I have killed everything in the game without paying a single penny. (read below) 1. This is a free to play game. It costs absolutely nothing to play this game. 2. You are given a .243 riffle, and a single shot 12 guage shotgun, both with unlimited ammo. 3. You can go into any map of the game. An immersive and realistic environment that sits on my top 3 most realistic of all time, in any game i have ever played. 2x Geforce GTX 970. At full detail levels. On the other hand player avatars can use a realism update, but the animals definately do not, and as this is a human vs animal game that is what counts.4. You can hunt Whitetail deer, pheasant, and 3 varieties of rabbit. (to start; fact is it cost nothing to hunt the other animals)5. The ballistics and damage models are by far the most accurate in any hunting game to date. Source: My opinion; I have hunted just about everything legal on the north american continent in the last 35 years, Including 6 Alaska hunts. and i have played Cabela's [titles here] hunting games as well.5. You can take part in in-game missions (quests) that reward you with in game currency (gms) To purchase perishable supplies like scents and baits, as well as licenses and ammo. (pssst this is the how-to)Biggest problem with the game is:1. Most people dont know what the hell they are doing they are running around like they are playing Battlefield 3 or Gears of war....this is the playstyle that they are failing at with this game. While you don't have to be a ninja to aquire a target in this game, you will need some patience and a little stealth to get anything in the trophy range (hello...real animals spook as do these, if they hear or smell you, you probably wont see them)  2. You arent getting any full auto weapon in this game. Every shot (except those made at the range) are tallied to your permanent record. The only semi-autos in game are a few select shotguns.3. No grenades, sachel charges, land mines or tow missles, sorry.4. People think programers work for free. They don't and this game wouldn't exist if players didn't take ""shortcuts"" and buy weaposn, gear and licenses and instead used the gm method of hunting to get the very same things.Bottom line: This game is free to play and you can hunt everything in the game without ever spending a dime of real currency. If you cannot do that, you are doing something entirely wrong and likely not in the scope of the game i.e. hunting and harvesting game. If anyone really needs any more clarification on the how to hunt all animals in this game as a guest, send me a message and i'll try and simplify it further for you.			",30,1,0,4,11,0,4

												*Just scroll down to the lower half of my review if you want proper Pros and Cons instead of a story*This game caught me off guard. I was bored one day, hopping from store page to store page of F2P games. All of them seeming like the same cash-grab garbage. So I stumble upon this game with it's Mostly Negative rating and assumed it was another cash-grab that needed to be purged.I downloaded it because I had been angered by the sheer amount of F2P cash grabs and decided I should throw a negative review at one of them.So I played this game for a bit. I enjoyed the game-play quite a bit actually, perhaps the only good hunting sim out there at the moment. Played without paying any money for a little over a week and was ready to post a nice little negative review. However, I noticed people that posted positive reviews did not seem like blind fan-boys trying to avoid regretting the money they put into the game.Noticed the monthly subscription fee was among the smallest I had ever seen ($3.33 per month) and there are 3 Starter packs of different prices that offer some items along with a few months of membership. So I decided ""F*** it"" and bought the Wayfarer Starter Pack.I eventually came to the conclusion that this game is pretty damn good with a low price. If you want to play this game without spending a dime then run fast and run far.The nice little ""Free-to-Play"" label next to Play Game isn't quite true. It should say ""$14.99 | Add to Cart"" and have ""Download Demo"" off to the side. So for the game:PROS:+ Slowpaced relaxing game-play.+ Many species of animal that require different methods to hunt. (Many share different styles while some are unique)+ Rather low-entry fee compared to other ""Free-To-Play"" games.+ Decent community. Only encountered one troll in multiplayer who was quickly banned by the admin.+ There is an in-game currency earned by completing missions which can be used to buy consumables and temporary licenses for non-members.+ Still supported and updated by the developers. The developers have also relaxed some of the restrictions for non-members, such as adding a free animal rotation and making all the reserves free.+ An actual hunting simulator with tracking, flushing, etc. Instead of those low-budget shooting galleries that are on store shelves.+ A huge variety of equipment to allow constant play-ability and variation.+ Low cost membership grants access to all animals to hunt. You start with a 12 Gauge shotgun which can be used to hunt every animal except for Bison.+ There is a wonderful satisfaction in going for a group hunt then taking a group selfies in front of the kill.+ Nice sound design.+ Looks decent without causing FPS drops on my potato rig.+ Servers are stable most of the time.CONS:- All equipment cost real money.- The ""Earn EMS"" system to gain money via methods other than directly paying does not work at all. I've taken enough surveys to earn over $100 in in-game currency and haven't received a dime.- Some animals are clearly added just to sell specific equipment. Bison require high-powered rifles, Black Bears are so skittish you almost always need a bait barrel and you cannot hunt ducks without buying a plethora of equipment to the point it feels like you purchased the ""Duck Hunting"" DLC. I personally haven't delved into most of the equipment yet so I cannot say if they're worth it or not yet.- Slow-paced gameplay is not for everyone.So far I have spent $60 on this game. 15 of which went into the Wayfarer starter pack.Overall I recommend this game IF you are willing to put some money in it. If you're open to putting money in it I recommend getting it for free and seeing if it is for you. If you are adamant about not spending a dime then stay away.			",34,5,0,8,5,0,9

												This game looks beautiful and plays really well. It has some major flaws though.First I'd like to state that I never bought the game, but played it as a free to play.First thing is the wind, the wind always blows from the south-west, making it quite boring and inefficient starting from any souther point on a map in my opinion. While a small problem, it is still an issue making the game dull at that part. A wind change every X hour or having it randomly set to one thing at the start of a map would be better.The biggest issue is the microtransaction part. As a free to play game you can only hunt mule deer and cottontail rabbits. You get all the equipment for the mule deers straight away, but in order to get the weapon required for cottontail rabbit, you have to go through microtransactions or watch ads/register on sketchy sites to obtain in game currency. There is a currency in the game that you can earn by doing missions, like shooting and confirming the kill of an animal or tracking and spotting a certain animal. But this currency cannot be used for buying weapons, only ammunition and other items such as scent removers etc.Paying the subscription allows you to hunt every single animal, and some packs give you weapons and sights to get started. But none offer said air rifle for use on rabbits, mallards or pheasants. I find this a huge problem as I wanted to shoot rabbits.The game could go very far if it had better ways of obtaining things. The ads for currency should be removed, everything should be purchasable with the free to play currency and it should be possible to obtain it from successfully shooting and killing animals that give points (mostly male animals)			",262,64,1,20,15,2,22

												I've got about 140hrs in this game before it came to steam, which gives a total of ~200.I have also spent over 100$ for in-game items and licences. I'm guessing the only reason why I played it for so much was the fact, that there aren't any other decent hunting games.Unfortunatelly I really can't recommend this game to any new players.First of all, it gets more and more outdated because engine is getting old and has plenty of limitations.Secondly, the game is not Free to Play at all. Free accounts have access to 2 terrible guns, one bad scope and can only hunt a few animal species. You might be able to spot a boar but you won't be able to shoot it. Frustrating.You have to buy licences to hunt all the animal species, and you can buy a licence for 3, 6 or 12 months. Yeah, it's a subscription fee, to play this game. And that's not everything.Then you learn about ethical weapons and the fact, that you need different weapons to hunt different species. Quickly you realise that you need to buy extra wepons and you can only do that with rl money.So you spend extra 50$ on a proper rifle with good scope, a revolver, pistol holster, a bow, a backpack to carry all that stuff, maybe some camo clothing or a fancy binocs with rangefinder.Now you can start to hunt and it's quite fun. For a while...Then you get to the same point I did. You have killed every single animal species, long range, short range, revolver kills, bow kills. What can I do next?Misssions. Missions reward you with in-game currency that can be used to buy mostly consumable items. Honestly, there is nothing usefull that you can buy for that. Forget about buying guns  or even callers.It gets worse. Many, many of the missions require you to use a specific weapon to complete them. You either spend rl money on some crappy gun (but I need it for a mission) or just ignore missions completly, since they are a waste of time.Then you move to competitions.Some competitions require specific guns but there should be plenty available where you can compete with any gun. To win a comp, usually you need to harvest a highest scoring animal. Most comps last 48hrs, some of them have limited attempts.Winning a comp gives you a trophy and some em$. That's the currency that is usually only purchaseable with rl money!You might think that this is solution to all your problems. Win enough comps and be able to afford guns and items.Sorry to disappoint you.Unless you are willing to spend countless hours, you won't win a thing. You might get lucky and bag a winning animal on your first attempt, but chances for that are extremly low. From my experience: winning a comp that wasn't even very popular (not many players competing) required around 12 hours of playing (6hrs a day).You will find out that most of the players, still playing this game, are massive no-lifers. MASSIVE.There are competitions that require you to bag as many animals as possible in 48hrs period of time. Regularly you will have players that are willing to spend up to 40hrs online in that period (forget about sleeping etc) just to win a reward that is worth 1-2$.Soon you will realise that you're better off paying 5$ for a new gun that spending 100hrs doing competitions.Eventually, there is no reason to keep playing this game. You got every animal, had some fun. Missions are pointless and a cashgrab attempt, competitions are for people with no jobs, who can pay 10+ hrs a day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't bother downloading this game unless you are hardcore right into hunting sims. Hunting sims, not games..So this is not an arcade hunting game whatsoever. You will spend a lot of time running around tracking or even trying to find anything moving at all. The graphics are actually pretty nice looking, and the game runs very smoothly.The main problem with this game is that it is listed as Free to Play. It should really say Demo with paid content. or Pay to Play.You start out being able to only shoot mule deer. Doing this will earn you points (that don't actually do anything, it seems). There are quite a few animal types in the game, but if you want to go after anything other than mule deers, (oh yeah, rabbits too) than you have to get a license to hunt them. How do you get a license? Well, by spending in game money. How do you get in game money you ask? Well, you can do missions... 3 of them. Once these 3 missions are done you will get a small portion of in-game money, however, not enough to actually buy anything. These are not daily missions either. They don't reset ever, once they are done they are done. The only way to unlock more missions is to buy a license to hunt a new animal.. So how else can you get in-game money then? Well, the only way is to buy it with real money. This is not free to play... this is actually more expensive a game than most AAA big name games.If you want to play the full game expect to pay a ton of cash, and then, only for whatever time limit you have bought for your licenses, then you have to rebuy them again. LolTerrible terrbible terrible pay model. One of the worst I have ever seen. I'm not saying it should be totally free, but this is absolutely just not the way to do it.I don't recommend this game at all.			",389,60,10,33,31,4,32

												Free to play? No. It's free to walk around, aimlessly, for as long as you want. You can also; ""track"" an animal, however, unless you SPEND REAL MONEY on a monthly subscription, to obtain a licence for that SPECIFIC animal, you can not SHOOT it. This hunting simulator, has brilliant technology that is aware of whether or not you have a specific licence, and if you do not, your character simply aims the gun down when you try to click your mouse button. Very realism. For someone that has no real experience hunting, but does enjoy spending hours in hunting games, this is extremely disappointing. This game has potential, the multiplayer aspect of the game with friends is also fantastic, but if I have a friend who has given the devs money, he gets far cooler stuff than I do, and can hunt far more things than I can. I am aware a lot of developers do this, and I don't have an issue with paying members getting cooler stuff, but I disagree with the fact that I lack the technology to pull the trigger on a rifle to SHOOT an animal, whether I have a licence for it or not. I'd also rather a 1 off payment to own the game and have full access to everything it has to offer, than continue dishing out money per month to have access to certain features. So remember, this isn't free to SHOOT at animals, but it is free to run around aimlessly like a d*ckhead.OK I cannot reply to anyone directly as Steam will not let me, so I can just continue editing this. Let's set some things straight:@Mathia$ - Yes, it does give you a little taste. I became addicted and ended up paying for a 3 month subscription - so I guess their method of making addicts has worked. I've also paid again for a .300 rifle and a scope, another 10 Euros spent lol@Dannj90 - Yup. Like I said, the game has potential and is addictively fun. I just prefer the method of buying a game outright and having everything it includes, instead of monthly this, and pay for that etc etc: completely my personal preference.@HaddockA - When people review things, they're reviewing them from their own personal experience. I can't imagine reviewing something without experiencing it. I wrote this review after the 3 day trail had ended, and I couldn't shoot anything. THAT was my experience, hence this negative review. Game's great, if you're willing to pay a lot for it (when you're under the influence that it is free).. So yeah, good luck finding someone's review of something where they aren't referring to personal experience.@darkfitz - lol I don't know where to begin. I'm not going to judge you on your computer terminology as that's uncalled for and unjustified. I don't know about real life hunting as I've not experienced it. The only killing of innocent animals I'll ever do, is in a game. Oh, and before anyone wants to educate me on the killing of innocent animals for the survival of mankind, and our lust for eating meat, yeah - I get it. No lecture required. I eat meat too. I'm aware of animals being slaughtered for that, it's just not something I would or could ever do.So, are we all happy now? The game isn't ""bad"", I just personally dislike having to continue dishing out money for something I've become somewhat addicted to...... Yes, that's a drug reference. Goodnight.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												i came into this expecting to write a really negative review because this game is marketed as free, without the DLC its basically a demo. yet, a really enjoyable demo.to the people who say this game is slow pace: well ofcourse it is its a hunting game genius.to the people who say there are almost no animals: in my first 30 minutes i had to decide between 3 different animals to track, a rabbit, a deer and a cayote. first i went after the rabbit since that was the only animal i had seen myself.this game almost geniunely makes you feel like you are outside, because face it, thats the closest thing to outside (or the route from your house to the closest grocery shop, the few times you dont order pizza) you will ever see. if you were to turn a fan on so you can also enjoy the wind this will get an immersion rating of 9.9/10.i see myself playing this semi-often, its super relaxing and yet very entertaining.but!there are a noticable amount of really small yet obvious bugs that you cant help but notice, and question why the dev hasnt fixed these yet? does he not play the game himself? and ofcourse the DLC drama this game has, to be fair its still pretty entertaining but i can see it getting old without the DLC's. and i dont want to spend 15$-50$ for a game marketed as free.i would normally say ""but hey, its free, play it yourself"" but no, this game requires an account first of all and secondly the download is massive for a 'free' game. if youve got the time and the space on your computer and you like slow pace games sure, try it. but in most other situations contemplate if youre willing to go through possible trouble and annoyance for a hunting sim (a good one might i add).

												Welp I wanted to retry this game and so i deleted my past review...So here's an update:Cons:-Walking simulator -Chase an animal for over 9000 hours to then when you finally shoot it, ""you dont have license for this""-Extremely slow paced-I'd rather watch paint dry-IF you were to put together Trion, Nexon, Aeria Games, Blizzard, EA Games, Bethesda, Gaben, Soros, etc; all together they still wouldn't compare to this company in terms of greedyness.-Free to download, buy to play, buy to (expiring) licenses for 90% of the animals, buy to weapons, buy to look at it.Pros:Uninstaller works.To anyone still reading this.. Save yourself a headache. Go play something else. The graphics are nice and so is the concept but this is one of the WORST game companies I've ever seen.I hit recommend for those ""optimist"" types that like to filter the obvious large amounts of negative reviews in place already.(((I've heard the government tortures terrorists to get them to speak by making them play this game with a 'free to play' account for hours.  So far it works and it can't be proven that its anti-humanitarian, the government doesn't even bother to ""dispose"" of their captives once they talk because by the time their done with this torture method the captives are FUBAR and usually end up commiting suicide via 6 bullets to the back of their head while trying on their new concrete shoes on the middle of a crocodile infested river.)))

												This is the hunting simulator I've been wanting for years, and you can love it too, if you keep a few very important details in mind:1. Despite its claims, this game is not really free to play, or at least, the free to play model is not great. To really enjoy it you need to invest a good $30-$40 to get some good equipment (so you don't scare every animal away immediately) and licenses (so that you can hunt any animal). 2. This is NOT an arcade-type hunting game. It actually requires you to hunt, tracking your prey and occasionally losing them. It takes time and patience. There will not be ten bucks popping out at you every five seconds. This is actually what I love about the game, but I can see how some would not take to it as easily if they were expecting something else. Besides, the world is gorgeous. Take time to walk and enjoy the sights along the way. Pro tip: After the first 150 yards or so after leaving your hunting camp, don't use the run button. It can scare the animals away. Again. you have to be able to enjoy a slower-paced game.3. The user interface takes some getting used to. It doesn't work like your average first-person shooter, and there is not a great tutorial that teaches you everything. Most of your important items, like your weapon and deer call and such are mapped to the number keys. Watch a beginner's guide on Youtube or on the TheHunter wiki page before diving in.If you can handle those three things, you are in for an incredible hunting simulation. The slower-pace makes the successful kill incredibly satisfying, and the online tournaments you can enter (you don't play with other people; just submit your best kills to see who scores the highest) add tons of incentive to keep playing. As I said, part of the joy of this game is just enjoying the world. I don't know how many screen shots I've taken during my time in-game. It's beautiful. Happy hunting!Pros: Excellent hunting simulationBeautiful worldStellar sound qualityCons:Not really Free-to-PlayUser interface could be betterSome might not like the slower pace8.5/10			",70,73,3,7,15,0,21

												There are so many animals in this game its like you are acually hunting. Spend hours hunting down animals alone or with your friends. Hunt down deer, bears, ducks, pheasants, rabbits, boars, ect. The amount of hours that any player could have put in to this game would have been amazing.Sounds like a good game right, well if its a good game why am i not recommending it, well here is the reason why. The store page is lieing, to you there is nothing in this game that makes it free-2-play. The 4 hours i spent playing this game i was so confused on why i couldn't shoot a boar THAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Turns out you need a liecense for almost every animal. You can only kill 2 animals if you are a free-2-play player, which is mule deer and rabbits (which in my opinion the hardest animals to find). I spent 2 hours looking for mule deers, I looked up guides, I tried different approaches, and still couldn't even see one. i was following a mule deer's tracks for a full hour and everytime i would get close it would run away (now keep in mind I was crouching the entire time and I didnt even get to see the damn thing). Also, while I was looking for the mule deer i found a whitetail deer, a pheasant, and a boar, WHICH WERE EASY KILLS. So this the games logic, I have to pay in order to click on animals. Yes that makes so much sense, my god i would rather go hunting in real life. Oh and i didnt even get to the equipent, guess how many weapons you get, just guess, ONE. It makes no sense to me how you only get ONE weapon in a hunting game. Ok let me tell you everything you get when you first start the game. You get a sniper rifle, a huntermate (a GPS/tracker), a mule deer caller, a camera, and binoculars. Now you might think that that is exactly what you need to go hunting. Well your wrong, because the full 4 hours i was playing the game i kept finding everything other than mule deer. Oh and I almost forgot mule deers are only found on one map, and there are i believe 8 maps. So let me get this straight there are 8 maps in this game, the animals that you are able to kill are only available in 1 map, and you only get 2 animals that you are able to kill. Yeah this is definatly free-2-play. Oh yeah also, if you want to be able to kill all the animals in the game you have to get a license. If you want to know something similar to this system, its like Xbox Live. You pay 14.99 for a 3 month license. WTF thats criminal now a days, now if you are the kind person that doesnt mind paying, then thats great this game is for you. But its still very stupid that you have to do such a thing like that.Hey Expansive Worlds and Avalanche Studios, let me teach you something about free-2-play.In order to make a good free-2-play game you must be able to make sacrifcises. Sacrificises such as being able to hunt down every animal in 1 map (not 2 you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), be able to give the player 1 of every weapon, and a caller for those animals. Now is that so hard. If you listen to this review and do what i say this will definately make this game, The Best Hunting Game Ever Made. It has the potential.The final verdict for this game is:3/10and if you listen to my suggetions it would probably make the game at least:7/10Think about it			",114,2,1,4,14,1,2

												I have never though about playing with a hunting game. I thought before, hunting and sport games are the most boring and pointless games ever made. But one of my older friend asked me if there are any hunting games out there, so I had searched and found theHunter for him, and helped to install and play it. Then it has shocked me how beautiful the graphics are, and how deep and complex the simulation is. So I have installed it on my PC too and spent a few hours to try it, and I was astonished by the quality, complexity and scale of it. The nature, landscape, weather, animals were so perfectly, and so beautifully simulated, that I have never encountered anything close to it before. And there was enough variety and complexity in gameplay (lots of species, equipments, methods) that I would not say it is boring.BUT the whole thing is messed up with the financial model of the game. There is actually no reward and no progress with successful hunting, you can only buy new equipment/new possibilities with real money. But if you would, for example spend at least 50-100$ to be able to have all the possibilities the game has to offer, then you would also loose the reward for hunting, you can not cook a dear stew or roast a boar with hunting friends in a wood camp, drink beer and sing etc. ....If you would spend such money, I advise you to buy a real gun, and try out real hunting, I bet its much more worth it.As for the game, I would even pay a fixed price of 30-40$ or even a monthly fee around 15-20$ to be able to play in a classic MMO style, where you can unlock stuff gradually as a reward for hunting. And no microtransactions and real money purchase for stuff. For nobody playing. Everyone has to earn equipment as a reward, so the game would get some kind of point and progress.Other really good idea would be to embed the game, in a full scale survival based game like Rust. The hunting simulation is very-very simple compared to theHunter in those games, and none of them has such a good simulation and landscape graphics. But serious and complex natural simulation and hunting mechanism would really add to those game concepts, and the hunting part would be well embedded in the reward cycle of a survival game, where the meat, hide, bones etc. can be used to survive after processing.

												Whenever a game says ""free to play"" you know that there's always going to be those people who have better gear than you, but you can deal with that because the game is fun as it is however, this is not the case with theHunter...I really want to like this game, I really do but the fact that it has pay to win written all over it is some-what depressing. The Graphics, great. The shooting, great. Co-op, great. Tracking, great. Buy ways (with real money) to hunt certain animals and almost everything else required for hunting, not so great...In conclusion I would say not to download this game unless you are living on your own private island and have the cash to spare.

												I am changing my review for this due to the recent change as far as privileges for free members. You can now hunt Whitetail, rather than mule deer, and you may hunt Pheasant and Rabbits. The single shot shotguns is also free for said Rabbits and Pheasants. For people like me, the standard ""no frills"" hunter, this makes for a sim I can appreciate at a free level. I hunt mainly deer and pheasant, so this game will allow me to continue doing so without spending a dime. I reccomend this game, since it isn't going to mug you as hard as it did before.Also because I like Whitetail more than Muleys, but that is beside the point.			",81,7,1,13,7,0,7

												The gameplay is ok but the restrictions are not. I can understand premium weapons and stuff but not premium only animals. Free players are restricted down to two animals and there are 18 therefore a lot of the animals you encounter you can't shoot at. Free players can't even create their own servers, making it difficult to play online.I can't believe I'm saying this but this is the WORST free to play game I have ever played (yes that's right I have played Star Wars The Old Republic). I couldn't get into it enough. The gameplay is all there (shootin' stuff) but the restrictions are too and they are horrible. The idea was good but if they made it a normal game which you pay for and unlock everything It could actually be good but no, they went down the Free to Play route.A good game but bad F2P Method.3/10			",78,7,1,5,4,0,6

												Wanna play a game that requires the patience of real hunting, a game with worse microtransactions than Candy Crush?Wanna pay 30 whole bucks to hunt one more species than the one you can get in the begining? The game says you start with 3 liscenses for 3 animals; 2 rabbits and a deer. But ya dont have a the guns for the rabbits :D. By the end of my 3 horrible hours in this game, the unistall button looked so fantastic! As i right-clicked the game to hit uninstall it said,""licencse Required to Unistall"". I shot myself 3 times and woke up from a dream. I got on my computer, uninstalled the game and smiled; it was the one thing the devs got right :P. When people think reveiws that say ""THIS GAME SUCKS,"" help them to decide if the game is good or bad, you know you're in for a treat.                   :PP.S.- I read positive reveiws, and half of them are people being sarcastic.

												First thing i have to mention is, this game is DEFINITELY pay to play.F2P is a LIE,This review is made on the mindset that you paid upfront anywhere from 20usd-40usd for Either the Wayfarer Bundle or the PathFinder Bundle.-----------------------------------The Difference between Wayfarer and PathFinderThe only things you need to consider are-Another 20usd for a silent bow and a backpack.The extra 3 months membership is not something you should consider.If you want to try using a silent bow to hunt animals ,and would like to carry more than 1 weapon, then you should consider the PathFinder Pack.------------------------------------Now then,Why is the hunter fun/not fun.+Authentic* hunting (Close enough i think, i never hunted IRL)+Multiple animal varieties+Multiple Types of guns to use(Rifles,Shotguns,Bows mainly)-Very slow game-a Kill can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 90minutes, depending on your skill level and luck-an Animal might survive after getting shot and escape so far you might not find it, wasting another 10-30minutes+That said a kill is more gratifying because of this-----------------------------------Should you buy a bundle and play this game?If you want to find a game where you can have fun killing animals easily-     NoIf you just want to kill animals-    Maybe                                - if you have the patienceIf you would try and experience a new type of gaming, of Slow pace and patience-YesIf you are willing to crouch/walk 85% of the time, listening to nature, scouting for animals-    Yes-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------             TLDR-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Game is slow, expensive, and might not be worth your time.But a kill you gain after hunting it for 30-90 minutes feels great.EDIT- i realise i could get 5 kills in a 72minute session, so if you have a decent amount of skill in the game , you are able to get consistent kills every 10-20 minutes or so			",184,8,4,9,14,1,19

												Feels like a good game being hijacked by Wall Street.1. It's a demo, not a F2P game by any regard. There's no logical way to progress without paying.2. It's subscription-based despite being mainly a singleplayer game with token multiplayer.3. Even if you subscribe, there are semi-arbitrary limitations on what guns can be used on what animal, forcing you to A. Buy two more guns B. Buy a shotgun and then continuously buy special ammo. C. Buy a bow, which is far harder to use than any other weapon. Either way, you either pay more or pay some and gimp yourself.4. Even if you buy the subscription and then guns you've only made the game passable. Forget about accessing any other guns, utilities or clothing without paying even more. So be prepared for about $18 just to get the very basics, and at only a 3-month lease to boot.5. The retail version of the game right now is about $16, for which you get 7 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. The 'Starter Pack' closest to that one is $32 for 4 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. Here's a hint. The first one is a decent price. The second one is deliberate milking of its customers for even less content.So yes, the game itself is something I'd definitely see myself playing, but even after subscribing I can't motivate myself to throw more and more money at it to get anywhere. It's a nice enough game, with well-made environments and soundscape, but without a campaign of any kind or more elaborate multiplayer experience it's more of a 'pick it up every now and then to relax' type of game. Which is fine, but completely hampered by the constant money grabbing - as a one-off I'd happily pay $25-40 for it, but for that kind of money now you'd barely get 10% of the full game and a subscription ending to watch out for.[edit] Turns out that even if you have the licensing and the appropriate gun, you need to shell out more cash for hunting some species (e.g. mallards) for decoys and whatnot, or get shafted. Neat.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Occasionally I'll think about this game and wish I could play more of it using all of the mechanics. This game has an incredible amount of potential and the developers seem like hardworking people that have made a really good game. Unfortunately, the way they delivered this game was incredibly poor. I would happily buy this game for $40 and start out with everything you would normally get starting for free. But I should be able to hunt animals, then sell the meat, hide etc. to earn ingame money and purchase licenses to hunt bigger and better animals and buy more equipment. Sadly they instead made you have to pay real money overtime to play. I just can't recommend that.			",119,8,2,16,21,0,10

TL;DRF2P is a Demo-Mode only. Solid hunting game with detailed hunting grounds, cheap MMO-like payment model, rare but large actual content updates but loads of optional microtransaction material.F2P and Payment modelThe F2P content contains the license to hunt Whitetail Deer, Pheasant and three kinds of Rabbit only. As of the latest major Patch you now get a shotgun for free as well, so the grindwall for hunting the rabbits and pheasant is gone. One ingame currency ""GMS"" can be obtained by doing missions like ""Track a Mule Deer"", ""Harvest a Mule Deer"", ""Spot a Whitetail Deer"". Its a pretty useless currency though.The payment model lets you pay per month in order to get a license for all animals, so think of it as a ""cheap MMO-type payment"". However in contrast to MMOs, actual content updates to be played by you as a license holder appear only a few times a year. On the other hand these updates usually contain a new hunting reserve with new animals, so they offer quite some content.There are a lot of weekly minor updates with new guns, clothes and other equipment not really needed for playing the game though.The GameIn my opinion thehunter is a well-made hunting simulator with decent animal behavior and very well made highly detailed hunting reserves.The negative points I want to mention are random fps-drops in certain areas of the map which many players seem to encounter, ""old animals"" seem a bit lacking in texture quality compared to the new ones as well as ""old reserves"" are not as diverse and different from each other as the more recent ones. Some reserves are considered lackluster by a majority of the playerbase due to ""recycling"" of animals, e.g. the Australia reserve only contains the kangaroo as a specifically australian animal.Some content patches in the past caused problems for players to connect in multiplayer games.How much does it cost ?If there is no sale going I can not recommend buying a membership via the Ingame Store at all. Instead, I highly recommend to get the DVD Version of 2013 for ~10 € which is a far better deal.Basically this DVD Version comes with everything you need in contrast to the ingame-store sets. Even if you want to extend your membership, the DVDs offer much more. For some animals, callers are quite handy, so you might want to plan another ~10€ for callers. For fox and coyote I think the ""Jackrabbit caller"" is essential, for the rest of the callers you dont own it is really dependant on your playstyle. The same goes for any more ""advanced"" hunting clothing.To summarize, I think buying a DVD-Version which offers a fair deal, if you can not get the 2013 Version you will need ~5€ for a decent big-game hunting rifle, depending on the ongoing sales.Important:Do not buy any of the starter packs unless the largest one gets a hefty discount on Steam, because the other ones will leave you with the lack of a big-game rifle as well and are lackluster in value proposition compared to buying any DVD Version.One thing that should be mentioned here is goose and duck hunting. Though you can find those animals without any special equipment, you will need this equipment should you want to hunt birds in large scale.Since geese and ducks require dummies and a special hunting setup you need ~15 €, depending on the current sales for a goose or a duck setup, so these act as ""DLCs"".AlternativesMost of the ""Cabelas"" Hunting  games are just mass animals shooters, the ""Cabelas Big Game Hunter Pro Hunts"" is not bad though, just simplified mechanics.If you enjoy the detailed landscape and the ""slow"" gameplay, you might want to look into ""Fishing Planet"". This one actual is true F2P, but comes with a high grindwall.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game off and on over the many years it's been promoted and advertised.This is a fenced in game riddled with micro transactions that require you to spend money to get new items and gear along with actual Hunting licenses as a Monthly Subscription.I am not a Fan of the Micro store requiring actual money, but they do offer missions to get consumables through in game currency for hunting contracts. Granted, the game is enjoyable as a Hunting simulator and challenging. But, the game has evolved since I first started playing.Beta (2009): free to play limited to 10 bullets and Mule dear for hunting only2012: free to play limited to only Mule dear Hunting only with unlimited ammo2016: free to play limited to a rotation of various animals for hunting *at time of review still needed to playI am going back to the game during different times of spurts for hunting enjoyment, but from past experience you will always need a hunting buddy with plenty of equipment for a well rounded enjoyment on many of the Hunting Maps available. *NOTE* I will be updating this review after I play through this years newest content.*Edit 9/03/2016* : OK the game still requires guests to miss out on alot of things, but with the rotation of different huntable animals it does allow for those that still want to hunt with out paying a Chance to partake in hunting.Now if you wanted to see what I am talking about I have done a Stream with a Buddy of mine and the first 30 minutes should help shed some light on the game play as a Guest.- Also to note later on the guest gamers ended up getting Starter Packs to allow for unlimited hunting of any and all animals.

There is a Wiki Page that was put together by the community to help with virtually anything you can think of related to the game. - - Shopping - - Equipment - - Hunting recommendations - - etc.Please take a Chance to check it out if your having trouble with your decision on spending money on the hunter.http://thehunter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Hunter_WikiaThe wiki will help even further if your not sure on equipment purchasing, for the type of hunter you would like to try and become or focus on.http://thehunter.wikia.com/wiki/Buying_Guide*edit*If there is something that is not helpful about the review let me know in the Comment's, so I can help you further.Nominated this game for the Steam awards.

												I say it's disapointing. The reason why is because it's sorta like a buy to win game,expect in this case you have to buy things to literally do ANYTHING. I loaded up the game,got used the controls and set off on a hunt! I then found a trail of a boar which i encountered a few minutes later. I aimed at it ,and pulled the trigger and i was stopped by a message stating ""YOU DO NOT HAVE A LISCENSE TO HUNT THIS ANIMAL"" I then quit to main menu and went to the site to look at the stuff. I think you can only hunt a rabbit,and a deer for a starter thing? When i went to the site everything had a price tag.Then i uninstalled this game forever.It's an okay game but the get it's true potential you gotta pay! For some this may not be a problem,but i want a game where the content is in the main game not the things your purchase on the side. SO IN CONCLUSION.0/10. FOR MAKING ME WALK 100 MILES,For letting me shoot birds or anything else!,You gotta pay to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're willing to pay the monthly fees, you're going to have a good time. It's a fun game that can kill a lot of your time. Probably the best hunting simulator in the market.However, if you're going to play for free, which is how this game was marketed, you're going to have a bad time, because all you're going to do is go around, find an animal, attemp to shoot it and get a message saying that you have to pay to be able to hunt it. You're only allowed to hunt one type of animal, and it's moderately hard to find one, let alone hunt it.Do I recommend it for how it was marketed? Of course not.Would I recommend it if it were Buy2Play and not Pay2Play disguised as free to play? Absolutely.Don't mind the low play time. I used to play it in the standalone launcher before it was on Steam. I decided to check back if anything has changed. It didn't. They only added more packs to be bought.			",289,70,15,27,17,0,18

												As so many reviewers before me I have to demand to get rid of this F2P tag. You have to pay real money on a subscription based model to play the game as the developers intented it. Otherwise I guess it is a great game. Kind of costly though, because nearly everything you can buy is only temporarily. With the free membership you can only hunt mule deers. This wouldn't be so bad if there were only mule deers on the map, but no, every animal that is huntable, you can find and thats where it really gets frustrating. You are hunting a deer for 40 to 50 minutes, get to the best shooting spot you can find, only to find out when you pull the trigger, that it is a white tail deer and you dont have a license to shoot it. The free membership is a farce. It is a really bad demo at best. I guess it would be a great game if it wasn't for this ridiculous payment model. Please Valve, do something about this F2P Tag.

Once you have subscribed the game is built to make you spend money with micro transactions for ether weapons and callers but also worldly items like tents and hunting towers.

												I have been searching for a good hunting game for awhile now and this gem popped up. Its a beautifully crafted game and you can tell there was love put into it. It is a solid title, however, I cannot enjoy the Hunter because I am constantly stopped by pay walls with it. Microtransactions are abundant and the game takes the fun out of it being a video game by making you have to pay for (like in real life) rounds, rifles, pistols, holsters, hunting licenses (which are temporary) and all sorts of other manner of hunting equipment as well.Its a great game, it could use vehicles, but the major downside is how all the equipment is blocked by constant cash fees. You can't just go out there and hunt whatever you like without paying the developer something and that is definetaly not what I am looking for in a hunting simulator. I will say you start with some basic equipment and are able to hunt hare and whitetail deer (correct me if I am wrong).I could understand and appreciate mechanics that dealt with ingame currency by rewarding you with cash for trophy kills, but that is not the case. I wish this was a standalone title, but sadly it is not. There is a multiplayer aspect to it and I really did not delve into it. If this is a MMO-like/multiplayer game with a deep community I could slightly understand the microtranscation fees. I still however in my good conscience cannot reccommend this game. If there is a standalone version where I can just buy the whole product and am not blocked by microtranscations, I would gladly pay for it. It would be well worth it in my honest opinion, but until that point this game is a no from me.			",70,22,0,34,27,1,20

This review mostly discusses the main issue the game has for most people – the pricing model. If you are looking for a gameplay or more balanced review, please Google for a “Let’s play” video or read another review instead. The positive recommendation only applies if you deem the pricing model as discussed acceptable.First things first - This title is not Free to Play.If you are looking for a free to play hunting title i have to start this review with some bad news: this game is not free to play by most interpretations of the term ""Free to play"". As a limited member you can do the following:  You can enter all the reserves and wander around. You receive one basic rifle, a scope and unlimited ammunition refills for that rifle. You will also receive a deer caller. You can only hunt Cottontail rabbits and Mule Deers. Hunting all other animals is prohibited in the sense that you cannot do so at all. You can see them, but shooting them is not possible.Unlike other free to play games you cannot feasibly unlock new content by playing the game a lot or by being good at it. You are stuck with what you have and that is it – and it’s admittedly not too much. The pricing model.So, you made it past the initial post explaining the game is not free to play and might be considering picking the game up? In that case, let us talk about the games pricing model and what it entails. The games pricing model is twofold: there are both subscriptions and items purchases. Subscription:  Subscription starts at 9.99 for a 3 month period which is arguably quite good compared to most MMO's. In exchange for your subscription you will receive unlimited ammunition for all the weapons you own, and a license to hunt all species of animals in the game. It is also possible to buy ammunition and animal hunting licenses as separate items though the monetary exchange rate for this is fairly bad in comparison. (But perhaps worthwhile if you are a very casual player)Items: Buyable items cover a broad range of possibilities. There is weapons, scopes, clothing, deployables (Hunting towers), utilities (Animal callers, storage increasing backpack) and temporally power-ups (Wind indicators, facial paint et cetera).Except for the power-ups all items are permanent once bought, with the caveat being that you will need an animal license and ammunition to hunt specific animals. There is an additional caveat as well: Each weapon can only be used on a subset of the animals in the game - you cannot use a pistol on a bear or a rifle on a pheasant for example. If you want to hunt all animals you will need to buy multiple weapons. The utilities sold are somewhat more optional though a huge convenience: callers enable you to coax animals them out of hiding or locate them, while specific clothing will provide superior camouflage thus fewer running animals as you try to sneak upon them.Bottom line? Expect to buy a membership and - depending on playing preference - one or more weapons, scopes and clothing if you wish to fully enjoy everything the game has to offer. The cheapest variety would be buying the wayfarer pack for about 15 Euro's; this includes 3 months of membership, a shotgun, a pistol with scope and some consumables. The shotgun itself is - with different ammo types - able to take down every type of animal in the game. Alternative you can do some research and find yourself a relatively cheap combination of items that allows you to hunt virtually everything the way you want it. Still, don't be surprised if you end up forking 20-30 bucks over initially if you chose this route (that figure includes a 3 month membership). Final thoughts.Despite the games price model arguably being steep I personally find myself enjoying the game quite a bit, so for me it is well worth the triple-a equivalent price I spend on it so far. Considering my current time invested, the subscription fee and my lack of a need to buy new items the game will be cheaper than a regular subscription MMO if I keep playing it another month or two, while spending a similar amount of time on it.That said: I can only advice the game to people who – like me – enjoy hunting simulations quite a bit. If you plan on picking up the game you should be able to live with the thought of having to possibly do a relatively sizable investment initially, followed by a fairly mild recurrent billing scheme. It is not a good pickup for people looking exclusively for a free to play title due to the rather sharp limitations and the inability to unlock content by playing a lot or being good. Still, the game itself is a lot of fun if you like hunting sims. If you can stomach the need for payment and don't mind doing some research into the items you want i can hearthily recomment it.Addendum - How to make the most out of your game without paying a dime: There is an excellent guide on the forums by Maverick that discusses the topic of getting the most out of the game without paying a dime for it. The method discussed will not grant access to all content indefinitely: You will be reliant on missions and counting your bullets. Even so it will allow you to access more content (Including hunting other animals) on a temporary basis. If you are strapped for cash but really want to play more of the game the suggestions in it may be a viable alternative - at least for a while.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Atmospheric and beautiful FPS where you're not shooting terrorists, zombies, aliens, demons or even dinosaurs. This time... it's bears. Bears, elks, pheasants and other wildlife roam the wilderness for you to track and hunt down for that perfect trophy. Gorgeous nature scenery and a wide variety of weapons keep the shooting fresh and relaxing.This game is one of the best examples of combination of realistic graphics with amazing gameplay. The game perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the hunt, level of interaction with the environment is extremely high. ""theHunter"" impresses with its proximity to the reality and the different variations of action.The game is free to play. If you are not a member, you can hunt 5 species for free a week. 2 of the 5 species are always the same, but 2 species change every week so you get a chance to hunt all animals. It is a simulation, so it is important for the player to take the right ammo when going on a hunt, otherwise some shots will be disallowed(Company promotes ethical hunting).

Posted: June 13, 2016
												Let me just start off by stating that I’m giving a positive rating because I think TheHunter is a decent game, but despite this I’m going to get pretty negative in this review, mostly because it’s essentially one very long complaint of a problem that I think is crippling to the game. I’m also not going to summarize how the core game works at all, so if you’re looking for a review of that then this probably won’t help much.As you can probably already see from the Steam reviews, there’s been a lot of controversy about Thehunter’s Free 2 Play model. I never had much experience with this, as I started out paying for membership, but the controversy eventually led Expansive Worlds to revise their model to a slightly less intrusive one, but asides from the confirmation that is was indeed a pretty bad model I think that maybe a lot of the negative reviews are undeserved.In general I think that periodical charges are perfectly reasonable in a game which offers continuous updates and new content, and TheHunter is one of the better hunting games in a video game genre otherwise marred by some pretty embarrassing design standards. It should be pretty clear from my playtime here on Steam that I like it. Despite a visible need for polish in terms of the games UI design and how the game conveys important information, as well as a pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥decision to make everything including the launcher fully dependant on Expansive Worlds’ servers (which means that when there’s problems on their end you can’t play the game at all, not even singleplayer, and sometimes a host can lose connection to her or his own game). However, the main problem that I’ve chosen to write about in this review stems from how the ingame store operates.For all means and purposes, TheHunter is a stealth game where the primary goal is to kill animals. In a stealth game about killing things, what are some of the general design elements that are the most crucial to providing variety and thereby prolonged engagement, i.e. fun, to the experience? Well, having different environments to play in and having different ways to kill things.If you pay for membership, (or if you use in-game currency to buy permissions for hunting different animals) you’re provided with the rudimentary means to hunt all animals within all 10 different reserves, and the environments of the different reserves do impact the difficulty of the game and the way you have to play in order to hunt efficiently, so in that case the game fulfills the first of those requirements.There’s also a large variety of different weapons to use and different equipment to use, and they all impact the way you can hunt significantly. Some weapons are silent, some weapons are light, some weapons are powerful and heavy, and you can get hunting blinds, bait, camouflage clothing, dogs, bows, and all other sorts of cool stuff to hunt animals in different ways,-BUT ALL OF THAT COSTS MONEY.-Like most Free 2 Play multiplayer games with microtransactions, there’s two kinds of currency, gm$, earned by completing missions ingame, and em$, earned by paying for it with real money. What is different and ironically worse than the microtransactions of most other Free 2 Play multiplayer games is that the stuff which can actually be bought with gm$ is currently limited to only the absolutely most pitifully uninteresting consumables that the game has to offer;You cannot buy weapons with gm$. You cannot buy tents or hunting blinds with gm$. You cannot buy bait barrels, which are required to use bait, with gm$. You cannot buy dogs with gm$. You cannot buy clothing with gm$. You cannot buy scopes with gm$.Essentially, any digital items which are permanently added to your character, or which actually do something significant to the gameplay requires payments in addition to your membership subscription, which to me is much more significant assery than the notorious former Free 2 Play structure. The concept of having to buy ingame equipment in order to have fun in a game that you’re already supporting through periodical charges is ludicrous.TheHunters main equivalent of points in its semi-competitive community high-score system is HunterScore, which is rewarded for getting ingame milestone achievements, like “25 Mule Deer harvests” or “100 .243 bolt action rifle harvests”. There is a maximum limit to the HunterScore which can be achieved, but since getting there requires killing animals with all weapons in the game, including those which cost money, it effectively acts as a Pay 2 Win structure if you really want to spend the ridiculous amount of time it requires to actually compete with the top players.The problems of the cost structure are slightly alleviated by the retail packages, which in some areas are actually way cheaper and offer more value than just buying membership online. With my first retail package I felt that I was getting significantly more value for my money than the 14.99€ “Wayfarer” starter package I bought on Steam, and this led me to later buy a couple of other packages from a german website in order to get some more new equipment and some added membership time. This time it was far less of a satisfying purchase, though, partly because it was less cheap and partly because only the membership and the single “special edition” weapon I got from the packages was actually useful to me. Most equipment offered in the retail packages is the same as every other retail package, save for usually one “exclusive” premium item, usually a weapon.You can stack multiple pieces of the same equipment in TheHunter, but it seems like an oversight much more than anything else, because you can’t actually do anything with spare pieces of equipment. There’s no trading system, you can’t sell them for a bit of money, and there’s no point of having two of the same gun with you on a hunt since you’re limited to the same amount of ammunition as when you’re carrying one anyways. If anything they do make navigating your inventory more tedious, because you’ll eventually see, like, 6 .243 bolt action rifles and 6 12 gauge single shot shotguns because you’ve activated 5 different packages which all contained roughly the same guns and because there isn’t even any option to discard them. In fact, with one of the recent updates the 12 gauge single shot shotgun is now the only weapon in the store which costs 0 em$, so just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles I bought 100 and now my ingame inventory is cluttered with them.Anyways, now that I got the retail packages from Germany and activated them, I haven’t really ended up feeling like I made a good purchase. Instead, I really feel like a gullible idiot, and probably rightfully so. It’s mostly this feeling which is the reason as to why I’m writing this review in the first place. The weapons in TheHunter are only digital trinkets after all, and I don’t think it’s right to spend money on digital trinkets like this in the first place. I don’t understand the need for it either, if it was possible to at least also buy weapons for gm$ in addition to em$, it would provide a major incentive for players to keep playing the game, and since membership requires a subscription already, then what’s the problem?Shouldn’t the membership subscriptions be paying for the maintenance and content updates of the game so that these seemingly kind of greedy and seemingly unnecessary micro transactions wouldn’t be needed? What’s the point of having two separate payment systems operating in the same game?I like the game, but looking at the store really just makes me annoyed. After the tremendous amount of negative reviews following the former Free 2 Play model, though, they did revise it in the end. Maybe one of the next priorities could be revising the payment system?

												Ok we'll try keep this short and simple. Yes this game CAN cost a lot of money (I've put in around $500 USD just because I enjoy it and my financial status allows me to) to play but there are lots of things you can do for 100% free. First off do the missions they give you gm$ which can in turn be used to buy ammo, camping supplies, licenses, and a lot of other stuff.    After you get enough gm$ buy a license for a different animal which you can then activate the missions which require you to kill said animal (if you don't have the weapon needed for the mission just ask players that do have that gun many will be glad to help you.) Oh and some missions can be done by just tracking or spotting an animal so theres some gm$ you can get and not have to buy a license. I would buy the Trailrunner membership it gives you tons of things like weapons, camoflauge, scopes, calls, stands, tents, camping supplies, etc. Along with a memebrship to hunt all animals ingame for one year. The cost for the trailrunner is $49.99 USD which equates to 7 cents a day (rounded) It costs more to live per day than it does to play an awesome game!    Oh and after your year is up if you decide to keep on playing, the basic one year memebrship costs $34.99 USD and you still get to hunt all the animals and you get 3 of the deployable hunting stands. Another thing is that 90% of the negative reviews never put at least 50 hours in the game they play for 10 minutes then cry because the game isn't free to play. Another thing you can do to earn em$ is the ""earn em$"" option where you watch videos, read articles, download stuff (I do not recommend you download stuff unless you're a betting man) I have some friends which only play by this method and are quite effective at it.    Oh and for the waterfowl it does cost a lot and i do not recommend it I only hunt them a couple times a year so save your money and look for someone who already has a setup. This game is also very realistic there are more animals than in real life but the developers needed to make this game a bit more fun, which they did perfectly. This is why I recommend this game, if you need help with anything ingame add me on theHunter at Charlielolyoloswag I've been playing for a bit over a year.  Also the devs recently did a lot for their Free to play memebers they gave them 5 new species to hunt 2 of which switch every week, and they gave us all the Single Shot shotgun with free ammo for it. So much for making this short and simple haha :)			",23,2,0,1,7,0,0

												The game is beautiful and the animals are pretty realistic, the immersion is great. However the economics of the game are fundamentally broken. In order to hunt and enjoy you need to spend a lot of money, real money. Before anyone jumps to conclusions I should make it clear that i have already spent 57 EUROS (more then 60$)  on this game. Because it wouldn't allow me to hunt anything I've purchased a 50 euro annual membership, i chose that one because it also gave me alot of ingame items and I'm comfortable spending that amount on a game. OK. I got some things like weapons, clothing, a tent, a caller or something. After I have spent some time in the game I realized that even that won't be enough. I spent another 7 EUROS for a crossbow and some callers/lures. Now I'm at the point where i realize that even though i have spent this amount of money I won't be able to enjoy all the features of the game without spending further money. But you see I am not comfortable spending any more money on this game and if any of the developers are reading the review, i will tell you this: I WON'T SPEND ANY FURTHER MONEY ON YOUR GAME. EVER. In fact i won't even play because i just can't enjoy a game that has no progression, a game that i know that no matter what i do ingame i will never be able to unlock items without paying for them. And playing without those items is possible but is artificially made harder in order to trick you into buying them.As someone said in another review theHunter is the perfect example of what is wrong with today's gaming. Some people believe that everyone is a millionaire and can afford to spend 500 EUROS on a game. I repeat i am perfectly fine spending 50 EUROS on a game (buying it outright) but I won't be someone's milk machine.			",30,3,3,4,46,0,10

												i want to play this but they need to change there pay to play strategy. they need to add a base price that dosent expire and where i can earn items. id pay $40 to be able to have a base playable game with friend(you cant play multiplayer unless someone is a paying monthly customer). its done to feel like a cash grab and its only for the rich. you can easly pump hundreds of $$$ into this game and probly $1000 if you have it and it still asks for a monthly fee. is this the way gaming is gona go? thanks to people who buy there way through games like farcry(paying real $$$ to get weapons and advance instead of earning it by playing through the game) companies have found this to be a way of doing business and its robbing people blind.       if we stop buying it they will stop doing it.

												Looking a gift horse in the mouth is your passion? Welcome to the review section of theHunter:""home of the reviewing cheeky brats""I´ve just browsed those negative reviews and looked for some criticism beyond the popular ""mememeeep, but it´s labeled free and there´s stuff I´d have to pay for"". The devs gave a lot more content to those free-players in the last weeks (at least 5 free species with a weekly rotation, enough weapons to hunt everything, special competitions for non-members) and all new reviews still concentrate on ""not free to play""!It´s remarkable that giving the basic access to a game away for free is leading to bad reviews. Most reviewers got less than 50 hrs ig and are just annoyed that they aren´t gifted the complete package. We are talking about steam users. The concept to pay for games isn´t exactely unknown on steam. Take Fallout 4: just to try the game you have to pay 50 bucks and if you don´t like it it´s a case of tough luck. It started in November 15 and until now there´s DLC for another 70 bucks to be bought. To enjoy the whole game you´ve got to empty your wallet regularly. Any complaints about that rip-off in the review section? No, since you´d have to admit that you´ve paid 50 bucks just to witness that you´re excluded from large parts of the game until you pay 70 more bucks.10 days ago the devs of theHunter released a patch that solved a lot of problems. Since then the game´s been running stable (even with 4k settings). They add plenty of content on a regular basis and since the free animals are changed weekly, even the for-free-players can enjoy that content. All that AND being the best hunting simulator on the market is obviously not enough to get comprehensible reviews on steam. I´ll suggest that they should take 50 bucks for the package that´s free at the moment in order to get great reviews from satisfied consumers!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The actual game isn't bad. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is good, but a little slow, and there are a lot of animals to hunt. The biggest problem is that the game has been developed as though it's an ipod app. Even though the game is free, to be able to do anything other than shoot deer with the most basic gun. you have to be investing about £5 per month into the game. This is annoying as it could be a good game, if they made more of the content useable for the people that just want the game for free and not have to invest more money into it.			",72,7,4,10,23,1,5

												If you are looking for a ''real'' hunting experience, this is probably the best game out there, without a doubt. This is not like Cabela's hunting games, where you massacre animals with assault rifles and machine guns, this is a realistic hunting experience. This game actually offers a real hunting experience, where you have to track down animals, and when you get your first kill or track down an animal that you have been searching for in hours, you actually feel like you have achieved something.Sadly, this game, in my opinion, fails at its F2P model. If you actually want to hunt all sorts of animals you will have to invest some money into the game, otherwise, There is only one type of animal that you can hunt. It feels more like a demo than a free to play title, this is sadly what scares a lot of people away. But if you can cope with the F2P model, and are willing to invest money into the game, this game is amazing.			",24,6,0,7,2,0,1

												This is hands down the most realistic hunting simulator available today. It's not easy and it's not cheap. But nothing even comes close in the hunting game genre. Yeah, it gets negative reviews from people who either have no clue about hunting or can’t afford the game. But it's an awesome game if you like to hunt or think that you’d like to hunt. The landscapes are immense, detailed, and very realistic. Each of the many maps is a work of art. The sounds are realistic and captivating. I wish it weren’t so expensive to play and maintain membership.  But, once you have all of your favorite gear, the membership fee really isn’t too bad considering what I’ve already said ^^.  If there were something better for less I'd definitely be interested. But I've looked and there isn't. So until then this is my hunting game of choice. It's free to try so why not try it and see what makes this the best hunting simulator available today.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't waste your time, although there is no charge for playing, the amount of gameplay you get (even after buying a subscription package) is minimal. There are very strict (and never explained) regulations on what you can shoot with what type of bullet (to be bought for extra currency you need to buy, or earned via a method that is never explained). If you're looking for an enjoyable experience, drop some money on a proper hunting game, unless you like getting messages from 'Doc' about the long list of ammo you're allowed to kill things with.

												I love playing this game. I don't love having to open my wallet for every single piece of content that the game contains. You have to buy the weapons, the ammo, anything else you can think of, and you have to buy eM in groups of 500, which is the worst way of doing it for everybody but the developers. I'm all for paying for certain content, think Rise of Flight or Iracing, but this is way worse then any of those. Buying a car or something that took ALOT of time to create is one thing, but having to pay for something that really should just be a part of the stock game... It's a cash grab, and its a sin because its ruined what could be a very fun game.			",49,5,8,6,24,2,14

												I had heard that the game was a poor excuse for a free-to-play, but I still decided to give it a try.  And, in my honest opinion, it is a really cool game.  The visuals, sounds, and atmosphere are great, it's a game that's relaxing to play, and it's cool to simply explore the areas.  But I cannot recommend it to anyone and have decided to stop playing myself because it really is the most incredibly money-grabbing game I have personally ever seen, especially for one that claims to be free-to-play.  You can't hunt almost any animals without spending money or earning a lot of the in-game currency, you can't get new weapons without spending money, you can't get get ammo without spending money or earning a large amount of the in-game currency, and you can't get almost any (if any) other equipment without spending real money.  And missions, what seem to be the main way of earning in-game currency, are incredibly limited in what you can actually do without spending money on the game.  It even claims to be multiplayer, but you can't host that to do with friends without spending money on the game either.  I wasn't even able to participate in their Halloween event without buying some form of weapon and/or ammo.  If the developers decide they actually care about their players instead of milking as much money as possible I'd gladly come back to the game, but not until then.			",74,7,0,20,0,0,8

												Not a very good F2P game. You can only hunt Mule Deer and Rabbit without buying a monthly subscription or paying real money for licenses. Although multiplayer is available and is a great option for friends, it is still a hunting game geared towards single player. Why this is a subscription-based game is complete non-sense. I've played everything from the Deer Hunter series to Cabela, Trophy Hunter, etc, all of which were great hunting games that you purchased once. To try to justify server costs would just ridiculous. They are using the wrong sales platform for this game.			",305,47,9,48,21,6,46

												This is easily the best hunting game around. It isnt free to play entirely, but even with a free account you can have fun.

												Love this game, the only reason so m any people hate it is because it says free to play and it isn't. I would urge the makers of the game to remove its free to play status and just be honest. It is limited for free to play and it's mostly a pay to play game. With that being said, I'll continue with why I love the game.It is an EXCELLENT pay to play game and literally the only online game I have subscribed to aside from World Of Warcraft when I was younger. Me, my buddy and my girlfreind spend hours at a time stalking and killing Elk with the amazing tracking system and the detailed injury system, allowing you to see exactly what organs you've hit on the animal after you collect the kill. This helps you to make a more precise and fast kill the next time, eventually leading you from shooting wildly at the animal and tracking it forever, to shooting the animal exactly where it's vital organs are, killing it in one swift killshot. This get's even better when you use weapons that are silent like bows or crossbows, enabling you to kil animals quick and silently without alerting others in the heard they are travelling with. I've taken doiwn 4 or 5 animals in one silent swipe with my buddy before, making tandem kills and picking the off animals lagging behind the rest of the heard.I also enjoy that there are many different ways to earn the in game real money currency ""em$"". Aside from spending your cash on it, you can also earn it by completing competitions, which with a free memebrship can be very difficult, but with just the basic package, it allows you to kill nearly all the animals (with the exception of a few that require specific equipment) and take part in most competition with at least some chance to achieve victory if you are really dedicated enough. You can also earn ""em$"" by completeing simple tasks such as filling out surveys, downloading apps onto your phone (tha can be immediatly removed) or registering to a website and confirming an E-mail. I've earned well ove 10,000 em$ through this process and although I have spent real money on the game, if I really wanted to, I could just keep completeing these tasks to earn whatever guns or equipment I wanted.Finally I'll talk about the dev team. With regular updates, bug fixes and new features being added to the game, it really feels like you're paying into the development of the game. New areas, new animals to hunt and just recently the addition of hunting dogs, really lets you know that the dev team is working hard to bring you new and exciting features for the game.Many people are turned off by the amount of money that can be dropped on the game, and I can see where the concern comes from, but this is one of the best hunting games I've ever played and although I hope they change their pricing model some day, I'm willing to pay for the amazing features in this game right now, given the quality of it.Edit: Also I should mention that the price of being able to hunt all animals is very low (in my opinion anyway). The first 3 month will cost you $5.66 a month and give you a pump shotgun which will allow you to hunt literallly every animal in the game. If you feel like doing missions until you can buy the single shot shotgun with the unpaid currency (Gm$) than you could pay for a 3 month membership for $3.66 a month and be able to hunt every single animal in the game. Since it gives you unlimited ammo you can hunt as much as you want during that time and it wont be a problem. Keep in mind that you can win competitions to get the paid currency, but they can be quite difficult to rank in. Also, people seem to have a problem with the amount of game hours I have in the game so I'll explain why I have so many. If you leave the initial ""thehunter"" browser open, steam counts you as in game and thus you get a billion hours in a week if you leave it open. I leave my browser open nearly all the time since me my buddies and my gf play so often, and so I can get the latest news they have updated the game with. So if you think it's sketchy that I have so many hours in the game, it's literallyn just because I leave the main browser open.			",91,18,0,8,21,0,18

												Ok then - theHunter. It's rivalling in terms of hours played my other big favourite of the moment, DayZ, and I'd like to tell you why.Firstly I am a real life hunter and shooter, but living in the UK access to real weapons and hunting isn't always easy. So when I saw this game for free, I thought it's worth giving a go. I haven't seen another game in this niche for 10 years, so I was keen to see what it offers.I'm going to deal with the free to play issue. This game can be played for free. You can access all areas of the reserves straight away, and beautiful they are. Yes you are given two weapons for ffree - a scoped .243 and a 12 bore shotgun, but these two weapons are good for all but one species on the many reserves you can hunt on, and have limitless ammo. In terms of what you can hunt, you are restricted to one species of deer to start with but can also hunt three variants of rabbits plus pheasants for free. Additionally you will get two extra species free to hunt every week on a rotating basisYes there is downloadable content to buy - if you want to - but it's not at all necessary for the enjoyment of the game. I compare it to a well known MMO tank game; you can do it all for free if you want and earn your way to stuff in game play or you can add real money and do it quicker and funner. TheHunter's the same - it gives you the option to use real money if you really want to.Pricing if you want to use real cash? Well it's minimal. Yes there is the option to buy a membership which for me is 8 English pence a day giving me licenses for all animals on the reserves plus free reloads of ammo. In terms of £ spent to hours played, as I have bought some extras, I'm on about £40 for over 200 hours, and I can see the hours going up and the £ spent staying at about £40. Considering I was charged £1 to aprk for 30 minutes today in town, I don't find this bad value for money at all.Game play and graphics are ok - I do find it very immersive with TrackIR and Dolby 7.1 headphones. 60fps at highest graphic settings doesn't strain my middle of the road desk top PC.What makes this game a challenge is that stalking and fieldcraft are probably more important than the shooting element. This is not some sort of immersive shooting gallery. Game can be elusive, wary, spookable, and even dangerous. If all you require is a game to blast holes in things try Sniper Elite.The only downside for me is that the designers have had to make some gameplay approximations and simplifications which make the game less realistic, and less of a challenge. The most notable one for me is that the rifle trajectories are effectively flat, and range finding isn't really part of the game as your encounter ranges tend to be well under 50 metres. There's no wind effect on the shot either, so real life skills of range finding, usind hold over for range, and allowing for the wind don't appear here which is a shame.Game play summary: you will spend a lot of time walking slowly from cover to cover straining your ears and eyes for the signs of animals which you can then track and if you get it right you will eventually see them and get in a position to shoot. A critic called it a walking simulator - sounds like he was a poor hunter as stealth is the key.So thinking of trying it? Well all you have to lose is the download time to your disc. If you like the first couple of hours you'll probably decide to splash a little cash for a basic membership to give you quicker access to hunting species other than the free mule deer.I've seen a review below where someone makes out that if you want to play the game you need to buy this and buy that and the sums run into large amounts of $. It's not so. You do not need to buy every bit of kit in the game - one shotgun with its birdshot, buckshot and solid slug will let you take on every single species on the map.So that's it for me. It is a good hunting simulator. There is Gucci gear available for real £ but you can do a lot with a very little £. You can do massive amounts with no £ at all as long as you accept: a) you need to work your way up the game to earn in game currency b) you need to use the right skills to do this - play like a CoD buffoon and you'll never succeed c) that people with real £ can buy goodies if they want to without stopping the game being free to play d) that there is no 'win' in this game other than the satisfaction you get from hunting with skill			",13,1,0,0,7,0,5

												I tried it, having not listened to the other reviews, and I am sorry to say that this game is NOT worth it.For starters, there's no Tutorial. The game tosses you in without any little hints and stuff.Second, You can't hunt anything unless you have a permit for it or the game's membership.There's also the fact that the running and several of the controls are just completely whack.Oh, and did I mention that your character holds the ""sniper rifle"" butt against the middle of their chest and hold the stock like some wand? Because the stock CLEARLY DOESN'T go against your shoulder.Next, the graphics are Playstation 2 style. They're outdated and poorly done. I know, graphics don't make up a game, but it's still a factor.The controls are slow and it's basically very amateur and a sad attempt.			",41,2,0,5,1,0,3

												After the apocalypse, Steve and his family moved to the coast of Norway. All was good and well until the family ran out of food supplies. Steve, who had worked in an office before the apocalypse, didn't really know how to use a gun, and had never killed an animal. But his family was starving, so he decided to give it a shot. Steve found an old rifle and som bullets in the cabin where they were living, and set out to find some food.He hadn't been searching for long, when suddenly a wild boar appeared. Steve laid down, pointed the hole-y end towards the animal, and pulled the trigger.  Nothing happened.  He was shocked at first, but later realised that the gun didn't want to cooperate beacuse he DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THING. Dissappointed, Steve set out to find some other animal. After a while a Peasant appeared.  Steve pointed the gun towards it, and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened again. HE DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL PEASANTS. No matter how he tried, Steve couldn't find an animal that he owned the license to kil..  After a couple of days he was awfully thirsty, hungry and stressed out. That gun started to look very very compelling.He pointed it towards his head, pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. HE DIDN'T OWN THE LICENSE TO KILL HIMSELF. Instead he decided to jump of a cliff, and shortly after that his family starved to death. THE END.Seriously though, are there any animals that you're actually allowed to kill in this game? Havent found any yet, and it's annoying me to death :P			",68,6,3,5,7,0,3

												PRELUDE: If you're mature and appreciate high quality games continue reading. The rating on the review is because of immature idiots who want everything for free - got nothing to do with the game. If you're a spoiled immature brat wanting more handouts to go with your welfare cheque, mark it down and ♥♥♥♥ off. Don't bother with entitlement whining in the comments, I'll just kill it...oo00oo..Now, the game.- GRAPHICS -This is gorgeous. A 6.00am start at Redfeather had me mesmerised. There are some placing issues, grass and trees above ground etc. but it's really only aesthetics and does little to detract gameplay. With my trusty 670gtx/i7/8Gb rig this game shines with only minor fan speedup when scene changing. A steady 60fps with only minor tearing (I haven't bothered changing the default yet so could probably be sorted easily enough).Very easy to look at and the animalation (now there's a word) is very attractive. Slightly robotic at times but hey, if we had 500,000 vectors to plot per animal we couldn't play without a Cray.- SOUND -There could be a little more control over some of the ambients, eg: ocean waves, as sound is a critcal and tactile sense in this game and some of it gets over the top. Rain, wind etc. is good and animal calls, while lacking in some bearing seperation, is true to form.And the guns? Wow. Crank it people. It might take 2 hours of tracking before you fire but I get great delight hearing the .308 reverb off the valley walls. My kids, avid fans all, bounce off their chair! The bang-ratchet-bang of the pump action while pheasant shooting is as sweet as.(Err.... an 11.00pm .308 shot scored me some wife-wrath so headphones people!)- GAMEPLAY -If holding shift + W is your only way to get somewhere this is NOT your thing. If the destination is more important than the journey or you're expecting a gluttony of ""shootables"", DO NOT BUY.This requires patience and lots of it, much of it is tedium. This is hunting. You are a hunter. Stealth. Cover. Shadows. Crouching. Camoflauge. Downwind. ALL of this comes into play.  I've even suggested on the forums that you need to move like YOU are the hunted for best results. Animals, particularly those munched on by predators have an uncanny sense of smell and hearing. And it IS fascinating to watch animals through a scope pausing, sniffing and treading lightly. ""Wary skittishness"" has been modelled beautifully and really adds to the sense of the hunters plight... Let's face it, we're blundering lunkheads in natures true arena and you'll pay the price for it.-Shooting. In RL, I have probably loosed close to 10,000 rounds. Mostly night shooting for foxes and roos. As a staunch user of the .243 in that era I took great delight in how well this acts, sounds and plays like a .243 ingame. I can ""feel"" the shoulder kick and smell the powder. (I know, it's psychosomatic but you get what I'm saying....)Scope tracking is well mimiced and looking downrange for a headshot @ 150m is frustratingly difficult. Zoom capabilities are also true-to-form in that higher zoom will produce greater scope movement. Nice work in this department. Note that there are many scopes, sizes and types, many aimed (yck yck) at quality shooting and range judgement.- The shotty is divine albeit a rather blunt instrument. - The .30 is popular and goes off like a firecracker on steroids.- The Anshutz .308 -a spend money on it- gun has just entered my inventory and is a darling to use. I linked it up with a 9x50 and I'm REALLY loving this outfit.I've made mention on the forums that I'm concerned that there is no score rewards based on target range despite the obvious (monetary) push to high-quality equipment. In my view this is wrong, both ingame and economically. My weapons and equipment need to be valuable to me but there is no reason to use anything other than a 12 gauge with the right ammo for the kill. Why charge up to $15 RL money for a gun and scope that counts towards.... nothing?-Animal TrackingI like the way this has been done. It's very difficult to mimic the senses from a 3D enviroment in a 2D rectangle and yet this gives a sense of tracking success with target sighting as the eventual reward. The kill itself does become secondary on the harder to track species and I've once or twice found myself shooting only a photo and simply walking away. Seriously.-CompetitionsGood fun and ultimately (at least for me) is the reason I play. Nope, I haven't won any as I write but I've got close. The planning and dedication required to win a trophy is high level stuff and really needs to be worked at. I'm loving them. Soon.......- GENERAL -In the interests of brevity I'm going to mention the words achievements (LOTS of them), missions, multiplayer, XP building all in the one sentence. The reasons will be quite obvious. You gotta pay to play, not a real lot, and it's worth every cent.- UI - In a sentence on the launcher windows. Messy. Clunky. Confusing. EW. Get someone on this. Rule of thumb, evaluate your UI on your grandmothers. If they're confused it's bad OK?  Even ingame I find some ""habit formed clicking"" breaks on some changes to equipment. ..oo00oo..- SUMMARY -CONSTedious at times with all that walking.Could ultimately cost quite a bit.UI.Scoring is errr.... pointless. (pun intended)As an Aussie, I find it filled with Americanised hunting claptrap and hyperbole. Less Greenpeace and more hunting is needed, it's a GAME :)PROSAwesome sound/graphics on good/high-end systems.Great immersion and true-to-life animals and in particular their behaviour.Good choice of weaponry and associated peripheral match-ups.Provides a very real sense of hunting.If you're an RL hunter but can't get out enough. GET THIS. No question.9/10 (amended score and review*)gg*Amended review to reflect continued use. 1000+ hours now and still immersed. Heavily. :)			",35,16,5,7,31,1,11

												Take a tideous walk through nature. Encounter tons of animals you can't hunt. Find trails that lead off into the boundaries of the play-field. Pay for features not in the free version that might help you bag something. If you're looking for a reaslistic hunting game, this isn't it. It fails to capture the fun and enjoyment of hunting in the woods.  ",346,58,4,29,24,1,37

												This is a somewhat lengthy review, so if you're looking for a simple answer, this game may not be for you, or you may want to look at other reviews. Let's be super clear about what this game is, and what it isn't:What it is:1) The most realistic hunting experience to date (IMO).2) Offers a plethora of options, weapons, locales, and equipment.3) Beautiful, even by today's standards. It's starting to show it's age, but still has wonderfully beautiful moments.4) Content is updated weekly, with new equipment, animals, new locations, etc., added regularly as well.5) Enjoyable, with patience. The game mostly calms me.6) Offers a fun multiplayer experience, including competitions and cooperative play.7) A free game, that allows you to hunt some species, and are given a few weapons to help you get along. There are weekly rotations on animals that non-members can hunt.8) A membership service for a larger experience.9) The free version is essentially a demo.What it isn't:1) A game that allows you to hunt everything, with all the equipment, etc., without spending money.2) A pay to win game. Winning is only in the eye of the beholder. You're generally only competing with yourself.3) A game with a low learning curve.4) Perfect.I've put over 500 hours into this game, and likely a few more hundred if you include my time spent in the game prior to transferring it to Steam. I feel as though I might have a complete view of this game, flaws and all. This game certainly has it's flaws, some of which stem from it using an older gaming engine, some of which stem from a team switch (probably some legacy code), and some of which stems from a misunderstanding of the payment model. Simply put, when you get this game for free, you're given a limited amount of items and weapons, and can only hunt a limited amount of species. To some, this may seem like a pay to win game, but there is no ""end-game,"" and ""winning"" is subjective at best. About being a new player, this game requires an investement of time. First, you have to learn what the game is trying to teach you (there's plenty of tutorials, videos, etc., available to help you understand some of this). The developers sometimes keep rather quiet about certain aspects of the game, such as where animals spawn, etc., but this is purposely done to keep you guessing, and never 100% sure about the mechanics of the game. This keeps the game lively, and allows you to learn from others. Many of my conversations with other players center around the best spots for hunting, and other unknowns, with a large amount of incorrect information. I don't mind this, because as I said, it keeps the game interesting, and even after this many hours, I'm still learning.Seeing the game advertised as free, then realizing you can't hunt everything in the game can put a lot of people off. I place blame on the way the game is marketed, but if you enjoy hunting game experiences, don't let this put you off. You do NOT need a membership to enjoy the game, although you're going to be limited to a few species, and two species that are rotated weekly. You get free ammo for the weapons you get as a non-member. You can hunt on any reserve, but are limited in the species you can legally hunt. In order to unlock the game fully, you must get yourself a membership. Alternatively, you can purchase licenses as a non-member to hunt specific species. If you purchase a firearm, you will have to purchase ammo for it. As I said, this can be daunting, and put new players off. Let's talk about memberships. A basic membership allows you to hunt all species, on all reserves, for a period of time. This will also allow you to get free replenishment on ammo for all weapons you own. Some memberships last for up to a year, which means if you pay into this game, you'll eventually be paying to upkeep your membership (I pay about $30 a year my membership). Some memberships come with equipment, which help you get started, and are cheaper than trying to buy the equipment indivudually. Once you have purchased equipment (via membership or otherwise), you always keep it. Some of the equipment is centered on equipment bundles for species, such as ducks, etc. It's up to the user to decide which membership they want. Let's talk about equipment. As a new member, you're given some basics, which is helpful for most deer species. You're give a rifle and a shotgun, which allows you to hunt anything in rotation or that comes with a non-member. Should you upgrade, the weapons you have allow you to hunt everything except one or two animals species. Everything else in this game is entirely optional. Many of the firearms are redundant (same weapon, different or unique skins). Some weapons are better for certain types of species, such as the .22 (useful for rabbits, geese, etc.), while others such as the .370 are excellent for very large game. There are decoys, dogs, blinds, stands, and all sorts of items that can be optionally used in your hunts. Some of this equipment makes it easier to hunt a particular species, such as a duck caller, and a blind, but they are not essential to getting them. These items cost money. Again, this can be daunting for new players, because there are so many species, and so many items. Certain memberships provide you with everything you need to hunt the vast majority of species with ease. If you were, however, to buy everything in the game, especially if it's not on sale or in a bundle, you're going to drop a huge amount of money (perhaps upwards of a thousand U.S. dollars or more).Buying items should only be done in the long term, when you realize your issues in hunting specific species. It requires you to invest some time, and to educate yourself so you get the best bang for your buck. It's part of the reason why this game has a high learning curve. In this way it mimics real life to some extent. You wouldn't use a bleat deer caller, for example, to call a moose. Throwing money at the issue won't assist you in becoming a better hunter, but time and patience will. Spend your money wisely, if you choose to spend money.When I first purchased a membership with this game, it was prior to Steam, but there was only one map, and a limited number of weapons. For me, over the years, I have been able to attain everything simply because it's within my gaming budget. I spend less on this game than what I would spend on buying other games during a month, and it keeps me coming back because of the high diversity, skill, and serenity the game provides. If you're someone going after achievements, you may be frustrated, and I would say this game isn't for you. As I said, this is about the long term. If, however, you have a lot of patience, and are looking for a deep hunting game experience, I highly recommend this game. There is just simply nothing else out there that can do what this game does.			",33,9,2,2,9,0,2

												Okay, where do I start with this?? I am going to start out saying that this will be my first lengthy review about any game in my Library. Why?? Because I feel like this game is NOT getting fair feedback looking at the overall reviews. Even when you read the Posotive Reviews of this game, NO ONE sheds light into what this game is AND why they rated it a Positive. And I hope that this review will ease your mind into actually giving this game a try, and finding out for yourself that the reviews either consist of .....1. People who does not have a job as of yet, want to play the best hunting game around, but can not afford this.2. Trolls just hating on the game because of the Free to Play aspect of this game and NOT the overall game itself3. People that has a COMPLETE wrong mindset of the Pay to Play factor and NEVER even tried to pay to play the gameand that I will go into bigger detail about those factors and why the review score is Mostly Negative because of those 3 points. In the process, I will also clarify a few things for anyone reading this review, and I hope you stick around to read it all. I promise it will be worth while, and that it will change your mind towards things to actually give this game a shot. Because, I was just like you (The Reader) at the start of it all, and also just like you (The Reader) my reaction to this game, the reviews and the Pay to Play factor just drove me away from this game COMPLETELY. When in the end, all that was needed to enjoy this game to full, was $49.99. How is that for Pay to Play??Okay, now for the actuall review.I will go as far as to say that this is the best hunting sim I have ever played, even though I was sceptical at the start because of the whole Pay to Play aspect of the game. At the time I HATED this game because it was Free to Play, but I cant even shoot anything in the game, because everytime I want to shoot, it tells me I need a license for this and license for that. I just got mad, and at the moment I felt like this game is the biggest pile of crap I have EVER played. Who even plays a crap game like this AND pours money into it?? What is this, another World of Warcraft??Till one day, I just felt like wasting money, and decided to waste money onto this game, because why not?? I went to the store page of this game's Launcher, and I went to purchase a Membership. Looking at the options I had, I decided to go with the Trailrunner Subscription ($49.99), which gives me a 12 month (Year) Membership to shoot what I want, where I want AND to ease me into the game, I got 9 extra Weapons to start off my game AND 35 other items to accompany me. Ranging from scopes for my 9 Weapons, Cammo, Lures, Backpack and much more usefull items. Eager to start out the game AND still keeping in mind that there is still MUCH MORE to purchase in the game store than what I got with my Subscription, I started a new game, and made due with what I had for the time being. The game started up and the hunt was on. With my lure at hand and my trusty .300 (Gotten from Trailrunner Subscription) I was determine to shoot some Deer.I set out with my trusty HunterMate, and I started learning the game and what goes for what. My first encounter was a Turkey. I went to the location of the Turkey call, and saw the tracks. My HunterMate told me in which direction the Turkey has fled, and I just follow along the path. The path led me through the Forest and Swampland areas, and I was soon greated with a Deer Grunt Call in the distance. It was at that moment I paused in my tracks. I took a crouching position, I got my Lure ready, and I called the Deer in. Sitting in the bush, looking left and right past the trees, through the bushes I am trying to find the Deer AND be as quite and low profile as I can get .... at the same time worrying about a stupid Turkey ....I saw the Deer peeking he's head over the scrubs infront of me, I bring up my .300 to scope .... I line up my shot and I just let it go. The Deer fell on the spot and I jumped with joy. I went to collect the Deer and I was happy with what I got. I went back to the tracks of the Turkey, and continued my journey.Its been a year later, and what was once a piece of crap game to waste money on, is now the best game I ever wasted money on. Funny how that works right?? Its also been a year later, and I only spend $49.99 on this game since then. Yes, you read that right. After one whole year, the Trailrunner Subscription for $49.99 was AND is all you need to enjoy this game to the fullest. I now renewed my Subscription for another year which is now $34.99. I used the other $15 and I bought myself more Lures to use on for the other animals, and I still only use my weapons and equipment I got from my Trailrunner pack. NEVER bought anything extra than what I got for spending $49.99 on this game.If you have sticked with me up until now in my review, I am sure you are now more convinced to actually try this game out INSTEAD of just looking at the Pay to Play factor and relying on the Review System of Steam.In general, all you EVER need to play this game is the Trailrunner Subscription. NOTHING more and NOTHING less. The other items you can purchase is just for better convinience and a better overall gameplay to make your life easier. In truth, the Weapons and Items you get in the Trailrunner Subsciption is MORE than enough to play this game to fullest of experience.Pros.1. Great Gameplay2. Great Hunting Sim3. A lot of Game Reserves to choose from4. Each Game Reserve has its own Game and Hunting tactics to adapt5. Overall very good hunting experience6. New Game Reserves was added (with Game) and is still being added (with Game)7. The game offers a level up system for each Weapon and Animal the more you use your Weapon and Track an Animal8. The game offers multiplayer where you can hunt with your friendsCons.1. Game engine is a bit out dated2. Devs does not seem to listen to its already small community to improve on overall user experience3. The controlls are kind of clunky and stiff, but you get use to itPutting it all together to sum it up. Purchase the Trailrunner Subscription ($49.99) and try this game out for yourself. Do NOT purchase the other subscriptions as you will not enjoy the game to the fullest, and they dont offer you as much gain as the Trailrunner Subscription does. Thats all you will EVER spend on this game in your life, and as you play the game, you will soon relise that you gave the game a unnecessary hard time BECAUSE of the overall Steam Review AND the fact that it is Pay to Play.Thank you for sticking with me the whole time through my review, if I helped you out, dont forget to click ""YES"" on ""Was this review helpfull"". And put your own positive review on this page.			",330,65,16,30,25,8,20

												The title ""free to play"" gets abused allot lately.theHunter is a good example of this. Once playing theHunter you will realize you are not playing a F2P game, but you are playing a demo. Yes you get to play with a starter gun, get unlimited basic ammo and you can shoot mule deer but that does  only scatch the surface of what game is available. That content you will see prancing around you as you are powerless to engage these creatures.Mechanics in the game like ethic hunting (not shooting a bunny with a 50. cal) are warped or solely exist to force the player into a pay to play model.Multiplay hosting is tied into a member subscription. Making you reliant on the scarce and mostly unstable starter area servers. The MP client is tied into a peer 2 peer model reminiscent of oldentimes or grand strategy or RTS games, halting everybodys client if one player is having a connection issue. The server browser is pulls uncomplete list and is severly lacking in search options.Trying to earn EM (Currency) points through the games disgusting partner ""task sites"" full of adware and survey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is not a good idea. 3/4 of the time they site will not pay out its ems like promised. but it can be fun trying to get some point with fake personal information like some sick game of minesweeper.The only good thing about this game has to be the trill of the hunt and your success in the field after considerable effort.4/10 ♥♥♥♥♥ adicting yo, and they want all your monies.

												Graphics, animals and surroundings are beautiful, but this game is not really free to play.  Here is how my game experience went. Started my hunter's day at 06:00 and began walking, 30 minutes later I track a pheasant, but I have no license to hunt it.  35 minutes in I track White Tail deer, no license, poop.  50 minutes of walking I track coyote, no license, oh come on!  Then after an hour of walking I track a Mule deer, got a 12 point buck in my sights and one shot one kill later I could not find any more Mule deer to track or hunt, just animals I do not have licenses for since I do not have a membership to unlock them, so I uninstalled.  This game is a nice hunting simulator, but falls short when it comes to f2p variety of huntable animals.			",122,12,1,25,6,0,20

												It was a really disappointing game to play. I had such high hopes for this game but was severly disappointed. The animations are quite primitive, the AI mechanics are unrealistic and just in general a bad game.10/10 would not recommend.			",48,3,0,3,3,0,1
