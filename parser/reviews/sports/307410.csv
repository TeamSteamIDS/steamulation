												Technically, the game looks like a PS2 game, with a 4:3 aspect ratio and no options whatsoever.Maybe the intention is good but... no. The game is not fun. People don't play a game which isn't fun.			",479,133,33,41,65,7,45

												The game itself is not bad. But there's no options for controls or graphics whatsoever.			",1469,420,125,86,261,22,172

												I cannot reccomend this game. The controls are shoddy, the fights are short and pointless and I find the entire game to be an insult to Capoeira. I would understand if the game was in PreAlpha, but it has been around for about 2 years before coming to Steam so the windo for improving it has been open for a long time. The only reason I can see for this pile of rubbish being released is to coincide with the world cup being held in Brazil. double thumbs down from a very disappointed fan of Capoeira			",488,152,11,24,47,7,16

												First off I actually like the game and enjoy playing, the fighting itself is a bit different from most games like this as in it is more strategy than button mashing. You have no health rather it is it like a tug o' war and you need to balance not getting tired.The reason for the the thumbs down is the lack of any graphic options even basic resolution. There is also no key remapping or controller support.			",113,28,4,39,47,4,23
