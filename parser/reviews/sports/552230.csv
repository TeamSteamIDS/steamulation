												This game is pretty fun. I was surprised when I found out you had to jump in the game, something that is super challenging and on the fringe of frustrating, however. Be prepared to get a work out with this one. There is lots of crouching, jumping and just moving around in general. The visuals are not all that impressive, as the lasers look more like red Liquorice than they do laser beams.I can still recommend the game as it is something different and the first of its kind (I am unaware of any other laser dodging game). One could argue for perhaps a cheaper price too, maybe $5-7.My overviews:

			Laser dodging has never been this much fun! Or tiring... I was surprised to find out that you even have to jump in this game!

												Such a simple idea, but there is really some fun in this game.+ Simple idea+ Graphics are ok+ Nice exercise (not as exhausting as Holopoint)- Could have more levels, there is content for 2-4 hoursThis is the first VR game I played where jumping is part of the game. A great idea, but... I stood on the cable smashing the headset on the floor. And several times the headset fell from my head. I rammed the controllers into the ceiling. My neighbours beneath me asked what I was doing. So my final points:+ Vive is really stable, can be smashed onto the floor- Jumping in VR games, is not a good idea-> All in all: it's worth 10$, I would buy it again.			",29,16,0,9,14,0,11
