Yes Its fun for a couple of minutes, but then you realize that actually you can't steer the car correctly, because even a turn makes you fly into the air. After 15 minutes I was able to buy every single upgrade from the shop. There is additional content when you buy through paypal, but who wants to do that? Multiplayer is empty and everything is in development, when I say everything there is only one map available at this moment which have air loop and few obstacles, that's it. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Jet Racing Extreme is a racing game where you get behind the wheel of a jet powered car and race around one of (currently) four tracks. There's not much else to say about the game itself so I'll crack on with the rest of my review.+A fair amount of customisation is available for your car, you can change the paint colour which is pretty basic but you can also upgrade the components of your car as well as fine tune them to create the best vehicle possible+The car's damage models are good and the car breaks apart nicely upon impacts, smashing into things is a big part of the game so this is rather important+Decent sound effects, the car noises are reasonably realistic in particular-Keyboard controls are, as expected of a racing game, bad and despite the dev claiming the game is best played with a gamepad the gamepad controls are quite possibly worse with terribly thought out bindings and no way to change the bindings for the gamepad (keyboard bindings can be changed)-There are currently only four maps available, two of which are just a short section of one of the other maps-The camera occasionally swaps angle randomly and most of the camera angles in the game are completely useless for a fast paced racing game - Seemingly this has now been fixed-The driving and general physics aren't even slightly realistic despite the claims on the store page and in the forums-None of the UI is explained at all making it almost completely pointless-The point system doesn't really work properly, I sometimes got given stunt points for crashing into objects and spinning uncontrollably which doesn't really make sense-A few grammatical and spelling errors, obviously not everyone speaks perfect English but it can't be too hard to get someone to proof-read-Despite not being a mobile port (the devs are planning to port it to mobile however) it does very much feel like a game that belongs on a smartphone or tablet rather than a PC or laptop-The mouse cursor always stays visible, one of my major pet peeves in games-You can't reverse so if you crash into a wall and can't turn out of it you're forced to restart-You can't pause the game! Another of my major pet peeves, seriously it's 2015 and we can't pause our games?-As you can see from the below comment section, the dev really has no idea how to communicate with the Steam community, telling me, among other things, that I'm wrong because I disagree with himVerdict:Avoid it like the Plague (2/10)Jet Racing Extreme is a poor mobile port that fails at what it sets out to achieve, with poor controls, sub-par graphics and a fair few other issues this game is neither worth your time nor money.No drama, Just Reviews.El K.

''I destroyed my car and my keyboard too!''I got this one for free, so I shouldn't complain. However, I will.Jet Racing Extreme is a Trackmania-like game. High speed (not as high as TM tho :( ), tricky physics, loops and obstacles ahead the track and a lot, A LOT of stuff that can induce rage (rage ranging from verbal rants to literally destroying your keyboard with your teeth and then pluging your cat's tail on the usb port to use as keyboard replacement).  At first it looks nice, unity 3D engine well used, decent graphics good modeling (just good) nice textures but It is still in  early access stage, so its not flawless. The lack of car options is a feature that should be fixed asap, though the (still small) possibility of customization fills that hole a little. Same goes for the available race tracks. Sound-wise its not bad, though again it turns to be repetitive and there are no sound options available as for the time of this review is being written (I'd recomend devs, for (._.)'s sake add this urgently!) I always loved to construct stuff, but i like destruction with the same passion, and JRE has it! You can destroy your vehicle in a billion pieces (probably less, but well, sounds more destructive). This is probably the strongest point of the game, and the one that will make me recomend this game.In conclusion: If you are a fan of destruction, then get this game, specially if it is on sale. Note that the destruction of the in game vehicle added to the crazy physics can transfer to PC peripherals, room or car destruction due to rage effects. So, if you can't afford to lose stuff stay away of this and download Trackmania instead.(._.)'s score: 45/100 - ''I enjoyed it for a little while, then i cried myself to sleep''.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ok, good thing first. This is basically ""get from point A to point B in car that can go over speed of sound.""Driving feels crazy, in good way. Graphics looks nice, damage model is great, although in speed you are going to ride in, car basically explodes on every hit.Now problems. - This is mobile port, in worst possible meaning of that. - Some stuff is controllable only by clicking on virtual buttons. - Controls are COMPLETELY broken. Like, brake and nitro is mapped on same key and slightest hit on arrow sends you car spinning around. - ... and don't even think about controller. Not working. - Camera changes mode automatically, in worst possible moments, to worst possible angle. You WILL die because of this, every ***ing time.And worst of all, if you try to speak about this in forum, dev simply deletes thread.Do NOT buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								It's really fun to crash your car, either bit by bit or in a huge explosion. As a car-crashing-simulator this game would get 8/10 from me.However, as a racing sim, this game plays terrible. There are quite a few obstacles on the road that will trash your car on the slightest contact and even without obstacles it is hard to keep the vehicle on the road. You will most likely spend more time flying than actually driving.+ destroying your car is fun+ flying your car across the track is fun- driving ""seriously"" is almost impossible- no background music- bad controls (not just vehicle controls, the whole UI suffers from bad design choices)- no online players			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Right now this seems like a Rocket Car sandbox game rather than an actual race game but for the current sale price of $2.49 it's a pretty fun game. Once you've figured how to map the controls to your joypad (I recommend mapping ""Steering"" to the left stick, ""ThrottleBrake"" to the right trigger, ""Airbrake"" the the left trigger and ""SteeringDirect"" to the right stick ... then don't use the right stick at all), the car is pretty fun to drive and the physics result in some fun stunts and crashes. The graphics are pretty nice and the game runs pretty smoothly for an Early Access title.Overall it's a fun driving game for two fitty, buy it while it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ok this game has so much potential to be really cool but my god it needs a lot of fixing! It seriously has some of the fastest racing I've ever experienced and the crashes are freaking spectacular! The controls however are janky as hell. Keyboard works moderately well but when you try to use a 360 controller its super sensitive and does not control well at all. You can theoretically tweak the car's controls through an option menu in game but this didn't make any difference with the controller and it apparently made the keyboard steering stop working even after I put it back to the default values.So as it stands right now, its fun but frustrating. Though there's still alot of amusement watching yourself crash and burn over and over it does get tiresome when you want to attempt to actually complete a lap. My friend managed it, but I didn't.In another 6 months I think this game will be fantastic and as such, I say jump on the bandwagon early because these developers deserve your money to be able to realize their vision! Just lower your expectations with the current build (Jan. 15th, 2016) and know that its currently a CCC title rather than a AAA. I'm sure it'll improve with a little developer love and community support!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Very fun game, but also very difficult. I find games like this a lot of fun, but this is the best of this type of game that I have found. They managed to make it extremely fun, but also realistic, so going 400 MPH and crashing into a wall actually obliterates your car. Pros: -Extremely fast, and dangerous driving-very good destruction physics-Realistic, but also fun (unlike some games that are too simulater-ish)-a few good but challenging tracks-more tracks to come when out of early access-actual shop where you can buy parts for your car-you can change the look and color of your carCons:-steering can be very wonky, but when you hook a controller up, it's is slightly easier-going too fast will throw you off the track when going around a bend-not many players online (would be better if more people played)-when you crash your car completely, it brings up a sign, sometimes deducting you 100 pointsAt it's current state, the game is well worth the money as you are getting a good amount of content, but the game could be improved on quite a bit (Fix that steering!) hopefully AI will be added in future updates as it would make the game more interesting. The game is cheap, so if your looking for some fun and you don't want to spend too much, buy this now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
