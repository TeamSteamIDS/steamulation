												Just played multiplayer with some random person - so far it's fun and simple to control. Ha I'm already looking up bocce strategies online. Very cool.			",19,14,1,0,13,1,0

												This is a fun, relaxing VR competitive experience.  The game is  easy to understand, and there are instructions for new players.  The physics in the game of throwing the balls works really well.  It's part of the total package that makes you feel like you are on a tropical island playing bocce ball.  I recommend it.
