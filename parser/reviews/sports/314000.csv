Early Access Review
								Pool Nation FX is a Pool Simulation game that can be seen as an improvement to the original Pool Nation. I have a few things to say as to whether or not I would recommend the game or not.Positives:  It looks great. However, having spent so much time in the original game, at this stage in time...1.6 hours... I prefer the look of the original game compared to Pool Nation FX. But perhaps the new look will grow on me over time.  More content. Pool Nation FX features an all-new career mode which is a big improvement from the original Pool Nation. It boasts many new locations and the 'play with skill to win' approach makes single-player pool a joy to play. Snooker is a great feature in Pool Nation. Me and a friend had an enjoyable time and like the other modes, are great.Negatives: I think the speed of the cloth could be adjusted. Perhaps there could be a slider added to the game, or a 'slow' or 'fast' speed option could be implemented. My friend and I were almost always complaining how the speed of the cloth could be better. It is fair, yes, but variety will always be appreciated.  Setting up a game with my friend had been slightly difficult as my friend had a microphone switched on in the lobby but I could not find a way to mute him so I had ended up turning the whole game down in the mixer.  Compared to Pool Nation, aiming and potting has become a lot harder, with or without aim assistance. I wish as I was taking my shot that I could look down the table even further. I have been using the middle mouse button to aim the cue more vertically to line up the cue ball better... however, it is still difficult.I have been looking forward to Pool Nation FX for so long now that I cannot help but want any improvement the game can get. However, the game is great and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Also, thank you so much for the loyalty discount!Thank you, Cherry Pop Games!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dont bother with free, buy the gameSo, first off I am using the free version of the game. I plan to buy it but I wanted to see the game from a free to play perspective first. When I first downloaded it, it was great and yes a lot of things were locked but a few games later I had some cash and was able to unlock some neat stuff.I don’t mind the free model where you unlock things by playing the game, it makes sense that those who play a lot have access to more content.The problem I have is the recent update: After the update a lot of good changes were made but also a VERY bad change was made. They changed the amount of money it costs to unlock many things. I’m not talking a small increase of 1k-2k here I’m talking a pool stick that was 5k is now 40k and the pool room I wanted to unlock for 4k (which I was only 300 away from before bed last night) is now 15k.This change has made it nearly impossible for any free user to make any progress unlocking the games features in any reasonable amount of time. Spending 4 days of grinding to unlock a single pool stick? I’ll pass on that.So, with that aside I would still suggest the game because it is damn fun and just like loading up in a real pool hall you never know who your opponent may be and it’s the challenge to outwit them. Good luck and have fun.-=-UPDATE-=-So, its been a while and i checke dback into the game. Online mode is seriously dead. Only one match up and the match i created saw no action for 20 min.

												Pros:- Sequel of Pool Nation, the best pool game in the planet, with more game modes.- Unreal Engine 4- Developers support and give attention to everyone in Steam forums- Unlimited FPSCons:- Campaign is very repetitive. The bonus matches are always the same, regardless the stage or game mode- AI sometimes is insane and impossible to win. This should be fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Pros:The game is very pretty.The balls behave well and there seems to be a lot going on in the physics part.Trick shots!No need to Chalk up.Can unlock vanity items using ingame currency instead of cash.Cons:Lite version of the game is basically nothing.Full version of the game is carved into Offline and Online, requiring two purchases. Why?Lite version of the game is practice 9-Ball...By yourself.If I wanted to play with a stick by myself I would probably visit a different website altogether. :P

			So the Unreal engine makes this game look good. Gameplay seems fun. I think they need to work on monetizing it.

												As a ""pool simulator"" it fails pretty horrendously, as a pool game its fairly decent, as an expierienced pool player I can tell you that the physics are fairly inaccurate, missing shots i can easily make in real life and it just does not feel very good, the power bar in my opinion is also not the best representation of how hard you will actually hit the ball and how far it will roll, and as far as the line guide, if you are a decent pool player in real life turn that off immidiately because it does not help at all, it is the worst line guide I have ever seen in a pool game by far, as far as just a pool game it is okay though I do not recommend paying anything for this, it is just not that fun missing shot's easily made on a real pool table, if you like pool games give it a try see if you like it, its always at least worth a try, but as for me I did not have any fun at all, mostly just frustration missing shots I know I can hit easily.

												This game is really a worthy succesor to Pool Nation. The controls are intuitive, the visuals are very impressive, and the new modes are very welcome. Only two real problems with this game, you have to tinker a bit with the graphics to get it to run smoothly, and two which is sorta minor is that they don't list the challenges for each particular match in the pause menu like they did in the original. This is really annoying when you forget them, but it's minor. I think the worst thing the developers could have done to this game is make it free-to-play. This invites the stereotypical freeloading gamers who think they're always entitled a completely free game and review the game negatively.  This is not how commerce works, so get over it! It's a great game for what it is, and ignore the majority of the negative reviews because they don't even bother to review the game itself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't really understand the bad reviews. I played it for several hours and it was great, lot of fun. The interaction with the other players is really easy and I made a new friend in the first few hours. They need to polish the aiming a bit, the camera angle for jump shot could be a lot better, but there is no ""game breaking"" glitch or bug. I suspect most of the ""pro pool players of the internet"" are those bullies super annoying in every pool hall, I wouldn't pay too much attention to their review. There is no ""pay wall"",  I played for 10+ hours without spending a dollar, the new maps and cues you get are really optional. I played the Yahoo pool games for several years and I can tell you this game is a great contender to become the next big thing in the pool scene.Let me break down the pros and cons;Pros: -Insane graphics, could be the best out there for a pool game-Great physic, it's not perfect, but then again, it could be the best physic out there for a pool game!-All the menus/UIs are super intuitive and user friendly-It's easy and quick to find a game, you can really start you game and play a pool game in a few minutes then do something else!-VOIP, it's well made, intuitiveCons: (I will really break down those so the developers know what I'm talking about, and other player will understand I'm not trying to ""demonize"" the game by no mean)-Lobby sucks, no really they do, they offer great amount of information and it's super user friendly, but they are missing lots of options. To my understanding you need the full version of the game to change some of the settings, but they don't tell you ""you can change this one, but you need  X dlc to change that other one"" they expect you to spam your mouse click and find out what's working. I don't like it, the lobby system need a revamp, structure wise no so much, but definitely function wise and we need more information.-The ""open microphone"" is terribly annoying, there is pros and cons to this function, but so far, after tabula rasa, all point bulletin then APB:Reloaded, after rainbow six : siege beta, comon if you build game you must be a gamer, if you are a gamer you already know other companies tried the open mic thing and it's not working, this is not real life and people do things they would not do in public while they are in front of their computers. I don't want to hear a guy beating his wife or farting or sniffing a line of coke while the match is loading because of the open mic.-9 times out of 10 the camera angle is great.  However, when it's wrong, it's hella wrong man... The jump shot and most of the trick shot are super sketchy to do, not because of the difficulty, but mostly because of the added difficulty thanks to the camera angle. In a video game, where you can't move your head around and inspect evereything, I expect they woud put some kind of arrow in the air to help you see where the ball will land after a jump shot. Keep in mind you can press ""O"" in the game to activate the ""overhead view"" which is great and fixing a lot of problem you could have with the game camera.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Early Access Review
								I have Pool Nation and spent many hours playing it and I did highly enjoy it. I never got round to writing a review for it because it wasn't a GOTY or a flop. It was a niche game with quite a nice gameplay.Pool Nation FX takes Pool Nation and adds several bits to it which Pool Nation didn't have but could have done well with.Straight off the bat, a new game has been added: Snooker. The other game modes from Pool Nation are still in FX but so far I can't find 8 Ball UK (which is red and yellow and a 2 shots rule), but 8 Ball is merely cosmetic seeing as rules are now customisable.Menus are suspiciously like Codemaster's DiRT Rally but are more clear to navigate than Pool Nation's.FX is currenty in Early Access which may be a concerning factor, however this does mean that they can do some things which are a bit off. The contols aren't as smooth and nice to handle in Pool Nation (I'm surprised why they didn't copy and paste the controls). Vibration of controllers doesn't actually work. All the icons are for the Xbox One controller (even though both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One controllers are XInput as far as PC is concerned) meaning that users of the ""old"" Xbox 360 controllers might be confused.If you liked the first Pool Nation, FX is for you. If you thought the first Pool Nation was a little lacking, FX fills in the spaces. If you didn't play the first Pool Nation, take a look at FX if you're into Pool/Snooker.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lazy Dev, Broken Game, Broken PromisesDon't bother with leagues. You get 1 loss recorded for every game you enter and 3 losses per loss. It's completely unplayable. The dev doesn't care and won't admit anything.Don't bother with snooker. The physics are broken, and the shot guide doesn't work. Again, the dev doesn't care.Don't bother reading the forums. Every bug somebody posts is taken down and replaced with praise from brand new accounts.Don't bother playing the ""for cash"" games. The game takes your currency, then doesn't pay out when you win. The dev won't admit this issue, even though it's all over the forums.Don't bother changing your settings. The game doesn't remember half of them. The dev won't admit there is a basic issue and won't fix it.Don't even bother playing on practise mode by yourself. WHen you rerack 9/10 times the game crashes.Don't think about multiplayer, either. Half the time people crash out, and the rest of the time in the middle of a shot the game starts forcing you to move in one direction, making play impossible. Oh yes, and don't think the game you think you are joining is displayed correctly, or think that the money the game is worth is correctt. I joined a 100 bet game and lost 2000 after I won it.Performance is shocking, a light years behind the last game whilst looking worse.The menus stutter and lag, with HEAVY mouse accelleration that can't be turned off.Don't bother playing. Cherry Pop, I used to love your games. You should be completely ashamed. You've become the kind of developer that shouldn't be allowed to exist.Update: In March the developer came on and PROMISED IN WRITING to ""personally address every single one of my issues."" It is now mid June, nothing was ever done and the developer has given up on the game and moved onto a spin off snooker game on early access (and we all know what that means)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Pool Nation is back and better than everPool Nation FX quite simply Improves on its predecessor in every way possible. Returning with a deeper career mode youll find yourself traveling around the entire globe competing in various competitions and nationals along the way. The Unreal engine brings the photo realistic locations and tables to life and the physics engine is tweaked and polished to perfection.Snooker makes a much needed appearence and even includes a career mode for when you need a change. Theres virtually every game mode tweak and rule set you could wish for, Online play is flawless and provides a wealth of options to match you skill set. Even the soundtrack is improved.In short Pool Nation FX improves the original in every way and is a game i highly recomend. Buy this game and show the developers your support. An amazing game by an amazing team.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Without paying for DLC you are forced to play online and win games to earn cash or grind 3 years (literally) of daily challenges to open meaningful content.There are not many people making lobbies, and when you open one there is no telling how long will you wait for an opponent. It might be seconds but it might be ten or more minutes.Camera control is not so good, when you wanna check your aim from different angles you will consume a lot of time. For snooker this gets triple longer (about 90 sec for every difficult shot) cos you need to refine your aim very well. This can make your opponents frustrated. And it will make you wait if they are really trying to aim...While this game looks great, plays well, and looks like a very solid development effort, instead of paying for convinience, lot of the game is locked behind paywall in reality.Don't expect free game, expect a demo for free, and if you like it, than pay to unlock it. It might be worth it. But the grind in free version is impossible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
