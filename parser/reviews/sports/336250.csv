												A sincerely bad game.Monster Jam Battlegrounds has 3 modes: Skill Driving, Stadium Events, and Stunt Mode. Skill Driving mode is a copy of Trials (basically time trial mode) but with virtually no ability to control your Monster Truck mid-air. I may have done it on accident once or twice, but the buttons seem overall unresponsive. Seems like the devs didn't even know how to fix this, because your Monster Truck corrects itself whenever you're about to fall over or fall on your roof. The tracks in Skill Driving mode are totally uninspired and dull, with two different routes if you're lucky. There could be three on a few later in the game, but I honestly don't find the game fun enough to play to find out myself. As far as difficulty goes, the game is either very easy or punishingly difficult almost to the point of impossible, going so far as to include an ""expert mode"" which you are able to toggle if you want to rip out your own hair.Stadium Events is what I would want from a Monster Truck game, that I sincerely miss from the first game of its kind: Monster Truck Madness for Windows 95. It's from a 3rd person perspective rather than a psuedo-2d perspective like the wannabe-Trials mode. The stadiums here are just as uninspired as the courses from Skill Driving mode, and the AI you race against has to have some sort of learning disibility, not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but you will not find a challenge in Stadium Events. You will lap them almost every single race if you have patience when you hit your jumps (because if you don't you'll spin out). WHOEVER HEARD OF A MONSTER TRUCK GAME WHERE YOU WANTED TO DRIVE WITHOUT RECKLESS ABANDON?! Not only is it poorly executed from a technical standpoint, but it doesn't even follow the rules of Monster Jam. You may exit the lines on the race-course whenever you feel like it and you will receive no time penalty... not that that would even be a problem, since you could drive around the stadium twice and return to the course and you will still win the race. Anyway... Stadium Events had the right idea, this is what a Monster Truck game should be, not a bunch of gimmicks, but it's done rather poorly here.Stunt mode is just Skill Driving mode but without a time limit or Skill, really. It has such thrilling events as: jump as far as you can, try to land in a specific area after you jump (different from long-jump mode, I promise), and crush as many cars as possible while you go through the course (this is far more boring than it sounds).The Monster Truck selection is rather dull, with alternate paintings (skins) of several trucks appearing, such as three El Toro Locos and three Grave Diggers, with a total of 23 trucks. Why no legacy trucks? Maybe I'm just out of the loop, since I've loved Monster Jam for well over 20 years and many of my favorite trucks have been retired. Something inexcusable is that there is no Bigfoot. Seriously?This is a short game, I would estimate I'm somewhere inbetween 25-33% through with a little over 20 minutes played.Avoid at all costs, even if you love Monster Jam.Looking at the positive reviews it is honestly pathetic how they are so obviously bought & paid. More evidence you should NOT buy this game.			",112,13,3,7,6,1,19

												This is just....Terrible. Terrible track design, specially stunt and skill ones. Stadium events are barebones to the max, you do one lap with 2 turns, and you do it  3 times and that is ""race"". Physics is just appalling, well actually i don't know from which planet it is, cause for sure it isnt the one we live on. ""Car"" spins in the air like its made from some extraterrestial material , that behaves in some super weird fasion, i'm no alien so i just dont understand it. You have ""controls"" that work only when they want and with extraterrestial physics you have some weird results. Most of the time ""car"" will land on its roof and game over, do that crap again, and with mind boggling dumb tracks that is absolutely and utterly painful.And dont let me start with stunt races, cause there you dont know where you have to go to activate some ""zones"" half of the time, and that is some special talent, to make one straight road and put the objectives in such a way that you get lost, man if those morons programed a road map 99 % of the people using it would end in some active vulcano.You will listen voice of some moonshine induced piece of trash d-i-p-s-h-i-t repeating same s-h-i-t over and over again: awesome, great, unbelievable, i hit my wife yesterday in my s-h-i-t-t-y wife-beater shirt...and words like awesome just dont fly in this game, there is nothing good let alone awesome.Music  sucks, its compromised of some sounds that redneck makes while taking a s-h-i-t after chili cook-off, screaming in progress cause mr cook put too much chili sauce in it, and his a-n-u-s isnt taking it all to well.Only good thing is sound of ""cars"" but most likely cause those vechicles dont want to have anything to do with this junk of a game and they are screaming in agonizing pain, regreting the day they were programmed by some sadist programmer that put them in it. I can empathize with them , cause those are some screams that can only be found in nightmares after getting shellshocked in Nam.This game is a mess, the kind of mess blind drunk nuclear reactor operator with no fingers would make. And they are selling it on Steam, its unreal. Its almost like buying a car with exhaust exhausting some vile and puke inducing smell into your nose. You will be able to drive that car, but you wount have best time of your life. Its just not good its TERRIBLE.			",522,221,27,32,31,7,23

												What better way to prove you're a real man then playing a game with Monster trucks... All the excitement of being at a live monster truck show. The crunching of cars, the shattering of glass, and the roar of a huge engine being driven by a 50 year old slightly balding man in a blue jumpsuit... roar... starting this game up I was drawn back to my days as a lad. Watching my 21 inch television, the screen flickering occasionally, looking at huge monster trucks, barreling down a dirt track toward a ramp... hitting that ramp and falling directly on top of 4 or 5 car shells... Crushing them immediately under the weight of the 4 ton monster truck...Starting the game up I was quickly disappointed by the fact the game seems rather bare bones. Although thinking about it, how many different ways can you set up crushing cars..Once started up, you have 3 options to choose from.... You have skill driving (which is pretty much a direct copy of Trials) this requires you to drive around on a locked track, hit ramps where you can do tricks... This works well with a motorcycle, but not so much with a Monster truck.. All the awesome tricks stuffed into Trials aren't present in Monster Jam, instead you just hit the A button and hope you have enough steam to climb the next hill... or when you hit a ramp your truck doesn't flip on it's hood...Arena mode - ahh Arena mode, you race an invisible truck around a track. The track is fairly basic, with one sometimes two ramps, a few cars around. The track doesn't tither you to a straight line as much as skill driving... but... the steering is crap. You feel like you're being held on a string and only allowed to deviate off the destined path slightly or else you lose..Last of all you have Stunt mode, which well i'm guessing it's nearly the same as Skill driving only with points being awarded for you doing stunts?all of them are pretty boring and uninspired. It's just a matter of hitting the drive button, and waiting for the win screen to pop up... Unless you magically flip over your truck and lose... Trust me it's boring..The game play is set up in nearly an identical way as Trials, you advance to harder difficulty settings by getting a set number of stars, stars are rewarded for completing tracks in a timely manner. I guess it could be fun if you are into repetitive game mechanics and boring game play.The only positive aspect of the game was the officially licensed Monster trucks.. the game has 23 officially licensed trucks including some like Grave Digger, which even non Monster Truck fans will recognize. So if you're big into monster trucks maybe consider buying it for that reason.The bottom line is... unless you are a huge monster truck fan, or want to own a game which will eventually be removed from steam (officially licensed trucks) I'd avoid this game. Even if you're a huge fan of Trails, this game won't fill that void, it'll just come across as a cheap knock off trying to cash in on using officially licensed monster trucks..Save your money for something else, unless you can find it for under a buck... then it may be worth it for the Trading cards alone... Surely not worth a full price purchase...			",3667,1526,146,417,520,48,544

												Simple but fun, my kids really enjoy it.  The good part is that it is easy enough for them to enjoy and play.  It's not something that will probably satisfy those who want some high realism  type game.  But I don't think it needs to be.  Not the biggest line-up, but the most popular ones are there, Gravedigger, El Toro Loco, Max D, 3 different Monster Mutts and plenty more.  Bottom line, I think younger fans will really enjoy it.

												On many of the levels, pretty much the only thing you're doing is holding down the throttle button. And when you have full control of the truck, the physics are abysmal. You can spin out going 10 mph. 2/10 may as well be an online game. Go out and buy your lunch instead.			",23,3,18,1,15,0,2

												I wanted to like this game but just can't recommend it as the controls are messy. I have a steam controller so I was able to bind the ""aircontrol"" to the flippers which made some of the game modes rather easy instead of impossible without them. The arena racing is horrible. Game might actually be better without it. So easy to lose control for no reason and the AI opponent has a static time that will never change. If you can get this game cheap and like this type of game, go for it. Otherwise hope that they fix the controls for everyone. Pros: - gameplay is responsive- trucks look fun and take damage- lots of levels and varietyCons:- default controls are bad, missing parts- gameplay gets choppy for no reason, possibly intensional but poorly exicuted if it was- AI is not really existant- levels are easy or still impossible after you fix controls- leveling system is odd. Simply upgrade one truck and be done with it- takes time to realize that the boost and jump buttons don't do anything until you upgrade the truck			",896,291,34,99,89,8,128

												My decision not to recommend this game comes from the high price tag.  With only a couple hours of content before completing the game 100% I've come to have a bit higher expectations in mid 2015.  Not to say I always measure games by their playtime.Visually the game looks like PS2 era which does not help the case.  While the game modes are fun but short, the ones I enjoyed most were the shortest. You are forced to play through them all in campaign earning stars to advance usually achieving highest rank on first try.The stadium mode reminds me of the Monster Jam live events, there are only a hand full of arenas though and a lap is never more than 30s with only 3 rounds to win the event.  The stadium events offer freestyle mode as well which feels like button mashing in a racing game or hurling your truck into jumps to pull of tricks.  The game also has side scrolling game modes in the trials style of balancing front and back as well as speed to make your way through obstacle courses and jump challenges.  An enjoyable adventure but looking ten years old at release, I say again, its hard to justify such a price tag.			",1138,455,88,126,164,17,223

I'm not a fan of the arena style mode, but the 'Trials' style mode is really fun to play. Monster Jam® Battlegrounds brings the ever popular touring show straight to the fans with roaring engines and crushing action. Not only does this game replicate the world renowned Monster Jam stadium and arena events, but it also takes fans out of the stadium and into other environments for physics based skill and stunt challenges. - Recommended!

												I have never been much of a fan of these sorts of games, but given that I've seen them pass by from the Acorn BBC Microcomputer, ATARI game consoles, the PC and just about any platform in between, and I was given a free copy from a friend I though I owed it to him and the genre to give it another try.This game surprised me in that its controls are a lot more subtle than I generally found in most of these games; Usually in a game like this it's assumed a truck can be controlled in mid-air just as easy as an acrobat can... There is still some control but it isn't overly sensitive. Which leads me to the physics, which really shine in this game, even at high speed and the graphics being what they are (awesome in my oppinion), especially when jumping / landing. The music isn't terrible, but isn't great either. It doesn't hurt the general feel or flow of the game.I have had some problems though; Game crash when select Own Score from the Leaderboards after a match, which also prevents me from getting to the Friends Score list. Not much into those online scoring stuff but I can see how others may feel differently.And then there is the incorrect keyboard diagram shown during loading of a level, which marks A and S as movement keys in mid-air, which is kind of misleading (W and D should also be in there, although I never actually found A and D to be doing anything...).It took me a while to figure out how to collect stars (which unlock tracks, arenas and other gamemodes) and the objective in for instance a Jump game; Do I perform stunts, height or distance? Couple of tries before I realized it was distance...Sometimes it does tend to crash for no apparent reason, but the game is saved often enough and it is quite fast in starting back up.All in all a great game, has some issues, but nothing major.

												Monster Jam Battlegrounds does alot right, it has heaps of content, great modelled monster trucks and enough stunts to make your head spin. The attention to detail in the trucks is amazing and the upgradability is awesome. Couple this with the great many tracks across a variety of environments and you have loads to sink into.

												I obtained this in a bundle for really cheap and I still feel ripped off.This is probably the most unsatisfying racing game I've ever had the misfortune of playing.  I thought FlatOut 3 and Glacier 3: The meltdown were bad games, but ooooh boy was I wrong.  The monster truck game for the gameboy was infinitely better than whatever you want to call this.There are 3 modes, 1 copies off of Trials, 1 is a stadium/race/freestyle, 1 is a bunch of minigames: jumping, precision landing, and demolition.For starters, the controls and physics ruin this game.  You can either use manual steering, or some sort of ""mapped"" steering.  I'll return to these near the end.  These two things should've been what they focused on, since this is a ""racing"" game.  Don't mind the ""Mixed"" reviews,  DO NOT.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  If you can get it for free, get it, who cares(unless you're an achievement hunter). This is the WORST racing/car game that I have ever played.Let's talk about ""Trials"" first. Leaning backwards doesn't work.  If you have to lean backwards, lean forwards instead. Every time you hit a jump or hit a little bump, the front of your truck nosedives rapidly and you have no control over when it happens.  Even the smallest of jumps will cause you to spin out and fail.  Level design is decent though, so I can't hate it entirely.  It only goes downhill from here.Now I'll move on to the 2nd mode, ""Racing"".  You go around on a little oval and try to get to the finish before your opponent.  Sounds simple, right? WRONG!  It doesn't matter whether you use mapped steering or manual.  You need a FAST car with close to max boost to even get near winning some of these.  The steering mapped is decent with making slight turns and going straight, but when you turn and go up a ramp, it is completely innaccurate.  While manual driving is great for jumps and ramps, but terrible for slight adjustments.  You spin out, flip, etc.  This still isn't the worst mode.Finally, the 3rd mode, ""Minigames"".  The jumping minigame is pretty easy, you just get a fast truck and upgrade it until you have at least one jump boost.  Go up the hill boost, when you reach the end of the ramp, jump boost.  Be careful to not spin out while going down the hill though.  The demolition minigame isn't bad either.  You just upgrade your truck to give it protection and higher armor.  Roll over the cars/buses and you're good.  This is probably the easiest one, since there's no time limit and you just have to take it slow to get enough demolitions.  You may be thinking, ""how is this mode worse than all of the others if the first two minigames weren't bad at all?""  It all comes down to the third minigame.  The precision minigame is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever played in a racing game.  You go up a ramp and try to land in a certain area.  This is where the level design goes FUBAR.  With a maxed out car going at insane speeds and  using all of my boosts, I still couldn't even get some of the 3-star precisions.  Now let's think back to how the controls worked for leaning.  Add this to the absolutely terrible level design.  It becomes a fustrating mess of thrown together elements mixed with garbage controls.It doesn't matter what you do.  The controls and physics make this game almost unplayable.  I would only recommend this game if you want to experience what it feels like to get so angry that you go super saiyan.  Just don't get it.  Protect what you have left of your sanity.TL;DR - It just sucks.			",1398,569,52,112,127,16,185

												This game looked promising, havent seen a Monster Truck game since the oollllllddd Microsoft ones which were decent, was shocked once I started this game to find out how garbage this game is, controls are garbage, graphics are garbage, everything is garbage in this game.This game is something you would expect to be given away free with cereal or something back in 2003.This game ruins the Monster Jam name, avoid this game like the plague			",548,123,65,50,127,11,68

												This game sucks.  I don't even know why it was released.  The graphics are terrible, the vehicle control is AWFUL.  There is nothing good I can say about this game.  I LOVE Monster Jam, but they should never have agreed to put their name on this game.  I've even gone back a couple times to give it a solid effort.  It's hopeless and terrible...don't buy it			",104,10,19,4,9,1,2
