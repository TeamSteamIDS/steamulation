												Enjoyable game has some flawsyou can make your own offensive plays that is funthere is alot of fumbling lol, I have played 3 historical seasonsand compared them with profootballrec.com was fairly accuratethough with trades and draft had a better third season, It isn't like out the park baseball so it took a bit to get use toand I am still learning (does have a help menu)I have not come across injured players playing and to switch yourdepth chart you have to click on both players and than swapI do enjoy the game, I recomend going on youtube to check it outand there site to see if it is for youI love historical teams so I took a chance and have been having funalong with some frustration			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my only review I have written in my steam lifetime. As a football fan, draft nut and a lover of statistics, this game delivers everything I want. I love tinkering with contracts, drafting the best players, and managing my team to be a super bowl contender every season. You can create your own team and even your own players, pick a year in NFL history and draft all incoming real players from that point on. The guy who wrote the first review must not be a numbers guy. I spent the full $10 on this game and do not regret it. In fact, I'm having a lovely time on my laptop by myself, thank you very much. Buy this game and have fun. Remember, it's text based, so it's not like real time football like Madden. Either way you won't regret it.			",14,1,0,5,13,1,5

												As a Hattrick player, I enjoy manager games. A simple and fun to play game. Could be better, but all in all, I enjoy playing it. Will update the review as soon as I explore the game further. For now, I think it is a good game.			",361,118,13,34,67,4,62

												A very fun heavy simulation type football game that uses real NFL players. Very similar to Franchise Hockey Manager in terms of gameplay and menu UI. You can choose to start an NFL season starting from 1970 to 2013 with all the real players from those teams! One of a few American Football games currently on Steam.			",219,19,1,56,13,3,21

												This game is more of a statistics game than anything else. If you enjoy the business aspect of football (playcalling, signing players, drafting, etc.) then this is a great game.If you are a fan of the NFL and you enjoy simulation/management games, I highly recommend this game.

												While this game does have some flaws, then again all games do have them. I have found this game to be extremely enjoyable. I love the fact you can play historical seasons with real players. I would love it if you could set your own depth chart, the auto sort feature does have some flaws. Otherwise it's a blast to play, and since i only paid $5 for it I can't complain since I wasn't going to pay $25 for FOF. I wish they would come out with a Basketball Mogul that would be an instant buy for me.			",170,18,6,16,33,6,53

												Terrible. No semblance of realism, game interface is confusing, player ratings make no sense, completely outdated (Accurate to the start of 2013 season) playcalling is flawed, cannot set your own depth chart, injured players can play...I could go on and on. This is a complete waste of money. If you want a football sim, get Front Office Football 7 instead. It is infinitely better in every possible way.			",132,77,1,68,68,3,25

												This is one of the worst games I have ever played.  It's like using an old outdate website with data from 2013 on football.  No explanation on controls.  Save your $10 and look for a better game that actually feels like it was made in the last 10 years.			",13,2,3,8,22,0,15

												The sports equivalent of Gratuitous Space Battle.  It is competent...yet very dry, flawed and unengaging.  +The game is only a 200mb download and runs in your web browser.  -There are no sound effects or music.  The lack of small touches that are missed definitely add up.  -The interface and options are bland and simplistic.   -There does not appear to be a way to adjust your lineup during a game...wow.-Playbook consists of the same 50 generic plays regardless of team.  (There is an option to make custom playbooks however, but also looks dry and unclear how the game will actually let you benefit)   -The game is missing a whole lot of ""fun factor"" without much in the way of a distinctive personality.  -In order to have fun with this, the player needs to have a particular personality/mood.  -Dealbreaker:  The realism is off big-time.  I played on ""head coach"" difficulty with the 2013 Miami Dolphins for 4 games/2+hrs.  I haven't played any other difficulty setting thus far, and frankly don't care to.  If the game is going to have my field goal kicker kick just 40% from under 40 yards...I have a problem.  If my defense gives up over 240 yrds/7yds per carry on average...per game when I am keying against the run to stop the trend...I have a problem. I really wasn't expecting much from this game, so it is with exceptional regret that I declare this to be a fail.  In hindsight, I dropped 10 bucks on something so reminiscent of 1997 shareware and should have spent more time looking at reviews/youtube.  For a game with ""2014"" in the label, this is rather sad. Score: 5.0/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Game is nice , reminds me of the good old browser footbal games. But unfortunatelly their area has stoped. This game is for the old timers that miss those games so i'm going to give it a positive for this.			",612,165,40,80,76,7,121
