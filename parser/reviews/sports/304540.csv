												Being a hardcore fan since it came out I must say this game really is something special and has a special place in my heart. I remember playing it in the winter with my friends over and we would have an awesome time. We would compete with eachother when the highscores were online. We were in the TOP 10 *literally*. The visuals are still great and it works fine on newer machines and OS's. Been spamming the forums for years now hoping it would get released. In 2010 I even got this game to be supported on Xfire. Bought the original disc and now I own it on steam too. When the devs reached out to me saying it got released today I was stoaked. It has its' flaws and bugs but it works really good on basically any decent machine out there. I don't want to spoil any of the game but the main goal is to complete challenges and do freerides. It's simple but very fun. Just try it out for yourself. The price is not that high. The only thing that needs fixing is the online multiplayer *It does not connect to the central server thus making it only playable thru LAN with Hamachi/ Tunngle..."" and the online highscores. That was awesome and it brought so much more to the game and I really hope the great devs over in Austria can get this sorted^^ GET IT WHILE IT's HOT LADS!;)13. January, 2016: 1 Year after the original post: I still come back to this game now and then and have an awesome time... I can never really get bored of it... It's like the girlfriend that everyone secretly wants to return to:p			",141,10,6,12,5,2,13

												Awesome Game. IF you played the non-Steam version for more than 100 hours you know how this feels like :D			",352,131,14,32,27,3,48

 FreakOut ...  ... is not a perfekt Game, but its one of the few Freestyleski Games on PC. Clearly you cant compare it with the new Game called SNOW here on Steam. This one is from 2007 and the grafics always remind you on that. BUT its a really fun Game and it has great chellanges. Its a Game you could play for 1000 of hours like I did with the non-Steam version.I would recommend this Game to every Skier, especially to Freeskiers out there.Keep on Ridin^^			",2823,1115,123,334,395,32,506
