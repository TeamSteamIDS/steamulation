												This Game would be great if you could just use a mouse.  but if you don't mind using the keybord or have a controller might work well for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't bother. Evidently the controls are porrly designed for keyboard and mouse. Check the forums. I'm very disappointed, not even worth the 4 bucks if it won't work.			",126,73,0,24,32,3,74
