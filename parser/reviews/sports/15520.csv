												Here is a game that loses its appeal in about 30 minutes. Sure, the first 5 or 10 minutes you think the game is kinda cool, but by minute 15 you will have decided the game is a bit boring and repititous, by minute 30 you will have decided the game is no longer fun to play, and after 2 hours of game play you will think there are far better uses of Harddrive space than AaAaAA!!!  - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.

												This game is like crack......not for everyone but if it's your thing you're gonna have a hard time stopping.I get the negative reviews for this game; it has indeed been superseeded by an improved version, (but if you're limited by  old hardware like I am this version has lower system requirements), and yes it is in a sense repetitive.... but it's a base jumping game, I honestly don't know what more people were hoping for. You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.This game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse). Above all else this game is immersive and a huge ammount of fun, one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.			",47,0,2,0,2,0,0

												This is one of those games that you probably pulled out back when Steam used to do their sales events. Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.You start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.The visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.I could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime. Fire it up if you got it in a bundle, but you will quickly put it back away.Grade: D+			",776,367,21,112,93,8,122

												I really enjoyed this game, mostly because of its originality; most games aren’t about skydiving off buildings. I’ve come back to play it for a while, I want to say I’ve got about 2 hours into it. At this point, I need to replay some levels to get more points to unlock more stages, so I doubt I’ll play it again and beat it, but it was fun for the low price of whatever I got it for. Overall, I would recommend this if it’s cheap enough.			",325,111,6,69,40,3,44

												An extremely simple concept, which often leads to very addictive games. Short description, you jump of things and try to hit the landing zone in one piece. Doing that is generally achievable. Doing it with high points, a bit more tricky, and therein lies the fun. It's kind of hard to describe, look at their promo stuff, they're not lying, it is a fun game. For the price, definitely worth it.			",200,31,7,50,46,0,48

												Clever title, clever mechanics, clever bits of story/extra material. There isn't too much more that's good about the game. While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.If you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor. Generally: give this a miss.			",108,27,0,12,25,2,26

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game in which you play a virtual basejumper who jumps through a series of maps attempting to rack up points by staying close to obstacles, spray-painting buildings, flipping off people who dislike you, and breaking plates with points on them while still landing safely. The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.It's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.I had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel ""done"" with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better. Just don't expect a whole lot of play time for your dollars.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												accurate and heart-wrenching videogame adaptation of The Bridge, a 2006 Britsh-American documentary film by the acclaimed visionary Eric Steel. in AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity the player takes the role of an unnamed jumper reliving his leap off of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in purgatory, unlocking his way to heaven by falling down stylized levels while flying near buildings (hereby believed to be the game's way of portraying the monumental, almost skyscraper like undertaking of preparing for death) and flipping off spectators (perhaps a representation of the filmmaker's own Jungian psyche) among other objectives. It is the deepest game of the 21st century and is easily the greatest example of storytelling in any medium, the Citizen Kane of videogames, proving that interaction fiction can truly become art. Robert Ebert once remarked that this game made him reconsider his views on mortality and also jumping off of buildings. playing his game was a life-changing experience and immediately after playing i conspired to jump off a building with a parachute while trying to flip-off everyone i see on the way down.10/10 it's ok			",131,14,7,17,10,1,11

												First of all: The title is awesome and it's a great example for the kind of humor that Dejobaan Games stands for. Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.

												My Take: A frantic paced game where you attempt to reach perfection on each level and will not rest until you have five stars. Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.	Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.			",378,60,9,30,51,3,77

												AaAaAA!!! is a strange and unusual game. The premise being simple, score points by being wreckles while you base jump from floating structures. The gameplay is simple enough, control your decent, gain as many points as possible by ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" strucutres, hitting scoreplates and flipping off protesters.Part of AaAaAA!!!'s charm is that it's completely tongue-in-cheek as far as ""the man"" goes. It's a strange game that no one else has really managed to pull off with a correct mix of apathy for political agendas.Even the title theme gives a good hint as to the attitude of the game. While it may be oler, it's still a great experience to hop on every once in awhile and stands out as a shining unique experience.			",653,134,32,120,86,3,104

												Tangibly cyberpunk, twitchy, enjoyable in short bursts.  Perfect for someone who doesn't have 5 hours at a time to invest in their play.  Despite being palpably absurd, the aesthetic of the game manages to be believable in its own right, in a vein similar to Death Race 2000, perhaps, or Hackers.  In an alternate timeline where the fluke discovery of ""polystructures"" has radically changed human technology, culture, and society, the jaded and apathetic Gen Y crowd (undoubtedly much more so in this parallel world) apparently go in big for hurling yourself off of buildings and navigating floating metropolitan structures, all at risk of death.  Easy to lose yourself in, highly recommended.			",165,44,4,22,16,3,18

												A truly original game where you jump out from the top of incredibly tall buildings in a near future where this has become a popular sport. You score more points by hanging close to buildings. You can also high-five admirers and give thumbs down to detractors as you fall down (if you see any). It can be played in small instalments as each ""map"" is rather short but there are lots of them and they're replayable.

												I had already played this game a bit before the Potato Sack promotion, but due to said promotion, I have finally had a chance to put a decent chunk fo time into it to make a recommendation. AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a ""realistic"" BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a ""just one more time"" feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

It doesn't let me change the resolution (Which would have been fine if it didn't fail to run properly at my normal nvidia surround resolutions), and it doesn't let you change the keyboard layouts (which would have been fine if it didn't introduce the grafitti action on a ♥♥♥♥ed up hand-contorting key).So way to go, developers, you showed us how pointlessly anti-configuration you were for no god damned reason.  Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it.  Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement. That's right, play now or forever have an empty slot in your achievement list. That's some really epic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Am I the only one who is annoyed as ♥♥♥♥ by that?			",419,122,9,48,43,3,52

Motion sickness, the game.The title of the game is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it. For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling. A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway. Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit. Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it. Neat. 8/10.(Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)			",2908,1137,96,354,354,29,474

												Its a skydiving score attack game. Rack up points by scraping by building by the skin of your teeth. The game gets repetitive quickly as most levels are similar, and you will have to replay levels many times to get a perfect score to unlock more levels. The game ends up being a one-trick pony.

												A lot of people seem to like this. I have no idea why. It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.[Rating: 70/100]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.The Good:* Unique use of humor.* Excellent sound track and sound effects.* The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.* Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun. * Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.The Bad:* For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to ""represent"" buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots ""the ground,"" he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)* Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.* The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.* Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.* No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?The Ugly:* The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers chose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released  ""1...2...3... Kick It"" when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.Verdict:Watch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
