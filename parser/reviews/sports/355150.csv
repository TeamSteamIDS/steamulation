												Gravilon is a minimalistic, jumpless 2D platformer that has you tumbling a square end over end instead of smooth running and jumping. Its a game that requires patience from the player and it does everything it can in its minimalist art style to keep you calm and relaxed. You won't hear music so much as what sounds like rolling dice as your square tumbles end over end. Every level consists of black lines as platforms with a grey background. You'll see the previous level in the foreground and the next level in the background. Getting to the exit will fly you into the background and it makes for a beautiful touch.The object of each level is simply to make it to the end door a large blue square. The controls are simple,A and D keys will to shift your weight to tumble and the space bar will make slow motion that will give you greater control when you're in the air. Otherwise your momentum can make you easily miss something. Using slow motion drains the meter and it will build back up over time.Since there's no jump, its all about your momentum, the tumble will make you jump depending on the angle your square hits a surface. To make things interesting there are white anti-gravity cubes that will shift your square's gravity from the bottom to the top of the screen and vise versa. These cubes regenerate in a few seconds.The game benefits the tumbling with platforms that are on angles to tumble or slide down. Trying to move up any incline is a difficult feat that you'll need to shift your square's weight backward before you can shift it forward to have enough momentum to climb. Any over calculation can send you tumbling back down again.If you ever get stuck, just hit R to respawn. There are no lives. It doesn't reset the level, but it does put you back at the start. Any time you die from a death pit a hazard or a respawn, it leaves a dead black square. This makes the level feel alive seeing all your dead squares there. You can move them and bump into them. If you hit them hard enough they'll disintegrate.With the level design, you can make your own way. There's not one clear path to take. Its all about how you take the path you're on. Take one path too slow and you might be stuck. Take another path too fast you might not have the precision it takes to get through it. Levels get more difficult with the inclusion of yellow lines as hazards. One touch and you're dead just like a death pit.From the moment you start, you're in the game, with a quick hub world that lets you tumble to a doorway with continue, act 1, act 2, act 3, bonus and even quit. There's no main menu and it goes a long way to making you feel in game and keeping you there.If you're looking for a hand holding experience you won't find it here. Gravilon is a frustrating game almost from the start. The tumbling mechanic ensures that no attempt is exactly the same and a lot of the time it feels like luck rather than skill. Even when you spawn, its at a different angle, causing you to bounce from there. Your tumble could be off and it might send you somewhere completely different. That's why you need to use the slow motion a lot and even then I felt like I would die again and again. There are no checkpoints, every death restarts the level over again. It wouldn't be an issue if you weren't a tumbling square.To make matters worse your view can get obscured by the previous level. As much as I love the artistic effect it does get annoying. There might not be hand holding, but I don't expect them to cover my eyes either. The game will even turn my level transparent to focus in on the background.Since you can take your own path, you are allowed to keep trying to make the wrong path work. If you can only get the momentum to tumble up high enough you can make this path work! 15 minutes later, its time for a new path. Yet going back to the game, then you can get the momentum to make it work. Again, it feels like luck and not skill. Doing the same thing 100 times might yield the result you want.The beginning of the seventh level has a dead square and with that dead square you can make a path to an anti-gravity cube. Hitting that dead square knocks it out of place, preventing you from using it again on your next attempt, unless you set up your living square then kill it with a retry to have it in place as a dead square. That was my path for a while.The other path I could take is gaining enough momentum, but not too much because you'll knock yourself on a platform or overshoot the needle thin platforms you'll need to slow motion jump to. Then hope you have enough momentum to carry you into the anti-gravity cube or else you'll just have to try again and again. That's just how Gravilon is. You need patience. Your skill will not get you there.Each level can take under two minutes from start to finish and I'm telling you that to inform you that I'm three hours into the game and I have yet to complete the seventh level. I've never made it through the first act. Perhaps that truth is a testament to how bad I am at this game, or its a testament of a game that's a lot like a roll of the dice.Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Its all in the unique tumble mechanic. While it is an unique game with a great art style, its just not fun. Its painful and frustrating, but there are people out there that will love the steep difficulty and soothing atmosphere.The game wouldn't as frustrating if it weren't for the tumbling or even if it gave you a reward; some incentive to continue playing and push through the frustration. Your reward is another level. A game should be fun enough to be its own reward. Maybe there are fun, rewarding bonuses, but three hours and seven levels in, I wasn't able to unlock anything from the bonus content.While I can recommend it for its art style and low price tag, I just can't recommend it as a fun game. Perhaps I found it more frustrating than relaxing. Even if I didn't care for the game, I'd like to thank Fan Wu for giving me the game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Placed in a strange world frozen in time, your objective is to reach the end. What could the end hold? Possibly the meaning of life, at least to Mr square.

gravilon is the definition of minimalistic, there are no enemies, collectables, achievements or random dubstep outtakes. Controls are very simple, move left and right or slow down time briefly. Using these skills you need to find your way through each level. Design of the levels is where the genius comes in to play. Each crafted in ways that give a multitude of ways to finish them so not only does it leave plenty of room for experimentation but you feel like superman after pulling certain moves off successfully.Not sure exactly how many levels the game contains but you will quickly be scratching your head, progress is also rewarded with a subconscious story that slowly evolves in the background which I've yet to completely understand, which I think is the point but certainly adds a nice element.Basically if Super Meat Boy and Thomas was Alone had a stepchild, gravilon would be his name. If you ever wondered how a platformer might play with no jump button, this will give you some serious insight. Only small complaint is no native gamepad support but certainly not a dealbreaker. Highly recommended! Cheers. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Past Level 1-2 or 1-3, gameplay becomes more frustrating than Super Meat Boy, and Super Meat Boy was more skill-based game (that is if you press exactly the same controls for the same time, the outcome will be identical); I made it up to 1-12 and at least 2 levels were 90% chance-based (the beginning of them to be exact). Using Space for slow-motion sometimes helps though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game lacks a proper settings menu, and boots up with the default unity menu. This instantly makes it feel unfinished.The game itself is aesthetically pleasing, and the sound system is very well done, making it very immersive.Sometimes crucial parts of the levels are blocked by earliers levels that are overlapping them, so you can't really tell where you're going. I found this frustrating sometimes.The emoticons you get from crafting badges are a bunch of black lines that are barely visible over the grey steam chat background. I feel like no time went into making these which is a shame. Overall, I found this game fun to play for a few hours, but found myself bored with it very quickly.This game is definetely not worth $10, and it's debatable if it's worth the 20ct I payed for it.

												Gravilon is... not great.I'm a very big fan of minimalistic puzzle games (e.g. Hook, Hexcells, ♥♥♥♥♥), because they provide me with some activity to do when I want to relax and perhaps when I'm doing something else.Sadly, this game does not deliver on this.- The main menu looks like a mess.- The mechanics are not explained at all.- There seems to be a bit of an inconsistency in the way to solve puzzles.- The game becomes extremely repetitive really quickly.- The main idea seems very simple and not intriguing.Overall, I would recommend you stay away from this game, since it's not the money, but the time that will feel like a waste.3/10, simply because it feels wrong to give a game a 1 if you haven't played it more than an hour.

												this game doesn't explain how to play itself and the menus are a joke. this game isnt even worth the time it took to buy the bundle it was a part of and definitely not worth the wait for the card drops.the controls feel sloppy touchy and the cube doesnt move as well as you expect it to when you look at it. the aesthetics are nice but the previous levels block your view more often than they should and the opening intro is long an unnecessary. i get that this game is trying to do ""jumpless platforming"" but thats exactly what this game needs. dont waste your time on it unless you're really into obscure puzzle games.

												This indie game has smooth controls and interesting gameplay. The graphics are artisically minimilistic but the game still maintains a cool atmosphere. The point of the game is to reach the exit of the level with your character (a black square). You can roll, boost, and use the effects of gravity to make your way to the end. It's challenging but rewarding and I highly recommend it to people who are experienced with platformers because you will need your skills and patience on this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Direct, perplexing, and dazzling. This aggregates up Gravilon charmingly. The purpose of the redirection is misleadingly essential. You control somewhat square that you ought to manual for the stage's exit. This is refined utilizing two limits: moving left and right; and the ability to by chance back off time. The delight world is contained solid straight lines, skimming dim squares (that address your past attempts), and minimal white spots that, once touched, change gravity. Humble parts, yet set up together stunningly make a platformer that tries to be something else and gets a kick out of the beating of your teeth. The level arrangement is constantly stunning and inventive, obliging you to acclimate to every test design Gravdev has arranged. Every time you start another level you spend the essential couple of tries genuinely making conviction based activities (the exit must be found in any case, clearly). For a delight made up of lines, the clone brush is pleasantly lost. You cross the world by using the dormancy grabbed from inconceivable drops and persistently changing gravity's headings. The mistake Gravilon subjects you to is outrageous, and accordingly your play session will typical around thirty minutes a pop. There is just so long you will have the ability to pound your head against the well known divider before a break is required. A stage will be clearly impassible; in any case, upon return with another mindset it is over the long haul overcome. There is an intriguing story suggested at all through the diversion, an illumination for the cemented world you live in. While unexpected and apparently pointless for such an essential platformer, it adds a constant drive to continue on. Gravilon and its mystery will take home in your mind until it is caught on. Each stage is layered one upon the other, and at evidently unpredictable centers the camera will zoom in two or three levels ahead to give you a gander at future levels, showing at something greater and revealing bits of an astound with the desire that you will see its aggregate. The sound framework is, afresh, insignificant yet wonderful. With basically a spooky vibe and the resounding uproar your square makes against the world, it genuinely highlights the stillness of the world. An extra favorable position? Keeping you calm after reiterated disillusionments. At the to an extraordinary degree low requesting that cost I disregard find a clarification behind what legitimate reason you should not give Gravilon a look. While direct, it is executed amazingly. To be sure, even the little graphical effects that are made while influencing a surface is fulfilling. You will have a lesser illicit relationship if you endeavor to complete it in one sitting; rather I recommend playing it sporadically. With a bit of the levels evidently incomprehensible I flew into a fierceness on various occasions, which convinced Gravdev may have horrible affinities. A break amidst every couple of attacks is perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed Gravilon sparingly through the traverse of a few weeks; its hunch perplex kept it holding up in my cerebrum between sessions. I may pay special mind to what design Gravdev has coming up next.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The reason I bought this puzzle platformer is because I thought the basic idea was pretty clever. You start out 'running' above the platforms but you can change the gravity of the game so that you are then 'running' underneath those same platforms. But I should have read some more reviews here before I actually bought Gravilon. You see, besides that basic idea there is nothing here. - Movement is clunky. Yeah I know: ""What do you expect when your 'character' is a square?"" Well, I expected the flow of the game to be surprisingly smooth despite the fact that you're controlling a square. But it's not. - The game has no instructions or tutorial at all. Once you struggle through the initial menu and manage to start the game, you have no idea what the goal is. By chance, you'll discover how to change the gravity (hit a white square). Besides that, you'll 'do things' but will have no idea what you just did. Every time I hit a black square, I heard a sound effect telling me that 'did' something but I haven't got a clue what it was.- Level design is bland and uninspired. Look at the screenshots. - The game menus are confusing. For example, I still have no idea how to exit the game properly.- There is 'Partial Controller Support'. This means you can use the buttons of compatible controllers, but not the stick. The dev replied to a discussion about this that that was intended. Ow-kay...Bottom line: this game is just no fun. At all. So I can't recommend it. At all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So, this game is needlessly difficult. Not that it should be easy, but the difficulty is not based on any skill or timing but on getting lucky on how your cube bounces. The game requires a precision that the controls don't afford, and the levels are either straightforward to the point of being linear or so jumbled that the solution is lost in a mess of lines and dots. The main menu is as difficult to navigate as the levels, and the ""minimalism"" just leaves the player hanging for some kind of story or reason to reach the end of the level. It has some moments, but it's nowhere near worth $5. Nor is it worth the time it takes to solve the puzzles.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
