												Here are my neatly categorized observations about GRID Autosport (GA).►Controls:There are no dead zone options for my Logitec F310 gamepad. There are no options to reduce steering lag (speed of my joystick motion vs steering input). Several users report that a bug from GRID 2 has cropped up in GA concerning steering wheel support. You might have trouble getting your favorite wheel working with GA.►Physics: Sudden steering input does not result in under-steer as it should. The cars have a bias towards oversteer in almost every situation. Hitting debris such as broken car parts and cones has little to no effect. Everything feels like GRID 2 with more grip. The physics are not better than GRID 1.►Graphics:The graphics look pretty good; especially after installing the high rez pack. Frame rates are fast on my Nvidia 750ti. However, the graphics feel like a step back from GRID 2. The building models of Chicago look WAY better in GRID 2. Blur cannot be disabled in the cockpit. IncGamers review of GA speculates that Codemasters have retrofitted all of the car interiors from a free community mod from GRID 2. Also the RPM and speedometer needles don't move. XD►Voices:Teammates say the same thing over and over. If you improve your times on each lap he'll literally say the same thing ""thats the fastest lap this race"" over and over. This is a clear step back from GRID 1 and a FAR CRY from DiRT 2. ►AI:On ""very hard"" difficulty the AI becomes EXTREMELY aggressive. You'll get hit and spun worse than any EA title. At lower difficulty levels the AI does show some signs of personality and can be mildly entertaining. ►Online Gameplay:In online mode you (supposedly) can race with friends and compete on leader boards. You can also buy, sell and tune cars. Multi-player is dead; the lobby is always empty. I've spent 3 hours waiting. 1 Hour for Friday night, 1 for Saturday afternoon and 1 for Sunday morning. The result? Not a soul showed up. It probably has to do with the fact that there are so many reports of cheating. As for vehicle tuning I think its sad that a game like Gran Turismo 1 (from 1997) has a much more engrossing and detailed tuning system. The mods don't even feel all that effective. I tuned my engine, lowered the weight and adjusting my gearbox for a bit more acceleration (for a tight course). I'm a pretty good driver, holding several records on a few online racing sims. The result of my mods? Nadda. On average my lap times stayed the same. I call shenanigans!  ►Single Player Gameplay:Single player gameplay does NOT include buying, selling or tuning cars. This is a grave mistake considering the multi-player situation. In single-player you will drive what your team tells you to drive; like it or not. If you don't like open-wheel racers TOO BAD! You will drive open-wheel racers to progress the game; like it or not. All so you can earn XP to go on to more events. LAME. Sadly none of the team building from GRID 1 made it to GA. Too bad.►Summary:The game feels rushed and has poor production value. Models and program-code are reused from GRID 2 and possibly even ripped from free community mods. There is no motivation to race in single-player and there are no people to race in multi-player. All I wanted was to earn some dough, buy a car and tune it. And wouldn't it be fun to build a team and climb the charts? All in single player of course! I don't recommend this title on any level whatsoever. If you already own it I don't recommend buying the season pass. If you're looking for a great simcade grab GRID 1 or Need for Speed Shift (1 and 2 are both great). Heck, I'd even recommend Test Drive Unlimited 2 over this.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Please push yes or no so I know if its helpful. :)			",271,49,59,19,50,1,64

UPDATED: 5th Sept 14 PatchThere is much emotion within the community in this latest instalment to the GRID series. It's been promoted as the ‘community's game’ with many of the new additions/changes from GRID 2 being done based on our feedback. Many love it & many despise it, with myself falling in the middle as I feel both viewpoints when I play. Although this may read as a negative (& long lol) review, let me state straight off the bat that GRID Autosport (GAS) is a solid racing game, its fast, challenging & fun to drive with a good selection of tracks (some new, some old), a decent range of balanced cars & various modes to choose from. At the end of the day that is what a good racing game should deliver & is why I give it a 'Thumbs Up' overall. It is easy to sink a lot of hours into GAS. That being said, although I do think this is a decent improvement over GRID 2 (and more closely aligned to GRID 1), it is still most lacking from being the definitive PC racing experience for me, so let me explain in more detail. One of the main disappointments for me was the Career mode. Actually, not really a Career it’s more an offline practice mode for your multiplayer career, as it primarily only a series of single events. Each series is a season (huh?), and you simply progress by completing each series in sequence for each racing discipline. Once you reach certain level, you unlock the GRID Tournament events which are larger playlist of all racing disciplines (with around 10 events). There are about 500 races in total which is approximately three times as many races as career in GRID 2, but this is basically it! It's boring!You cannot run your own team as in GRID 1, as in GAS you are a driver for hire, so no choice of car, livery or sponsors etc. Nothing to work towards collecting or unique events (like 24 Hours of Le Mans) to aim for, or other things you need to unlock... it’s just mindlessly follow the event list. Team co-op would have been nice to see in GAS, but obviously not setup with that in mind (focus clearly seems to be on Multiplayer, but more on that later). There is also no choice to specialise your career to say just Touring Cars or stick with one team, as you are forced to complete all disciplines & teams seem random based on the event. AI is an improvement to a degree, with much tougher competition to contend with from GRID1-2, which is a huge plus to the experience. They still suffer from being overly aggressive, will not honour racing line and will often cause you to have multiple restarts after the notorious first corner. Still with the improved physics, handling & damage models in GAS, it makes it less hurtful than getting hit by AI in GRID2, let’s say, but it remains a source of frustration. In the end it forces you to race aggressively too, rather than racing a 'proper' race.Likewise with the AI, it seems to have minimal randomness, from seemingly predictable lap times to the driving results. In offline 'ahem career' mode, your racing team mate will almost always finish last making it unlikely, even when you win every race, that your team will win the event. I also noticed some strange behaviour when team mate is winning all through the race & you overtake, he almost immediately drops position after position every time! Also a little odd, the AI seem to race faster than qualifying laps. You could be 6-8 seconds ahead in qualify, yet struggle to keep up in the race or find on some tracks the AI are always super-fast & others they are always super-slow; they seem predefined and not adaptable to your experience.AI get a boost at race start so you always play catch-up for the first few corners, which means you miss out on all the starting grid hustle or you start on pole and get taken out from behind! These sort of issues end up drawing your attention the more you play & end up breaking your immersion.Moving on from Career & AI, the Multiplayer online component of GAS has got more positive feature changes. There is a much longer progression curve, where you also level up your purchased cars to provide more modification. You can join a club (or create your own) & compete against your friends & the world. Clubs seem to be underutilised (no event creation, no group racing, no club vs club, limited in-game info/management). There is an improved Global Challenges with tough times & decent rewards. Overall, I have found the online racing experience to be much better than in GRID 2. Damage is more severe (& costly) although this unfortunately doesn't prevent bad drivers taking you out first corner, or any corner for that matter (Kick from game is improved tho :)). Matchmaking & finding games still needs much improvement. Online play is still region locked, which was a big issue in GRID 2 still not addressed for those outside of UK/US. It means for players like me in Australia, where online games are limited that I cannot race with others around the world without changing my Steam client region. This segments the community & is compounded by a lack of visibility of the games in progress to see what you might like to join. Matchmaking is good to have but not at the expense of manually finding games too; this is console-centric online play not PC in my view. You eventually give up trying to find a specific active game mode as it normally isn't populated with any active games anyways (& you don't know what is), so you just choose the Random playlist.It would have been great to also be able to create your own customised playlists in advance & save them for selection later online. So you can prepare as a host & setup some unique configurations for others to race.Most of these issues or limitations I have highlighted you can live with, although not as good as I expected, there is enough done decently to make it fun to race! Those that wanted the cockpit view however, may be disappointed as this is not much more than an in-car angle, blurry without a real cockpit functionality. Not an issue for me, but just to mention for others that might be an important factor.Omitted from the original release version due to issues was Time Trial mode. This has returned in the July 14 patch (in limited form). You can only choose the primary circuits (not the 100+ variations), no reverse tracks & selection is limited to the discipline. Still no friends times in career mode (ala GRID 2) nor any online times recorded. Great to have this feature finally to compete with your friends, but is lessened by limited implemenation. There are other artificial limitions throughout GAS, such as limited garage slots, limited custom cup events to 5, limited number of laps, or the extra long multiplayer grind. Rather than fixing some of these, CM instead brings out a XP Booster & Garage Pack DLCs for us to buy! These are a joke & are simply a money grabbing endeavor providing a solution to a problem they created. Shameful!Players from GRID 2 will also find a lot of reused components in GAS, such as cars/wheels/logos/livery patterns/tracks. This is not necessarily a bad thing to maximise the amount of content & customisation, but it does feel light on new content. I would have liked to see more of everything or at least some integrated modding support for community to create its own?GAS is still a blast but it's far from a perfect game. I think CM can do better which is why I feel disappointment seeing some of the corners cut in GAS (pun intended .. time penalty enforced!). The 4k UHD Texture pack brings GAS back up to code graphically, but still feels more like an expansion to GRID 2. Can't help but to feel its rushed & not well enough rounded (or refined) to be a real classic!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												So, is it any good?Well, it depends on what you expect.But if you take it for what it is, you will discover a really good and enjoyable arcade racer!Nothing more, nothing less.It has good graphics, except for the blurry cockpit view, but with the dashboard cam I find it alright!Sound is alright too, and the tracks are nice and detailed.Even if some known tracks can be hard to recognize when you drive on them.The damage model is excellent, with cracked windows, scratches and dents, twisted metal, lost car parts and sparks!Your car will also be harder to drive and steer the more you crash / bump into things.There are many cars and championship events with thrilling, exciting races.10 hours in, and I have only scratched the surface of Modern touring championship and Open wheel, and tested some other modes.I do multiply the number of laps in options though.The AI is decent and somewhat competitive.They are agressive and will do some cheap blockings, but they just trying to keep their positions and I don't find them to agressive.What goes for the physics, I find it driveable and it handles better than Grid 1 did.So I think it will please many casual players!One thing I really don't like is the preprogrammed DLC!I also bought the Touring Legends pack, a good pack, but no download was needed after the purchase!..So they are already in the game, hidden away from us from the start!That is really, really low Codemasters!!So I say go for it!But don't buy the DLC, atleast not to full price, This kind of behavior from Devs should not be supported!!

												Grid Autosport Review.My 1st 15 hours with Grid Autosport.How did I get access to this you ask? Here's the shortish version.I'd just upgraded and sent my old parts to a friend who is currently out of work in Greece. Hi Miatakias He NEEDED to upgrade and no-one I knew wanted the bits. So off they went.He fitted them but after he installed his current GFX card drivers he got blank screen. Nothing we tried fixed it nor did any suggestions from these forums or others.Then I stumbled on an official 5 month old thread on their site saying a fix is still weeks away.Having 2 AMD 6970's on the go and a pair of replacements planned, I decided to send him one of my 6970's as well. For me it meant playing half speed for a while but at least I COULD play.Loore had sent me a message and asked me about Miatakias' problem, I told him the above story and that the GFX card was going soon. Miatakias was over the moon with the parts when we got them running and asked if I was going to buy GAS? if so he wanted to buy it for me as thank you for the parts I'd sent.I contacted Loore later to let him know all was now ok with the PC and how Miatakias reacted, I got this back.""Loore May 10Tell him not to buy your copy, I've got it covered  Consider it a reward for helping make the GRID community a better place.""Cool, a freebe for bein a nice guy and helping someone out To my surprise, when Loore contacted me again. He supplied me with a passcode for the game plus the access to the press preview levels and cars we've seen in vids. Stroll on!All hush, hush till now so here goes..A week with Grid Autosport.16 hours played and tested as I write this and upload some eyefinity vids.1st off. The big one... The handling, Is it any good? Did they listen to all the whining we did?Ooooohhh yes it's good VERY good, and yes again, they did listen to us fans of old and acted on it (or most of it so far?).FINALLY! After years of waiting, we get a trueblooded, direct descendant of Grids epic gameplay. Grippy cars on tarmac that you need to DRIVE to succeed. Slide any race car about like you had to in Grid 2 and you'll fail at the first corner.Driving Autosport right on the limits of speed vs grip round Istanbul Park intermediate and the old grey matter started fizzing again, those Grid ingrained responses to what I was seeing on screen and feeling through the wheel took over and the Grin was back.The assists are of the same style as Grid 1, where turning them off made every car soo much harder to control leading to slower lap times. Paradoxically though turning off the assists in GAS lead to the opposite, better times than I got when they were on. I might have been fighting with the stability control instead of letting it do its job here.Precise throttle control is critical for success but you reap the rewards for such restraint. so analogue controllers or wheels will do well, no idea regarding KB as I never had much in the way of KB skills to start with.Bear in mind this is press preview and not full release. Only 4GBs it's just the core game elements I'm playing with. I'm playing on this lot. AMD 9590 @5GHz, Asus Sabretooth Rev 2, 16GB DDR3 @2133MHz, Sapphire 8GB R9 290X all running 3 screens @ 5932x1080 maxxed out GFX, AA, AF settings etc with 50 fps as a minimum. Using my old and trusted DFGT wheel for the tricky bits.So Here's some vids of the basic career modes, All in eyefinity taken using fraps and saved using windows live movie maker. 1st up, Touring cars Istanbul Park Intermediate.The racing is just as much fun as the original Grid was for me. trading paint with a bit of shoulder barging here and there, got slapped by the corner cut system, so that works. The ""x5 race"" option made for same fun racing over 15 or 20 laps but be warned, In 1 event  I lead from pole and no contact with the AI cars, I lost 5th gear all the rest were fine this made the last 2 laps  somewhat interesting.

Like a tiny wee policeman pops up wherever you look saying ""Nothing to see here, move along..."" This has to be unfinished or the Modders got some work to do again....Again though, it's only the press preview surely it'll be better for launch dayhttp://youtu.be/bg79ms19tGoEndurance, be careful, this category bites.... No pit stops.Tyre wear in Grid? HUH? Well much as I wouldn't have missed it, it does add a big tactical element to your driving. In an 8 minute race grip dissapears like an ice cube in a volcano, I kid you not.1st try, I shot off into the blue, by the end of a lap I shredded 20% in less than 1:30 and had none for the end. You really neeed to nurse the tyres as on the 2nd try I used only 6% in one lap and still won the race albeit with 30 and 32% left of the rear tyres. Pit stops would help here but it's about tyre management instead of outright speed.http://youtu.be/mn1sr0ca4HIAs I said above it's the core of the game here and no where near complete, though with the way it handles, looks and plays right now I would be buying a copy without a shadow of a doubt.Ferreted about in the mp section and found a few gems when looking at tracks,You might wanna add to the confirmed track list RallyDriven http://forums.codemasters.com/discussion/289/grid-autosport-confirmed-cars-tracks-features/p1Autodromo Do AlgarveIndianapolisOkutamaHong KongRed Bull RingAutosport RacewayBarcelonaaaaaand SPAAAA!!!No other tracks/locations listed and no cars as a load is still locked in career mode or limited by it being in essence an abridged and unfinished version. If I find out there's more to it between now and launch I'll keep you posted while I work on some more vids.Post edited by SRS13Rastus1701 at 2:28PM			",18,1,11,1,1,0,3

												I like the game, but it's money waster, especially if you got GRID 2. This game looks like Codemasters looked at reviews and said ""Oh, they want cockpit view and proper physics instead of arcade♥♥♥♥♥♥we made in GRID2... Hmm, let's give them what they want. For full price. With Season Pass and 8 DLC packs planned. And won't make proper cockpit view. We're too lazy, we don't want to make detailed interiors - just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures without working dashboard and let's blur all that♥♥♥♥♥♥so players won't see how lazy we are""Seriously, even Watch Dogs has better cockpit view and it's not even racing game! Okay, so handling is a little better now - you can't just ""pedal to the metal"" and win the race - you need to use brakes more clever and watch your acceleration pedal/trigger. Yes, it's better than GRID 2, but it ain't deserve the rights to be new game and should be given to anyone who already bought GRID 2. Paying for this game is just... Worse than buying CoD every year, yeah.			",576,173,29,96,74,8,98

												Where to start...and keep in mind this is based on my singleplayer experience.The driving is awful. The cars wallow all over the place, the grip modeling is bizzarre, you have to brake at sim-like distances, though the AI does not--and meanwhile the AI's only goal is, seemingly, to wreck you at every opportunity, or at least shove you off the track or into the nearest barrier. They will honest-to-god plow into you at the startline if they can. It's like multiplayer with twelve-year-olds.The cockpit cam is pathetic. It's worse than the Grid 2 mod.No team of your own, no personal livery, no stable full of cars--just mercenarily jumping from sponsor to sponsor and racing whatever they have for you.The only reason I'd give this anything but a zero on a 0-10 scale is that it looks very nice, all things considered, and has a pretty interesting car list--that I will never fully get to experience because of the godawful nature of the basic game. It's a two at best.If you want an arcade racer, pick up the first game, or grab any of the NFS games. If you want a sim, Assetto Corsa is the answer. Reading through some of these other reviews, I'm boggled by the low standards and mean value to which people hold their entertainment dollar these days.			",56,13,9,8,2,0,0

												I feel that Grid Autosport is an unfinished game and therefore I would not recommend it.There's 5 disciplines in this game, Touring, Endurance, Tuner, street and Grid. The Tuner and Street disciplines are too similar and I feel it would have been better to have some sort of off-road discipline instead. Pros.Vehicle damage. From full on physical damage to progressive gearbox and clutch damage. Pretty visuals most of the time and everything outside looks clean and crisp. Good track atmosphere, planes, helicopters, crowds, pits and even tannoy announcements. Loads of cars on the track, gritty racing, when the A.I doesn't try and kill you. Neither good or bad.Driving physics, the mix of simulation and arcade isn't to my taste, it's more towards arcade than simulation and I would have liked it to feel more alive and direct. Often the cars feel like they float and you're not even connected to the tarmac.Disciplines, some people will think it's great to be able to choose ""5"" ""different"" disciplines for each season but if you don't like a discipline you still need to complete it in order to unlock the 5th discipline. There's no distinction in terms of race rules between the disciplines so they all feel so similar and that's my issue with them. Cons.The A.I is horrible, they just seem to follow a set path and totally ignore the player and as you might say they're on rails. Another issue with the A.I is their pace, they're extremely inconsistent, you can catch them quite easily but once you're in front of them suddenly they spring to life and you cannot shake them, unless they're Ravenwest Motorsport and once they're in front they're are extremely difficult to catch. The tracks. There's 22 full GP circuits, what CodeMasters have done is taken those 22 and then reversed them or used the Indy version of that circuit, basically the same circuit that has had a corner cut out to make it shorter and now CodeMasters claim Grid Autosport has 100 circuits. I guess CodeMasters are correct but the core aspect of the track is the same as all the others from that location and when you have 5 disciplines to create tracks for it means there's hardly any variations in each discipline. Loading times, I guess this will be improved in time with a patch but as of now there's a ton of loading times, even when you select a car you have to wait for the image of that car to load and it just seems so slow and clunky. Race seasons. You pick a discipline and take part in an event, it could be 1-10 races but for some horrible reason you have to race around a track, finish and then race the same track all over again just with a different grid order and it becomes boring very quickly. No pit stops! It's a game with full damage and without a pit stop there's no way to repair your vehicle so you're just stuck with the damage.Engine, cockpit and mirror visuals are non-existent, they are straight out of a PS1 game. Cockpit and mirrors are just blurred out so you can't see anything other than outlines and engines look like they were modelled for Minecraft. The disciplines all have the same race rules, full contact in touring cars is to be expected but it's also acceptable in Grid Autosport for full contact in open wheel events. No safety cars, warning flags etc Just T-bone the car in front and drive off without any consequences. No sense of speed, you could be doing 140mph and if feels like you're doing 30mph, it feels quite lazy and slow paced quite often. Online multi player is a mess, hordes of cheaters, clans who purposely crash in to you and constant disconnects.Grid Autosport has the makings of a great game but it's just not there, maybe CodeMasters bit off more than they could chew with this one, their previous game, F1 2013 which is just focused on F1 is much more refined, detailed, complete and if they had that kind of refinement in Grid Autosport it would have been an amazing game. Grid Autosport currently isn't average game but it's not a great game, I guess Grid Autosport gets a ""fair"" rating. 6.5/10.  ",82,7,6,10,14,0,10

												What a let down this game is.The career mode has left the idea of creating your own team, aquiring your own cars and teamates out in favour of the 'offer system' which was a fund saving option every season in the original GRID. By doing this you no longer have any personal attachement to the team, the car or your teamate who btw always seem to suck. The Ravenwest team is your constant rivals while leveling up, always one tier above the rest of the AI.  And whats your reward once you've jumped through all the hoops of said leveling? Driving for them of course! The team you've been drilled to loathe is suddenly your employer and youre supposed to feel proud? honored? pfffff.....The aquiring of cars and making your own livery is still present, but only in online modes.... which is divided between the challenges we know from previous iterations, sadly updated only weekly and only offering a single entry per class making buying a car kinda useless while starting out, since you'll most likely only be able to afford one car, the chances of getting to drive it are slim, since the challenge also needs to be for the right tier of vehicles.Or you could go for the other online mode - forced matchmaking...or wait no you can't because no one plays that.Mechanically the games is fine bar the rubberbanding which seems everpresent in all modes and the drifting which is horrible, gone are the linking up of high speed drifts from the original grid in favor of doing snail-paced burnouts while streering, easily doubling the score of the AI. In the race modes the AI are boring robots rarely doing anything out of the ordinary, no spin-outs, crashes or remarkable performances, every race will end with you first, then both Ravenwest drivers, then the rest of the field and lastly your teammate. It got so boring I spent and entire season just trying to run the Ravenwest drivers off the track... all i discovered was that the AI seem to have Scalectrix levels of front end grip.There are two bright points in the game however - Open wheel classes which have a distinct feel of downforce and good pace, and the managing of tire conditions in the Endurance mode. The latter should have been expanded to all modes and the pit-stops from the old TOCA games should have been brought back and this game would have been more than it is which is an incredible beacon of mediocrity 5/10.

												Where do i begin?-Physics-The Physics in this game are completely different from the past games, they are more like a simcadeIts not Assetto Corsa or Project Cars kind of simulation level but it still has a little touch as a Simcade game.-Cars-Haven't heard of half the cars in this game and didn't know they existed, surprised me a lot. just like Race Driver GRID back in 2008, full of surprises!And of course the detail in the cars is insane in terms of damage and such.-Tunning-I always wanted the customization at Autosport since 2008 and i finally got it!Finally i can set down force, suspensions, brakes bias, differential etc the way i always wanted!I can upgrade my engine, clutch and more stuff under my hood! insane!-Tracks-A huge amount of tracks in this game, all around Europe, Asia, Australia, America and more based on real life. as good as it gets they are big as well.-Graphics-Beautiful graphics, and my pc is not amazing and i still manage to run it on high with a 16:9 resolution and get a really good fps. so i'll admit, the game engine is as good as it is since always!-Car Sounds-Obviously not the only game which has really realistic engine sounds and definitely not the best one.But they are great and i love them, and they make me wanna boost my corsair all the way to 100% volume.-Multiplayer-Compared to GRID 2, this game finally brought back the wide space roads from GRID 2008 which means multiplayer is actually playable without having the whole lobby totaled at the first few corners.Match making is nice too, i can find races fast and easily without too much pain and also have a voice chat feature which is nice.Weekly/Daily multiplayer challenges are cool too.And i love the fact that i can buy whatever car i want again whether its a brand new car or a used car from ""ebay"". Just like the old days in GRID 2008!-Controller Support-Supports joypads, gamepads, wheel, keyboard and everything you can dream of.The game is also very balanced so its very playable with keyboard as well for a simcade.-Camera-Good to see the rewind feature is still here, very useful indeed!And the replay feature after finishing a race also has an option to hide hud and upload on youtube directly from the game. Also has various cameras positions which is cool as well.The only down sides of this game i could think of are:-A broken cockpit cam-Can't make my own team and hire my own team mates-No drifting mountains like the old days.But overall, i'm glad codemasters listened to the community and its requests and gave us most of the things we asked for.We were also introduced to Drag which is brand new to GRID which is cool as well! 8/10 from me, i really want those drift mountains.

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Grid Autosport 

			Views: 1,733		

			One year later Codemasters heads back to the track with Grid Autosport. Is this the game that fans of TOCA and Grid wanted last year or is it a quick and dirty cash in?		

 There are racing games for car lovers and there are racing games made for people that obsess with details of sending a car around a track as quickly as possible. Autosport caters to the latter. Those who enjoy buying, tuning and personalizing their dream cars should leave this game on the shelf. Grid Autosport offers very little theater, ditching the fictitious racing series and fake Sportscenter news clips in favor of no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rubber on tarmac racing. Players will find that they are free to move between different touring car races, endurance races, open wheel racing, tuner events and street races. Players level up in each race type independently and in doing so they unlock new events and sponsors as well as Grid race series events. The freedom ends there however. Once an event is selected players are given the choice between two race teams who have pre selected cars and unappealing liveries. While certainly a realistic touch, it takes the joy out of earning your favorite rides and making them your own. Additionally, each sponsor has different objectives and tuning affinities. The higher their affinity for tuning the more settings players will have to tweak their machines so choosing a sponsor is more like choosing the difficulty of a series and additional experience can be earned by succeeding with an underdog team.  The realism continues once players are secured via five point harness behind the wheel. If you are expecting to be at the front of the pack then participating in qualifying is necessary. Forgoing qualifying laps mean fighting to the front of a dense 12 to 16 player field and contending with some seriously aggressive AI. An extensive damage model and strict penalties for cutting corners means that moving up a position or two is a bitter fight. It feels like an accomplishment to move through the pack but since most races consist of two or three laps aggressive racing is essential and often times you will find yourself crossing the finish line with a car that has wrecked steering and is not pushing as much horsepower as when the race started. Race ending collisions can occur and like Grid 2 the damage models set a genre standard. Unfortunately, qualifying means completing every race twice and qualifying isn't a possibility for certain race series. For those who don't have an obsession with cleaving a tenth of a second off of a lap time it's tedious.  Also complicating matters is the fact that most race events have you teamed up with an AI driver who helps determine your placement in the team standings at the end of a season. Perhaps I made a habit of selecting the wrong sponsor, but my teammates all seemed to be tailpipe fetishists who were content to follow the entire field. While it is possible to order commands for your teammate to drive more aggressively or hold their position it seems to have little effect other than hearing your partner spin out if you forget to back them off of the most aggressive behavior setting. Fortunately, the opponent AI also makes mistakes but all too often the work you put into capturing a podium finish is undermined by your teammate, ultimately costing you valuable experience at the end of the season. Gaining experience is essential to progressing through the career so it doesn't take long before the game feels like a grind. Variety is a hallmark of the Grid series and Autosport offers touring car racing, endurance racing, open wheel racing, street racing and tuner racing. Endurance races take place over a fixed time and the driver that travels the furthest in the allotted time wins. It's is possibly the most challenging race type since careful and consistent driving is required to stay at the front of the pack and protect the soft rubber that keeps your machine on the road. Open wheel racers are incredibly fragile and the threshold between cornering at max speed and being murdered in a nasty crash is thinner than a human hair. Open wheel racing in Autosport is not as complex as Codemasters' own F1 series since adaptive aerodynamics and the KERS system have been omitted but never the less offers a commendable and accessible experience. Tuner races are largely comprised of time attacks and drift events. Street races tend to be the most enjoyable events simply because the excise the game's long list of real world grand prix tracks in favor of the more detailed city based tracks. Finally, touring car events adhere to the addage of rubbing is racing by placing you behind the wheel of road cars tuned to unrecognizable specifications while you bump and bash your way through corners defending your position against a tightly knit field of racers. Sadly, togue events are absent from Autosport and the live route system—possibly one of the most intriguing features in a racing game in years is also absent. Additionally, players varying tastes means that some events will become a tremendous test of patience for some and leveling across all event types is essential to unlock Grid events. Once again the vehicle selection is slim but covers a tremendous variety of machines, including the platypus of the automotive world: the Aussie Ute.  Online is much the same in Autosport as it was in Grid 2 with both weekly challenge events and direct competition with 11 other drivers. Cars have to be earned one by one and leveling up each of the racing disciplines contributes to your overall level and unlocks more slots in your garage. Each car must be leveled up through use, unlocking tuning options and upgrades. This proves to be highly problematic however since it takes an absurd amount of time to unlock enough tuning options for the feature to be usable. Tuning is a delicate art—the kind of thing you would do with a scalpel and Autosport's initial instinct is to provide you with a jackhammer. Tuning options are controlled via sliders and the greater your affinity for tuning, the more settings available along the slider. Also the way vehicle availability is divided between race types and classes within each race type means that it's hard to dedicate yourself to using a single vehicle in order to upgrade it. All this comes together to make online play a grind of it's own. Autosport does provide an excellent assortment of tracks across it's single player and online suits, many of the tracks in Grid 2 can be found here as well as a large selection of new Grand Prix tracks—many of which are not found in any other mainstream racing games. The most exciting inclusion is the brand new Circut of the Americas with it's tight hairpins, long straits and winding sections. While Codemasters has included a number of details that liven up the real life Gran Prix tracks, races through the game's cityscapes is far more captivating and lively. Presentation wise, Autosport maintains the same high quality as Grid 2 but by popular demand a cockpit view has been added. Corners have been cut however with a depth of field filter that blurs the detals in the cockpit. utosport makes some strides toward addressing the issues that many TOCA and Grid fans had with Grid 2 but features enough quirks and questionable design choices to remain frustrating. It's a game that caters to serious race fans and shrugs off features that lend themselves toward giving players a sense of progression. You are simply a driver tied to a team that you are in no way invested in, who is, in turn, leashed to a corporate sponsor. It's a bit of realism that most gamers could do without. Autosport is a challenging racing game with perfect handling and tenacious AI but the dense racing fields and low lap counts combined with a rigorous damage model can irritate. Extensive plans for DLC also raise eyebrows and will likely cause would be wheel-men to steer around this entry.			",1843,697,76,250,218,18,319

												I'm only 5 and a half hours into the game, so take what I say with that in mind. I'm also an intermediate level racer.I like the ""sim-cade"" genre, I like Gran Turismo and Forza a whole lot. Unfortunately, Neither Sony or Microsoft would ever see those particular cash cows on the PC. GRID is one of the few options on PC. Okay, usual complaints that PC gamers have on console ports- Controller oriented UI. Still, not nearly as bad as say, SHIFT 2 was. Uneven graphics. Wierd sound stuff. (I noticed it most when driving an open wheel car, the wind sound would go away if I looked side to side or behind me.)On to the meat-Limited Tuning, you can't really fine tune the car, just move some sliders around.The team offers thing is wonky- yeah I get it, you only have so much choice in pro-level racing who you drive for and who's graphics are on your car. But it's a game. Come on man. Cars are extra, super, crazy tail happy- I expect this from a heavy, vintage V8 Sedan, NOT a super high downforce openwheel car. The opening level GT's are nearly undrivable in my feeling. The Dalara F312 has HORRID snap oversteer even when you click all those dumb sliders to what should be the most stable settings. It's an open wheel car, it has tremendous mechanical grip AND downforce, I expect it to get loose if I kill all that downforce but NOT when I'm at speed.The AI is set to murder- they don't do clean racing. They love to shunt you, cut you and generally drive like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every race is a street fight in this game.It makes you Drift. Drifting isn't racing. Drifting is a hell of a show, but it isn't racing and I've never enjoyed it. (I prefer to get my drift on running tail-happy Sixties race cars or Rally cars in various other games.)Unlicensed/Fake cars. :(The pricing/amount of DLC is silly. I bought the Drag pack because of how poorly represented that aspect of motorsports have been in the game world... It does it half right at best. Staging is there but it leaves out the burnout box. It just doesn't feel right anyhow. Also, I bought the game on impulse, I broke my own rule- ""Don't pay Codemasters again until they FIX Dirt3."" I still want them to fix Dirt3.4/2/15 HEY THEY FIXED DIRT3 THATS COOL. STILL DON'T LIKE GRID. :D			",98,11,27,20,33,1,21

												Codemasters had a plan when they rebranded under the Codemasters Racing Studio banner. That plan was to have the GRID and Dirt franchises to release a game every other year in syncopation. This started with Dirt Showdown, followed by GRID 2. However, Codemasters have abandoned their plan after only a single iteration. Possibly in part to the release of the next generation of consoles and the learning curve required in developing for the new platform, but ultimately it can be put down to the fact that GRID 2 received such a mixed reception from the fans. No cockpit view? A story driven racing game? What were Codemasters thinking?So what is GRID Autosport then? Codemasters claim that the “time and technology were right” to release another version, only a year later than GRID 2 had graced our shelves. What the fans really think is that GRID Autosport is an apology for GRID 2. One thing is for sure, it’s a fine game.Codemasters went to a lot of effort in listening to their fans. One of the biggest gripes of GRID 2 was the lack of a cockpit view. Well GRID Autosport has two of them. Codemasters reason for leaving it out of GRID 2 made a lot of sense, saving on resources that could be better used making the rest of the game beautiful, something they definitely achieved. So while GRID Autosport has brought back in the cockpit view, it is relatively low detail, with no sign of dials or monitors anywhere on the dash to provide feedback to the player. This is still a bit of a sticking point, especially when the player is encouraged to play without any UI for an extra XP reward bonus each race.The difficulty settings are pretty much back to the way they were in the original GRID. You get a set XP reward from your performance during a season, and this can be enhanced depending on the difficulty settings you pick. Not just the level of the AI, but driving assists, forcing the view to cockpit only and driving with no UI all help raise your XP bonus. It is rather key then that with the low end internal view that Codemasters provided some further form of feedback to the player. This is done in terms of a race engineer. In previous games the race engineer came onto the radio when the game felt the need, start of every lap, after a bad crash etc. In GRID Autosport you can request information from him at any point. Your position, your team mates position, your rivals position and a damage report are all just a button press away. This works really well during races, but Codemasters have still slightly missed out here by not having it available during the timed events or qualifying sessions.A gripe of mine when it came to GRID 2 was the forcing of multidiscipline play. The GRID series has its origins set from the TOCA Touring Car games, and it has always been what they have done best. GRID Autosport goes some way to correcting this by getting rid of the whole story based driving idea and focusing a lot more on circuits over open road tracks. The selection of tracks is not huge, twenty two locations combine to provide over a hundred different track layouts. There are a couple of new tracks in there, but the majority of them are old favourites.You can race on these tracks across the set disciplines available in GRID Autosport. These are Touring, Open Wheel, Endurance, Tuner and Street. The set up is a lot more like the original GRID where each season you pick a discipline, then select an event from that discipline to race in over the course of that season. Each event category will give you a couple of driver offers to chose from, with season objects set and XP rewards in that discipline for completing them. Once you reach level three in all disciplines you unlock the first of the GRID Championships.If you chose to complete a GRID Championship season you will compete across all disciplines, but the season objectives will be challenging yet rewarding. These are probably the best way to boost your XP across all the disciplines.However, if you are like me then you will prefer one or two disciplines over the others. In fact, I see no reason for some of these to be in here at all. Tuner, for example, is mostly filled with Time Trial and Drift events. Who plays these? The Open Wheel discipline is nice, but all it does is make me look forward to the next F1 game. I wouldn’t be upset if these two categories were not in the game. Street is good, it has been a strong part in all the GRID games, though the loss of Live Routes is a shame, as it was easily the best feature in GRID 2. Endurance requires a lot of skill, with the minimum length of races being eight minutes and tire wear playing a huge part in each race. Endurance racing is very much about consistency, and it’s the discipline where you see AI mistakes more than any other. Touring is the bread and butter though. I’ve already mentioned that the GRID roots are in the TOCA series, and to be honest, I’d love to see Codemasters go back and make a pure TOCA game again, and I don’t think I’m alone.The multiplayer side of the game works off the same experience system as the single player, with every race providing you with XP in the selected discipline. To begin with you will be loaning a car in each race you enter, but once you own a car you can start competing with it if the right events show up in your playlist. Codemasters have gone to a lot of effort to make the online experience a lot more personal. You can customise cars you own in terms of livery and sponsors, but each race also earns the car XP which will unlock upgrades for it.Overall GRID Autosport has taken a step backwards, but in a good way. One big shame in single player is that you never form your own team like in the original GRID, picking the livery and sponsors. You are just constantly a driver for hire. The discipline system works well though, and if you are not bothered about the GRID Championships then you can just stick to what you enjoy.			",2254,865,87,235,310,22,348

												Well this is the third Grid game which is surprisingly long and giving much more motorsport than the second one. After playing Grid 2 i felt like playing the different version of NFS: Hot Pursuit because of the enviroment and the race types. With this game Codemasters give us a hope for a future realistic Grid games that may be possible to come out. Let's make a quick review with pros and cons.+Long and challenging gameplay                                        +Simple menu and racing menu interface+Good graphics and car details+Team radio is better than the other two games+Five different classes-I believe there is a hidden Dlc in this game called The Dumbest Teammate in this World. No matter which team you are racing for your teammate is an idiot.-After playing 30 hours or much game is just repeating itself.-You can't choose your teammate like in the first game.-This whiteline penalty...It is so sensitive and it doesn't show how many seconds you take the penalty.-I don't understand why there is a utopic team named Ravenwest Motorsport.Nevermind my cons review this game is good than worth buying. I recommend all for the Grid lovers.			",345,94,9,52,15,2,28

												+ Dazzling array of cars+ Great-sounding engine noises- Cockpit view is low-res, blurry, and the needles don't even move- Cars seem to handle like a barge. With wheels. That is aquaplaning. On the Moon.- AI seem to have two modes: religiously follow driving line; or swipe me off the track.- Damage modelling is rough. I only seem to pick up minor scratches, and then lose parts of my car. Damage model doesn't seem very realistic. In fact, it doesn't even seem to be satisfyingly unrealistic. Just bits falling off. - Game seems horribly unoptimised for my set-up. Alas.All in all, I would say that this game is a waste of £29.99. I'm glad I got it for free when I bought this PC, because there was no way I would buy this on sale. 11/10 - IGN			",96,18,6,6,8,0,2

												I'm playing this on Linux with a GTX 660 and the NVIDIA drivers. I'm usually not much of a racing guy, but I'm quite enjoying this game.Pros  No crashes or hiccups  Runs at 60 FPS Minimum on high settings at 1080p  Nice visuals and sounds, pretty UI, extensive options menu  Picked up my DualShock 4 controller right away without me doing anything  Currently the best racing game on Linux (there's really not that many)  Variety of tracks, modes and cars  Detailed difficulty settings, making it easy for players of all backgrounds to quickly feel at home  Detailed visual customization of cars in multiplayerNeutral  If you're using a less popular controller, the game won't save your controls. You can create a keymap with controllermap and paste it into this file: GRID Autosport/share/controllermapping.txtCons  Absolutely zero customization of your cars in singleplayer  Razer and Monster Energy advertisement plastered over cars and along tracks.Looking forward to more Linux ports of this publisher's games! DiRT Rally please?			",97,10,2,7,3,0,3

												After playing Grid 2 and having mixed, mostly-positive feelings, I was hoping Autosport would win me over. It did not. I'd definitely recommend Grid 2 over this game, and if you've already played 2, don't bother with Autosport.My biggest problem is with the driving physics (which are similar to Grid 2). I get that it's an arcade racer; that's fine. But the cars don't feel like they have 4 wheels contacting the ground. They're more than just ""floaty"". They are kind of like cardboard with a pencil stuck through the middle. When you turn, the car seems to pivot around its center (you can feel the rear wheels swing out). So I'll brake before a turn, start turning in, and keep traction through the turn. But while doing this, the car has pivoted and feels like it's drifting... but I have traction?... it's a bizarre sensation and just feels ""wrong"".As a comparison: Project Gotham Racing was an arcade racer that nailed driving physics. Even though PGR was arcadey, the cars felt weighty and had momentum. You could feel the road under the wheels and could tell when you made little mistakes. Very satisfying to master. Grid's physics don't have that magic at all.Beyond that, Autosport's career mode is dull. My experience with Grid 2 was that, in spite of the poor physics, the career's trickle of exciting tracks and cars kept me playing. However, I do not feel this in Grid Autosport. Your career progress is only portrayed through menus, and everything (everything!) boils down to filling XP bars. Gone is the illusion of building up a racing career, gone is collecting cars, gone is my garage. For the first few races I was actually confused: ""what is my GOAL here?"" It turns out: I don't need to win, I don't need to beat my rivals, I don't need to finish objectives. I just need to play enough to fill XP bars up.Couple that with the fact that most of the tracks are straight from Grid 2, and I'm left super disappointed. It's a shame because I've always liked Codemaster's Colin McRae and Dirt series. I want to like this game, but I can't.			",177,37,18,17,20,7,17

												Ok about time for a review, I have had enough hrs in this game to give a fairly clinical observationSure it will be biased but in the end I will as objective as possibleSo game play overall? let's just say with some tweaking once you upgrade your cars, you can have some serious grin timeNow let's explore this, you need to grind to upgrade your cars, and by grind I mean go online and compete either with real players or AIIt can get repetitive but don't let this fool you into thinking this game is shallowThe grind is arduous, I prefer not to race online as then you are forced to have your ""download"" set to UK servers which will cause latency issuesPeople who think otherwise, really don't understand how ""networking"" worksSo having left my ""downlaod"" set to UK, iI found my actual game downloads were notoriously slow, so make sure you return to your regional setting if not playing this online with real opponentsLiving in Australia gives me around 250+ ping to UK, so this kind of ruins any sort of gaming with others, which is this game's achillies heelThey ruined it by having so little servers populated that you are forced into a UK regionSo what next? there is always online events to participate in, and these rotate every 100 hrs or so, compete in these (grinding) with a bought car and this is how you can become more competetive if you so wish to play against real peopleOtherwise it's a fools paradise trying to compete with peopel who have already maxed out their resepctive carsThis should never been implemented in this game, everyone should have the same car, or similar in class So how does this compare with two other car games of similar context?Grid 2: GAS is muuch more realistic and has tunable cars once unlocked, and what I mean is once you meet level requirements, you can now adjust suspensin, diff, brakes etc etcMakes gaming much better and AI seem more behaved tooSo about the AI, something good in GAS make you realize that AI do not hap hazardly just RAM you, they can be aggressive, but it all depends where you are in the racing lineI spun out today, car behind me actually braked and would not try and go around, so not only was I not rammed, but I was given time to get back on track, good touch imoSo on the other end of the spectrum we have Project Cars:GAS does so much more, better and just with more reward, I'll explain.pC has ground breaking bugs where cars AI pass you on the greass, or you pit only to come out with flat tires, or crap where everyone is online and race starts but suddenly you lose ability to use your wheel?See pC is pretentious and gets so many things wrong than right, GAS on teh otehr hand is the underdog just prodding along and almost championing what it can do, but alas falls just short It's lack of specific tracks that ruin it for me, specifically NordsSo out of the 3 games, I prefer GAS based on: Quick play and rewardGreat graphics, but not as good as pCGood AI with challenging game playNice tweaking options of cars without being too complexDifferent styles of driving, ie drag racing, destruction derby, drifting to name a fewIs this the creme de le creme car game? no, does it offer a lot to kleep you occupied, yes but in small doses This game gets  a nice solid 8.5 based on what it does and does well, without all the BS involved with pC and more depth that Grid 2 offers:DTL:DR 8.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unless you're a hardcore racing fan I don't recommend.The AI is too aggressive and the online multiplayer is dead.AI 'catchup' feature completely ruins the game, if the AI get's too far behind they get a stat boost to their car making them overpowered and just not fun or realistic at all.Otherwise the physics compared to GRID2 make it a completely different more realistic and fun experience, but its hard to have fun as the AI is so awful.

IntruductionI don't write much reviews, but I feel that this game needs one from me.I have followed the development of this game closely, and everything I read made me believe this was going to be a good game. So naturally I pre-ordered the game. I never have been someone who buys a DLC, though a pre-order bonus is something I usually take.First impressionFirst impression is that they did listen. This is a game with good graphics, and cars handle as they should. Not unlike in Grid 2, that if you learn how to slide in every corner, you are guaranteed going to be faster than everyone. I started doing multiplayer directly. I learned that like in every multiplayer game, the sooner you start with multiplayer, the easier it is, because you get access to the faster cars earlier. I started out doing streets discipline because that is what I loved from Grid2 most too.This worked for me. I like the cars and the tracks I drove were nice. It did seem the same tracks were in the rotational though, but on the forums they mentioned to do something about that. It immediately came to me that this game has a steep learning curve. Nothing you do will guarantee you to win and many things just don't seem to work and you have to figure out why. For that reason I wrote a beginners guide to Multiplayer with all the do's and don'ts. A lot of people are thankful to me because it answered many questions they had.If a game has this, that is not a good sign, but lets try and keep things positive. I mean, you learn how it works, and then it works.My first encounter with the AII started doing Open Wheels with a friend in custom lobbies with AI to fill up the spots. This is where I found out that CodeMasters made a big mistake with this game. The AI is badly programmed. They say they are very fond of how the AI is, and that it is very realistic. This is a lie. The AI really is AI (artificial) It follows the racingline, and if you happen to be there, they are happy to crash into you pushing you away. They'll get you to spin off the tarmac easily, and if you try that with them, they seem not to be harmed at all. They break early so you easily crash into them unless you take the inside corner and use them as a moving wall.Damage system VS AIGrid multiplayer has a damage system. Basically, when you damage your car, at the end of the race you have to repair your car which costs money. The real problem with this is that the AI does not seem to care and happily crashes into you, causing you to have a high bill to pay. There is also the impact rating that tells other drivers how clean you drive. Even if you attempt to avoid all contact, the AI easily can cause such accident that your rating becomes yellow, causing other players to think you are a bad driver.Racenet ChallengesThen there are the racenet challenges. They suffer the same problem: They included the AI in most of the races, and you start at position 12. This means that it is no longer a race to get the fastest time, but to find out how you can effectively take over 11 cars in the first 2 corners. The faster you do that, the faster your time is. Thats all there is to it really. CodeMasters has mentioned that they'll look into this, but CodeMasters also mentioned they really love the AI and are not planning to make any changes to it. Lets hope they decide to remove the AI completely.Single playerI did some single player too. I started doing Streets as that is what I did in Multiplayer too. I had to learn how to adjust to the AI. I basically learned that: crashing is good, do everything you have to do to get in front of the AI as quickly as possible trying to minimize the damage as much as possible, and you will guaranteed win. Of course, everyone else learns this too, and they take these experiences to multiplayer. Yes, this game has a lot of crashes and rammers in multiplayer too. You'll have to find custom lobbies if you want to avoid this.Good points vs Bad PointsThere are other issues too that are small problems and thus not worth having a section per item. I'll list them as good and bad points.Good points:- Good graphics- Physics of the cars are very good.- When you start a race, you get to see the map so you always know what the track is going to be like- You can enable raceline which helps greatly in learning the cars and tracks, both in SP and MP.- Most settings are shared between SP and MP.Bad points:- AI behavior vs you- AI in multiplayer vs repair costs- AI in Racenet Challenges, doesn't make sense, see above.- Keyboard players have a big disadvantage over controller players in Endurance (basically, forget this mode all together)- Big learning curve- Time spent waiting too long- MP, time before first race can easily go up to 10 minutes if you're out of luck, but on average it is 5 minutes or more)- Game says cockpit view, but it isn't really a cockpit view. No working dials, everything blurred.- Assists aren't really assists. Except for ABS, the rest makes you go slower and loose bonus points, giving a false sense of help.- Menu system is hard to navigate and reponds slow.- Quitting MP takes a lot of time, you cannot quit when you want to and have to wait for a certain moment before you can quit. ALT-F4 works, but you'll loose your progress.- Cheating happens in MP, even though CodeMasters are banning cheaters.End verdictLong story short... Grid Autosports on paper is this: the best things from Grid1 and Grid2 together. The actual outcome however isn't this. With a short development time for this game, yet a full price, it is clear the game is a quick job trying to generate money because of the negativity around Grid2.For who is this game? If you are very good at racing games and you want a bit of realism, yet you want to have a challenge, you'll love this game. If you are not very good at racing games, this game just isn't going to make you happy. Any other racing game will do it, just not this one. If you don't want too much realism in how your car drives, this game is not for you either. Grid1 might be, Grid2 definitely is going to be. If you have raced a lot in Assetto Corsa, this game is not gonna do it for you. If you race with keyboard and do not have/want to drive with a controller (gamepad or steeringwheel), this game is going to be harder for you. Can still be fun but you'll have a disadvantage in certain disciplines.If you want to get this game solely for multiplayer, I would not recommend it, because the racenet challenges are an important part of multiplayer, (gives you the most XP/money in a short timespan) and right now, the racenet challenges are crap.I hope this review helped you make a decision. I didn't made the decision lightly to write this review, but I feel I have to.			",38,4,10,1,8,1,8

												Overall:- A rushed production- If you're a GRID fan, DON'T buy it , it's not GRID 3, it's just GRID 2.5- If you're new to GRID, DON'T buy it, buy original GRID and GRID 2, they are way more better, and you won't miss any thing when you played thouse twoGood:- Overall graphic is nice- Sound is great, menu music is very good- The ""every-one-can-race"" driving style is preserved, that's good- PR team did hell of job, made me belive this will be like the original GRID, but better, so I pre-order itBad:- You need a gamepad, keyboard driving is no good(They are good when it back in orignal GIRD). I know I know, you have a steering wheel, but GRID is a fun-to-play racing game, if you try to play it as simulation game, you will dispoint.- Game design is rubbish, both singleplay and multiplay is messy- NO team management in the singleplay, you are a hried driver, you can't choose car, livery, upgraed, teammate, so I first thought maybe GRID:Autosport is focus on multiplay...boy was I wrong- Multiplay is lack of creative, finding new race is difficult, the only way I can play multiplay race is invite my friend...- The orginal GRID is great mostly becasue it's creative, back then, every race track in other racing game has only fixed time of day, so you can imange how amazing when we first saw LeMans 24 hours race in GRID with shifting time of day, and then you can understand how dispointed when you find out ""Endurance"" seriese in Autosport is just runing in a night version race track, when every major racing game has change time and weather as standard...hopelsee			",65,6,14,8,24,0,11

												It seems odd that we had to wait close to five years at an official sequel to Codemasters incredible Race Driver: Grid, and now only a year later, sitting with the series' third game. It tastes undeniably by a developer as well by the jokkede in the spinach, and therefore has worked diligently to together splitting the successor as the series' many fans had hoped for in the first place.Therefore, it is not surprising that the Grid: Autosport in style feels like an extended, graphic prettier version of the series' first game and never really manages to put his own stamp on the whole for fear of differ so radically from the original as Grid 2 did.There should not be many button presses to before is started with the first race, and actually Codemasters discarded part of the personalization that or has characterized several of their car racing. Five different race classes means that you can decide how you want to approach it all the way and is a welcome approach compared to some of the more restrictive structures you find in many of the genre's other games.Touring is the closest the new games come on the series' roots, so then Codemasters yet called the TOCA Touring Car Championship. Here it is on standardvognsræs with lots of horsepower, clashes and cars stretching from a Honda Civic to a Nissan Skyline GT-R.Endurance is a completely different size and is about ran over long distances, which means a completely different approach. If you want to see the finish line, let alone join in a proper location, so at all times make sure to treat the car properly and get the rubber of your tires to stretch as far as possible. It's a really exciting form of racing that few other games have had the courage to include and the right discipline requires that you have the concentration skills in order.Open Wheel is the game's fastest class and focuses on small, fast single-seaters, among other means of races in Ariel Atom, Dallaraa F312 and Caparo T1. If one before has been caught by developers F1 series, it is also where you will feel most at home, despite the fact that simulation trends obviously not Special focus.Street is by-race as in the first Race Driver: Grid and is definitely where the game most frequently shows its graphical muscles. It's also the closest race, and you are almost constantly surrounded by a whole field of other cars, making the class very intense.The last wild lass is Tuner, despite having its own qualities also seems like the least adequate in the game's complete package. Here is the following of ardent running competitions and time trial with everything from muscle cars to the tuner-favorites like the Mazda RX-7 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X.You have to take my hat off to the tremendous work Codemasters obviously put in to ensure that each of those five classes not only clearly different from each other, but also is relatively faithful to the racing classes from the real world that inspired them. If you are planning to transform yourself into the ultimate Grid cruise control, however, you can look forward to spending time in all disciplines, as it is the only way the game closes on all its content.To master race classes means that you will greatly be working to find the balance in the variety of cars and it is really encouraging to Codemasters have returned to a management that has far more in common with it from the first game than the powerslide-happy approach from Grid secondCodemasters has again orchestrated a controller that clearly lets you mark how far you can push the selected car before it goes wrong. If that kind of gets simulation alarms ringing in you, there is nothing to fear, for Grid: Autosport are just as motivated by arcade racing as its predecessors. Mixing balance is the developer's own, and again, they have hit the mark with something that works accessible, speed-filled and action-oriented without the chamber completely in Burnout territory.It is no secret that the development time on Grid: Autosport has not been very long, and despite a thoroughly solid game racing, it's something you feel in virtually all aspects of the game.The aforementioned inability from start to personalize the experience is just the first symptom of a game where there seem saved and reused in all the edges and looking where it has been possible. Most cars, tracks and race types have already been included in the series' previous edition, and the graphical difference from Grid 2 to Grid: Autosport is not enough to hide the problem.Saved there also seems to have been on the development of artificial intelligence, and Autosport offers the series' most unprofessional opponents to date most of the time does not seem to suspect that there are others on the field than themselves.Elsewhere must wonder a bit over the configuration of the various races, and even races in fast single-seaters can be boring when you are forced into a time around to run six to eight different tournaments where each race to be run twice before one again gets to choose another runaway lass.Graphic is also not much has happened lately, and though sometimes it still is impressive how many colors, effects and cars Codemasters manages to force the screen without sacrificing frame rate, it's a little disappointing that there is at least not been lavished little more for the PC version.Grid: Autosport is certainly not without talent. Whether you have played the series before or not the race is on the field still fun, intense and delivered with a really good management. However, it is without doubt those who do not have experience with the series, which will make the most of Grid: Autosport, for the rest of us will find it hard to ignore the clear taste of recycling.Thomas Blichfeldt Gamereactor Denmark			",293,83,80,28,41,7,38

												Dear fellow players. I have just bought this game recently and in my opinion it is amazing. The best thing to mention is that the game focuses on the player only, you do not have to go through a boring career method, you can freely do the events as you would like to.The game has really wide range of motorsport genres, you can find almost everything what you like, including drift, formula car series etc.The gameplay, with the RPG elements also fantastic. In online games, you will start the game with a loan vehicle, which are the slowest one. As you progress and earn money for racing, you can finally buy your first car and upgrade them through your online career. As soon as your car is leveled to the highest level, you will experience some really difficult and enjoyable races online.The online community is also good, the game has an “impact rating system”, which means if you make an impact with other players, your rating will be lowered and you will be temporarily banned from some of the events which has impact rating enabled. If you would like to improve your impact rating, you need to drive safe and look out for the other racers and stay away from impacts at all costs.The mixture of arcade and simulation style is also a good idea, it is not easy as an arcade game for example Need for speed series and it is not that difficult either. You need to have some skills, if you would like to finish in the top places, so the challenges will last long enough to play lot of hours.Only two negative thing to mention. The first is the blurry HUD, which is painfully awful. I do not even know, why codemasters did not do it perfectly (they do it right in the first GRID). Secondly, the silly AI is can be really annoying. The system did not even notice whether I am on the track or not.Altogether, a game which is really fun to play in my opinion and I will play many more hours in the future. Hopefully, the negative problems will be solved in the future through a patch or something. I am really recommend this game, if you are looking for good competition, it is an 8 out of 10 for me.I am really looking forward to see you soon in my rearview-mirror! :) ",36,2,2,5,1,0,2

												A diverse but inconsistent racer, while the graphics and easy and complete menus add to the strong side. It all comes crashing down when you actually start a race. The AI is very very dumb and this is in the realistic hard version, as a Gran Turismo Veteran, Grid's AI is not really an AI when you just feel part of a prerun race, the unresponsiveness and complete obliviousness of the AI to your every move, keeps me frustrated at how I have to adjust myself to the AI's position, yet they have no problem crashing into me EVERY time when I successfully clean overtake. I've never encountered such an unrealistic driving experience in Gran turismo, and Oh do I wish GT comes to the computer/steam platform.			",101,5,5,14,4,0,12

												I've been a fan of Codemasters since the original ""Dirt,"" enjoyed the original ""Grid"" (realizing it was arcad-y), and have loved F1 2012. I judge simulators among simulators and arcade games for what they are as well. This game was horrible. I got drunk and bought it for $40 one night. The next day, I start it... the car pivots around its center when you turn... Strange even for a less serious ""arcade"" style game. If you're into simulator style racing games, you probably aren't even looking at this franchise. If you want a fun, but less serious racing game, you should still stay away. I put three hours into it, forcing myself to enjoy, but failed. Luckily Steam refunded my money. Thank you Steam.			",46,1,5,2,4,0,0

TL;DR VERSION:GRID: Autosport is my favourite casual sim, with amazing physics (similar to GRID 1), good AI, great track selection, nice damage system, and beautiful graphics.Rating: 9/10Note: I recommend you read the in-depth review below and watch some gameplay videos!================================================================IN-DEPTH REVIEW:I'm writing this review with about 6 hours of play time logged, so keep that in mind.GRID Autosport is a great game. I has a few downfalls, but overall it is very enjoyable.Starting with the graphics/visual side, it has some great looking effects and beautiful lighting. Car models look a little on the low-detail side, but its not a very big problem.The in-car cameras, I have to say, fail. There's no working dials, and very low detail on the interiors. The mirrors don't work either. Depending on what your requirements are, this could be game breaking or just a 'meh' situation. I can live with it, because I'm not a hardcore sim player. It still needs fixing though, because sometimes it is a nice change to play inside the car.Physics wise, the game is super. It feels great with an Xbox 360 Gamepad, and absolutely jaw-droppingly amazing with a wheel (and I'm even using an old Logitech Momo wheel!). Haven't tried it with a keyboard yet. It's very accessable, but also quite deep. A very good example of 'simcade' handling, and a great improvement over GRID 2.My old Momo steering wheel worked fine first time, so thumbs up for old wheel support :)I don't know whether I like or hate the AI. I think maybe both. They are so damn agressive, it makes for some hair-raising, what-the-heck-how-did-I-pull-that-off racing, but also gets a bit rough, and can get on your nerves sometimes if you want to race clean. They'll grind and bump you quite regularly, so get used it it :)I haven't had a go at Online yet, I'll update the review when I do.Car list is good, ranging from the VW Golf, to the Bugatti Veyron and Koenigsegg (did I spell that right?) Agera. Like said before, it would be nice to have some higher quality car models, but it's not game breaking.There are a nice range of tracks, from Bathurst to the original San Francisco from GRID 1 (finally! I loved that track!).Performance is good, running it all maxed out at 1080p with a solid 60FPS on a GTX 980 Ti and i7 6700k.-------------------Pros & Cons List:Pros:+ Nice Graphics (eye candy, track detail).+ Jaw dropping handling (in my opinion).+ Supported my old Momo Force Feedback wheel.+ AI provide a good challenge, and make the races exciting+ Good car list, nice variety (all DLC included).+ Nice range of tracks (all DLC included).+ Good optimization, had no hitches getting it running.Cons:- The car models are not as high quality as I'd like (but lower quality models help with optimzation).- Interior views are lacking detail.- AI can get too rough.Overall: 9/10------------------Thanks for reading :)			",44,6,33,2,6,0,0

												In short? This has quickly become an absolute favorite of mine. If you enjoyed the first GRID, had fun with the second, or didn't play either but just like racing games, this is a fine investment. It plays relatively similarly to the first, leaning slightly more towards simulation, but is still accessible enough as long as you generally treat the cars like cars, so with the heavily adjustable difficulty and wide range of game modes, if it looks good to you, you can find something to enjoy here.The original GRID jumped around between many different racing disciplines, keeping things exciting as you could jump from open-wheel races to demolition derbies at will. GRID 2 was a more linear set of races; luckily, Autosport finds a middle-ground and divides the game into 5 main disciplines: Touring, Open-Wheel, Endurance, Tuner, and Street. Touring is basically classic bumper-to-bumper racing on circuits, Open Wheel is faster and more fragile, Endurance is night racing (in the single-player maps, at least) with time-accelerated tire wear, Tuner is a collection of extra modes like Time Attack and Drift with classic cars, and Street uses road courses and supercars. Outside of the single-player career, you can combine any car set with any tracks.There's a pretty massive selection of tracks, thanks in no small part to, well, the vast majority being ports from GRID 1 and 2. Those games' globetrotting feel was often hampered by going back to the same locations again and again within the same tours, but with (the majority of) their rosters combined, repetition happens a lot less (though still a tad often in longer seasons). Normally, I find circuit racing a bit of a bore in terms of visuals, but all the courses here are rather beautiful, and visually interesting enough to be distinguishable.I have bought a ton of racing games and played through a ton of career modes, so the structure of the single-player campaign struck me as a little odd; you're a driver for hire who picks a team contract and then works with that set of cars, sponsors, and teammates for the rest of the season, which is also a pre-set bundle of races (and between races, you can save and exit the season, returning to it later). Still, it feels pretty awesome to be the one they bring in to turn the tide; typically the contracts are from rival teams who pit you against whichever you didn't pick. In any case, these mean huge sets of events with points standings that run across them from beginning to end, which is hit-or-miss. Sometimes it's an intense battle, sometimes it just drags and you're slogging through more and more of the same thing. The GRID seasons definitely remedy this by hopping between all disciplines, but there's only three of them.The actual classic GRID 1 sort of experience - buy your cars, customize them, make paint schemes, and so on - is actually moved to the online modes, weirdly. However, you don't have to play multiplayer to make use of these. Every week, it generates six new weekly challenges, mixing and matching car classes and tracks to make unique events that breath a little new life into the game on a regular basis. As such, it's the one game I come back to every single week. It doesn't penalize you for not showing up; it's entirely optional and extremely fun.That's how I'd sum this up. Extremely fun. Despite anything else one might find fault with this, the handling is absolutely superb, the game is just forgiving enough to encourage genuine racing tactics without demolishing you for the slightest slip-up, and the massive amount of content makes absolutely no sacrifice of quality for quantity. This game makes my laptop run really, really hot, and I've gone the past few months with rather consistent burn marks on my legs because that's not gonna stop me from playing more of this. There is so, so much here that if you just want one racing game that will cover nearly everything, well... this is it. I can't recommend it enough.			",202,57,48,14,17,5,10

												Very disappointing.Not being able to create your own team, buy your own cars (like in the first Grid), had made this game meaningless. You are nothing more than a driver racing cars you neither picked nor own, for a team that's not yours. You have no stake, no affection with whatever you're doing at all. That drains away all the motivation to pick this game up and race again.And if you're saying that the racing expereince is all that matters, then I can name at least 5 other games which do that equally well, and on top of that, give you a sense of belonging to your beloved cars.

												What I've played so far, it is a great racing-simulator. Everything seems pretty realistic like physics, driving and so on. The only really arcade-like thing that I noticed is the well-known flashback function, which is helping out a lot.Personally, I like racing games with a little more to them than just racing. I'm more of an arcade racing-guy, and GRID Autosport seems to head down the simulator track this time. But if you're a fan of racing-simulators, I say go ahead. You might love this one!

												Nothing short of what i expected it to be. An amazing racing game. My only problem is that in the POV camera, it looks horrible, the interior design on the cars seem to not even be remotely textured. Other than that its very good. If I were to be honest, i dont think it could compete in the simulation/arcade, racing games such as Forza 5 or Grand Turismo. It does have its pros and cons as any game should, and its in its first release build, so its too be expected, maybe they will polish it in the future.			",63,3,3,2,4,0,10

												Change of review... (old one see bottom of this, hypocrite maybe)So, I did like this until Codemasters and a few of the devs on here mentioned they are working on a new engine. Then the placebo wore off. Then F1 2014 came out, nearly everyone complained it was a clone of 2013 and again Codemasters stated they are working on a new engine. So basically all we have here are 2 games, very similar to the last, with yet another price tag to pay.If you own 1 and 2 I would say save your money. The online mode is almost dead, the game hasn't delivered in fairness. You will still see the same cars winning above any other like the 4wd Golf etc. The crash system hasn't stopped fools having a laugh. The tracks are mostly the same, along with the darby races brought in as a ""free"" dlc (wish they brought more of Showdown into that dlc).And finally, my biggest problem, the real life physics. Disk breaks still only glow for a few second and don't ware, the handling is still too ""drifty"" and you get no sense of the car your driving from any other. Cars are all the same blah blah blah blah.Again if you buy this try and enjoy the placebo while it lasts. Otherwise wait for Project Cars this March or the next in Codemasters plans. Provided they give the new games the lift it really needs, not something that feels very very much descended from ps1's Colin Mcrae... 26th June, 2014YES YES YES! Thank you to all the team over at Codemasters! I never got early access, but read many reviews. Most good, but some talked about handling being well rubbish, wobbly, no grip. Obviously these people haven't taken a real car into a corner at 70mph. I would say its near spot on. Grid 2 I hated, you just turn full lock and floor it. This you think, you slow down and you gently turn into a corner. Just what a good racing game should be. I finally feel we are all out of this NFS arcade way of driving. Its very early days now so haven't really played the game enough to fully see how things go but one things for sure. Your not going to play online only to have one option of wining a race, Ie follow the sheep and only drive one car on each class. Just what racing games needed. I will give a better review in the coming weeks. And once again thank you!!!  ",75,11,15,7,19,0,5

												You want the truth, so here it is: I wish Steam had a stars rating system... I'd give it 3 out of 5.  This game is very good, and really is worth the purchase.  (At least until something better comes along.)Some will criticize it as being ""simcade"", harping on ""mediocre physics"", etc., and they're right that it's a simcade but not right about the physics at all.  So here's how it really is.  The physics are top notch, simulation grade.  However, great physics don't make a simulator.  True, great physics are a requirement of being a simulator, but a simulator is more than just a set of well implemented physics rules.  That is where such critics get confused: they tend to view physics and simulation as one and the same, but that's just not reality.  The handling and physics models really are quite good.  (The only aspect of physical simulation I think they could improve greatly on is the force feedback - it's good, but not great.)However, this game is a GAME, first and foremost.  What separates it from the likes of iRacing is not ""bad physics"" (again, they're quite good) but the approach to development, which is very game oriented.  For instance, many of the cars DON'T actually handle like their real world counterparts (for instance the GT-R is far more ""understeery"" than it is in real life)... however, they DO handle very much like *A* real car... just not necessarily the car being represented.  I believe the reason it is that way is because of lack of research - research I'd guess the developer didn't feel was necessary since the goal was balanced gameplay, and as long as they acheived balanced trade-offs within a given class of car, and it was approximately true to life, that was ""good enough"".  (However, in my opinion, it's NOT good enough, but I digress.)Another aspect that is very game-ish rather than simulation-ish, is the A.I. (computer driven) cars/players are extremely and frustratingly aggressive.  I read in the developer's blog how proud they were of their aggressive A.I., but I feel they missed the mark.  In real life racing, there is aggression, no doubt, but there is also a sense of caution... no pro race car driver will intentionally derail another driver into a potentially fatal crash - unless they want to be arrested for manslaughter.  Gently tapping/touching/etc. to throw another driver off their game, sure, that happens in real life (and is very controversial)... but repeated hammering until you spin out of control or completely T-boning your car is absolutely NOT realistic.  At times, Grid Autosport reminds me of the old game ""frogger"", where it feels like the point is to dodge speeding cars as you cross the road, cars that are actually trying to hit you (or at least don't care at all if they do.)  To make this worse, if you return the aggression, the A.I. cars are very difficult to disorient or make slide/spin, whereas they can feel free to derail you at will.  This is the most frustrating aspect of Grid Autosport.  To introduce this kind of A.I. logic is to add a layer of ""random chance""... a layer that is very inappropriate in a purely skill oriented venue.Frankly, I don't think that Codemasters (the developer) really understands their audience - we want the wonderful online gameplay and comradery (which is excellent by the way), great cars to drive (and they are) in an immersive and realistic environment (also quite good), but we don't want to waste our time on ""games of chance"".  Racing is a purely skill oriented discipline... there's no element of random chance whatsoever (not counting weather, which Grid Autosport doesn't have anyhow.)  We want the good aspects of ""gameplay"" with the best of simulation... because we want to believe that we're real live race car drivers... that's the illusion we want to buy when we give them our money.  This is where Codemasters really misses the mark - they don't seem to get that at all - they seem only to understand the ""rules of game design"" without considering what we the audience really, truly want: A racing simulation that keeps us immersed and believing that it’s real but gives us a sense of PROGRESSION and ACHEIVEMENT found primarily in games.  Ruining the illusion with random chance and puerile A.I. ruins the experience, and wastes our time and money.The bottom line is that the physics are excellent (if you can forgive inaccurate representations of specific cars), the graphics are excellent, online racing is outstanding, but the A.I. is horrible, frustrating, and hardly fun at all.  If it weren't for the great online gameplay, I'd say avoid this title, but on the whole, it's worth getting.			",65,1,8,5,7,0,1

												I spend almost 2500 hours in this game so I must say that Grid Autosport is a great game worth a lot of time playing.To make 2500 hours long story shorter I will simply just write down whats good and whats bad from my point of view  GOOD- great realistic racing,awesome gameplay- cars are nicely devided by classes,so whatever car you choose it is the right one and it gives you the opportunity for close racing- tuning cars is very effective,large possibility for improvement and setting the car according to your style- multiplayer is made very well,racing,leveling each discipline,leveling cars,racenet challenges,upgrades,tuning,repairs    and the whole online career is great- penalties for cutting the corner are made well and don't cause pileup crashes on multiplayer like on GRID 2- idea about racenet clubs is great- AI behavior and difficulty- great graphics,physics and car damage  BAD- worst career mode so far from a GRID series (playing just as a driver for a hire,long and boring progress,no money to spend)- some bugs that has never been fixed (racing line bug,AI stuck on multiplayer,save data corrupt which is the worst case scenario bug)- most of the tracks and cars are already seen and played in GRID 2- not enough room in multiplayer garage to have a car for every class- so-called ""riding the wall"" thing is yet again very possible- expiriance points system on multiplayer is very bad (same xp for a 1 lap or a 20 laps race)- same engine sound use 2 different cars (Ford Sierra and Lancia Delta have the same engine sound for example and some others like that)- THERES NO CORVETTE IN THE GAME!As a fan of a GRID series this game deserves a great 8.5/10 it's a great realistic racing game that most of us wanted at the first place after GRID 1,but on the other hand there is a big taste of this being just a very quick game build and a remake of GRID 2			",21,1,4,3,0,0,6

												So, after I bought this game for about 6 dollars on *steam censorship*.com, I thought about making a review about this.So, how does it drive?Actually, better than I thought. I expected some kind of GRID 2-ish handling, but it drives way more like DiRT 3 with more grip and only on ashpalt. Although it is pretty much realism-trimmed, It´s still very fun to drive, especially the Street Cars.And if you´re looking for the most realistic game of the GRID franchise, here you go.The Drift Races still suck tho.Content?Yes.How much?Very much. Most tracks are taken from GRID/GRID 2, but all of them are redone. San Francisco looks way better now. But of course there are multiple new tracks, a few city tracks and race tracks like Hockenheimring and Red Bull Ring (I think, read that somewhere)There is a huge range of cars, everything from numerous kinds of street cars, over classic japanese tuners, muscles and even damn racing trucks, to formula/indycars and touring cars.Grafficks?They exist. And it looks awesome for a game on an engine from 2006. And the difference in graphics between DiRT and GRID Autosport is like the difference between Battlefield BC and Battlefield 4.ayy lmao, dis no sim racur, dis no hev weel optiuns.You´re right, except you´re wrong. Codie´s fixed that in the meanwhile and if you got a Force Feedback Wheel, please try this, this is so much fun with a FFB Wheel.Multiplayer?Exists too. Haven´t tried it yet though.Overpriced?Actually not at all. GRID 2 is overpriced, I won´t pay 30 bucks for Tokyo Drift Simulator. But for the content this is actually wellpriced. Wouldn´t buy the DLCs though, not a fan of them anyway.Cockpit view?Yeeeeahhh-no. Something weird. You have a Dashcam and a normal Cockpit Cam, but the dash in Cockpit Cam is all blurred out for you, so you can´t see that Codemasters didn´t put an HQ Cockpit in your car or even the dials don´t work.Story?noone cares m8The End?Yes. Overall this is a Wellpriced, good looking, well drivable Racing Simulator. Get it. And if you´re a ch33ky♥♥♥♥♥n199a like me who doesn´t want to pay 40 bucks for a game, get it on *steam censorship* or *steam censorship* for way less money. Whatever it costs below 40 bucks, it´s worth it. Get it. NOW!			",136,7,33,3,5,1,5

												Do yourself a favor and buy Grid 1. This Grid:Autosport has a very sh*tty handling, VERY poor sense of speed, the cockpit view is blured like it' 1998. Sound of the cars is crap too. The sense of speed is so bad, I take a E92 M3 , corner it and 99% times I think that my car fully stopped (it's moving so slow) and the tacho shows 98 km/h. Race driver GRID (GRID 1) was an amazing racer. I still play it rather then this one. Better handling, better sounds, better cockpit .It's a shame, Codemasters had such a great franchise with Grid 1, Grid 2 was also bad, and now this one..			",49,2,9,11,1,0,1

												By far the best value in PC Arcade racers today. While games like Assetto Corsa and Project Cars concentrate on realizm and driving simulator game play, Grid Autosport balances nicely between Arcade and Sim racers. Course designs are easily familiar to the real world courses and course diversity is average. Custom Skins and the abilty to make groups is great but the online multiplayer sessions can be a bit confusing at times when you are trying to meet up with a buddy due in part to the cumbersome RaceNet interface which differs from regular online play.  The stoyline, while lengthy and appears to be full of diverse content, ultimately forces a driver to be all things to all forms of racing, which si not something that actually happens in the racing world. Graphics are 9/10, Audio is 9/10, Controls support 9/10 and content 8/10 (just because I am not into all the tuner and drift stuff). Overall I rate the game 85-90 out of 100 in total game ranking & is worth the on sale price.			",430,56,40,38,43,2,44

Only buy if you play Singleplayer or have a set of friends to play with in Multiplayer.I bought the game at its release and this is what's negative about it:CONS- Codemasters community manager repeatedly claimed that they would constantly improve and patch the game for at least a year after its release. He blatantly lied. - Online play is pretty much dead, you have to switch your Steam download region to UK to be able to find some players- Cheaters in multiplayer matches, cheats which their anticheat can't detect and exist since the release, the kind of cheats which slightly increase your grip or acceleration so beginners think their cars just have better upgrades. - Driving and body physics are fairly arcade-like and unpredictable at times, some cars feel clumsy, e.g. with a keyboard you can't corner as good as a gamepad driver due to steering angle problemsFor me personally it's an improvment towards GRID 2 but still a step backwards compared to GRID 1. So overall it's playable but still a disappointment.I recommend buying ""Forza Horizon 3"" instead.			",132,7,4,7,6,1,5

												I bought this game thinking it would be completely different than the other games in the GRID series. The ""authentic handling"" as stated in the description caught my eye as GRID 2 was all about drifting every single car around corners at crazy speeds. I was very disappointed to learn that nothing has changed. This game feels like GRID 2 with better graphics, the same drifty handling, and the same waste of money for someone looking for a, ""authentic handling"" or simulator experience. This brings me to the controls, I'm sure the game is manageable with a controller or even a keyboard and mouse, but with a wheel like a G27, good luck. The shifting, should you choose to use a manual transmission with a clutch and H shifter is horrid, cars pop out of gear at random times and most of the time you can't put the car back into gear because the game simply won’t recognize it. All in all, the game isn't what I was looking for and Codemasters has only given the series a new set of pretty textures and not much else. If you liked the other GRID games, by all means this is nothing different but if your someone looking for a sim experience I recommend you look into Race 07, and Asseto Corsa and not dump $50 on this game like I did.

75/100Pretty fun racing game!  I expected it to be more realistic when it comes to car handling, but it is in fact quite arcady and a bit loose. I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.The game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low. One really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality. As for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well. Overall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.			",148,11,15,23,22,1,29

												Having over 600 hours in this game, having a lot of fun racing, having completed all achievements;I do not recommend this game!Here are the simple reasons why:A.I. online driver system is broken: It happens in online racing that A.I. drivers will not show up on the starting grid, or never leave at the start of the race. This results in them never finishing that race and all players being stuck in a lobby, having to reset the game.My savegame got corruptedSteam Cloud my♥♥♥♥♥(and i'm fairly confident that VAC is also falsely advertised). Anyway i lost my complete carreer, all my cars, all my cash. Which brings me to my next two:Chunks of money vapor from your bankaccount.Leveling system in cars. May have seemed like a good idea, but with this small community it's simply impossible to level max some cars. I'm not a fan. (Cheatengine helps here, ""c'mon Codies, don't ban me for this, you forced this upon me."")Keyboard input randomly stops for a splitsecond! Yes i am a keyboard racedriver, sorry... But seriously on random moments in a race my car will go straight on while already cornering and tapping my keys, they suddenly don't register anymore. Not cool at all and conciderably gamebreaking! Especcially uncool when it causes me to crash another racer offtrack. And NO it's not a hardware failure, i've had this on different systems and keyboards and heard others experiencing this. (sidenote, aside for this bug the controlabilty of the cars through keyboard is great!! no controler or wheel needed)Garage limitation. There is not enough room in the garage to buy a racecar for every racing class. There is DLC available for €7.- !!! to expand your garage with just 5 slots, still not enough to have a racecar in every class. Shamefull! I would even prefer to have 2 owned cars in some classes..Still.... bearing through all this, i DO ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME, a lot! It's a great and fun racing game, looks great feels great plays great, a nice community, friendly fair, but unfortunatly thinning out. Don't be too surprised when there is no one to race against at 3.00 am on a weekday. Check the playercount yourselves, here: http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=grid+autosportConcidering all this, can i fully recommend this? No.  Will i myself buy the next Grid game? Likely yes, on a sale. If it has good reviews,Tip for the Codies: Your game installments could do well with a replay system of online races, like .demo files. Allowing your racers to capture races from playback. I.m.o. there is no better promotion than good YouTube coverage of your game.I would have uploaded tons of races if a had an option to watch and record a replay later.			",92,12,3,5,6,0,3

												The game looks very pretty, but the physics are just wrong..  If you are looking for an arcade game then this one is not bad.  But if you are looking for a sim to get on par with iRacing / Asseto Corsa/ RF2 Then look elsewhere.  The game's AI is pretty bland and dumb. and the controlls expecially the steering just feels wrong.  and the interface could use a drastic overhaul.The nice thing about this is they have an option to place a spectator view on a 2nd display which i think is great, however expect it to pretty much kill any system using that option.

												After Grid 2, I felt there was a lot of good things to be made in the next instalment in the GRID series and I was happy to find out that many were improved. I have invested easily twice the time when comparing to GRID 2 and there was a reason for this. The multi-disciplined Events offer you a lot more variety and it's great for those who are a fan of mixing different race styles. From Endurance races to Tuner and Street you also have Touring Events and Open Wheel as well giving you different tastes of what's available in the racing words. For me all were great aside of any Drift events. It's nothing personal but I love to race in all sorts of classes but when it comes to win by points in a corner by making good use of your handbrake the racer fan in me feels a bit bored. As you advance in all events you will get a chance of having better sponsors interested in you with more difficulty and challenging objectives to complete such beating a rival time, finish above 5th place, then 3rd place and so on.There is a clear effort in making this game a pleasant experience for the racing fans but even after so many efforts there is still much to be done. Endurance races are great but it lacks some proper tuning and the duration of most of them are not really what I would call endurance since the bigger ones are around 12 minutes long. Qualifications are back and it's a great opportunity to set a time to start on a better position. The audio is the best effort I've seen in the grid series. You really do not need any soundtrack or any other sound effect. You just need to remove all the hud in the game, increase the volume and you will have such a good time driving while pushing to the max to the next gear. There are also little things that did not go unnoticed. For instance, you can ask (with the D-pad) what is the current state of your car (gearbox, engine damage, etc) as well the position of your rival, team-mate and so on. If you are entering a tunnel and you ask for this info you can see there's a difference in the sound from the speaker since the signal may be weaker. These little things are always appreciated. One last thing regarding the sound: I loved GRID 2 main theme and it's a such a shame that I felt a downgrade regarding the tunes/themes in the menus (not to mention these menus are quite... bland). Then there are the community feedback that Codemasters did or tried to achieve with things like the Cockpit view. For many racing fans this view not only is a must but it's also the only view they play their racing games. So, in order to keep fans happy Codemasters implemented this view but to be honest this was the most poor effort I've seen in adding something that is a big request in these games. First I thought that my eyes were deceiving me because I've played and seen many recent games with great looking cockpit views like Driveclub and Project Cars so it crossed my mind I was not being fair to GRID Autosport since this game was released some time ago. Then I just remembered. Games like Dirt 2 or Dirt 3 do have a cockpit view and they are quite nicely done, if you ask me. So what happened here? Was no time to develop a better view and they just tried a quick solution? For those who haven't seen it, go check it out. It's a dark, blurry mess with no details at all. Seriously. This was such a wasted opportunity and I can see why so many fans were upset with all this.One thing I also liked was the Cups between the major events. This would be races without a team member and they had a great selection of either prototypes or older gems, something I'm fond of. But still, I wish I could have seen more of them.In the end, I had great fun with Autosport. I played more than 50 hours, I did more than 400 races, leveled up every single category to level 10 or above and finished all the major events, all cups with many qualifications as well. Side Curiosity: It is thanks to Ben Gouldstone, the Senior Game Designer of Driveclub that the racetrack from Algarve, in Portugal is a reality after he gave this feedback to the Codemasters team. It's great to see when companies are open to all sorts of feedback in order to bring more variety and content to their games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The best experince for me on the road with super cars!Graphics are great even at medium settings, expect for the blurry cockpit view, but all the others are fine to me, and the game runs fine and stable even on onboard graphic cards like the Intel HD ones.Cars and the enviroment looks great, so detailed that i can see the the reflection on the car easily (medium settings).Great combination between arcade racing game and simulation racing game, not too easy to steer like Need for Speed, but also not too hard like F1 games, this will make lots of gamer happy, specially casual gamersDrive on 5 disciplines with many cars, so thrilling and exciting, test your driving skills at all 5 of them.10 teams, racing at the GRID Lengends series, join one of them and lead that team to victory, great move Codemaster =))The AI are a little more agressive than GRID 2, they will try to smash your car, try to make you out of the race, be careful! One things i don't like is the Multiplayer, still reigon lock, still no world wide multiplayer, still have to change download reigon to UK before playing the multiplayer, that really annoys me when i download a new game, have to change back to my country to download it, even though the multiplayer is good, you can join a team and race with them. That really interested me =))The game is great, if you're fan or would lilke to play simulation racing game (not too hard, for casual players), you should buy it.

												So yeah, another GRID game. Please note that my opinion is based on Linux version' experience.A bunch content from older Codemasters games. Apart from visuals and other whistles and bells, I feel that circuits like Istanbul Park or Hockenheimring haven't changes at all, for worse, and more importantly, better. They are just the same.Graphics are nice, although I suspect that Linux port lacks few effects. Handling is not arcade-like, but still makes you think sometimes that first GRID back in 2007 was more realistic. But the only REAL issue is that this will be probably another Codemasters' racing game you'll never beat -- there's so much old content that you'll probably get bored halfway.Nevertheless, thumbs up. There's very few racing games on Linux whatsoever, and this is definitely not a bad one.			",100,17,9,13,14,0,15

												Pros:Great sense of speed when driving (most important thing in a racing game)Large variety in gameplay modes even without the DLCGreat career mode loaded with car variety, race/event variety, sponsors and splintering objectivesOnline challenges even without a present online communityGreat graphicsCustom tailored difficultyCosmetic car damage including option to affect vehicle performanceFlashback option allowing for rewinds to retry certain moments as opposed to restarting an entire race (newbie friendly)Cons:Driver side view isn't in HD. Blurry, none of the meters work. Extremely limiting in viewRavenwest Team (Developer's team) is unagonizingly cheapPolarizing AI. Can create distance in some races, impossible to shake off in others (rubberband AI)Certain AI race on a track and will not stop even when you block them causing them to just railroad youOverall a great racing game with a varied career mode, great graphics, great style all around. Cars look gorgeous, races are intense and game is just fun overall.			",390,73,18,49,32,4,63

												This game is amazing if you like racing games, if you notice, all the bad reviews are from people with less than 2 hours of playing, and wanted an easy racing game, i honestly don't like the endurance races, but the rest is awsome, and every car feels diferent, and no, it's not like driving on ice, if you have a driver license, and drive a car daily, you will know the game physics are almost on point compared to real life.In my opinion, GRID Autosport took the best of the original GRID and made ir better, the only let down i had, was not being able to choose the teammate, because the one you are given, normaly suck, and the fact we cannot buy cars.But on the other hand, in online mode, we can buy/sell cars, and have alot of fun with other racers, so enjoy! :)			",48,0,1,6,5,1,4

												This is one of those ""rare"" PC games that can be discribed as ""done."". Hard to find these days.GRID Autosports is a content filled but not overburdened racer with various types of cars, tracks and gameplay.It runs smooth at rock solid 60 fps with no stuttering or hickup, even on mid class rigs and... it... just makes a lot of fun to play. ;) Slick menus, wonderful graphics and believable car physics with good headroom to dig into and master every aspect of the ideal racing line. If you like racing games done with passion and have a heart for devs that still take the pc serious: grab your copy now! ;)			",248,24,9,16,30,0,24

												Be aware that the reinstatement of the cockpit cam is not as excellent as it first sounds.  It's blurry, very very blurry.  Playing with hud off.  Clearly the steering wheels in the open wheel cars are designed to have info on them such has shift lights, speedometers or whatever.  But instead its a blurry mess with no useful information.  It wouldnt be so bad if the lights on my G27 were supported.Fix it codemasters. Not in a special DCL, not with a community mod, and you can have your positive review.This will make me think twice before buying F1 2014 which I was looking foreward to.			",137,16,12,7,16,0,30

												GRID Autosport is a racing game released by Codemasters in 2014. Similar to the Colin McRae Rally games, GRID Autosport takes us to the world of professional racing, on a variety of authentic tracks, with real cars from around the world. Not exactly a driving simulator, more like a racing career simulator, as you get sponsors, achieve objectives. I compare all racing games to Gran Turismo 2, which is arguably one of the best racing/driving sims ever made, and GRID Autosport does a good job of trying to live up to such high standards. Unfortunately, I found the lack of individual car customization to be a disappointment, and I wish that you could buy cars as you win races and earn money. This isn't the case however, as  you earn reputation and experience, instead of cash, for winning. Still a great game, lovely detail, the tracks are challenging, the AI is competitive, I think racing fans will enjoy this game.			",479,176,24,74,66,6,86

												Despite the claim that the save game corruption bug was fixed, it is still there. So be prepared to lose all of the hours of gameplay you spent randomly at any given time.Happened to me, and my friend i was playing it with, within the same weekend. For a game where so much of it is based on your levels and progress, that is for sure a total mood killer!			",216,32,3,59,35,0,74

												For some reason everyone seems to be following the Forza ""smooth loading screen"" especially for racing games. I'm also not extremely well versed in the GRID series so I don't have any comparison reviews here. This is a ""hey look what I got for free with my GPU"" review. GRID visually is stunning. I like it, I like the fact I can race about any car (especially F1 cars). Maybe it's because I'm playing on a keyboard, the steering seems a bit stiff. Tried switching to a gamepad and still sort of found it the same. The campaign itself is nice, gratifying as you go along upgrading the car you drive or buying another. There is also a feature where if you messed up royally on a turn you can hit ""rewind"" and go back before the turn.GRID is simply another racing game to be honest. The graphics are unbelievable but so are many other racing games. The driving sort of feels arcade to me. Does it mean GRID is a bad game? Not necessarily no. But I wouldn't say it's worth $50.00. I would give it an 8 but it's another racing game in my eyes. I would recommend Need For Speed Shift 2 over this. Shift literally feels like your driving a car. Overall : 7/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B+ Sounds / Music B+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Well, what can i say?  I thought this maybe a return to the excellent days of TOCA but I was sadly mistaken.  If you are a fan of race sims and use a wheel then I'm afraid this game is a waste of money.  In single player mode the AI just smash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you and it's even worse online.  The game is infested with joypad players who are just zig zagging all over the track and don't seem to realise that the idea of the game is to try and pass you fair and square.  However, what your sadly presented with is a community full of ""smash to pass"" players who don't seem to have any grasp of the words ""Gentlemanly Behaviour"".  I've done several online races now and there doesn't seem to be any penalties for contact but theres plenty of penalties for clipping a corner a SMALL degree (With two tyres still on the tarmac and inside the white line).  I'm sorry but this is just another GRID with the same old churned up♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with additional cars and tracks (Most of which have been produced for their other games such as  the F1 series) which has been produced for the chavvy masses to smash the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of each other.  Oh, the graphics are excellent but the interior views are all blurred out as they couldn't be arsed to go into detail....another♥♥♥♥♥♥part of this extremely poor game.   4/10 -  I've had more fun having teeth pulled out.

												I bought this game for the multiplayer games.That's the biggest mistake I made.The multiplayer is dead.No one plays it and you'll have to change your download region to UK in order to find matches.That's ridiculous.I think it's better if you wait for a little while until this game gets more popular if you wanna buy it.I wasn't really interested in the single player games,though.So I only played the single player for the first 2 races.To be honest,I'm not really worth it to not recommend this game since I only played for 1 hour.It's just totally disappointing that no one plays the multiplayer because my main reason for purchasing steam games was for the multiplayer expierence.And about the game's content,I'll say the overall is really great.Stunning graphics,cool cars,and the engine sound makes you wanna drive more and more.But with the dead multiplayer,I lost my whole interest in this game.

												If you like the type of a game where you want to throw your pad at the wall out of anger and then pick it up 2 mins later to continue playing this might be perfect for you.TL;DRIf you plan to get the game for some single player racing - don'tIf you plan to get the game for some multi player racing - don'tUnless you are a fan of GRID games and can get it for like 5$ max, you can buy it if you want to.Good things:1. Graphics and optimisation The game looks really nice, even compared to new games and it's so well optimised that a decent pc can run it at medium-high or high settings with 60+fps. Night races are good looking and occasional eye catchers like jets or baloons are a nice thing.2. Driving modelIt's not a simulator, but still, driving model is very nice and somehow addicting, it's just fun driving in this game.3. Multiplayer part 1If you can get few friends to play with you, the game can be really fun.Meh things:1. SoundsSound is okay-ish, cars sound good, there is also some music. Nothing too impressive, but not bad either.2. Career modeAt the beginning it's fun, but after some time it gets so boring and repetitive you completely space out when you want to do it. For the occasional races it's much better to create your own cup.3. Amount of carsWell, there are many known cars, both old and new ones, but still, feels like more wouldn't hurt and well...who wouldn't want more cars?4. RacenetSometimes connecting to racenet takes a while - it's not a super long time, but still few seconds. It can be annoying when you have to do it multiple times.Bad things:1. AIPeople responsible for creating AI for this game should be tied to a pole and hit with rotten tomatoes for every ruined race. The AI is just made to irritate the player as much as possible, it's the cause of failing like 80 out of 100 races. They block your line on purpose, won't let you pass on straights unless the track is wide, block you on the corners while they're slow as snails, block the hell out of the road on first corners, brake early, sometimes they crash with each other and they even ram you off the road. They feel like they have only two states - either you don't exist for them on the track, or you do, but they are so agressive it's ridiculous. Driving among them feels like defusing 5 bombs at the same time - you never know which one will do what. They can easily do the pit maneuver on you, but if you try to ram them out of anger, their cars behave like they weight at least 4 tons. It's worth noting that if you manage to pass an AI car, they seem to slow down. They also don't get any penalties...oh those penalties...2. Penalties So what about the remaining 20 out of 100 causes of faling the races? 6 of them are crashing the car or going off the track by yourself and ridiculous penalties you get for cutting the track are the other 14.Sure, there definitely should be a way to punish the player for cutting the track, but the system in this game...it's crap.Penalties slow you down to 50 km/h for a short duration, which is decided by how much you've cut the track...well that's all in theory, in practice you get 5 seconds of penalty for slightly-yet-completely-acceptable cutting when you go over the white line by few centimenters or sometimes even not go over it at all. That type of penalty completely ruins your lap or race and all the fun in trying to get the best time as possible by creating the fastest racing line by yourself. This penalty system was a failure from the very beginning, sadly there's nothing that can be done about it. A simple time penalty PROPERLY calculated would be much better.3. Weekly challengesWhile they are a good way to earn money in the game, it's extremely frustrating. In theory you can compete with other players in the world for the best time while getting paid for it - sounds nice? BAM, in reality you get the two problems from above and sometimes some ridiculous requirements for platinum. I'm 99% sure nobody checks if those times are possible to beat, just some AI(ugh) system sets it. I'm not the best driver there is, but good enough to be really fast with practice, and sometimes even when you practice one challenge over and over and over again until there's nothing that can be improved, you're still not getting that platinum. Weird thing is sometimes it's so easy to get platinum you can get it on the first try, even with some racing errors.4. Multiplayer part 2Well. we know how multiplayer racing games are - there are many good, clean racers and also there are the ones that crash other players and ruin the fun - this game is no different. Who knows, maybe those crashers are people who got angry at the AI? You can kick crashers if they get enough votes to kick...yeah, ""if"" is the keyword.There is voice chat, which people with always-on-and-over-sensitive microphones love. You can mute them, no problem, but only if you're in the lobby before the race. Yep, even while you've crashed or abandoned the race, all you can do is listen to whiny comments or weird music or some other sounds.There is no text chat, which should be available in a pc game, but when you think about it - maybe it's better you don't have to read about who did what with your mother, but then again, they can crash into you instead, so I don't know really.There is also a small problem with lags. Sometimes you will get pushed out of the track and the other person might not even know about it and vice versa. The only solution to this is to keep a safe distance. And while we talk about multiplayer races...5. ""Rewards"" from racing......or rather lack of them. If you are racing in an expensive rental car, it won't matter if you finish 1st or 8th - you won't earn anything, instead you lose money for repairs after every race. I call it investing in the races to get better and have a laugh about it, but really I'm laughing through tears.So in the end very few pros and many cons. Shame really, this game had potential to be really fun, but too many things are just bad. I wouldn't recommend buying it, there are so many better alternatives.			",31,0,14,5,4,0,4

												There seem to be many negative reviews of this game mostly by people who have tired it for 5 mins and found that unlike Need for Speed and other driving games aimed at children and the feeble-minded, there is a learning curve.. you need to MAKE AN EFFORT.. you cannot drive GRID autosport and watch TV or text.. you need to concentrate and get the feel of the vehicles etc.. which is actually very realistic and rewarding and just about the best intuitive and responsive car handling that there is in ANY PC driving game currently available. If you want to slam in to all the barriers and hit everything but not lose speed this is not the game for you.. go play My Little Pony or some other empty pointless rubbish which is suited to you.Some people (beginners) told me that GRID autosport is not accessible , what they mean is 'not totally and effortlessly easy'... why bother to walk and talk.. did you learn that instantly??Single player mode is VERY CRAPPY and boring.. but who cares because the real action is online multiplayer where you can race others and create/host your own sessions with your choice of settings, cars and tracksDO NOT pay attention to the negative reviewers who speak more of themselves than of the game.Try it for yourself and you will see GRID autosport is quite simply one of the BEST driving games currently available.. one of the best EVER (so far)GRID Autosport is an excellent arcade racer with superb vehicle handling, an intuitive and very responsive fun racer from Touring Cars to Open Wheel, there's something to please everyone... except feeble-minded My Little Pony lamers.. and sad losers who are used to having everything done for them and mummy holding their hands.. oh there there little baby did the nasty game make you angry.. mummy will kiss it better.

												Grid Autosport brings more dreadful physics to the Grid experience where Racing Cars cannot steer around bends at 40mph without sliding into barriers. The whole game is just a continuation of the abysmal physics from Grid 2. Cars with zero grip on dry roads at low speeds, handling that's indistinct and floaty.Just stop now Codemasters. Really just stop. You made one good Grid game, the first one. I would recommend that to anyone who will listen.Grid Autosport and Grid 2 should be avoided like the plague. Fortunately I received this game free. I'd be furious if I'd have had to pay for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""Changed my headlight fluid, won at life.""  TEN'AH'TA'TEN! - BuckfugglyGamingGrid has and continues to be less of a simulation fans racing game for the sake of being more of an arcade racing game. And it does what it does as well if not better than it ever has before in Grid:Autosport. That being said, there is precious little telemetry and car customization and you're given little to no selection for what you'll be driving from one race to the next. And I hate that, I'm a sim-racing fan more than anything else. But I've enjoyed my time in Grid:Autosport for sure. You won't find bespoke graphical / mechanical car customization and selection in Grid, but  you will find lots of solid arcade (think ridge racer) fun.The HD textures (while perhaps one of my favorite optional free DLC offerings from devs of any game) causes what appears to be memory-leak crashes for me but the game is pretty enough in high-res mode for me to be fine without it. As for other visuals, I feel much more like I'm racing in particular cars than I have in other games, hatchbacks typically have some weighty body-roll thats ideal to pre-load going into a corner, and high-strung sports cars feel like their ""twitch"" is pushing your head around like it owes this game money.I have a few minor problems with the audio, but they're minor and can be completely overlooked unless you really care to hear them. The team radio announcer is a little bland most of the time and a bit uninformative. But I like the idea of having radio-comms to coordinate car condition and situational performance. I'd especially like it if more games swapped out some selectable or even voice activated voice checks for the typical HUD items that tend to litter most racing games.Split screen!!! Thank you! I wish more games tried a little harder to put/keep this in their PC games. I like online gaming, but few things are as satisfying as sitting next to the person you're stomping into a dirty mudhole on the track =)I really like the idea of a youtube button during replays for uploading them to youtube. A wonderful addition to a very pretty and exciting racing experience. And it has been pretty user-friendly (as far as reply controls go) for me to capture some decent footage for machinima things I do in my spare time. But the manually selectable camera angles are limited to the same ones you have access to during the race. So that could have maybe been better. Note* - the automated cinematic camera angles are on a loop, so if you're trying to get footage, it's easy to accidentally repeat the same exact camera angles over multiple takes.I've had zero problems using my cheapo (but heaven-sent) logitech gamepad with analog triggers with no in-game setup at all. Right outta the gate everything worked flawlessly. There's a lot to be said for that.I can't speak for the online play yet. But if I get around to giving it a shot I'll sure update my review accordingly.			",245,49,20,30,41,5,60

												Oh, Codemasters. I came into Autosport expecting nothing and I was still let down. Where do I start?The GOOD:-Nice overall detail-Tons of arcade(ish) fun!The BAD:-Horrible stutter-Floaty physics-Lackluster AIThe REVIEW:Being a longtime fan of Codemasters and their work (pre DiRT 2), I thought I'd give Autosport a try. I'd seen the horrible reviews that Grid 2 had recieved, and was quite disapointed, as I loved Grid 1. Luckily, I caught Autosport on a nice sale, and was quick to ignore the shoddy reviews because I'd caught it at such a steal. Boy, had I wished I listened. Oddly enough, Autosport proved itself fun in the start. While it presented itself as a hardcore racer for hardcore players, I was lied to, as Autosport's racing physics are at best arcadey, and at worst, unbearable. All cars felt like they handled the same- all that was changed was how much power they were capable of producing. Drifting F1 cars should not be possible.On top of that, the video stutter made a playable game unplayable. I've looked into this and have found that I'm not the only one with a stuttering problem. I've tried many fixes, but to no avail. The stutter comes and goes, however. Codemasters, why advertise a game as a hardcore sim when it's not even close?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do recommend Grid Autosport with a few hesitations. The graphics are stunning, the car models are great and the game is for the most part very well optimized for most mid to high end systems. The controls are very well executed, they feel smooth and responsive. Unless you're a hardcore racing purest I'd say pass this one up since you have no ability to choose and customize your own vehicle, they're preselected for you based on the sponsor you choose before entering into a season. The other part that bothered me significantly is that when you are leading a race your opponents appear to gain a significant speed boost and they easily overtake you and speed off into the distance as if you're standing still. The only way to midigate this issue is to turn down AI difficult which will actually impact the amount of xp you earn. If buying through steam I highly discourage it since Grid Autosport is not worth $40+ instead pick it up cheap on sites like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥etc then I recommend it as a fun and addicting time sink for a few days until you grow tired of it.

												Great game overall. THe only thing i can think of that sucks is when you join a multiplayer game you have to wait till the game ends to do anyting, you cant watch the action to pass the time (and see what the potential competion is like).Tracks are good (add ons make it even better) - overall one of the best driving games i have purchaed The list is...GP LegendsGTRGTR2GTR EvolutionRace 07SimRacewayRichard Burns RallyCMR 2,3,4,5Grid 1, 2 and this..DIrt 1,2,3 (showdown sucked for me- it wouldn't recognize a logitec g27 wheel)F1 2010,2011,2012,2013Shift 2(and a few others that i cant remember)It would be nice if there were more players online, but the Racenet Series where you race against your friends asyncronously is a realy bonus.. It still feels like multi player, but you just are not racing at exactly the same time. You are posting times that your friends compete against.Overall though- well worth the money!

												Well, it's exciting and in higher difficulty your opponents provide enough challenges. But it feels even more tilted to arcade side comparing to grid 1. Some times you can turn 90 degree sharp in a speed which will almost certain to cause slide. And when you slide, you can gain your control back without much trouble.Graphics are still decent by today's standards, but sky is static and a little distracting.			",71,4,2,6,4,1,13

												I'll preface this by saying that GRID Autosport is the most ""hardcore"" racing game that I own, so I'm not a simmer in any sense of the word. That being said, I play with a Track IR 5 and Logitech G25 on the ""manual H-patten + clutch"" setting on a 34"" ultrawide 21:9 display and it's very immersive. It's even possible to heel-toe downshift but sometimes it's a bit tricky since there's no feedback in the pedals. For a game, it's plenty of fun. The car selection is nice and the track selection is pretty good too. Generally I stick to GP circuits and play either open wheel or hot hatch since everything else just feels like a drift fest to me, but maybe I'm doing it wrong or something.Oh, and did I mention that it works on Linux and MacOS X too? I've played a bit on Macbook Pro running El Capitan with a Xbox 360 controller pad and the splitscreen works beautifully with full rumble support and everything. I've also got it running on Linux Mint 17.3 with my Logitech G25 with full force feedback and 900 degree support too.GRID Autosport has something for everyone and has great OS support and controller/wheel support. Get it!			",85,26,10,4,5,0,18

												The very first GRID was (and still is) my favorite arcade racing game. It had customizable difficulty, it had teams and sponsors and your really didn't have to be always first to win a championship (something that NFS Shift 2 had problems with). You could buy your own cars and customize it, so you can see how you progress through the game. And it was fun to play with AI, since it wasn't really good (i.e. cheating) or really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game just really balanced between arcade and sim and did it really good.Now in Autosport you still have customizable difficulty and same championship system. And it's pretty much it. AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that would just crash into you giving no♥♥♥♥♥♥about it whatsoever. You can't buy cars (well, you can in multiplayer, but you'll be given a car anyway when you joing a race). Well, I know that you race with teams and sponsors just provide you cars, but come on, it's not a sim, it's 100% NFS-like arcade, so what's the point of that? You don't really progress, you just comlete one season to unlock another and that's it (it gets really boring very quick. You know, the AI and♥♥♥♥♥♥. Oh, don't forget annoying bugs with resolution and fullscreen mode. So after all I would not recommend Autosport (even on sale). Just grab Race Driver: GRID instead.			",52,3,1,5,1,1,10

												Positives about the game:-So many cars so many track options, catergories like touring open wheel etc. contain a lot of cups opportunities to race on, and to level up both online and offline.-You can race, have a time attack or have checkpoint or eliminator races and also u have demilition derby, and of course drift events (there are dls which can give u something like drag racing too)Racenet challanges are rewarding, if u are in the top 30% of the leaderboards u can get like 45000 ingame money and by participating in one u can even level up.-You can make your own liveries which for me is a massive plus point with sponsors and what not, and the bigger money u have the better sponsors u can put on, which will earn you little amount of money after a multiplayer race.-Level system. in both career and online but especially online I like it, because we can sort of have an idea on who put a lot of effort into the game and good at the game and probably has upgraded veichles and who is someone with like 1 or 2 hours with level 1, in f1 games u have no idea about stuff like that until u go into the session. - Speaking of upgraded veichles, u can upgrade tune and as I said make your own livery for a veichle you own online, the more you race with it the bigger level it gets, for example after level 5 of ur car the brake bias tuning gets avaliable and etc u will get upgrades too which will make the can better as  I said. the biggest upgrade is at level 50-impact ratings: have u noticed in an online race there is a circle with a '!"" in it. know what that means? that shows the impact rating of a certain player I like that cause, for example if I see someone with an orange  I will try and be aware as it means that he is likely to crash into me, and white is ""super clean""- Difficulty bonus. in every mode u race in pretty much (there are exceptions) u will get difficulty bonus depending on how challenging u choose to race. for example lets say u are on 38% bonus with 3 flashbacks, now if u put them to unlimited it will be lower, by a lot actually, and the whole bonus will be based on how u choose to race, without tc abs or force inside camera and stuff like that - This game rewards you for putting the time into it and experience, as u need to build up your progress to higher levels in order to reach like sponsors or for example garage slots.- Damage model is cool, the car deformates in many ways- The game looks beautiful despite me having a bad equipment- Racenet clubs. u can make a group where ur friends join, and u can put on a custom livery for that club, u dont have to make a livery for every car, u can just quickly choose that livery and go with it (of course if u dont have time or don't want to make a livery)---Open for updates, I can update this review later---Slight negatives (these negatives don't make me hate the game but they can be annoying)AI- They sometimes have no respect to you they push you off track and in some cases crash into you that u get damage, I reccomend u to be careful in every mode with damage on also have like 1-3 flashbacks.- During online if u have a loan veichle, after a race u get ridicolous amounts of damage expences sometimes even after winning, like -8000 d.e. and like 3000 for everything else, its just not cool, and unfortunetaly I can't own every veichle on a low level obviously.- You can only race RavenWest in carrer after u won that season u can't start a new season with it which is a shame- Engineer speaking skills :D u are in practise in career u completed one lap.. now u are up in the 1st sector by 2.3 seconds and even improving in the second one and the engineer....: ""You are on avarage pace through sector 1"" ""...... avarage pace through sector 2"" ""....avarage pace through sector 3.""  I am like you are an avarage engineer lol xD.Also I improve a lap and he says ""you lost a bit of pace in that lap lets pick it up"" I am like, you blind ::::::: I improved by a second how is that losing pace :D but its more like facepalm than making me angry.- Distance of races online and offline make no difference, so a 12 lap race isnt worth more xp than a 2 lap this one isnt a negative or a postive: handling.. it is generally quite oversteery, especially open wheel but for example cat c touring has no wheelspin even with tc off (well not no but you know). In the past I didnt play the game cause of the handling but now I got used to it and I just deal with it however some endurance veichles are too slidey for me to control without traction which I prefer not Funny things about the game..Commentator: He is saying all sorts of crap, Peter and Dunken are very funny and can say technically stupid things or even when they dont say stupid things they can befunny for me..UUUUUH there was a naaasty crash.. Looks like somebody has lost control. xD and every times it happens they say it with the same sound xD.We got some of the world best drifters out there, xD And a bonus to the end (not a cracker or anything amazing)When I am in career mode selecting a contract the girls starts talking. ""Liqui Moly racing team are reqruiting for their team after ur performance... blalbla I am just talking with her and I know what she is exactly saying so I am saying the same line as her when she is supposed to say something new :Dthats all for now this will be updated in the future and will add more things which i noticed and will correct it			",3,1,4,0,3,0,0

												GRID Autosport is a masterpiece of the racing genre, everything that was criticized from GRID 2 was pulled back redone and tightened.  The overall product is a fantastic experience of realism of raw metal and rubber.  The controls are tight and beautiful and every detail that went into this game is there to catch your eye and heighten your experience that much more.  I give this racer a 10/10, it is a complete racing simulation that GRID 2 should have been.Video Review Below

												Its cool. The handling is pretty nice, the tracks are pretty nice ( while it misses some important like Laguna Seca) and overall it has very much variety in it races. While it has some things i dont like1. The Medium AIs are to easy while the Hard AIs are a bit too hard.2. You cant customize your cars in the career, you can tune the stiffness and stuff but you cant make your own liverys or changes wheels and stuff.3. Its getting pretty boring after you beaten the second GRID series ( there are 3 GRID series in the game)			",5,0,4,0,1,0,0

												I have played more racing games in over 20 years than I could ever remember. While not the worst racing game I have ever played, It is a long way from the best.  Controls and handling of the cars is not really an issue except to point out that keyboard players should expect to be at a disadvantage.The main problems are the AI, the lack of visibility and the atrocious in car view.The AI is following the same principle that has been used for a few years now. That is they are ""heavy"" meaning you cannot ram them and expect to see them suffer much. Unfortunately that the same does not apply in reverse, and you will often find yourself losing many positions or even out of a race after being hit by the AI. What make it worse in this game, is the AI generally doesnt see you or care. They will maneuver to overtake on a corner, then  switch into your lane after a few seconds, regardless of where you are. This only applies if your are not drift/sliding around the corner. In this instance you do not exist and that will blindly drive right into you. If by chance you get t-boned and stuck on the front of thier car, then race over. They will not stop to let you off, and will happily push you as far off the track as they can go before hitting a wall or running out of momentum.Visibilty in this game is not something you will notice much as the graphics are quite nice. The problem does become apparent on the more technical circuits though. The issue is you can see a lot of scenery, but very little of the road ahead. In many places the corners are hard to judge as you can not really see a far as you should be able to. It is like an artificial limit on the draw distance. Using the best line feature can help, but if you cannot see much of the road, you wont see much of a line on the road either.Now for the in car view. Its there.... partially. This is absolutly the worst view I have EVER seen in a car game. Not only do they further restrict your view by making you feel like you are to small to look over the dash, but the whole interior of the car is blurred W...T...F!!! Bonus xp for limiting views to incar only, but not worth it.People who played Grid 2 online are in for some good news. You can buy quite a few cars in this game without having to play online for 100hrs. Bad news is there are now something like 50 catagoeries, so you will still get stuck having to use loan cars until your 100hrs is up.			",1045,608,64,110,138,14,170

												Since I saw this game was on sale for $9.99 today I decided I should write a review for people looking at this game. First off, I don't think I have ever seen this game go on a 75% off sale, and for the record I got this game for free. GRID Autosport is probably one of the best racing games on Steam in my opinion. The graphics are great, and it runs well on my average PC.      The career mode is very unique, with you playing as a professional racer who drives across 5 different disciplines: Touring, Endurance, Open Wheel, Tuner, and Street. Touring is basically normal racing on tracks all across the world. Endurance is similar, but the races are a lot longer and require you to manage your tires by deciding when to put wear on them and when to hold back. Open Wheel features open wheel Formula 1 type cars. Tuner events are drift competitions set into heats, and also time attack where racers begin in a staggered moving start and try to set the fastest lap speed rather than the highest position. Finally, Street is racing on tracks made in tight city streets with many sharp turns and short tracks. As you progress through the different disciplines you unlock new Season opportunities and get closer to racing in the GRID, where all disciplines are tested in one competition. For events you do not get to choose the car you drive, which some people don't like but I am fine with. The game is structured into racing seasons where you pick one discipline and a season with preset races and cars. Seasons can also feature a special event where maybe everyone drives the same car or something. When a season ends you can choose a new season from any discipline. The game will save your progress between events so you don't have to play a whole season in one sitting. For each season you can also choose a racing team which gives different challenges or offers which give you bonus XP. For example, improve your lap time, finish above 5th position, lead for a lap. Also, for most racing events each racing team has two drivers. You recieve a teammate with a description and stats (however I do not think the stats really have a great impact on them). During the race you can order your teammate to hold their position, push for a higher one, or just have the default balanced approach. The racing itself is quite good, featuring a penalty system for infractions like going off track and gaining a position by way of that. There is also a replay feature, similar to Forza Horizon where you can rewind the last seconds where you may have crashed or made a mistake. For racers who don't like this feature, you can disable it, and you will receive an XP bonus. There are also other setting you can turn on or off that will increase your XP bonus or lower it. For inexperienced racers I would recommend turning on the driving line which displays the best path to take on the track and where to brake. Now, a lot of the times you can make big gains in races by way of road rage and muscling your way through the competition, I have to admit I do this some of the time. As long as you are on the track you receive no penalty, however if you take enough damage, your steering column, engine, or tires can be damaged. The multiplayer is fun, one thing is that you have to set your Steam download region to UK-London in order to find matches. From what I've heard this will not affect your downloads and it hasn't seemed to affect me so far. Surprisingly the multiplayer features the rewind function, however it will only rewind your car while everyone else keeps racing, so its really only for big mistakes. By racing in multiplayer you earn money and XP and can buy new cars. There is no customization and the cars you buy are just for multiplayer. All In all I think this is a great racing game and a steal for such a big sale. I probably would not buy this game for full price however, but if I didn't have it and saw it on this sale I would definitely grab it! Great graphics, good career mode, good multiplayer, nice music.NOTE: This game like most racing games is best with a CONTROLLER.			",101,10,1,7,8,0,8

												Not my cup of tea. It's neither a sim nor arcade. It's somewhere in the middle which honestly makes a lot of the vehicles behave chaotic. One moment you're taking a corner at 160 km/h and the next your car flies off the track at 30 km/h on a less drastic turn.Either make it a real sim or stick with the arcade. This hybrid doesn't work.			",55,14,6,8,8,0,8

												GRID autosport... what can really be said about this game? Lots, but long story short this game rewards driving skill.You have to hold the line, work the throttle, and have the patience to wait for the moment to pass. The bs drifting advantage is over. Only in select situations does drifting help. So far as I can describe through play, this game by design cuts down greatly on the demolition derby that was GRID 2. The A.I. is definitely challenging, but that may just be since the driving dynamics are different from other GRID titles so passing wouldn't be as familiar.The sound of the game has some notable improvements from G2. There are cockpit rattles in various cars. The engine sounds are satisfying, tires, exhust notes, radio chatter...blah blah. It sounds better.One aspect of the game I am enjoying a lot more are the RaceNet challenges. Again the driving dynamics make this particular game mode great, they take work to complete with platinum medals.Should you pick this game up? Depends if you're an arcade racer or not.

												Looks good. Has probably the most hateful AI in a game I have ever seen. They just smash into you. Their cars seem to knock you off track with the slightest bump, whereas if you hit them they don't budge an inch. Super-aggressive AI makes this game, which looks good and feels good, absolutely infuriating. Can't recommend it.Still it was on sale. And it WAS fun smashing into my friend in split screen mode. I suspect it would be better with a proper wheel and pedal set-up, but I'm not going to buy one just to be whacked about by the suspect AI in this game.I played TOCA 2 back in 1999 or 2000 on PSone. Loved it. Played it to death. Made by the same folks who produced this game I think. The AI in it were totally fine, perhaps not aggressive enough, but it WAS fun. How can 15 years go by and their game evolves to this? I'll probably sink a few more hours into it, see if it grows on me, you never know. If nothing else, the time trials aren't affected and I like trying to beat my own times round a track. Would I recommend it? -  on sale, perhaps. It hasn't made me want to look out for the next installment, that's for sure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Short: I rate this game a  6/10 as of January 2016 .Pros: Supports a lot of racing wheelsVery playable with a controller or keyboard Singleplayer with a lot of racesMultiplayer with Clans ( Racing teams ), custom lobbies Some car customizationCons:  Multiplayer is dead Support systems are perfect ( Can't improve certain things by using a wheel )  A lot of 500-2000h people that own all upgrades on cars and will always finish top places People with the most points always start first.  DLCs ( Yes DLCs are always a Con for me. ) Boring Singleplayer ( Stopped after the second season because it's basically: Choose a team, race , race, Choose a better team, race, race ) Read the full review for my salt.  Long: I owned Grid 2 before, been playing it with keyboard and controller, very arcady indeed.Preordered Grid Autosport when it got announced, played it a couple of hours on release, more of a sim-arcade game than just arcade ( Can't drift around corners anymore and be faster than others ). Now this doesn't have to be bad actually I liked it at first but I never really got into the game during that time, rather played different genres. I played it now and then and every time I had the same feeling and ended up playing other stuff again because of the following reasons:Grid Autosports has upgrades that you can install into your vehicle to boost its performance (Better acceleration for example), for these you need to have a certain level on your car (which you have to buy with ingame cash if you want to level up the car ). Basically this means if you play the game a lot you get better cars ( besides owning cars in the first place ).Again this is something most online games have, reward players that play the game.One problem with this is that the game is basically unplayable and very very very frustrating in multiplayer as a ""beginner"" as you can't theoretically drive faster than people that have upgraded cars, which means you can't, again theoretically (before you argue you can still do that by skill... ), do better than people with upgraded cars.As you get XP and Cash mainly based on your placement and the amount of players this means you're going to have hard times leveling up and buying new cars. (Cash problem can easily be solved by doing RaceNet-Challenges ).This problem also gets supported by the fact that the Multiplayer is pretty much dead ( EU-Experience ). You may get a full touring lobby on Sundays but then again you will have to race mostly high level players ( Talking about people with somewhere between 700-2000h in this game ).The ""reward people that play the game "" - system can also be seen at the start of a race: The guy with the most points starts first ( If you just sit in a lobby for long enough and play a lot you will always start on pole ). If you're lucky enough to find a full lobby with some low rank players you will have to start at the very back and probably get rammed out of the first turn. Now you could still have more driving skill than some high skill players, maybe you're thinking because you own a wheel you get advantages as you do in other games but I'm sorry to tell you that you're wrong.As I said earlier this game is somewhere between Arcade and Simulator, therefor it's easily playable with a controller or keyboard, multiplayer doesn't have any specific rules on game supports ( ABS , Shiftmode , TC , stability control, ... ) you can enable what ever you want. Enabling those also doesn't really give you a disadvantage ( you get less xp but that's not really noticible ), having TC enabled for example just saves you from accelerating too quickly but if you choose to fully accelerate you still accelerate perfectly. I am personally using a racing wheel ( T300RS ) and I feel like this is sadly the case for most settings. Manual shifting / sequential is worthless, just more work for your brain and automatic shifts perfectly anyways.Basically this means you can play this game just as well on a controller as you could on a racing wheel. Good if you own a controller - bad if you own a 300€ or more racing wheel and get no advantages.Conclusion:As reviews should tell people who are interested in buying this game if it's worth it or not I'm going to say: Probably not.If you're looking for an arcade game, don't care if you finish last most games and not play with a lot of players ( yes there are private lobbies ... sometimes ... if you're lucky ... so basically never (  let's be real )  ) or if you just want to play this game in singleplayer, go ahead and pick it up.If you actually want a racing sim, play a game where you feel like it's good to own a wheel and not get dusted by people who may be worse drivers than you but still win because they played the game a lot then don't buy this game.Personally I never expected this to be a racing sim but rarely finding lobbies and having to play people who play this game all day is annoying. Also I feel like you should be able to drive better if you own a wheel, support systems shouldn't do everything perfect so there's something to improve by using a wheel. ",59,16,7,13,24,1,17

												I don't know why am I even writing this review but I really want to. Have all grid titles including Grid and Grid 2 in my Steam Library but never touched them. Bought Grid AutoSport + Season Pass just because I had money to waste (and maybe to show off to others that I buy expensive games) and I think it is one of the beautiful mistakes I've made in my life. I was always an avid follower of F1 and thats why I love racing games. Played almost all newer NFS titles where you kind of get a supercar and blast through all the racer and get 1st , 2nd or 3rd place almost every time. Played this game and I got a reality check about what actual racing is. I selected the ""Easy"" AI Mode but after 4 races (15th Place , 14th Place , 9th place and 16th place *I ain't joking*) . I had to set the AI to ""Very Easy"" mode. Even after that , I've managed to get the podium 2 times ONLY (2nd and 3rd) even after playing almost 30+ races. If you think you've mastered racing games just because you can play NFS , play this game. I'm sure you'll love it. Although I understand that this game is frustrating at times just because the amount of complexity you'll have to go through e.g. In Online mode car damage will affect your car's performance and trust me when I say that I wanted to threw away my laptop just because I couldn't come 1st in a race just because my car's handling failed after getting hit by another car. I've only played like 2-3 games online so I dont know much about that but I'm really enjoying the Single Player mode.As of now , I've only tried ""Touring"" and ""Endurance"" disciplines but I plan to try other ones soon enough. And about the optimization part , I'm running this game maxed out in Intel HD 5200 and haven't encountered a visual glitch till now. Also , the visuals are really top notch. Somethimes when playing , I felt like I was racing in a real world (but I'm too much dreamy so you can ignore that part :'D ) This game also has a good set of cars and racing tracks ..... Well , to finish , I know I spoke too much in my review but if you can , buy this game. You'll have countless hours of fun like I'm having .... Thank You again for reading this length pile of garbage.  P.S. I never played Asseto Corsa and don't plan to. So , please don't tell me about how Asseto Corsa is better than Grid : Autosport even if it is !! Thank You :)			",414,101,17,52,49,2,57

												Basically it should have been a DLC for Grid 2, nearly everything is taken from it. The rushed interior view is a joke and the whole concept is tedious especially the Endurance races.

												This is a racing game made for racers. People who genuinely love motorsports. People who have actually DONE motorsports before. People who know what racing really is like in real life. This review is written having only played the game with a G27 racing wheel and only manual sear shifting with all HUD's disabled for the most racing like experience. I've done my fair share of track days and i can tell you, think is the most realistic car racing game i have played. There's plenty of people complaining the game feels too slow, the cars don't grip in corners blah blah. Well guess what, those people have never driven on a track in their life. When on a racing track, unless you're in a ultra fast ferarri or koensigg or something, guess what, you feel SLOW. That's how it is. Your car is slow. People are so used to **** car sims that put so much emphasis on feeling like you're flying along or arcade racing games that let you go around corners at 400kph that they have no idea what it's actually like to race a car. So more on the good parts. The handling of the cars: Fantastic. Cars handle how they should. FWD understeers coming too hot into a corner, or if you put power down coming into a corner and you can even get the♥♥♥♥♥out with lift off oversteer when driving really agressive. All of that is true in a FWD cars handling characteristics and they are all spot on in the game. RWD cars oversteer if you power on too much mid corner, or over a crest. You can really feel the suspension working. Coming super hot down a hill into a banked corner? Your suspension will start to wallow like a real car trying to deal with sideways g-forces, and if not careful in a RWD car, will cause oversteer. Graphics: AMAZING. Holy **** The attention to detail is amazing. From the different exhaust outputs of the cars (some will be obviously running rich, some not, etc) to the in car view of the dash being out of focus (because you're looking at the track, not the car) but obviously having some type of MOTEC carbon fiber HUD in place of the standard cars one, to the general cars decals and body panels. The world around looks so gorgeous, beautiful lighting, amazing scenery, and really perfect track textures. Racing modes: The only thing the game is missing in terms of racing modes is drag racing and rally. Which is not a downside to me. Drag is always a short lived interest in racing games and rally is much a massive part of racing it really does require its own game. One massive thing to note is the different racing game modes all have different racing styles. Touring cars are mega aggressive, open wheelers really require you to be careful with damage on and time attack is like how time attack is with sporadic cars you have to deal with. Sounds: I love the fact you can hear the tyres gripping, the straight cut gears int he gear box and the pop from fuel injectors still being on when your changing gears, because screw fuel efficiency. Its the little things: To me what really makes this game great is the little things. Like picking a perfect line through a series of corners then coming out and realising you just shaved a second or 2 off your lap time. The spectators not being 2d, the clouds and lighting are so gorgeous and the cars look amazing. Even the simple and elegant UI still keeping perfect functionality. The fact you log in, and the game says with voice ""Welcome back (name here), there's some new events in the touring car championship, go check them out!"". You can really tell Codemasters have really put their heart and soul into this game. Summary: If you're a grown adult that loves racing, and has done it before, this is the game for you. If your some pimply teenager that thinks GTA and Need for Speed are racing simulators, this isn't for you.			",28,4,1,0,0,0,0

												I only recommend this game if you can get it for like 50%-75% off price. It's not worth the full price. It definitely don't deserve the simulation tag. All cars drive like a motorboat.They ignored the cockpit view detail and use super ugly low res road texture.  2 of the most important aspect in a racing game especially for simcade/sim.You need a good gamepad to enjoy this game, preferably an Xbox 360 controller or something similar. Buying a racing wheel for this game is a dumb move.			",77,13,7,19,9,1,9

												It looks nice but that is about it. The cars seem to have too much oversteer and it feels more arcadey than Need for Speed. I was lured in by the free DLC for the demo derby. I think I dislike this game because they completely missed the target on that. The demo derby mode is just like everything else in the game, cars are aggresively racing you to cross the finish line 1st. Its kind of a figure 8 race I guess? A simple youtube search would show you what a demo derby is. And to whoever gave this a ""simulation"" tag, go play an even numbered Gran Turismo, Forza or maybe Need for Speed Shift so you can see what a sim racer is.			",19,1,2,4,11,0,9

												Engine-wise, this is the most optimized game I've played in the last 10 years. Everything is super light and responsive with gorgeous graphics on mid-range PCs, and with acceptable graphics on low-end PCs.There is not enough diversity in cars, despite the many categories (even F1-like cars), but there are a lot of different tracks to drive on.Music is annoying and generic, and does bad job at complementing such a beautiful game.Car damage is realistic and affects driving in a major way - this is not the game to ram your opponents off the track.For me personally, in the age of games that struggle on quad core CPUs and 2+ Gb GPUs to deliver mid-res textures and questionable lighting, the biggest advantage of GRID Autosport is how amazingly beautiful and lightweight its graphics engine is. Definitely restores my faith in developers.I have not noticed any bugs so far, and I've played it way more than my profile shows, outside of Steam.Career is a bit boring, or at least it was to me. Driving aside, a race pilot's career is not very interesting to begin with. But it does provide an extra bit of addrenaline to the regular racing experience.			",78,11,4,6,6,0,11

TL/DR REVIEW: Pretty good.Grid Autosport is a pretty casual racer. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is looking for a simulation experience. It has a great car and track selection which kept me interested for quite a long time. The AI was OK I guess, I didn't really notice anything special in a good or bad way. I wouldn't expect too much from the online aspect, strangers will generally race dirty or be incompetent. All in all this game delivers a couch gaming experience while giving off a semi-realistic vibe. It's kind of like a poormans forza. I am happy I picked it up on a good discount, and recommend waiting for one.Final noteThis is not an in depth or complete review of the game. It simply sums up my experience with the game in an effort to help you make a more informed purchasing decision. ",84,1,10,1,12,1,7

												Fun game to pick up every once in a while. Looks great, runs great and if you're like me and you want the new Forza but you don't have an xbox one, this game is probably your best option. My only complaints are that some of the cars feel kinda floaty (for the lack of a better word) and I would've liked to see some regular street cars and maybe some older cars.			",132,18,35,9,23,4,8

												GRID is more detailed...not just the cars,but the environment.It's a good combination between simulation&arcade.Better optimisation and better graphics (minus the cockpit view).Project CARS does better at simulation,but it requires too much hardware for what it delivers in terms of graphics.I still play GRID Autosport on PC and Driveclub on PS4.I am waiting for Assetto Corsa on PS4.Cheers :D﻿			",55,6,12,1,7,0,12

												Game is lots of fun. Vast variety of cars and championship.I do feel like the Ravenwest guys are way too fast in comparising to the other AI. Especially in Endurance. It's weird having 2 Ravenwest cars on your tail for 10 minutes and have the 4th place AI gapped by 1500 meters.I also wish you could've customised your own car in singeplayer instead of riding with a pre-made livery.

												9/10 Pretty fun racing game! I expected it to be more realistic when it comes to car handling, but it is in fact quite arcady and a bit loose. I am playing with a Xbox controller and the controls are not super responsive and direct when it comes to the steering with the L joystick, but it's acceptable. You might need to get used to it a bit in the beginning, after that it's fine.The game has a ton of cups and challenges to keep you busy for many many hours (enough content). Even with the arcady feel it is actually quite chalenging to drive against the AI! So far as I have played the amount of different tracks is quite low, I played for 7 hours and only driven half a dozen different tracks (and reversed), also the amount of different cars and classes is quite low.One really noticable quality gap in the game is the cockpit view. It is really low detailed in most/all cars and they made the cockpit on the lower part of your screen blurry to camouflage it. It is extra noticable, because basically everything else in the game is pretty solid and good quality.As for realism I think this game falls far below the racing sims on the market. Even Gran Turismo feels more real (direct/responsive) when it comes to car handling, but the AI in GRID is way more fun to race against and the races are more custimizable then in Gran Turismo. I also don't think that this game tries or was intended to be a realistic racing sim, but an enjoyable not over complicated racing experience. And that it does quite well.Overall I think this is a pretty solid and fun racing game and worthy to pick up during a sale.			",132,35,10,18,5,5,10

Posted: April 12, 2015
												Yet another beloved Codemasters game saga. ""Race Driver"" games have been out there since early 2000, and although the name of the latest games has changed gradually to ""GRID"", the focus of the saga keeps exactly the same as in its origins nearly 15 years ago. I have got the 2002 ""Pro Race Driver"" and from it I could get a well-determined scheme of what the saga is meant to be like. First of all, the title says it all: Pro Race Driver. Yup, you are a race driver going from the bottom to the top of Motorsport, always on tarmac races. What we get then is a large variety of cars and circuits to make the ladder along the career changing and entertaining. Back in 2007, with ""Race Driver GRID"" being released (and in my all honest opinion, one of the best games I've ever played), the saga was brought back. Later in 2012, the game library grew with GRID 2 to finally lose the name ""Race Driver"" and pretend like it was a brand new saga. Now, after the release in 2014 of GRID Autosport, some say this may be the end of the GRID saga. As exposed before GRID is actually part of the Race Driver saga, so maybe the next tarmac-racing game by Codemasters may not be called GRID but will still be part of the RD line. No developer is stupid enough to let down one of their most successful sagas ever while it still sells well.After some context introduction, it's time for the actual review:At first sight this brand new game might look like a GRID 2 DLC. Visuals are almost identical to it, and as in the store page what you see from the game are screenshots, you feel convinced of your opinion. GRID Autosport shares a lot of visual features with GRID 2 indeed. But the game is directioned in a completely different way. First up, GRID 2 was mostly about street races with road cars. GRID Autosport is undeniably focused on circuit races. This may not look like a big difference, but it actually makes the game feel 100% renewed.I think I share the opinion that having to unlock the 75% of the cars in game sucks. Or that to race certain competitions you have to pass through the ♥♥♥♥♥est races in the ♥♥♥♥♥est circuits with the ♥♥♥♥♥est cars. At GRID Autosport they have broken up with that annoying tradition and you are completely free to start your career mode in whatever competition category you prefer. For example, if you hate street races you can always kick off the Endurance season if you fancy. A great kudos to Codies for that. Plus if you want to take up a quick race at any game mode you can race with any car in game. They are all available from moment you click the ""Play"" button on Steam for the first time.Another huge improvement in which most of the upgrades of this game are based is the graphics engine. 4K compatible and stable at 60FPS or more, which basically means that the game is ridiculously well built. If you don't own a top GPU which supports these new performance features, you still get a good bit with high FPS and affordable higher settings. GRID 2 was annoyingly bad in that way, with massive FPS drops and nonsense low FPS on any setting... Graphics are clear and textures are the summit of all Codemasters titles. Grass, tyres, tarmac trees are brilliant. Cars keep the trend of ""so-so"" quality though. Modelling is not extremelly accurate, but still decent.Physics were a huge problem in GRID 2. The 2007 GRID was much better in that field, and now these realistic physics are back. If you spin off the track and insane speeds and get onto the gravel, you are likely to end up rolling. Track bumps fit properly-made suspension works. If you go real quick on a staright and there's a steep lift on the track, you may take off the tarmac shortly. If you go full YOLO out of a turn and drive over the curb you can be sure to be going to lose control of the car. Just some remarkable examples of how well detaled this game is.Handling confirms that the latest addition to the saga is still an arcade. It would be better to say it is a mixture between a sim and an arcade. Handling is not at all precise. At any turn you'll have to make slight drifts to get hold of the car because if you just lock the pad axle on a single position the car is going to oversteer as if it had been kicked from the tail by Superman. This is common through all the previous games. If you get the purpose of this handling's characterictics you'll believe you're a pro racer saving the driving line with corrections. If not, you'll leave the game apart thinking it is unplayable. It's all a question of practice though.Codemasters warned that AI is so dirty in this game. They somehow managed to program an AI that is not dumb at all but behaves as any real online racer. It has personality... Plus the amazingly-superbly-awesome new feature of radio interaction with your trackside engineer. By pushing some buttons you can ask him for any information about race status and your car's damages and tyre wear. Also, you can tell your team mate to be more aggressive or to defeat his position. Real cool stuff.Sound field. I do think that at Codemasters they copy-paste the car sound files from one game to another. It is true that GRID Autosport has a wider range of hi-fi sounds like wind, crowd cheering and more accurate gravel and grass sounds when you spin off the track. Engines just sound the same, just a ridiculous high-pitched monotone sound. Of course it has some remarkable distinctions for some cars. Some Endurance cars sound just too badass, but the sound itself looks too simplistic.Cockpit camera was painfully missing in GRID 2 and now it is back. Interestingly there are two on board cams available, one nearer from the windshield than the other, more driver-eye like. At first sight you'll see a major difference from any other on board cam from any other game. I don't know if it is made on purpose to bring one of the best graphics effects ever on a racing game or a merely ridiculous attempt to hide bad work on the cockpits. The thing is that the interior of the cars are blurry and anything from behind the winshield is nitide. In my opinion it looks absolutely mega, but that's up to everyone's opinion.So does GRID Autosport stick to the scheme of the rest of the ""Race Driver"" games? Indeed. Career mode keeps the essence of being focused on you as a driver exactly as the 2002 game did. So many circuits with their variants and an impressive range of cars. It never gets boring.8/10			",81,10,13,2,6,1,3

												besides your top of the line simulater games like iraceing and forza and project cars, grid auto sport is up there with the best for sure. i have spent alot of time on this game on my xbox 360 and now i am playing on the pc and i still love it. the sound of the engines and tyres in this game are awsome and the pyshics and looks of the cars are awsome. havent found another game that has the aussie v8 utes in them and they sound amazing. great choice of cars to. definalty love playing this game.. the only downside is im useing the logitec g920 and the responce is a lil sloppy. when you turn the wheel like 5 to 10 degress to the left or right the car wont turn untill you go past that. so in other words the first lil turn left or right isnt responsive, but once u go past that its fine and works well. and that also is with all the settings turned up. other downside is there is  no calibration setting to calibrate your wheel if that setting was in the game it would fix this problem. other than that 10/10 for me on this game.

Still need to try DLC's, cant wait till prices drop to get them. Gameplay is just right with gamepad, cars handle great, and you can switch between driving aids and even if you are only starting with it you will have fun.

												Great racing game. Lots of cars, tracks and disciplines. The cars handle very well; you have to learn how to drive them properly around corners and the game helps with the learning through visual assists.Touring cars remind me of Toca 2.The AI really fights for every inch of tarmac which adds a lot to the adrenaline and competitive atmosphere. I love that and I think I felt it most at ""medium"" difficulty.I noticed many times the AI cars follow the racing line religiously(mostly while cornering) and in some cases they'll ram you off the track because of it, but that usually happens when driving kamikaze style, not like a racer would. You'll learn to be aware of other cars.The game doesn't have a storyline to help drive progression like in Grid 1. Instead you feel more like a professional driver fighting to climb up the ranks. You can play only one discipline if you want to.It's nice you can choose to stick with a team for a few seasons before moving to another one.The commentators before the race are a nice touch :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: January 10, 2015
												MY BIGGEST IN DEPTH REVIEW EVER! I previously reviewed Grid 2 and I will start with a familiar sentence those who read my grid 2 review will know. Codemasters, my dear old friend. I have been a loyal supporter since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, stretching from V8 Supercars 1, 2 (Xbox) to TOCA Race Driver 3 and even the Formula One games (My fave) Its only fair I review GRID: Autosport. In a nutshell, its an improvement over GRID 2. OK LETS GET INTO IT! Again I shall start with the cons.-ConsFirst the AI. Easy to catch, bloomin hard to keep them behind you. It seems there is a rubberbanding effect here where the cars behind get a performance boost when you pass, especially the top drivers (looking at you Westley). Rubberbanding provides a challenge to the player but it kinda makes it frustrating all your effort catching (even on hard difficaulty) suddenly goes to mud because the AI suddenly go faster. And on the subject of AI they REALLY get aggressive out there. For example in Open Wheel (more about classes in the pros!) It is supposed to be NON CONTACT. But they do not leave space, and I found myself getting spun when they slam into me in the breaking zones like im not even there or they re-pass on the inside and clip my rear wheels with their wing. THis is a long paragraph for a single con. -Damage. This is a pro and con. Its more about the AI damage. They don't seem to have any issues with damage.

												MY BIGGEST IN DEPTH REVIEW EVER! I previously reviewed Grid 2 and I will start with a familiar sentence those who read my grid 2 review will know. Codemasters, my dear old friend. I have been a loyal supporter since Colin Mcrae Rally 2.0, stretching from V8 Supercars 1, 2 (Xbox) to TOCA Race Driver 3 and even the Formula One games (My fave) Its only fair I review GRID: Autosport. In a nutshell, its an improvement over GRID 2. OK LETS GET INTO IT! Again I shall start with the cons.-ConsFirst the AI. Easy to catch, bloomin hard to keep them behind you. It seems there is a rubberbanding effect here where the cars behind get a performance boost when you pass, especially the top drivers (looking at you Westley). Rubberbanding provides a challenge to the player but it kinda makes it frustrating all your effort catching (even on hard difficaulty) suddenly goes to mud because the AI suddenly go faster. And on the subject of AI they REALLY get aggressive out there. For example in Open Wheel (more about classes in the pros!) It is supposed to be NON CONTACT. But they do not leave space, and I found myself getting spun when they slam into me in the breaking zones like im not even there or they re-pass on the inside and clip my rear wheels with their wing. THis is a long paragraph for a single con. -Damage. This is a pro and con. Its more about the AI damage. They don't seem to have any issues with damage. I went the wrong way, smashed head on into an AI at over 200kph and sent him flipping through the air. When his car righted again he just continued although he did have a lose wing and cosmetic damage... he finished 5th... SO work there needs to be done.-Multiplayer. Again...

												Just like Cities:Skylines seemed to be closer to a next-generation version of SimCity 4 was than Sim City 5, so does Grid Autosport seem to be the heir to the throne that was last occupied by DiRT: Showdown (D:S).It is a great half-way point between super in-depth racers from the PS2-era of GT2 and GT3 and the arcadey racers.  It has depth in what it refines.Does it let you race bajillions of vehicles?  No, just from playing the ""street"" vein of the game I can tell that only a small handful (under 10) are available.  But because each of those dozen or so vehicles vary so much in their physics, each vein yields new challenges to personal skills that might've plateaued if just left to rot in one specific type.But it does add some great advancements: ""rivals"" which seem like the next non-team guy in points above or below you is one of them.  Another is the flashback where you get -- by default -- five times during one race to rewind the action so that spin-out or incorrect judgement of the entry speed on a corner doesn't happen.Yup, car collection is still there but not a focus.

												If you're familiar with TOCA Race Driver 3 You'll find this game very familiar. Several racing disciplines you can advance in  either one at a time or alternating between. Sadly no prerendered cutscenes of your crewchief congratulating you or mussy haired race enemies berating you.Drives very much like a codemasters game - definitely not a sim and definitely a little floaty but the cars are a little more planted than GRID. I've only done a few of the GT races so open wheel cars or the upper end cars may be different.Runs very well on Linux and easily the best naitive running racing game available.

												Cockpit view is messed up because of the blur effect. The ""cockpit + mirror fix"" won't help much, because the textures under the blur have extremely low resolution. Also rev, speed, etc. isn't displayed.This might be OK for an arcade gamer or if U just don't want to use the cockpit view. But if u want to slightly have something like a simulation, this is not acceptable (at least for me). No idea, why Codemasters did this. Even ""Racedriver GRID (1)"" had a proper cockpit view.Also there is a bug in the menu if U are using a G920-wheel. U have to use the keyboard-preset to fix it in settings.So if U are looking for a more ""arcady"" simulation as r3e, assettocorsa, etc. better go for an older GRID or even NFS Shift (2).

												Perfect mix between simulation and arcade racing. Beautiful graphics, really low loading times and endless settings can be changed if wanted. You can play this game just with the standard settings from the cars or fine tune them yourselves.I do recommend a steering wheel with pedals or at least a controller. I'm saving up for a Fanatec wheel with pedals and now  racing with a Xbox 360 controller. I also tried lot of other racing games like Project Cars (to much of a sim for me), Test Drive Unlimited 2 (too big of an open world for me), Need for speed series (too arcade for my taste), but since I started playing GRID2 I was hooked. Thankfully that nice balance between Sim and Arcade is still there in GRID Autosport. If you think you're not an arcade racer, but also not somebody who want's to play it too hardcore like a Sim, this is the perfect game			",70,6,5,4,15,0,4

												I'm a long-time fan of the Race Driver series and played every single one of them.The classic Race Driver games (especially RD2 and RD3) were absolutely superb games. Then came the first GRID and just added to it. It was a great game with decent cars, decent simcade handling, good racetracks (especially those Japan Docks). GRID 2 was a disaster. To anyone who knows Codemasters and the Race Driver franchise it's obvious that they just lost track of their heritage on this one. It didn't have a monetary system. The handling was changed to something that can only be described as super-arcade. The sponsor system was terrible too - supremely dumbed-down. And the AI was irritating. Generally just a bad bad Codemasters racing game.I told myself I'd never pre-order again, then came GRID Autosport.Which I didn't pre-order and bought on sale.BUTIt's a good game. Not GRID 1 good, but it's eons ahead of GRID 2. The single player mode isn't quite where GRID 1 had gotten it so right, with a lack of a monetary system and no ownership of cars. The music is about as bland as it gets too. The multiplayer, however, is where the game really proves itself. Earn money, earn xp and build your garage. Track your stats on RaceNet. Create or join racing clubs. Race vs friends, strangers or just AI. It really has a nice balance to it. There are community challenges to keep you interested and leaderboards to work against. Generally GRID Autosport is well rounded with handling only marginally below that of GRID 1.GRID Autosport proves that Codemasters have not lost their touch with racing games.

												This game is AWESOME. Physics are on the dot, the game has a good single player campaign, cars handle as in real life, at least with the Xbox One Controller. Its very polished and I love the racenet boards where you can set times and scores and see how you stack up in teh world, no cheating there that I have seen (not like NFS:Shift, and DIRT3, lol those have tons of fake times online) Furthermore, the game just seems uber polished, I also bought Project Cars to compare but havent played it much yet, as an overall package I have to say this is #01 numero Uno as far as PC Driving games and realistic physics as compared to real life, but hey everyone is going to have a different opinion.

												The game runs with 60+ FPS on Ubuntu 16.10 with GTX 970, ultra settings and full HD monitor. I have a Logitech G25 Racing Wheel and it was just plug&play (you just have to enable FF from the game menu, as it is diabled by default).The new Era of Ubuntu gaming is here.Btw, the game is really nice. Feels sim-like. AI is kind of bumbing into you, but in a fun way and car damage isn't that bad so you don't mind. Each car has unique handling and it doesn't feel like they pushed cars just to have more graphics. They dedicated time to this. Also, the drift mode is fun and feels realistic. The game is worth the money.			",23,3,2,9,0,0,0

												There's a problem with the Steam ratings system, and that's that you have a binary ""YES"" or ""NO"" as to if you'd recommend a game.  I need a third category for GRID Autosport, a wavy hand, non-committal noise, a sort of shrug.I'm a big fan of racing games in general and have been buying Codemasters racers since TOCA Race Driver 2.  I’ve bought GRID and GRID 2 and enjoyed them both, I actually wrote a positive review of GRID2 on Steam.  But GRID Autosport is...*does hand rocking back and forward motion*.So what's wrong?  The biggest fault in this game is the AI.  It’s bad, not terrible, just pretty stupid.  AI cars really want to hit that racing line.  Quite often you'll find them piling up at the first corner as they all try to take the same line through.  A savvy player can avoid the melee and gain quite a few places straight away.  More annoying is when you're taking a corner and the AI clips your back end sending you spinning out.  Of course, this happens in real world racing but it feels all to frequent in GRID Autosport making the AI feel cheap and frustrating.  It made me wonder if the flashback game mechanic was implemented because they couldn’t be bothered to fix the AI and decided that the player could just rewind and take evasive action should they get rear ended and end up in a wall!  But because the AI behaves so badly you don't really care about smashing them up to get ahead.  This can turn races into something of a demolition derby and ruins the immersion somewhat.  Far better was the system in Need For Speed: Shift which rewarded you for a more passive (or aggressive) racing style, that way you could at least play a persona.  Also the less said about the total waste of an AI race partner the better.  There's also nothing new here.  If you've played the last two outings you've seen most of what this game has to offer.  I might be mistaken but I think all the tracks are recycled and they've ditched the point-to-point racing that was so much fun in GRID2 (though you can get it back as DLC, it’s not part of the main career mode).  Drag racing could have been new and fun (reminiscent of the ace drag racing from Need For Speed Underground) but again, that comes as a DLC and isn't part of the main career. So what's right?  Graphically it’s quite the looker.  The cars are detailed (and there are quite a few of them), the tracks feel alive and interesting (racing through the construction site that is Dubai is a particular highlight).  The car handling seems to have been refined from the previous outing and the multi-disciplined approach means you really have to focus on how you drive as you, for example, switch between the easy to drive, stable at speed Touring Cars and the fast but skittish GT Race Cars.  Moreover the number of disciplines keeps things varied and interesting.  You'll be bumper to bumper racing in Touring Cars, managing your tyre wear in Endurance, getting sideways in Drift.  That you don't need to be the best in a particular discipline to progress is neat too (mid table finishes still earn XP, albeit slower than finishing top).There's enough in this game to keep me coming back (and I will do until I finish it because I'm compulsive like that) so because Steam only gives me a binary choice I'll give a thumbs up.  But this is likely the last GRID game I pick up.  The racing marketplace is about to get a whole lot more competitive with the exciting Project CARS on the horizon, and I reckon the GRID series, without an overhaul, will end up languishing in mid-pack.

												First off, this is a great game, I would definetly buy it if I were you.The physics model is a perfect balance of arcade and simulation, much better than GRID 2, which was like driving on soap. That makes this game very fun and playable with w,a,s,d and arrow keys.The car selection is huge, you get everything in between hot hatches and formula 1. Touring cars, muscle cars, hypercars, you name it, they have it.The graphics are great, obviously not the best in the world right now, but still insane.The frame rate is very constant, I dont have the best PC ever, only 6GB of ram and a core i5, but it still runs at 40-50fps pretty much no matter what I'm doing. I cant say the same for games like need for speed.The track selection is immense, granted, some of the tracks are just variations of the same track, but it's still difficult to run out of places to race.Multiplayer is great as well, impact ratings keep all of the jerks out of the race and let everyone have fun without being killed by some idiot driving on the track backwards.However, there are some flaws. For example, when GRID autosport says you are going to drive formula A, or formula 1, it gives you an indycar instead. Indycar and F1 are NOT the same thing.Another flaw has to be the DLC, which has been a problem for all of the GRID games. There is so much of it, and none of it is free. You want an extra car? Better have $5 lying around. This also effects multiplayer, half of the time the party leader is using DLC that you probably dont have, and there is usually no other party to join.The cokcpit wiew is super blurry as well, not a big problem, but still something I want to point out.My final thoughts? Still an excellent game. DO NOT listen to the people who say you are better off with GRID 2, ive played the game before, trust me, you want this one. Although I do recommend buying it on sale, the GRID series tends to be on sale more than most racing games on steam, so I was able to get it for 10 bucks. Also, if you are looking for a racing sim, go buy asseto corsa, do not buy GRID.			",16,0,10,1,9,0,0

The best racing game on GNU/Linux... as of today.Until the day DiRT Rally comes out... if SteamDB is not wrong.So, after fans complained that GRID 2 was too arcadey, left cockpit view out of the base game and missed the real race tracks, GRID Autosport brings back what the sequel was missing, and rewrites the handling of the game so it stick closer to that simcade balance from GRID 1.In short, the game can be formulated as ""GRID 1's spirit"" + ""GRID 2's technology and assets"".The game may have its flaws, but it's ultimately a good experience filled with variety. I should also mention that it has split-screen multiplayer, a rarity on PC games (and even current console games).What differences this version from Windows' is that it performs worse graphically, so if the game runs flawlessly on Windows, chances are you may experience some frame drops (unless your computer is that powerful). As a reference, playing on Nvidia has the same performance as playing on Windows + AMD card. BUT, considering how GNU/Linux works, if the game freezes, it won't affect anywhere else on the computer, where Windows could freeze itself entirely.______________________________________________Oh, one last thing: if your country uses commas to represent decimals (0,3333..3 as in ""one third""), use this command on launch:	LANG=C %command%Otherwise the game may not even launch!

												I really like this game. Keeping in the arcade-game line, they added features from simulations, which is big PLUS for me.After few hours I am really glad I got this title. Controls are very fine for me (unlike other reviewers... I am using X360 controller). Summarized - I like the game, online modes and the way the game feels. Most Welcome for me is ability to create Racing Club with your friends in game (applicable after driving YOUR car with Race Club livery). Honestly I don't use cockpit view, so wheter it is there or not, all the same to me :)I recommend this game for everyone, who wants simulation-like racing, but with arcade in it (Honestly I hate games where you can set your precise gear ratios, angles of wheels and such... I am no mechanic, I am player). This is my view and in my view this game is 8,5/10 :)			",309,62,11,39,37,6,38

												Was Super Excited to get this game. And after spending about 5 hours trying to rewrite code because the game continually crashed on start-up, I finally gave up. I just built a brand new computer, (and the game came with one of the items i purchased.)and I am even running an AMD R9 not a nvidia, where the problems seemed to be originating from. It would get to the inital menus and then just crash out as soon as I would try to open a menu. And it seems from looking around for answers on the internet and here in the forums, there is simply no fix, at all. I might revisit this again in a few months if there does happen to be a few patches for this game, but constantly freezing up the whole computer is just not worth the risk. Codemasters, I will not download or purchase another one of your games on the PC, ever. -1/10 ",9,0,1,4,0,0,1

If you are looking for a game more realistic, try Assetto Corsa, Project CARS or similars. Don't buy GRID Autosport.			",86,15,16,5,16,1,11

												(Singleplayer only)A really fantastic looking arcade racer that fills my racing fix when I just want to put in a few races. I normally can't put in more than two or three hours at a time though. It can't hook me in to play longer. I just end up getting bored. The game is now almost two years old now and it's still $40. It's not worth $40. I got it in a Codemasters bundle I think. Got this and a few other titles for $15 (great deal!). I really enjoy the Touring, Open Wheel, and Street seasons, but I'm not a fan of this game's Endurance (AI don't suffer from wear) mode and I hate Tuner.With a decent gaming desktop, I can run many of the settings on ultra, but have to lower some settings to keep the frame rate from dropping at high-intensity moments (especially when drifting with tire smoke). Ravenwest are my sworn enemies. When I get there, I will only run one season with them to get the achievement. They can screw off after that.Overall, it looks great, the AI are decent (but not perfect), and can fill that racing fix for about two hours at a time. Get it on sale. 50% off or greater.Edit: accidentally said Tuner twice. Changed to Touring			",16,3,6,7,11,0,14

												I have to admit that there is fun to be found here, but the game is still floaty as hell.  I honestly don't know what Codemasters is attempting to do.  With the first game, I thought they were going for the Forza/Gran Turismo market, which... they didn't succeed at.  With Grid 2, I have NO IDEA what the hell they were thinking.  So that brings us to Grid Autosport, which still doesn't seem to go for that sim feel, although it's much closer than Grid 2 ever was.  So if that's not the goal, this doesn't really feel like an arcade racer, either.  It just feels like a very pretty, but ultimately not-great racing game.  The entire series has an identity crisis, as if it doesn't know whether to be a sim or an arcade game, and that just leaves it teetering in the middle where nobody is going to be satisfied.

												Nope!  This game is offensively too broken to justify spending even $5 on if you intend to be chasing any sort of game progression or steam achievements. Sure, the racenet site is pretty terrible, does a poor job of barely handling the minimal functionality required to support the features for which it is needed.  Sure, the AI and other humans are often out of sync between gamers in the same multiplayer game.  Sure, you will usually find multiplayer lobby empty unless you switch your Steam download location to somewhere in the EU.  That's all relatively trivial next to the known save game corruption bug that's wiped out my progress twice within 6 months.Twice now, the game has rendered my save data corrupt.  Both times, this was after normal quitting of the game through the exit option in the menu.  This is apparently not uncommon, and has happened with a number of others.  None of the online racenet progress is actually stored online in any way that can be recovered.  Nor, for some reason, is the Steam cloud being leveraged to recover one's lost progress. Some gamers have recommended  disabling Steam Cloud support for the game, citing repeated failures by codemasters to handle it properly in other games.  Further, it's been recommended that users go through the hassle of digging into their C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\Userdata\<steamuserid>\255220 to save backups regularly.After the first time it happened to me, I disabled Steam cloud support, and made a copy of the 255220 userdata folder on occasion.  I eventually got comfortable and a bit lazy, and had not backed up for some time, at which point it occurred again.Hundreds of online races, purchases, upgrades, and funds lost.  Hundreds of career races and progress lost.  No way to complete the missing achievements without first redoing all the lost effort to get back to where you were before your save game data was corrupted.I honestly think this game could be good if the publisher could be bothered to fix the handful of bugs plaguing it.   It appears the developer has no intention of fixing any bugs in the game at this point.  Though one could argue hours of fun racing did occur, resetting users' progress when they are halfway through the achievements... repeatedly... is absolutely not an acceptable situation.Most active developers update their games with bugfixes as the need arises.  Codemasters apparently feels this game is complete, bugs and all, and is focused on putting their efforts into releasing new paid-for content instead of fixing the glitches.I could say save yourself the money, but honestly, save yourself the wasted time chasing achievements, and save yourself the frustration and anger at a developer who took your money and doesn't seem to care that the game is broken.Trivial lackings in addition to the above* no choice of tires* no choice of weather* no choice of road surface (all tarmac)* limited online garage slots prevent owning all vehicles			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping for some decent racing game as a good excuse to put the track IR to work, but I was rather dissapointed within barely an hour of gameplay. The exterior textures looks pretty good and the handling feels decent enough, but that's really where the positive aspects ends. No matter how many settings I turn up, the interior of the car has horrendously low quality and blurry textures in comparison to the rest of the game. And after looking it up, that's apparently just the way it is, which does not reallty make alot of sense. And speaking of settings, I cranked them all the way up, as one should with a 1080, but only to find the the game then runs at a solid 20 fps. Add some cheesy unskippable cutscenes and you're good to go.Would not recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I even begin.  First off there is a horrible memory leak in this title that can bring a GTX 770 to it's knees in a heartbeat.  I can't even really play this game unless I turn off the FFB because my Clubsport Wheel bucks like a bronco and damn near tore my finger off.  It ping pongs back and forth sitting on the grid!!!I would stay away from this title until Codemasters learns how to do proper input support and it's patched three or four times.  The developers are amazingly silent on the many complaints in the forum and every time they do pop in, they insult your intellegence with some remedial computer pointers.The game is actually fun to play, when you can play it.  However the techincal failures are too much for me to bear at this point.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite there are wildly different opinions on this game, I find Grid Autosport to be a fairly enjoyable game with it's accessible yet fun driving physics, great content and a throwback to Grid 1 or even TOCA series that should set the foundation for the next Grid game. Grid Autosport also brings back the rather enjoyable multidisciplinary racing aspect of Grid 1 and TOCA series where the game features cars from exotic hyper cars, Australian V8 Supercars, Formula 3 Open Wheel, GT3s, drift machines and so on. The career is serviceable as the whole team management aspect in Grid 1 was axed so you are very much a driver for hire now which is disappointing to me. Personally, I would still recommend Custom Cup (or commonly known as Quick Race in most racing games) where you can choose to race with any car and on any tracks to your liking, considering all the cars and tracks are unlocked once you boot up the game. There are some issues with the game such as the poorly implemented multiplayer mode, AI that can be too aggressive at times and a lot of recycled content that some might find it to be a bit lazy. Still, with a revamped and improved driving physics, driving on tracks such as the licensed race track, Red Bull Ring in Grid Autosport is certainly more enjoyable than Grid 2.I do recommend Grid Autosport to you if you enjoyed Grid 1 or TOCA series but was disappointed with Grid 2's direction. Or you are racing game fan who is looking for a fun, accessible simcade with tonnes of content. If you stumbled upon this review on a sale, I do recommend you to pick up this game along with the Season Pass as there are some really enjoyable content in the Season Pass.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												0/10 for incomplete game and too much 'launch DLC'Limit on cars you can use in MP... BLOWS!!!!Multiplayer aspect is either non-functional or dead- started up the game to not be able to join ANY servers if ANY kind what so ever. Don't even try to blame user error. I'm not doing any stupid fix that codemasters should have done. Bottom line multiplayer DOESN'T WORK. If the game advertises that it does have MP functionality that is a straight up lie. Look up how many people can't join any servers and stupid fixes and let that speak for itself.Coming from a long time GRID 1 player (600+ hours) this game tried to address everyones outrage to how terriblke Grid 2 was. Welll... they tried but didn't listen to what the customers wanted. People straight up told them to copy Grid 1 physics and have a cockpit view. Guess What?They screwed both of those simple request up. Cockpit view is a half♥♥♥♥♥low quality job that is laughable by todays standards. Driving physics are bad.. not bad as grid 2 but they are not enjoyable like Grid 1. I enjoyed driving in grid 1, The cars feel off and are not anything like cars in Grid 1 were. Grid Autoport lacks the soul of its  predesessor, I feel ripped off they even put Grid in the title and tried to play it off like ""ohhh yea we understand Grid 2 was a big pile of steaming dog poo.. Here's grid autosport its like grid 1"" Except it's not.. GG codemasters			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GRID Autosport is a very good game yet there's something missing from it. It could be because we've seen it all before, as there's nothing majorly brand new to the series in this game, however it does feel more like the original GRID than GRID 2. Which is a good thing for the original GRID's fans. A lot of tracks are repeated from GRID 1 & 2, but that's not a bad thing as most of these are the 'good' tracks including the made up San Francisco and Chicago one's. There's a nice selection of cars in game which beats its predecessors, I think, by quite a bit. A nice bit of variety, but no way near the amount of vehicles that you'd get in Forza or Gran Turismo. Then again there isn't really any need for that many. The handling of the cars is more similar to the original GRID with that essence of both arcade and simulation (GRID 2's was arcade) however it does lean more on the simulation side a bit more this time. This game was made in about a year as it came out due to complaints from the original GRID's fans. Oh it also has in- car cam in it now, more about that below in the Pro's & Con's bit:Pro's:Nice variety of cars/ disciplines- Touring Cars- Street Racers- Open Wheel & more. Graphics- As always, great graphics from Codemasters. Sharp and shiny. Lot's of tracks- Whether they be made up or real life, you will find a track that you like.Online- Is (I think) better than the Career mode. You can look up or set up custom sessions. But if you can't be bothered looking through things let it plough you face first in to a mixture of races! You can also be in clubs and change car skins/ livery's whatever you want to call it. Menu- I like the menu'sHandling- I think it's pretty damn good, no more drifting in every single car like in GRID 2.Con's:Music- Lack's music. GRID 1 & 2 had more variety and had a big part in the games.In- car cam- It's there, it's just blurry. There's also a dashboard cam. I'm not too bothered about it, I just don't get why they would have a good one in GRID 1 and not its sequels.Repeat tracks- Only bad for people who have played the other GRID's and want something new. AI- This one was difficult, they're nice and aggressive, but you can't help but feel they have the upper- hand some of the time. It's difficult to spin them out, but it's easy for them to do it to you.Career- A bit bland the further you go in to it, plus having a teamate makes you not want to have one. Also you can't make your own livery's.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like the GRID series a lot, and I'm not really into racing games in general. This series always feels like a throwback game to a lot of people, myself included. It's a solid game, and certainly worth the price. I've played a lot of GRID 2, so I'm sure I'll enjoy this one as well. It's not a huge leap different from G2, from what I've seen so far. Buy it. You won't regret it, especially considering it's a bargain at this price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Wowww.. Simply the best Oculus experience you can have in a racing game. I just bought this game to check out the experimental Oculus DK2 support! So far this has been one of the best VR experiences ever.. I didnt expect too much of it, but i was very suprised the support is realy realy good. Altough I didnt felt immersively overwelmed, this is one of the few games i can play for hours without any headaches and also a very very great game. not all menu's are supported, but the racing itself is a really awesome. Direct to Rift and Extended mode works perfect. Hope the GRID Team will keep on supporting Oculus, as its a truly remarkable experience!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I wouldn't say this is in the same league as other sims like Assetto Corsa, Forza Motorsport, or GT, etc., but it is definitely a fun little racer. In fact this game does do one thing better than any other racing game I've played, and that's making me feel like I'm the racecar driver and not the car itself. All other racers I've felt like a sentient car born with an urge to go as fast around a track as possible. In Grid Autosport I feel like a driver racing for my team and trying to get the attention of better teams so I can further my career. It makes winning more satisfying and battling it out against rivals even more intense. Get it while it's on sale and you'll be pleasantly surprised.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great improvment over GRID 2, but still fails a bit short when compared to the first GRID.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is great racing game, I usually play forza a lot on my xbox, but after buying grid autosport, I never touched forza again. I have about 10 hours on this game so far, offilne is great, a love how they have selected types of racing you can choose from. Online is really fun, as for now i cant stop playing this game. It is really worth the price, i got only for about $10 on winter sale. Great game!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
