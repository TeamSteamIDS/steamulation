												I have waited what feels like forever! But, it is finally here! In Riders Of Asgard you take the role of a historically accurate* BMX riding Viking!The goal is to beat challenges, scores and times in a competetive side scrolling 2.5D environment.Due to the level designs being, but NOT LIMITED TO 2 dimensional, the gameplay isnt overly complicated. What i mean by 'not limited to' is, you can perform 'Transfers' forwards and backwards, whilst still side scrolling through the level. This allows you to create your own path and play your own way.To sum this all up, Riders Of Asgard is simple enough to avoid stress and confusion, but diverse enough to keep you entertained and coming back for more!Also, I spoke to the Dev's a lot throughout development of this game and they are super nice, they take note of feedback and are always quick to respond to their fans! *Not as historically accurate as advertised!

												It's OK for what it is, but don't expect a Viking Trials. I was a little dissapointed and was getting very frustrated during the small sections. I was getting stuck alot, I couldn't get enough speed, and I couldn't get over 70% of the jumps. After failing to get anywhere on level 1.1 I simply gave up. As a big fan of trials I guess I was expecting a longer ride styled experience.I'm not giving the game a negative review as the problems we're down to me not enjoying the experience not the game itself. It handles really well and it looks amazing... I just couldn't seem to get into the flow of it. If you're on the fence about this one, I would suggest you watch a few lets play videos before commiting. I was planning on uploading a gameplay video but I was getting frustrated during the recording.			",1016,195,27,62,74,1,90

												WOW! This game is awesome!I started out with auto-transfers on, but after getting the hang of the controls, I turned it off and discovered my own paths. And boy, this is where the fun really begins! I quickly started unlocking new items and levels and I can't wait to see what is next! I really recommend this game to anyone and I'm going to go play some more now! :D			",17,1,0,2,1,1,0

												I started out on my bike, I thought I kind of looked like a knight. Forward charge I thought, for now it was speed that I sought. Moving forward in grace only to land smack on my face. Whilst lying there the on the floor, thinking, what happened to my score!I really enjoy this game. I loved riding along a Viking obstacle course with my trusty shield, performing tricks and trying to beat my friendâ€™s high score!			",13,2,0,2,0,1,2
