												After being gifted this game, I really really want to recommend it, but I just can't. Here's why:Pros (+) :1. Pleasant and fitting music though it feels... Not so original.2. Strong monsters (for those of you who like strong enemies in games) that scale with your level, including their loot.3. Six different classes to choose from.4. The character art is pretty, but everything else is what you would expect of a game of that genre, nothing special or unique here.5. It's possible to upgrade your weapon as well as craft your own potions.6. It's a fairly cheap game.Cons (-) :1. Classes are way too similar to each other. In fact, it doesn't matter which one you pick as they hardly differ from each other at all as there are no special abilities or talents. All of the classes can use the two OP weapons I will mention further down in this review.2. Unfixed bugs are present in the game. Several of them. You can literally walk on the walls inside the church, an innkeeper won't allow you to enter the room you paid for and you can't walk behind a really tall building.3. Hardly any balancing in melee fights: Enemies have more hp and hit harder as you level, while you hardly become any stronger. In fact, it wasn't unusual for enemies to be able to kill me with 2-3 hits once I leveled up just a few times. And that was indeed as a melee class with a higher defense stat than mages and archers. Also, there are two swords that can be used by ALL classes, and those swords can kill just about every monster without them ever being able to hit you as you hit them diagonally, while they can only harm you when you are in their path.4. Spells are useless: only 2 spells and they don't really do any major damage. Also, enemies apparently have a 2 second or so invulnerability after being hit, which isn't much of an issue when using melee weapons (as a melee weapon takes about equally long to charge the attack), but it's a major issue when using spells as you have to time the spell right so you don't waste mana nor get hit while waiting for their invulnerability to wear off. Unnecesarily hard and really bothersome.5. Very few quests for a game of that genre: I could only find 4 in the game and I literally looked everywhere and talked to every single npc in the game. Oh and they don't really give any directions so you more or less have to guess where to go for x quest.6. Lacks content: Like I wrote above, enemies become stronger the higher level you are, and so it would be nice if you could buy or acquire better armor, but there isn't anything meant for mid-game fights and above. Also, why is there a random guy living in the middle of nowhere when he does nothing important? Why does everyone talk about the king and all when he actually proves to be completely irrelevant to the story and is, in fact, impossible to interact with? 7. Incomplete (or feels so) things: why are there guard towers with instructions on how to use smoke signals if you don't ever get to use it yourself or see it happen? Why are there so many locked doors?8. Doesn't really have a lot of different weapons to offer: Again, no need to acquire any other weapon than one of the two swords mentioned above.9. The crafting / upgrading system is more or less useless. Once you acquire either one of the swords (again with the swordsâ€¦), you can literally just kill monsters without them ever being able to hit you, and only standard weapons sold by npcs can be upgraded, and the upgraded weapons are FAR inferior to those two swords. As for making your own potions, well, using OP swords will give you so much money that you will easily be able to buy more potions than you could ever need. Oh and if you really want to make your own potions, farming the ressources is a major pain and nearly impossible to do, as nothing says where to acquire them (apart from those blue butterflies). Just farm gold kay?.10. No ""fast travel"" or ""teleport to x city/town"": It's really annoying to travel through several zones 10 times while trying to avoid monsters (in EVERY zone) that can almost kill you with one hit.11. It's a fairly short game (fortunately?). I beat it first time as a ninja (the slow and long play-through to explore everything the game has to offer, and ninja is a melee class) in four hours, second time was to test the mage class and I completed it in aprox. 2, and the third was a speed run as an archer, which I completed in about an hour. I tried to beat the game using only magic and arrows, but I eventually gave up on both and just went the OP swords ""route"", which made the game A LOT easier.Final Verdict:Is it worth buying? Not really. I would probably recommend it if it had fewer bugs and more content, but right now it just feels empty content-wise after 30 or so minutes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Secret of Magia is an Action RPG developed with RPG Maker.I was given a key by the developer and I am sorry to say I do not recommend this game and here is why.Let's start with the good things first :The game offers not only between the choice of a female or male character, but features a class system that determines what can you equip. The HUD is nicely done and the quest system is rather original for a game like this.The combat system is pretty good and the enemies are implemented in a smart way, the skeletons in the mines were one of them, as they genuinely surprised me and made me paranoid.Another nice thing is that you can gather flowers and butterflies for the crafting system, sadly after an hour and a half I have not tried this system yet, but I gathered quite a lot of stuff.Now for the bad parts :I'm not sure if the developer has tested this game, but it's full of bugs, you can go inside walls, letters become plants when you read them, some blocks that should be solid are not, some that shouldn't be are, glitches here and there, couches have teleport blocks inside them, I was joking with a friend that in the first chuch you come across you can ascend to godhood by straight walking on the wall, most of the walls there are passable, even npcs climb them.The combat while original for the first half hour, is kind of unbalanced, at least as a melee class, I was getting oneshotted the first levels which was pretty frustrating (slimes), I had to align myself diagonally so the monsters wouldn't have a chance to attack me but I could. I farmed a little, when I leveled up though, the monsters leveled with me and became a lot more tanky, giving more gold too. Now, the first real boss was not a big problem because by the time I had so many money I invested in health potions, he could never kill me, doesn't matter how much damage he did to me. After that you drop a legendary weapon which is a bow, a weapon my assassin shouldn't be using but he was using anyway (not sure if legendary weapons do not have class requirements). Some of the resources are inherent to RPG Maker and not original by the developer, you can judge if that affects quality or not.I do not feel compelled to complete or continue the game as I did not have much fun with it, but thank you anyway for this chance (since I received the key by a developer or someone in contact with him).All in all it's a low quality rpg maker title with some smart ideas here and there, but with a weak story, characters and quite full of bugs at the moment of writing, so personally I would not recommend you this game.
