												Vertiginous Golf is a dystopian steam-punk mini-golf game developed by Kinelco and Lone Elk Creative. Vertiginous Golf (I will refer to it as VG for the rest of my review) is set in the skies above Scudburough in a floating city called New Lun-Donne. Those who live in Scudburough, such as your fine self, can visit Verti-Sphere shops where you can get a temporary fix of verti-golf in the clouds high above.+Nice graphics+Cool dystopian steam-punk world design+54 holes included with the game, each hole is very well designed and there's a good variation of difficulty across all courses+An integrated course editor so you can make your own courses+A few different course types+You can take control of a robotic bird to scout out the track and look for the best way forward+A cool 'free stroke' mechanic which involves you getting the ball in a certain whole to get that stroke free and move you to a different part of the course+Cool rewind function, it's not unlimited which leaves the game a good level of challenge, rewind fuel can be restored by taking shots+Simple controls (I played with a 360 controller)+Good soundeffects and nice soundtrack+Singleplayer and Multiplayer both local and online+/-No predicted path for the ball, personally I would have liked to have seen it be at least an option +/-There aren't many railings on the courses so you're gonna lose your ball over the side often-Awful voice acting, it's all very bland and uninteresting -Uninteresting story which isn't helped by the afore mentioned voice acting-Only two clubs to choose from-The ball feels a bit too bouncy for my liking which makes it even easier for balls to go over the edgeVerdict:7.5A fun dystopian steam-punk mini-golf game with nice graphics, cool world design, loads of courses, an integrated course editor and some cool mechanics. If you like mini-golf games, chances are you're gonna like this.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

Early Access Review
The GoodVertignious Golf is a gorgeous game, both conceptually and stylistically.  The game controls aren't difficult to grasp, the music and sounds are well designed, and the interface is nice and clean, not interfering with the graphics -- did I mention they were gorgeous?  Oh, yes, I did.The hummingbird and rewind features are welcome additions to the basic gameplay of minigolf.  In fact, given the complexity of some of the holes, they're requirements.  The availability of a wedge in addition to a putter is welcome, adding a level of strategy absent in other minigolf games.The game is also eminently playable -- on the more advanced courses, there are several ways to play each hole, so there's little repetition even with the limited number of courses.  If it has a boredom factor, I haven't reached it yet.The BadWhile I have not identified the game's boredom factor, it does have a frustration factor, and it was found quite quickly.There are difficult holes.  There are even diabolical holes -- the par 3 8th at OSU Scarlet, when the pin is set in that card-table sized tongue of green sticking out into the pond, comes to mind as a real-world example.Vertiginous Golf, unfortunately, includes a few unplayable holes, where the line between success and failure is both unmarked and razor thin.  The penalty for failure is vastly out of proportion to the value of success -- and scores rapidly balloon out of control, rendering an entire round not much more than an exercise in futility.  And if I want futility, I can just load up my clubs and go play some real golf (which can fairly be described as two shots worthy of Tiger hidden within one hundred twenty worthy of Tigger).On the plus side, this is the worst I have to say about Vertiginous Golf -- but since it's central to game play, it's of importance.The SkinnyOverall, I'll give 7.5/10, though I would strongly recommend the designers re-visit some of the holes and dial it back a little.  I don't expect an ace every time, but neither do I expect to be condemned to ten or more strokes because I missed a tee shot by the faintest of margins.On the cosmetic side, I'd like to suggest allowing the player to choose their ball color (or if that's already in the game, making it more obvious as I haven't found it yet).  We golfers are a superstitious lot, and I (think I) play better with a blue or green ball than with a red one.  :DA course designer would be another welcome addition -- way back in ancient times (i.e., the 1990s), the Jack Nicklaus series of golf games always included course design tools, and some of the fan-made courses were genuinely brilliant.  The vast array of additional free content also kept the JN games playable far longer than most other games released at the same time.Overall, this game is Recommended on the basis of design and creativity, and in the hopes that some of its frustration factor is ironed out by the time of its official release.

Early Access Review
I've not has so much fun playing a crazy golf game since buying 3D Ultra™ Minigolf Adventures well over 4 years ago.  Vertiginous Golf, is not only  beautiflul  to look at , it's deviously more difficult to  score compared to  the older mini golf game.  With local coop available now; and,   as development progresses  with   up to 4 player multiplayer this is going to be a great game to play with your online mates.  I can imagine the laugh your all going to have playing this.   The game is in early access;  if you were lucky enought to buy it via the humble store    a few days ago, you'd have  got it  for half price, right up to its release.The game is a physics based first person exploratory mini golf game  set in a steampunk  universe.  There are loads of  innovations  included such as first person mechanical humming bird that can be utilized to plan your shots, there' s a rewind facility that allows  you to  undo or rewind a shot without losing a stroke (basically a cheat system).  The ball can also be controlled  using the WASD keys, so  rewinding part way, you can then adjust your shot accordingly.  There's a whole host of other  things  included  such as moving obstacles,    mini helicopters, blockers,  platforms, spinners, travelators and other   interesting  items (eg  a glowing semi transparent  trail showing you   your previous shots)  that  help or hinder your progress.  At the moment there are 18 holes with   a further 27 + holes planned in future updates.As an early access game  you can report bugs in the  games forums HERE.You can see  videos  of game play HERE,   HERE   and HERE. Highly recommended even at it's full price of £11.99 ($14.99).  That's over £3 cheaper  if you can find a friend in the US to gift it too you.  ;) ",4946,1933,224,565,877,79,758

												Vertiginous Golf, is a puzzle golf game I recently got during the free giveaway event. The game couples relaxing music and visuals with golfing and physics puzzle based gameplay. The world is fantastical and steampunk, this is not a game for someone looking for a legitimate golf sim type of game.  Vertiginous Golf comes with a level creator as well! You can share these custom courses with other players custom course menu.  You can even play these courses in the online multiplayer. A few other things to note are the neat interactive menus in the game, and the character customization, both are neat additions and not something I would expect coming into a game like this.   I can freely say that I have not played much of Vertiginous yet, but  I enjoy the gameplay it offers. I haven't tried much of multiplayer but the population seems to be fairly small, its not surprising since I had not heard of this game until it was offered free for a day.  I would recommend this game to fans of puzzle games, or even golf games, as long as they can tolerate the more fantastical feeling offered here.			",374,143,14,85,57,11,89

			Brbteabreak got to get hands on with Vertiginious Golf, a new crazy arcade golfing game developed by Lone-Elk. Subscribe for more inappropriate pop-up images.		

You could say Vertiginous Golf is the golfing equivalent of Dark Souls, there’s no hand holding going on here and all you’re told is you have to get the ball into the hole at the end of the course. How you do this is completely up to you, do you try and smash it across the whole field, hoping to get some lucky rebounds? Maybe you’re a bit more conservative and like to go for the paths which are enclosed? Maybe you want that “hole-in-one” every time and you have to pitch perfectly in order to get it. Also did I mention this game is as hard as 7 week old bacon?Vertiginous Golf is overflowing with options, which is something you wouldn’t normally see from a game which is tied to a sport. Just on originality alone I think this is a good pick-up. It already has great features while in Early Access and promised future developments look even better. I’d only steer away from this if you have ADD and you need fast hot action all over your face in order to feel satisfied, now go clean yourself up.			",374,70,4,34,40,2,41

												Let me begin this review by saying two things: As a gamer, my guilty pleasure has always been Mini-golf games. I have played them through my childhood, but as an adult, I had slacked off. Then--*Gasp*--What do my eyes see? I new mini-golf game on steam! I immediately got it and was thrilled to play it, even at the price point.And the second point is simply this; How dare you expect me to enjoy this heap of junk.The controls are the wonkiest thing on the planet, I feel like I have no kind of control over the ball whastsoever. There is nowhere near enough railing, I found myself constantly falling off of the platforms for no other reason than my putter flinched a little harder than I told it--tried to tell it to.In the story, the concept with the records advancing the plot and rewarding you if you do is really neat. However, making it mandatory to make the hole isn't. I had made it to the end of a hole, after, oh I don't know, 15 storkes because the ball forgot how to stay on the platform, and finally made it to the raised recepticle where the ball was thanks to a ""free stroke"" hole (that just sounds dirty). I was thrilled I had finally made it, only to discover that I missed a record. I couldn't get out. I had to restart the hole because a metal tube spat me out at a point where I couldn't go back. Also, this happened on three different holes.And don't get me started on how bad the Swing Power system is. You could pull the club to the same height three times and get three totally different swings. Oh, And the ball itself! Oh golly gee wilikers, that ball. I have lost more strokes because my ball bounced off of the cup and into the abyss than I care to count. It doesn't matter how slow the ball is going, if I can't just barely nudge it in, it goes flying out and 5 meters away, usually into the abyss. It's unbelieveable. And I'm NOT going to star in on the awful, twitchy camera.SummaryIt may sound like I am just bad at the game and complaining about it, but I have a feel for how a game like this should work. And, frankly, something isn't working here. This game is trying to be something that it just isn't quite yet. Now, I know, what you're thinking, ""Hey, Joe! Give the Devs a break, the game has been in 1.0 for literally three days!"" I know that. I have a lot of games that are still in development in my library. I know how tedious a game can be for the first few months until they patch it up and give it its lolly. So, don't get me wrong, I am still excited to play this game. Just... not right now. My keyboard may need a bandage first.So, until the game is fixed a little bit, I can't and won't recomend it. But, the second those updates happen(they ARE going to happen, right?), I will be chomping at the bits, ready to play. And then I will gladly, openly, and, perhaps even lovingly change my review, but until then, I almost refuse to play it.Until next time (There WILL be a next time, right?);Cheers,SuPeR_J03			",57,18,0,11,13,1,16

Don't expect it to be easy to put the ball in the hole and don't expect it to be stress free. This game is hard core and can be frustrating at first, but with a little in game experience, you'll see your scores getting better. The graphics are really nice too....  Fun game! Buy it now!

Early Access Review
								Highly original, beautifully crafted and rock-hard ""mini-golf"" game. I have to put that between brackets because although this is more or less traditional mini-golf, it doesn't look or feel like it at all. Imagine playing minigolf on islands in the sky with twisted, devious and brilliant courses in a steam-punk world remeniscent of Bioshock Infinite.From the moment you start this game up and are greeted with one of the most innovative and immersive menu systems I have ever seen in a computer game you know you are in for something special.As of writing the game is feature complete and I have not noticed any bugs, there are two courses of 9 holes and a training hole. So don't let the Early Acces label scare you off, this is the first EA game I have purchased and I am glad I did. Appart from adding about 30 more holes and tweaking this game could be considered finished.Oh did I mention this game was rock-hard? Don't be surprised to get 20, 30 or even 40 over par on your first attempts at a hole. Getting the first hole in one is going to be an epic challenge.This is obviously a labour of love, the passion the developers have put into this project shines through in every aspect of Vertiginous Golf. You owe it to yourself to give this a shot if you are intrigued, because this is one of the better examples of video games being art without being pretentious. The stylish design and gameplay blend together perfectly and it never feels contrived.I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a beautiful, relaxing but also very challenging experience.

												Vertiginous Golf is a game that will either grow on you…or it wont. When I first started playing this game, I got very frustrated with it very quickly. Over time, I learned some of the different features it has to offer, so I experimented with some of these other features before returning to the base part of the game.When you first start playing this game, you have a few different options. There are various 1 player modes, as well as multi player modes to choose from. I started by playing the regular mini putt holes, and worked my way up to playing these holes with the multi player mode. I will say, the holes get drastically more difficult and complex as you move on. Sometimes, in my opinion, the par the holes are set at can be unreasonable, but with that aside, the holes do range in difficulties.This game also gives you a build your own hole option, which I found to be rewarding, because I could take some of my frustrations out that I had with the game, on the self created holes. Some of the obstacles I previously found aggravating and just downright cruel, became amusing in the close to impossible holes I created for myself.NOTE: I got this game for free during a special event, so I recommend this game when it is on sale for a low price. If I were to have actually spent a chunk of change on this game, I would have rated it differently. As I mentioned before, MANY of the holes built into this game leave you asking yourself  “how is it even possible to get it in that many strokes?” or “this hole isn’t even fair!” As I stated earlier in my review however, I changed my attitude with this game because I play it now more as a humorous experiment, instead of a serious challenge.

												It's a case of nice premise, but ultimately boring execution. The story falls back on the inevitable cliches, the controls are a bit clunky, and over all it doesn't do too much to stand out.the biggest problem I have with it is ultimately a lack of consequence. good scores will garner you more money, sure, but on holes where I was getting 20 strokes over par (again, the controls are awkward and touchy) I was still receiving a small reward at the end. The upgrades you can buy with the money are purely cosmetic, and by then end it literally had bored me to sleep. Games should present either a challenge, or give the illusion of one, and this game fails to do either.ultimately, it gets a lost golfball out of ten in my book.			",91,32,1,9,9,3,10

								This is a great game and the developers have already added some content and made various improvements.  It may require a painstaking amount of precision and tremendous amounts of trial and error but in the end when it all comes together and you are making par you feel truly accomplished.UPDATE: 7/12/14Being as most reviewers on here have not spent that much time with game (except for rabid) this is the truly unique golf game, that fans of ""wacky"" golf games have been waiting for.  If Kirby's dream course was a turn based strategy game this would be the RTS equal.  This game makes you think more than a puzzle game and react more than a FPS. It is incredibly well made and gets better by the month.  The only downside I can see to recommending this game is that it will affect my positions on the leaderboards. YOU GUYS ROCK. Thanks for making a great game and letting us go along for the ride as I am sure it will become the standard which golf games are measured by.			",34,10,1,2,2,1,3

												Disclaimer: I got this for free, so I can't be sure if the price is okay, but...I had great fun with a friend playing this game. Despite the cons other reviews mentioned, it does well what it was designed to do: a minigolf game. The holes are sometimes more complex than it should be, but that's the fun of it. When you play with friends, an inaccurate stroke could send your ball to ""how am I supposed to get to the hole now?!"", which will give you and yours friends a very hilarious time toghether. That alone makes it worth buying this game for a few fun local-coop sessions, not to mention the online part (multiplayers and level builder, which I haven't tried yet).Honestly, I just want to pull more people into this game to creat more holes for me to play XD			",50,10,1,12,5,1,1

Early Access Review
								Why does miniature golf need to be miniature? Why can't it be the scale of regular golf, so I'm putting through three hundred yards of bumpers and windmills and rollercoasters? Also, why can't mini-golf have lots of mechanical hummingbirds?Obviously, we've all asked these questions. Now Vertiginous Golf is here to answer them.It's insanity, but it all works well. It's fun and polished, especially for a tiny indy production like this one. The multiplayer is the star of the show. Charming and imaginative describe virtually every inch of what exists in Vertiginous Golf.My only real complaint is lack of content. It needs more courses. Partly, that's Early Access. But, the future goals say the final game will have 45+ courses, and it will need to be double that, at least, because it IS miniature golf. Real golf is about honing nuances. Miniature golf, at any scale, is far more dependent on novelty factor. As cool and robust as these course designs are, they're not anything you're going to play fifty or a hundred times. The game needs so many holes that by the time you finish the final holes, you can no longer remember the early holes clearly. That's the only way this will ever be anything more than an incredibly cool way to spend an evening or two. The only way this will ever be a real game.My hope is that this will turn into a more expensive game, with far, far more content, instead of remaining a cheap game which inevitably starts pushing the edges of its content after just a few hours. At the moment, it reminds me a lot of the disc golf sector of the ps3 game Sports Champions - BRILLIANT, but give me more of it. A *lot* more of it.			",90,6,5,13,14,2,32

This game does offer online multi-player but I have not tried it and don't really plan to.Pros:-Fun multi-player-Beginner level single-player story course is REALLY fun!-a free-roaming menu area where you can run around in the rain, visit the customization shop, or go straight to playing the game (it would be cool if there was more explorable content here, but it is still cool as is).-Humming bird and club customizations are really cool (the character clothes are cool too but you only see them for a few seconds before you start a course.)-more game modes than I have currently tried at the moment.-level editor is a nice touch-creative courses-story mode is actually very interesting. The sound clips you get throughout the single player story really help you understand the lore and world of the game which is fairly enjoyable. Cons:- if you have multiple controllers hooked up, they control everything (all players). It would be good to have an option for designated player controls rather than pass n' play.-Player created levels are a bit disorganized. It would be nice if this feature could be done through steam workshop so you could see more info on the levels when browsing.-Multiplayer does not give you coins to unlock accessories or club skins. You need to play single-player for that.-Single-player courses(and most courses in general) get mind numbingly difficult once you start the intermediate levels.-The camera could be better at times. Some times I can't see where I am putting because of a tree, wall, low ceiling, etc...-in multiplayer, all players share the same club and humming-bird skins (character skins too but thats not important cause you dont see it in game). It would be nice to have the option for players to have different humming bird and club skins.			",237,84,3,46,19,3,40

												Art Deco/Steampunk style mini golf game. Lovely presentation, and I like the free-form multiplayer aspect--you can play properly, taking strokes in turn or just play simultaneously and troll around with weapons. If you don't like golf then you won't like this, otherwise you'll enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Vertiginous Golf? More like Pretentious Golf. OR Bioshock Golf: The Game. I'm unsure if I can adequately express quite how much the characters in this game love hearing themselves talk. You play as a silent protagonist playing golf via virtual reality projection of a sort to play on floating platforms in the sky. The story is all told by rambling characters who spent 3 hours poring over a thesaurus for the most ostentatious way of saying anything at all. At first, it was charming, but after about 2 hours of it, I was dreadfully tired of it, but to attempt to follow the plot, you have to listen to the recordings which you gain by touching them with your golf ball. I wound up having a friend stream to watch me play just under the last half of the game, and she found the people prattling on even more annoying than I did.That said, this is actually a pretty good game. It's a steampunk floating mini golf course where you can occasionally rewind bad swings, use contraptions in the environment to get your ball where you want it to go, and use a club that lets you hit in a straight line, or one that lets you make it come up off of the ground strategically. I'll be honest: I was absolute rubbish at this game. I had more than 40 swings on a par 4 level, and the last half of the game I was doing absolutely miserably at it on a regular basis. Despite all of that, I had fun. I'm glad this game was made, even if the characters drone on a bit more than I found enjoyable. This is far from the type of game I would normally ever play, but I picked it up on the cheap as part of a Humble Bundle. I do recommend this game, though I would say $5.00 should be the most a person ought to pay for it, if that much. I had a good time.			",428,108,2,61,33,5,50

The game works well, isnt buggy or broken, its not even that difficult.If you can get it on sale or you got a free copy from a friend, its worth getting together and playing.You can play golf and attack each other.Point system is a bit broken, but other than that, pretty good.

Early Access Review
								(October 9th)I just recently got this game and already my friends and I love it. We got it after the multiplayer update and have had a blast messing around it. The singleplayer and multiplayer have multiple options for you to choose from. So you can either make it challenging for yourself by removing the bug influencer, playing on a only green map, or if with your friends play with weapons.There are also multiple ways to play the multiplayer matches. So far from what I've played they have a regular golf match (9 holes) and they have a race type. Now typically for the regular match it's kind of like a race but you can go at your own pace. My friends and I personally like to take turns and whatnot but you can play however you want. So I haven't put as many hours into this game as some of the other people here, but I LOVE this game. Just because you play a course doesn't mean you can't go back and play it again. With how the holes are setup, there are multiple ways about getting to your goal. So if you mess up, keep going, and come back some other time and try to beat your score on how you did it before. There are just so many possibilities.Now this game is currently in Early Access but it's still a great game for where it is at. So here are some Pros and Cons that I have come to find about this game.Pros:-Replay Value (a ton, I really don't see how I could run out of options especially if Steam Community gets involved)-Lovely Graphics (freaking beautiful)-Some minor customization on your playing style (no bug influence, yes/no weapons)-Very smooth gameplay (I play on Splendid graphics and framerate is great)-Easy concepts to grasp (Left mouse camera, right mouse shoot) (there is more but you get the picture)-Online Multiplayer (little buggy but whatever, still cool)-Hilarious to laugh at friends as you explode their ball into oblivion (bombs are awesome. You can explode their ball out of the hole)-Nine 9 hole courses so far (increases in difficulty each one)-Button customization (don't like how it's setup? No prob, set it to what you want)-8 player multiplayer (freaking 8. I haven't had that many friends on here yet but seriously, imagine the chaos of 8 people placing traps for others. Huehuehuehue)Cons: -Online Multiplayer Servers:            Everytime you go to multiplayer you search a region to play in. For some reason it has it set to Europe as default for me when I live in the US. I would like to click on US and search for things there, but it has to search for every game in the regions, which could take some time, stalling for even longer. So if there was a way to have a choice on which region you want to play would be nice.-Online Multiplayer Options:           Yes you have a lot of options to choose from, and that is awesome, BUT, if you try to change the course instead of repeating the level, you might accidentally mess up and have to restart the hosted game.-Online Multiplayer Lobby:           I love the fact that you can create your own lobby, it's cool, but you don't have many options in your lobby. Your lobby is always public, so anyone can join. Which is sometimes irritating if I'm waiting for my friends to join. So they join whatever, you can ask them to leave, but they don't always. So you have to restart the lobby. Why? Because you have no kick option.-Weapon selection:           This is kind of minor but I wish there was a way to choose your weapon with a specific button rather then having to press 'c' 4 times to get what I want. Maybe I can select how I want to set it up and I'm being stupid. I haven't explored all the button options yet, but I haven't seen any options for it. -Camera:            It's pretty good for the most part, but sometimes you get stuck near a pole and can't see where you are trying to put. Other games have fixed this by making those see through but everything is solid, so on the rare occasion if you get stuck, you kind of have to hope you hit it to the right spot because you can't see.Yes I have some issues with the online multiplayer, but I can't blame the developers, this option just came out October 6th so I don't expect this feature to be perfect, there are some things anyone/anything can improve on. There are also some other features that they said they plan on bringing to the game later on. Such as a LOT more customization. Avatars, Putters, Golf Balls, and Levels. Freaking Levels. They said they plan on bringing in Steam Community to this game. Players from all around will be creating their own levels with the level customization will be used (they plan on bringing that and hopefully will). There is so much they can do with this game, I'm just so excited to see what they will do. So long story short, this game rocks my socks off. I love mini golf in real life and this game really only limits people to their imagination. I hope to see this game keep going and come out with all the features they plan on. TL;DR - Den outta Den			",207,58,4,11,11,5,17

								If you have an itch for a wacky golf/marble madness style game, you could do much worse than Vertiginous Golf. Admittedly, I'm not that far in but I've enjoyed what I've played so far. Mechanically very good, and oozing with style, I definitely recommend the game. I also find it super relaxing, if you're into that sort of thing.			",123,32,3,15,8,2,17

												The Hate reviews are totally unjustified.I have no problem recommending this game.It's a functional multiplayer Mini Golf Game. I had fun with my girls and GF.However: The interface for setting up and starting your round of golf, is unnessary and confusing.Production Value is barebones. You get a Birdy, and NOTHING. Not even a sound effect. Par? Same. Win the round? Same. You get nothing. It's weird, and awkward. This game is good enough, that it deserves a final coat of paint and polish, and, honestly, that is all it's missing. ",167,64,9,22,11,3,21

												This is one of those games where a meh button would apply. The gameplay isn't bad, but on some of the holes I feel that the par is too low. The courses are pretty neat. So is the bird you can fly around the course to view it. The character model looks awful, but that isn't too big of a deal. Also, I have had trouble with accidentally trying to use RMB to aim and ending up wasting a shot.Pros:Levels are designed to be interestingWorld looks fairly niceBird controlCons:Bad character modelsSomewhat awkward controlsMildly unforgivingOverall, I would give this a 5.5/10. It definitely is not worth the $10, but for anything less than $5, I would say it was a good price. Want to reiterate, this is not a bad game. It just isn't a particularly good one.I got the key for this game from a steam group called Accidentally Reviewed. I thank them greatly for distributing free keys for reviewing and encourage anyone and everyone to join the group.			",154,29,4,14,10,1,24

												Vertiginous Golf has its heart in the right place. It's an interesting indie game that attempts to take mini golf and spruce it up with a fantastic enviroment and cool hole machines. The controls were decent and worked well for the gameplay. I liked the inclusion of multiplayer and the overal theme of a steampunk world. The issue lies in the presentation. Why have a 3D area when a menu system would have sufficed? I found myself wanting to explore the world and not play the actual game. I enjoyed the rain an the music in the game area. That is never good. Still, I think this game deserves your dollar. Pick it up on sale and try it out.			",277,72,4,39,18,6,50

												Very hard mini golf game, get ready to be punished by the levels, specially some community created ones. It's very fun to play with friends, you also can activate items to punish opponents even further. The game is not fully polished but works very decently, for 5 dolars or less it's a very good buy.Pros:++ Multiplayer with friends.+   Nice graphics (Not very optimized in terms of CPU and graphic card use).+   Levels creation tool (if you want to create your own holes or play the ones made by the community).+   Creative story courses.+   Character, clubs, ball and pet customization.+   Can use your flying pet to get a good view of the hole and prepare your next shot.+   You can also chip, not only putt.+   Interesting super powers and rewind key.Cons:- not very friendly UI, take some time to get accustomed to it.- Multiplayer gets stuck sometimes (not frequently).- Room creation in multiplayer is a bit funky, sometimes it doesn't appear in the list for other players to join (you gotta exit the game and load it again to solve it).If you see it in discount, get some copies and invite your friends, you will get fun. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is nice amount of maps originally within the game and physics are made with good sense of humour.I recommend that you try at least once this, if you decided to grab it for free.

Early Access Review
								This game is really pretty cool. It's a minigolf game with a really cool fantasy-esque atmosphere and neat little contraptions all over. You build up power with swings and can use either a rewind button or a little jet thingie on your ball to move it slightly where you want. At first it seems like rewind is incredibly OP but the game gets fairly challenging and fairly fast. To the point it might even get a bit frustrating to some people. Luckily I was playing it with my girlfriend so I did honestly have a good time watch us both screw up a few times. The game's got pretty good graphics and a neat art style and is surprisingly not too computer intensive too. It also has online now which they just added. I don't know if I'll do that myself as I'm more content with local, but it's cool to have the option to play with friends. Apparently has weapons and other fun junk if you want. Another reason I really enjoyed this game. The devs are really cool and seem to be very active even in the steam forums. I had a glitch that didn't allow me to play local multiplayer and made a thread here. The devs worked with me on it and in just a day they released a patch to fix it. That's something you don't see too often when it comes to early access and other junk and is certainly a breath of fresh air. I will admit the game is a tad big buggy and has the occasional physics or weird clipping bug, but its kind of hard to stay mad at it when it's an early access game. I expect it to be ironed out as time goes on. The devs were very open with what their update schedule is and what their plans are and have so far done what they said. Anyways, it's just a really nice mini golf game. If you want to play a nice relaxing (or a fairly challenging) game of minigolf you should really give it a shot. even though it is early access, it's a fun enough game even as it is right now and even goes on sale fairly often. its just fun ok. devs were swell and is looks cool. Not expensive either. Thanks ilu			",350,133,7,51,31,7,46

												Minigolf in the skySo this game is basically minigolf except there's tons of spots where your ball can fall off. You know that feeling in Mario Kart when you fall off the edge? Well you'll get that feeling in this game a lot.  However, this game makes up for that by not requiring you to score a certain amount to proceed. It also has a shop. YES A FREAKING SHOP. It's cosmetic, but still I love buying things in games. Honestly though you should see for yourself how unique this game is.Watch me play through the first story

												Whilst I've not yet touched the singleplayer, the multiplayer is solid. The mechanics allow for a new spin on a classic game which allows for hours of fun. Not to mention the level editor (Whilst a bit iffy at times, and can become laggy due to complexity - not an issue in the game however) allows for far more replayabilty. Whilst I cant recommend this game for those looking for a singleplayer experience, if you have a couple friends together and are willing to part with a bit of cash, you can have a lot of fun with this game.

												At the surface, Vertiginous Golf looks like another generic minigolf game that has a steampunk theme to it. Just like those never ending various themed pinball games, there are many themed minigolf games like this one and I'm not gonna lie, this one isn't on the top of the ""15 minigolf games you should play before you stop being a gamer because you only play games like Vertiginous Golf, a minigolf game that's set in a dystopian steam punk world where the player casually sits down on electrical chair to get shocked into a world in the skies above an alternate world where the smog filled, dark, constant raining reality seems like a bad dream"" list. It'll probably not be on the list even if the list was 30 minigolf games. But this game, this ""minigolf"" game is something much more, something that's hard to figure it out at first glance.If you're playing this game, or planning to play this game, or maybe you even finished the game and have or haven't figure out the deeper part of the game, then that probably means you've played a lot of minigolf games. This isn't the kind of game that someone who's not a fan of minigolf games would play, most people would just look at it, go ""huh"" and move on. So if you're not one of those ""lucky""could someone who's first minigolf game to be this one called lucky? Would they just play all the courses and miss the true purpose of this game? Can those people called lucky? Maybe they are, for them to not have the same fate as me, not knowing what this game contains. Maybe they are lucky to not have their minds filled with regrets and thoughts about this mad, dysfunctional society we live in few who stumbled upon this game, then that probably means you're a veteran minigolf game player and you've probably played all the big titles like 3D Ultra Minigolf and Planet Minigolf or maybe even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org]. And you probably know how most of these minigolf game goes. Well if you think this game is like 3D Ultra Minigolf, Planet Minigolf or even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org] then you're right, it's just another minigolf game, and if you like minigolf (like me) then do give this a try. It may lack polish compared to big budget minigolf games like 3D Ultra Minigolf, Planet Minigolf or  even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org], but hey, more minigolf.

Early Access Review
								This game is very promising and well worth the money, even at the stage it is in now.The holes are very imaginative and fun to play. I've played through each course a couple times now and I'm still having a lot of fun. I will say that the hole layouts are a bit confusing. These aren't par 3-4 holes! The complexity is slightly annoying at first but adds to the replay value. It's been fun for me to realize ""secrets"" to getting the best path through a hole.The shot strength is another mechanic that you just have to get used to. After my couple hours of play I am now pretty certain of how far my shots will go.There is plenty of help in this game, easing the difficulty level down. There is a flashback feature to redo shots. There is also an aftertouch to sway the ball after hitting it. There will apparently later be a hardcore mode with those disabled if you find it too easy.The atmosphere and genre of the game is great. The music is calming and the atmosphere serene.I'm very excited for the future course editor and new courses. The developers seem very active in the forums and seem to greatly value the community. I have faith that this game will get expanded in the ways that they say it will and it is pretty fun now to hold me over!			",565,217,40,68,95,17,91

								Really fun, steampunk themed mini-golf.  The visuals look great and the courses are varied.  Constructuve critisism - better manipulation of the camera, option to hide the club itself while shooting, and scale the power meter to make it less ""touchy"" for the first 25% or so.

												While the graphics are fantastic, and the courses have a lot of potential, my only problem with the game is the mouse sensitivity-disabling acceleration and decreasing sensitivity still has not made a large enough difference in precision to make it easy to set the stroke speed for the different holes.

												I'd say that this is a pretty fun game overall! I'm a big fan of the art and steampunk idea, especially how it takes place in the sky. Other than that, the only thing that would need mentioning is all of the nasty bugs in this game. However, I've already named them all on the main discussion so I will refrain from retyping them all here. I'd reccommend this game to anyone who is a fan of golfing games, but not in it's current state. If you plan on spending money on this game I suggest waiting until it is stable, so that one may have an enjoyable experience whilst playing.			",76,7,0,6,6,1,5

A Playable Golf GameConsidering this game went for free during its promo, it is possible to get this game very cheap now. It provides a good amount of fun for a while if you play with a friend or some friends. The courses at the start are not too challenging and easy to understand, however later on in the game the courses become very complex with the addition of many objects that manipulate the balls movement. It runs well and with the ability to make your own courses and play other peoples in addition to the multiplayer, it makes it at least enough content to be worth a few dollars.

								This game is as advertised.  A delightful steam-punk infused mini golf game that is often challenging, and dang it, even frustrating a times.  However, when you sink those difficult shots it feels great, and the whole aesthetic of the game is very appealing.  I quite enjoy how you start the game outside of a quaint shop, inside of which you will find the menu that launches the game proper.  With regular updates hitting frequently since I purchased the game, I'm definitely feeling like I got my monies worth.  I haven't even had a chance to try multiplayer yet but I'm sure it would be a great time indeed.			",180,33,2,30,24,4,38

												I understand that this golf game is supposed to take place in a steampunk setting and the overall presentation does lend itself to that aim. The problem is that this premise also gets in the way (for me) of enjoying a golf experience that is very much flawed in every aspect. Playing Vertiginous Golf hardly feels like I'm playing a golf game. While the physics engine is serviceable, the holes and their gimmicks simply get in the way of what golf or mini golf are supposed to feel like. Traversing each hole is cumbersome and awkward. The alternative-style (steampunk?) obstacles scattered throughout each hole just aren't interesting, nor do they add anything new and worthwhile to the golfing experience. There's also very little content and each hole is very similar to the next. Yes, there is the opportunity to create your own holes and to play through holes created by the community but they honestly all look, feel and play the same. This is a less than ambitious golf game with little to no variety. I would rather play PGA Tour Golf for DOS, which was released in 1990.Vertiginous Golf is mediocre.			",1294,339,60,143,147,16,197
