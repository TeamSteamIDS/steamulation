												Fun little puzzle pool game.... IN SPACE!Hit the balls out of the arena to clear them.There is some extras like bombs, which are trickier to clear than normal balls.There is local turn based multiplayer, which I haven't tried out yet.Would love to see some bots to play against, and some online multiplayer in the future.
