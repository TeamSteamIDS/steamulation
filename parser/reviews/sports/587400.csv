												I have wanted a snowmachine game sense SledStorm came out on PlayStation one. This is the best thing to come out sense then for people that want a snow cross game. The game is very arcade and the snowmachines have a generic sound and don't really handle like a real snowmachine but its not bad. It does'int quite have the realism that MX unleashed offered for moto-cross games but It's a good start. Only complaint I have is the price. I fell like $9.99 is a more realistic price for the quailty of game.			",97,8,14,4,31,0,17

												Snow Moto Racing Freedom is a really cool and solid arcade racing game much in the style of Aqua Moto Racing Utopia, a game that I like a lot since it reminds me of the old wave race series of games except with more of everything. This game feels very different and in a great way. First, it’s on snow and it gives you the racing options to either sprint cross vast mountain landscapes or to race head-to-head in arenas full of jumps, turns and sometimes high hills to climb. I was impressed to notice that the snow sparkles and that the weather effects range from daylight, sunset, storm, into even dark night where the snowmobiles have their headlights on. The trails that all snowmobiles make stays in the landscapes and are not removed like in other snow games I’ve played. Overall I find the sound quality superb. There are dopler effects as you get passed, the engine pitch goes up when you’re in the air and I even hear the skis in the snow.  The game is rich on features with an extensive single player career mode, time trials, freestyle, leisure, just to mention a few. I think a lot of effort has gone into all the details of the game. And to top it off this game has online play with world rankings. My best advice to beginners:* Try out the first person camera for a great sensation of speed and to gain more direct control on the tight racing tracks.  * In snocross, release the stick early in turns to keep on track.* Don’t be affraid to try different routes in sprint, even if they seem crazy.* Use the boost button to go faster! * Charge your boost by making stunts now and then.* Press the left front lower button to rotate the snowmobile in the air! That’s what I enjoy the most, since this game let’s you fly high in the air in every race. I give it a high score of 9/10 – it’s that good!  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm from Sweden so I know how big snowmobiling is! The developers Zordix are from far up North in Umeå, and their enthusiasm really shows up in the game.  I discovered this new game after coming back to play 2016 year's surprise hit Aqua Moto Racing Utopia and I'm equally impressed with this one. Looking at some old films on Youtube from earlier popular snowmobile games, my conclusion is that this must be the best game in the snowmobile genre so far. Congratulations on such a great achievement! The physics in this game is really advanced and the snow is well simulated. I love the controls and how the snowmobile slides sideways into each turn on the Snocross tracks. It feels like the level of fun has been turned up one more notch compared to the jetski game. There's more speed and more freedom taking different routes. I guess that's what the subtitle ""Freedom"" means. I noticed many interesting metal music scores which I never get bored listening to. The engine sounds are well done and makes you feel like you're totally there. Especially when switching to first person view. The single player is perfectly tuned with AI that gets harder to beat for every new race. I got some of my friends to play the game with me online. For each race we're collecting points and climbing in the World rankings list. It's quite fun and different to level up in a racing game compared to an RPG. To me it feels like a totally fresh and fun approach in a racing game. I'm now a huge fan of the Moto Racing series and I hope there will be more great games like this coming soon.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												We’re at a mountain top. Wind blows up snow in the air and the the two-cylinder smoke lies as a curtain behind the drivers. All equally tense. Everyone looking in the same direction with the same goal. Hearts pounding, nervousness and an enormous adrenaline onslaught. The drivers tightening their grips on the handlebars with their thumb on the gas. That’s how it’s like on the starting line, now let me tell you about the gameplay. Ready-Set-Go! Off we go and all the tension is wiped away. I’m off to a perfect start by timing it and my controller starts to shake as I push the nitro button for extra speed. My snowmobile shakes from the speed boost as I switch to first person view for better immersion. I’m totally there, taking a crazy route noone’s ever taken, far away from the other racers. I barely miss two trees and bounce slightly on a wicked bush. I manage to release the gas, and I slide sideways past two competitors, to line up perfectly in front of the next gate. Slowly up the hill now, trying to make a stunt with the right stick while driving to reload some nitro, slowly towards the goal on the top… curses … I’m passed, not once but twice, and I’m third in the race. If you’re like me, that’s not OK, you’ll want to stay for a long time in this world of snow and speed - to be the best!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
