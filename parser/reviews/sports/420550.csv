Early Access Review
Kicking off with style. Super Arcade Football is, yep you guessed it, an arcade football game that has recently launched through Steam’s Early Access program. SAF’s style of football is fast-paced, foul-filled and frantic, making it incredibly exciting for those playing single-player or with friends with the game’s local-multiplayer. With Quick Matches, Preset Tournaments (The World Cup and The Euros) as well as Custom Tournaments, there’s already a fair bit of bang for your buck with more to come as the game continues through development.Please note: While I will mention what the devs plan to add several times in this review, my overall opinion, and therefore this review, is based entirely on what is currently in the game.The game’s graphics are simple but suit it well, it’s a bright and colourful game which goes well with the overall feel of the game as a casual arcade game. The UI simply consists of the score and time played of the match in the top left, it doesn’t take up too much screen space so no complaints from me. The menu is also easy to navigate and a basic settings menu is now in place. The settings menu has two audio options and also lets you choose between a landscape or portrait camera. While there’s still a lot of settings which need to be added this is a good start considering it launched with no settings menu at all.SAF currently features four different modes for playing a match, they are as follows:Standard mode. A normal eleven-a-side match with a portrait, grass pitch.Winter wonderland. Eleven-a-side and a portrait pitch but the pitch is made of ice so your players slide around all over the place. It’s good fun but you probably won’t play too much of this.Indoor Madness. A five-a-side match, this time with a landscape, indoor pitch. Having five players makes the game even more fast-paced than usual and it’s the best way to play the game in my opinion.Custom Game. This mode has all the options that are currently available in the game and you can choose whichever ones you want.The three different game modes all have a default time for a half (which is three minutes) but there are a few other options: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes and No Time Limit (this last one would be for if you wanted to set a score limit). There are other match options now as well, you can choose what pitch surface you want, you can set a score limit, choose between 11-a-side and five-a-side and add modifiers to the game. The game currently has somewhere in the region of forty national teams with plans to bring more national teams as well as European 1st-3rd Division Clubs sometime in the near future. You’ll also be able to edit teams as well as create and share your own, presumably that’ll come with the team management update.As for the game’s content, there is as I said earlier a fair bit to do, the reason I’ve only played two hours is because of a [seemingly] rare bug. The Tournaments are a lot of fun and the Quick Matches are perfect for killing a few minutes here and there. The general rule for sports games is that there’s a correlation between how much replay value there is and how much you enjoy the game’s sport, the same can be said for this game. SAF’s main appeal in its current state is for picking up to kill some time and while that will probably provide you a fair bit of game time over a long period of time. While the Tournaments are also enjoyable I can’t imagine wanting to play them more than a few times, though you could make them more interesting for yourself by trying to beat them with some of the lesser skilled teams in the game. Speaking of lesser skilled teams, as you’d expect there are different skill levels of teams (a rating out of five in the game). As far as I can tell, the only thing affected by your team’s skill level is their speed though there may be other things, I’m not sure. Having a lower speed than the team your facing definitely doesn’t make the match impossible but there is a noticeable difference in difficulty. On to the game’s controls, I haven’t tried M&KB but SAF is great with an Xbox One Controller. The controls are tight and responsive, as you’d want from a fast-paced game, and thankfully the default controls are good seeing as you can’t change them. You move your player with the left thumbstick, switch players with the left bumper, pass/kick with A (the longer you hold A down the harder the kick) and you also have a slow-mo kick with the B button. Holding down the B button lets you control the ball after you’ve kicked it, you’re not going to have it flying around in circles but you can curve it in to the goal which is awesome! It may sound like it makes the game too easy but you can only stay in slow-mo for a certain amount of time (though it’s usually more than enough to go from foot to goal) and goalkeepers move at roughly the same speed as the ball so you still need to be careful with your shots else it’ll just end up in the keeper’s hands.Circling back to fouls, there’s a hell of a lot of them. This is undoubtedly where the game is weakest and I’m hoping that an option to disable fouls comes about as has been suggested by others in the forum. There are two main problems with fouls. First off, the only kind of tackle is a slide tackle. No big deal at face value but if the slide tackler makes contact with the slide tackleee (is that even a real word?) then a bone snap sound is heard and the player is incapacitated for a few seconds. You can have most of your team wiped out, leaving you defenceless, especially in the Indoor Madness mode, which is rather frustrating. The second problem is a weird one, there are too few foul calls as well as too many. If you’re going to include foul calls from the ref then every foul should be called, though like I said no fouls would be preferable. The thing is with SAF, not all of the fouls are called. This can be incredibly frustrating, especially in situations where your opponents get away with several fouls and you end up getting red carded. Plus, stopping play for a free kick or penalty completely kills the generally fast-paced nature of the game which is one of the best things about it. UPDATE: While fouls do still remain a problem in normal, unchanged game modes, one of the modifiers that has been added is a No Fouls modifier which works well for the 5-a-side games but I’d still like to see something done to fouls so they can be kept on in 11-a-side where they fit in a little more.Lastly, as I said earlier I’ve only played two and a half hours (at the time of writing this review) due to a bug. The bug makes the game freeze during loading which means you have to force quit and restart to play a new match and it happens every two or three matches. It’s particularly frustrating for Tournaments since you then lose your progress. However, this seems to be a very rare issue as there seems to just be one other person who has complained about it in the forums. UPDATE: It looks like this bug has now been fixed which is awesome! Figured I’d leave this section in since it demonstrates that the devs care about the game due to the issue being fixed reasonably quickly.Verdict Super Arcade Football is already a cracking fast-paced, arcade football game, though there’s still a lot that needs to be added. Even in its current state, its well worth the price of admission!Lone Ranger Reviews.El K.			",670,170,24,76,100,6,76

 NOTE: Due to Steam's review word count limit, I'm taking the suggestions out of this review. The full reviews including the suggestions will be available on my discussion page:  Pros + Cons + Suggestions (Continuously Edited) Thanks!I'm going to continually edit this review as I play more of Super Arcade Football. EDIT 1: -  PRO: The game is super fun. It's fast, fluid, the controls feel amazing. The fast pace you feel when playing really makes it an addicting game. I love it so far.-  CON: When playing as defense, it feels a little hard to know which player the game is going to pick for you to play as. It switches up a lot and therefore kind of messes up the running. For me, this is the biggest issue. The game keeps changing the defensive player, making it very hard to play defense. It changes! And it's sad :(-  PRO: The graphics are really cool. The teams are well designed and everything just works.-  CON: While it may seem like it only has controller support, I was working with my keyboard. I just had to play around until I found the controls. (WASD or arrow keys to move, SPACE or Z to kick/slide tackle, and X to slow-mo shot)-  PRO: The slow-mo shots are  really cool, dude. Like, it's pretty awesome.-  PRO: I love how if you get rekt in any of the stages of the tournament, it finishes it off for you. You just don't quit the tournament. Nice touch :) EDIT 2: UPDATE #1 - What was updated:Added a button (LB) for switching player Revised the Auto Switch Added better keyboard support (showing the controls on the controller screen) Improved the(Local)multiplayer experience Fixed some bugs-  PRO: Oddly I just noticed you can bend the ball mid-air in slow-mo mode. Awesome!-  PRO: The button for switching players was much needed. I'm thankful for that :3. It works well, but it's gonna take some time to get used to. I assume it's easier to play on the controller, so I won't make this a con. Job well done!-  PRO: Even better than what I was expecting for the keyboard control layout, it's perfect! I like how the game allows you to choose when you'd like to start the game, great control over that.-  CON: I noticed that when fouls are given against my team, the player that just committed the foul stands there, and you can't move him to a position before the ball is played again from the opposing team. EDIT 3: Note: I copied the game to my school computer, in which steam is blocked, but I can still play during school. I'm playing a lot more now, even though my hours on steam say otherwise. btw :3 - SUGGESTION: Like Broforce, I think there should be a way for users to play 2 players locally, using the same computer, on the same keyboard. One player could use WASD and JKL and one player could use arrow keys and ZXC. I haven't actually tested this out so I'm not sure if it works, but I'm assuming it doesn't at the moment. This could be really fun for players without controllers (like at my school, if i want to play with a friend on the same game against each other, using the same keyboard). It could open up a whole new area to gamers playing locally on a computer! EDIT 4: UPDATE #2 - What was updated:Skip Replay (If you scored the goal or if it's an AI Goal) Fixed kick off bug Tweaked Player Physics Fixed wrong corners / Throw ins Auto resize resolutions Much better difference between teams/players Icey Mode improved AI Teams now try and defend / tackle! Removed dead times (when waiting for players to get the ball) General Bug Fixes - PRO: I do really enjoy the dead times being fixed, it would take a long time for the players to fetch a really long ball, so this works perfectly. Plus, it keeps the game super fast paced! - PRO: Although I didn't even think we needed it, it's an awesome addition to see opposing AI teams try to tackle!  - PRO: The new skip button works fantastically! Thank you so much for that - CON: Major bug for me: The AI team passes it to the same person at kick-off (different person per half, either left or right). This is extremely easy to take advantage of. I just immediately slide tackle the player whom I KNOW will have the ball because there's no differentiation between which AI player the ball goes to.I'm giving a really honest and lengthy review because I really like this game so far. I just really like the direction, and it feels old-school and fast-paced. I love it. Keep up the good work guys! Hope this review helped :)			",77,12,1,1,12,0,3

Early Access Review
								I've been into football games since Match Day and Football Manager on the BBC Micro. I've played a few since then: Kick Off, Player Manager, Sensible Soccer, Kick Off 2 and Goal! Although I never really got in to FIFA or Pro Evo. I was after a more old school footie kickabout game I could enjoy with my friends. So from the end my Amiga days until now there is a massive gap in my football games. I have never really found anything as good as Kick Off or Sensi. Then I heard about Super Arcade Football on Steam Greenlight.I liked this game when it was initially released on early access but it is the features the devs keep adding that make me like it  more and more. I love the way the devs respond. They have a great sense of humour and fun. There were a few complaints the game was too fast so they added a ""slower gameplay"" mod but they also cheekily added a ""faster gameplay"" mod! The ""sleepy keeper"" mod is also great fun and allows for some hilarious score lines. After winning 30-14 in a 10 minute indoor match I couldn’t wait for the next game. But under the humour is a (semi) serious football game that is only going to improve with each update. The game is in an early access version and is currently very casual and while it is great fun, with the updates promised like career mode, the depth and longevity of the gameplay is expected to go the next level.I would have rated the initial release 6/10 but it keeps getting better and version 0.04 I would give 8/10 and because it is so much fun it made me want to give the devs a positive review so here it is. With all the updates they are promising this score will no doubt increase. I was really excited about the recent retro developments with Kick Off Revival and Sociable Soccer in the pipeline but to be honest, I'm not really bothered about them any longer. I'm having so much fun with SAF, and with the potential of the promised updates, that maybe (just maybe) Kick Off and Sensible Soccer can remain in the past and SAF can fulfil all of my modern retro football gaming needs. I'm loving it so far.If you like football games, get this one. It is great fun and is only going to get better.			",141,35,8,5,11,0,24

								Thoroughly recommend this game. It's got exactly the right speed and responsiveness for a football game that will appeal to gamers new and old. Whilst this is only an Early Access build, the developers have promised to really expand the experience to include career mode (like SWOS), loads more teams and tournaments, online multiplayer, transfer systems, editable databases, team creation tools, custom tournaments, more gameplay modes and crazy mods. It's gonna be a massive game, and I can't wait to see how it develops.As a huge bonus, the developers are super responsive and really open to suggestions. They want this game to be as popular and successful as possible, so if you find something that you think should be in the game get in touch with them and there's every chance they'll add it.

								This is one of the best, funnest, football/soccer game I have played in a long time.  I highly recommend this game to those that enjoy football/soccer games or just want a casual sports game to play in your spare time.  The mechanics are fairly solid and straight foward.  As of now you have shoot, pass, and swap players.  What I like most is the games are fast-paced, so you can get multiple games in a very short gaming session, perfect for players that like to play in bursts.There isn't much in terms of teams, cups, field types, and gaming settings.  But the devs are active and do a excellent job updating the game with features, they also listen to player feedback and suggestions and add them to the game.I don't really have any gripes about this game, I like everything this game has shown me currently and I'm always excited to see what the updates will bring to the table.For the hours to price ratio, you will definitely get your money's worth and much more.  There is always that feel of ""just one more..."".Hope this review was helpful.			",373,23,2,23,1,3,8

								I played every of the EA releases of this game and it really improves with every release.And they do new releases on a regular basis.As the name says its a very arcade oriented game not a realistic simulation like FIFA.I lke this kind of gamplay as it reminds me of football games i played in the 90s on the Amiga.At the moment it seems a little bit easy because i win every game without a problem, but mainly it's because i play with Germany (my home country), which is one of the best national football teams of the world.Defense is a little bit tricky becaues it's hard to do a fair tacle and the referee shows a lot yellow and red cards.But it's not a big problem even to win with 2 or 3 players less. It's football, you just have to shoot one goal more than you opponent ;)The only thing that bothered me is taht Online Play is still not working (or there are no other players). I tried it several times and never found anyone to play with.			",3197,1250,131,314,441,36,485

								I haven't been a fan of sport related games for many years and I think thats becuase they've all become a bit ""samey"" and you know what to expect.  The last sports games I remember playing where I've enjoyed the gameplay must have been back in the 90's, where I'm sure that anyone over the age of 30 will remember games such as Kick Off and Sensible World Of Soccer?Well, This game brings back good memories of this type of game with fast gameplay, loud roars from fans in the background, the ability to score from the same positions (well placed diagonal runs into the box), crunching tackles and so on.It's in early access stage so theres bugs but not show stopper bugs, and reading the communications from the devs these are being fixed in a timely manner so I've nothing to complain about.It's a quality game with bags of further potential, well worth the money and you'll have a hoot with your friends playing this (albeit, it's only local though).It's a good 8/10 for me.  Hours of indie gaming fun :)W3IRD SCI3NC3			",14,0,0,0,3,0,0

								If you loved Kick-Off back in the golden days of computer gaming, you'll love this.Bare in mind it's still in development, but O M F G, it's epic fun. Given it needs a bit of work, things like diving headers and more control on how passes and crosses equate to goals, rather than luck. Scoring at the moment is more like scoring in pong where you get the goalie out of place to stick the ball in the back of the net, or recreating that glorious Roberto Carlos banana bend goal :P Fun Fun Fun! Can't wait for more solid gameplay and features! but this is of to a Great start! :D			",180,29,23,25,22,2,23

								TL;DR - Good, not great yet but shows promise  buy if youre boredAfter playing this game for a good amount of time and i have good grasp of its features, the AI and the general gameplay I can reccomend this game, it is still in early stages but it does have potential to be good, some things i suggest for the future: • A Top Goal Scorers for the Tournaments  (World Cup, Euros, Custom) • To fix the AI as when you walk in small circles with the ball it makes the ai impossible to dispossess you and it is very easy to manipulate matches and outcomes. • Substitutes you can add in• Try and give ratings to individual Players• Make your own formations or use default set out ones.• Give more edges to higher club teams other than just buffing the pace on the playersIts in early stages, it can be a lot better, but for what it is right now, its a fun little game you can play to waste time if you dont have anything better to do.

								This is Diego Simeone´s favourite game.Playing a World Cup with my girlfriend. We made it into the finals. Colombia vs Brasil.Brasil is strong and they take the lead quick, and before the end of the 1T they score again. We are 2 down and she says, we won´t beat Brasil, they are buffed. But then after 2 nice balls we score once and in 88 we score again. We go for golden goal. Brasil gets a corner and they almost score, we are breathless the match is intense, and suddenly we get a penalty. We shot, the camera goes slow motion and its GOAL!!! WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS!!!

								Super Arcade Football is  fun. That i can honestly say. But it's fun, only in these circumstances : - you have someone to play with- both of you love arcade games (especially Sensible Soccer)Early Access has it's charms, but this game is pretty bare bones right now. Gameplay is lacking things like airplay, proper crossing mechanics, team management and tactics. It will be added, so the developer says. So what's in the game ? Plenty of teams to choose from, basic tounaments, leagues. Also - mods. Great in-door mod, nice ""on ice"" mod (makes everything slippery). Some absurd ones, like metoer shower - making the game a bit unpredictible. More will be added - and i'm looking forward to it. Playing against AI becomes dull very quickly... but make your friend/girlfriend/pet grab a controller and Super Arcade Football shines. It's fast paced, frantic and veeery enjoyable arcade game. More people playing - more fun. Single player - not so much.  ",369,59,13,36,35,4,57

								Now I'm not a fan of Football games like FIFA, if my friend wants to play it then sure I'd hope in and break a few bones to score a goal, but Super Arcade Football is my jam! It's fun, fast, smooth and I'm having the time of my life doing slide-tackles and breaking other player's bones, hearing their pain as they scream in agony!

			It's really fun breaking legs and hearing players' pain =D . More info at: http://www.futurebetagamer.com/super-arcade-football-beta-access/ End video song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVafDa...		

It's a very enjoyable arcade football game and from the looks of it it'll keep getting more fun. The only gripe I have with the game right now is that it automatically selects players for you on the field as you're playing, and you can't manually select one of your players as far as I know, making it kind of hard to have consistant enjoyment.But aside from that, the game rocks! =D			",589,105,8,19,53,5,36

								After seeing some early screenshots and videos I was eagerly awaiting the release of this game, but on first play I wasn't impressed.  However, coming back to the game a couple of days later I was hooked.  Sure, there are a few things that need attention, and the cons outweigh the pros at the moment, but the heart of the game is in the right place and with improvement this is surely going to be a great game...Pros- Stunning design - everything looks beautiful, cool kits and hairstyles, brilliant pitch textures (particularly the 5-a-side courts).  Would be nice to have an option to choose your kit in a tournament though as clashes are going to happen (you can choose in an single game)- 5-a-side option - probably the best I have seen in a game- Brilliant sounds & chants- Fast and furious- Fun to play- Slo-mo shooting camera - works quite well and is a nice touch... but would be good to be able to turn it offCons- Little too fast at times- Difficult to pick a pass, might as well dribble through the whole team- Goalies fly across the goal to make unbelievable saves- No deflections - if your shot hits an opponent they walk off with the ball stuck to them- Replays - Waaaaaay too long and can't be stopped, if a game has a lot of goals it can double the game time- Gimmicks - Ice pitch?  Never gonna use that.  Hope that decent features aren't delayed for gimmicky elements- Referees - very inconsistent, and don't even look at the player they are booking half the time.  But then again, most games have this problem, and have you seen John Moss, Lee Mason or Anthony Taylor trying to officiate a match?- Tackling - it's all or nothing.  Sliding tackles are too violent and slide too far.  Should have the ability to make conservative tackles- Team database - no way to get to the files so I can't have a look at them to edit.  Would also love to be to have more than two kits to help avoid kit clashes- Team management - can't reposition players leaving gaping holes when someone is sent off.  And in 5-a-side it seems as though the only tactic is full on assault of the goal, leaving you stranded if you lose the ball- Crashes - I've had quite a few on both my old PC and new Mac.  You can live with it in an early release, but there is no save option so losing your league is frustrating- Ghost goals - Both myself and the AI have scored goals which definitely hit the back of the net but haven't counted, and I've also managed to score through a goalie and through the side netting on occasions- Orientation - would like to be able to choose vertical or horizontal layout for all modesAs it stands, this is a great game for the price, and I'll use it to have a laugh with my mates in five-a-side mode so we can marvel at the bone crunching tackles, bad refereeing, goals that don't count.  I'm very much looking forward to new domestic teams being added, and finding out how custom teams can be created and loaded.  But I think this needs a lot of work if the management side is to be added... it doesn't sit right that my best option in a full match is to pass the ball out to my right back who will them weave round the whole of my opponents team before trying to beat the keeper.  If you are going to build a team, you want to be able to use all the players and for me the passing and tackling elements needs a drastic overhaul... either that or allow us to slow the game down so you can try to pick a pass or make a tackle.

								This game is pretty casual and very fun, but can also become a hardcore game if you want it too. Overall I recommened this game to anyone that has that ""sports itch"" at the moment and is looking for something to play. I also recommend to anyone that likes sports games in general too.From a singleplayer point of view:I do enjoy playing the games from time to time. I am one of those that got the ""sports itch"", I looked around and saw this game. The graphics are very welcoming and fun which pushed me to badly want to try it. When I started playing, I was amazed at how fun the game actually was, the overall mechanics are simple, but there is an underlying depth to it which makes it hard to master.Anyone can pick up this game and play it right away with no problem. The fun factor was instant, I just wanted to play more and more.Overall I would recommend purchasing this game, especially if you play with friends, I can see lots of enjoyment coming out of it. If not then definitely keep an eye out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The closest experience you can get from milestone 'SWOS' or 'Dino Dini's Goal!' soccer games on modern times!Even if just in its first forms, this game already packs a lot of action and fun using the practical controls of classic soccer games (two buttons and aftertouch). So far you can choose between the best national teams in the world (and although the description up there says 43 teams I counted 54; I might've made a mistake :p ), hopefully that can be increased even with clubs from as much different leagues as possible. :3 Not only you can take the action to the pitch, the hilarious and fun ""Winter Wonderland"" mode makes you feel like in those ""party games"" where physics are against you, in this case trying to keep your players still, avoiding to make them slide an extra mile when running after the ball. XD There's also that good old feature neglected by modern soccer games: an indoor soccer mode, that kind surrounded by walls (no out-of-bounds) that even allows you to play the ball behind the goal like in lacrosse or ice hockey rules!There are very few bugs and glitches at the moment that in all truth doesn't really compromise the gameplay, and considering the game is only going to improve from here, it's totally worth a buy for those who won't content themselves just with Pro Evolution Soccer and EA FIFA games. ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								*Key was provided by the developer for review purposes*Super Arcade Football is a fantastic game even at it's current stage, the gameplay is smooth, fun and easy to get the hang of, of course the game isn't all there yet but there is still a lot to do.--Gameplay--The game itself runs well without any Frame rate issues, the gameplay is fast paced but easy to get the hang of. There isn't much to say except it's football but very fast paced, the game has a slow motion shot which allows you to curve the ball around the keeper and works very well. The keepers are for the most part very good and react fast enough to stop most shots but not fast enough to stop well placed shots which is good though as of this review they are a bit buggy and can get confused from a shot at an angle but the Developer has said they are working on it though it's not a massive issue. The only major complaint is the Auto switching but the Dev has also said they are working on something better and will be releasing it soon so that won't be a problem soon!You can choose from 'Quick Match' 'World Cup' 'Euros' and Custom 'League' and 'Knockout' meaning you can choose how many teams are in it and what teams are human controlled, you can for Custom autofill the teams and just see who wins without playing which is a nice feature. There is NO saving currently, meaning if you're 15 games into a league but need to stop you will lose all progress, an annoyance at the moment but of course that will change so be wary of that!Tackling is a bit odd but fun, it's pretty much random whether it will be a foul or not same with a booking or red card. There are also Penalties.--Visuals--I didn't see any graphics options though you shouldn't have a problem running the game, the game has a nice touch with the sliding tackles by adding in dirt lines where you slide which looks really nice especially when you get near the end of the game.--Bugs--Pretty much just the Goalkeeper bug I mentioned above, that's it, the game is very well put together and the developer obviously cares a lot about their game which is great to see!--Conclusion--So far this game has made a great impression with its initial start on Steam EA and I can't wait to see how this game develops especially with Career Mode! I give the game a 9/10 for being fun, fluid and nicely polished which is great to see for an EA game, if you like Football games or Sensible Soccer styled games then pick this up!--YouTube--Video Gameplay once it's finished uploading!

								For an early access release this seems really good. The fundamentals are all sound, which is more than I expected. It's already fun. Tackling could do with some work, it seems to be broken leg or nothing at the moment. I didn't spend much time on it yet though, so maybe I just need to learn it. As I say, the basics are good and I enjoyed playing it even at this early stage.			",23,19,1,2,3,0,4

								I like this game very much. It perfectly captures the feel of old school football games like Sensible Soccer. In this state game is very fun and playable, but I would like to recommend some new features and point to some things that could be improved.1. Option menu. Game desperately needs functional option menu where you can set some basic things like screen resolution, game speed, rebind keys, etc.2. Player stats. It would be nice that every player have some basic stats on their own, and feel diferent from other players in the team.3. Manager mode. I would like to see manager mode, where you can set tactic, transfer players, promote players from youth team, train players and compete in various competitions.4. Detailed competition stats. It would be much more fun, when you could see player and team stats in competition. Like leading goalscorers, assists, ratings, etc.5. Game feel. Gameplay in this game is very fast, but in majority of cases when you make a tackle, camera, and players on the pitch stop moving, and it feels like the game is freezed, but it isn't.6. Specializations. Some better players can have individual trait, like speedrunner (for super fast players), force master (for players that have more control on after-touch) etc.7.There are few good national teams that are still missing (Serbia for example).

								Really impressed with the game even at this early stage. Super fast slick arcade retro feel to it, kind of like a sensi/ko2 hybrid on acid ! Played a few tournaments including a custom league where I drew all four of my games which shows how well balanced it is all ready. The stats between me and the computer teams were very evenly matched in each game. Tackling seems a bit hit and miss, sometimes you get away with terrible tackles other times you get sent off. Also the cpu has missed every penalty against me probably 10 in a row so far ! These are just minor issues that I'm sure will get sorted. A nice option would be to turn off the ref so you can play as dirty as you like. The indoor 5 a side pitch is a nice touch where it bounces off the walls. Overall definetely worth the asking price even at this stage of development in fact if it continues to improve could be the bargain of the season. Oh and howcome Rooney is in the England starting line up ? get with the program stick Vardy upfront with Kane !  "" Jamie Vardy's havin' a party bring your vodka and your charlie ,  we're Leicester City we're top of the league "" ",102,1,23,0,6,1,1

								Cracking game, really good fun and thats with the early access.  Cannot wait for the game to be updated, looking forward to an editor system, creating your own teams? that would be good.I think maybe the tackling is a bit extreme and i think that the normal shooting button doesnt need to make it go slow mo but i am sure things will be sorted.A really really good career mode excites me, maybe even room for career modes online?Love the game and really happy to have it :)			",4,1,0,2,6,0,0

								This game deserves a chance and I recommend it to old-school gamers like myself who grew up with Sensible Soccer and Kick-Off series. To be frank, I was not good with Kick-Off but on Sensible Soccer the joy I got taking Turquay United from England Division 3 and making them the champion of Champions League was ten times more than the new FIFA and PES games. So, I may be sentimental and giving tribute to the nostalgia.The game is nice and resembles its precedes. It's very fast, nice graphics and atmosphere to make it an arcade game as in the name.But the game is still real early access. There are no options, no multi-player. Somehow the kits similar color is making it hard to differentiate teams in matches. Also, the game play with keyboard is quite hard especially when you press three buttons at once, i.e. diagonal shoots. I hope in time, the developers will be reading the reviews and also ask for the gamers to return their feedback. Then act accordingly.I'd recommend giving it the chance and supporting this game. It'd be great to play it online with friends and strangers when the game is complete. The alternative would be being stuck with FIFA milking us every year with squad updates.			",25,7,0,7,3,0,5

								I can't recommend this game in its current state:1. The gameplay is only enjoyable if you have a controller. It really sucks playing with a keyboard. However, I had much fun playing FIFA 16 just by using keyboard and mouse.2. The game is TOO fast-paced. So fast that you can't really strategize at all. This is just a game about eye-hand coordination and muscle reflexes. If you want some strategic elements in a football game, stick with the FIFA or the PES series.3. Currently, the game seriously lacks important features like team management, career mode, custom tournament, and online multiplayer. Quick match is the only source of fun you can have for now.If you're really interested in this game, wait until the developer adds more gameplay options and features. Of course, don't forget to buy a controller. Playing this game with a keyboard is a pain in the ar$e.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
