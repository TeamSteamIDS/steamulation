												Not very exciting. You cannot pedal the bike, nor can you steer the bike. You essentially follow a fixed path, then hit one of seven keys in the air to do tricks.			",11,0,2,0,0,0,0

												This is a very fun game! I had my doubts when downloaded it but was very happy! About the features of the game that I liked:- a really big variety of tricks- 9 beautiful levels, I liked Ocean Port!- customization of the bike and characterAnd of course the first person! It's gorgeous! I felt like I was riding my bike and doing dangerous stunts! The game is really worth the money.The game I really liked, I advise everyone!			",23,3,3,4,3,0,0
