Early Access Review
								A lot of potential, and as football fan with a big soft spot for nostalgia, I love the concept.  However, whilst there is a lot to like about the game, there are also a number of issues at the moment, and as such it is hard to recommend until these have been addressed.  Of course, this is still in early access, and I have high hopes I will be able to write a more positive review at a later date :)  But for now, this is how I see it:Pros:* All those seasons, so much choice :)* Nice representation of player skills* Simple and quick to pick up* Nostalgia for the older CM games, but with new ideas as wellCons:* Interface can be very slow when switching screens* Not much feedback in terms of what is going well/wrong in a game* Not so many tactical options - probably a design choice, keeping it a quicker simpler game.  But would still be nice to change set piece takers, have more control over passing options, etc.* Game has crashed for me, more than once* Some interface glitches - for example, I once had a return button stuck on screen, blocking other buttons, and leaving me stuck with no option but to kill the process* Lots of teams for lots of years - but player positions and stats are not always as I remember them* Transfer / scouting options limited at this timeAll in all it has potential to be a good, quick to play football manager game, and one perfect for fans who like to drift their minds back to the ""good old days"" (whenever they may be).  But still a bit of work to be done, particularly in terms of performance and stability.  But again, early days, so I hope it will live up to it's potential!			",23,4,7,3,15,1,9

								Full disclosure, I've been playing RFB since the very, very early beta stages as part of a community (COYP!), but I was anxiously waiting for the release to hit Steam so I could throw money at it.Why?Put simply, because it's the opportunity to rewrite history. Correct the terrible things that went wrong in the past. That cup final that was simply your destiny? You get a chance to win that match all over again. That player that became your first real idol (who was pretty rubbish in retrospect, but who cares) - you get to lead him to glory. That striker that your club sold, who if you were in charge would have been chained up in the training ground, well, sorry buddy, you don't get your dream move I'm afraid.The amount of work and detail that's gone into this game is incredible - it should be said that this is an early iteration, the first steps if you will, but if this is the start, I genuinely cannot wait until the bugs are ironed out and the final product is polished. In terms of gameplay, it's simple. It's not FM16, with a myriad of different things you need to tweak or adjust. It's pure, pick up and play management. Go for the players you want, get them on the pitch, hope for the best, in the truest, classic CM93/94 style. No frills, no fancy animations, just history being corrected (if you're any good!).It's very single player - as yet, you can only manage one club in game (so, no selling players to 'friendly' clubs for inflated fees - boo, hiss), the transfer system as regards foreign players needs (in my opinion), a bit of a revamp, and there are a few glitches here and there. I will say that, having seen the game develop from an idea into reality, I trust 1888 to get all of these things sorted in a smart time scale.Genuinely, I've spent hours playing this during development and again since purchasing on Steam. For the price of a pub lunch, if you have any interest at all in football (proper football, jumpers for goalposts that is, not prawn sandwiches and £100m transfers), you need to have this game in your library.

								Play it !! Love it !!Some time ago, The FA had his 125 year anniversary!! During that, Football Manager honoured that with a retro 19th century screenshots of a supposed Football Manager 1888. At that time, those screenshots receive a major feedback. Everybody asked if it was possible to go back in time. Nothing happened until now!So, seeing the work made by this guys, the only thing i must say to them is:  thank you very much!!The amount of data, players, and history of this game is so immense that for a guy (like me) that like old retro-vintage english football history is perfect! You will have the chance of change that real life story of your favorite clubs; the ability to play and see old 2-2-7 tactics; the tactical and rules changes; going back to players £1 wages in the 1888; an incredible amount of options (choose any club from 1888 to almost nowadays); see old stanley matthews in action and try to get him out from Stoke; the return of the league after the WW I-II; be the Huddersfild manager and try to maintain the Champions status back in the 1923' and following years; Billy Bremner arriving at Leeds in 1959; be able to beat best Liverpool's 70's to 90's league dominance; see Shearer's career from the start; and so, so, so, so much more.......Only crazy people LOL  could have done this amazing and spectacular job. I do understand that the game still have some errors, bugs, and improvements need to be done, but there's why is a early access game. But the potencial is there!! If you like to return back and re-write all (or any decade) of the English Football League history, without be annoyed and desapointed by the lack of FM graphical/interface beauty or any other comparation, this is right choice.So, for me, this game was well spent money, and they deserved all the best!!!

								I have to say i have enjoyed this game so much. Being a big fan of the championship manager to football manager series i like how much control i have over the ream so was skeptical about this. But the fact i can play as my hometown Wolves from the beginning of the game and just have so much fun  with them was amazing. I am grateful the developer is on top of the game and providing regular updates to this as it really does deserve it. A must buy for me for gamers who like football management games as its easy to pick up and easy to play that doesnt require so much attention you cant also get on with other things.9/10 would definately reccomend to friends.

								I cannot recommend this just yet...But it could be the best footy management sim ever...Keeping it simple is the key. None of those  ridiculous press interviews or player tantrums, just pure swift management.But being Early Access it is at present, incredibly flaky & crashes constantly. I am sure this will be addressed shortly & i shall return with haste to edit this review & recommend it wholeheartedly.Really looking forward to this one.....The concept is superb...The execution isn't there yet....Waiting.....Hoping.....

								Great start to a game full of potential. This is the distant cousin of two great text sims, the original Championship Manager and OOTP Baseball. Using a historical database to recreate seasons from 1888 to 1998 this game creates endless challenges. Want to know what it is like to have a team with Best, Law and Charlton? Or extend Liverpool's 70's, 80's heydey into the 90's? It's all here. Yes there are bugbears, (User interface, scouting) which over time will improve but stick with it. I remember CM and OOTP started slowly and they are giants now. Immerse yourself, when I took over Leeds Utd in 1980, I could almost smell the beer on my players breaths as they trotted out of the tunnel, I could smell the linament on the creaky knees of Revie's old boys, Paul  Madeley and Trevor Cherry and enjoyed the skills of Brian Flynn and Arthur Graham. Good start, lots of detail and scope to change and improve!			",1,0,0,0,2,0,0

								Played this game for a little while.  Love the premise, love the idea but it's still unfinished.  I really wanted to get into it, but I will definitely be watching from the sidelines and seeing as it improves.			",5,4,1,0,11,0,2

								Certainly no positive recommendation for this game, given that fact that the price is set at 11 EUR or something. Extremly long loading cycles, font barely readable, hardly no options in terms of match display, training, management and in-game coaching. All changes seem to have no effect on the match. Furthermore, I have come across several serious bugs during the matches. For instance, a player that has been sent off could be substituted for another one off the bench. Hi-la-ri-ous. The only thing that makes this game at least a little bit charming is the (apparently, did not check) comprehensive database of historic clubs and players. In general, however, there are plenty of flash game soccer managers on the internet that do a way better job than this one.			",0,1,0,0,1,0,0

								This is difficult, I can't reccommend this game at the moment. But would certainly recommend following this game and see how things go as it has so much potential and will probably end up being a really great football management game in time. I've managed to play at most around of a quarter of an hour of the game in a single session before it has crashed, and this has happened every time I have tried to play it no matter how often I have uninstalled and re-installed, tried checking the files for erros and contacted the dev's on the forums and they have responded but the problems still persist which is annoying especially as this is one of the first time I have experienced a problem like this with a game.There are however many positives about the game, it is currently in Early Access so the performance will be improved and new features will be added, and the dev's are always on the forums answering questions and they do their best to squash bugs and improve the game, and you want this game to be successful for them as they put so much work (and research) into it and it has so much potential just need to fix a couple of things.
