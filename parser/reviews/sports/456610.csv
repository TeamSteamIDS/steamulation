												I was excited about this game before the release but I have to say I am disappointed.I did not expect too much from the graphics side, but what I got was just horrific. Colours, lightin etc. are just awful and embarrassing.But I know PES is not about graphics and I have to say that gameplaywise we got a few upgrades. Goalkeepers are actually doing their job during the game, passing feels even better.After the first 45 minutes I closed the game and opened PES 2016. Here, I have to add that I have several patches, transfer updates, pitch update installed on PES 2016. The game just felt much better. Even the graphics looked nicer. Colors were brighter and the quality just better. Even the gameplay felt almost the same.So If you are asking me: Does it worth buying it?My answer is a definite NO. Just use PES 2016 with transfer updates and you are safe to go.PES was never for online playing and you can have fun offline with 2016.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
