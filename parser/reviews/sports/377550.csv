												Tastes like chicken!Really fun coach game, perfect to play with some friends. You have to give it a little of time to get the handle of the controls, but it really pays off as there's nothing like slamming a friend's face into the ground with a baseball bat.Thumbs up!

												When you look at Unfair Jousting Fair you see a game that clearly has no problems be wacky. You are after all competing in a jousting competition riding unicycles while brandishing random weapons which include rakes and floor lamps. This total randomness is the best part of the game. It's hard not to chuckle at some of the situations that transpire in the game. The controls are kind of hard to get a handle on. I think this was somewhat done on purpose. While you will get better at the controls with practice, you will likely never master them. In order to move forward you kind of have to rock back and forth which will sometimes lead to you falling down before you even reach your opponent. This is sometimes funny but can also be frustrating as well.The combat is pretty simple as you are pretty much just trying to hit the other player. The longer weapons seem to have an advantage since you can reach the other player before they can even touch you. I would like to point out that Unfair Jousting Fair is solely a local multiplayer game. You need a second player and at this time there is no online mode so you need to find another person to play the local multiplayer with.The biggest issue with the game is the longevity. After about fifteen to twenty minutes Unfair Jousting Fair get a little boring. At least for me it is the type of game that I would come back to every so often but I know some players could be sick of the game after that amount of time.If the game's concept interests you, you have someone else to play the game with and you don't quickly tire of games I think you will enjoy Unfair Jousting Fair. If not Unfair Jousting Fair may not be for you.Note: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer. Read My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com] ",998,413,28,106,105,15,184

												I played this game at Madrid Games Week and it's hilarious! I mean, you can joust on snails and as the devs explained to me, that's even historically accurate (in a twisted kind of way)! The fact that rounds are kept short gives it that lovely ""just one more time""-quality. The music supports the mood nicely and there's lots of little unlockables that add variety. The controls reminded me of qwop, you get that same sense of amusement at your own clumsiness, yet they evidently can be mastered; it must be cool to see two experienced players have a go.Would love to see this game come to other platforms as it is perfect to add variety to my and my friends' local multiplayer rotation.

Not worth five bucks. Unfair Jousting Fair is too simple, with not enough game options to merit the purchase. I will explain:Pros:+Artwork is original+Using chickens as projectiles is hilarious and an awesome mechanicCons:-The hardest part about this game is not knocking your opponent down - it is keeping your own balance enough to get across the arena - this is probably the worst part, and practice did not seem to help - we were just as bad after 20 minutes as we were on the first go-Music is super short and super repetitive-Only 1 game mode-Different characters are functionally the exact same, and overall are boring looking (all look like hipster coffee shop dwellers)-There are so few options in-game; you can change the number of rounds, but that is about it - I don't even think there is an option to choose a specific weapon (but it wouldn't change my mind overall, anyway)-It is boring after about literally 10 minutesUnfortunately, there just isn't really any game here.

												A great blast with a friend!Despite the game suffering from issues with the controller working with the menu, I had a blast with it. A lot of fun with the tough controls trying to maintain balance. Would definitely recommend it considering the low price point.

			Genna plays Unfair Jousting Fair. A multiplayer game where you ride unicycles and hit each other in the face with long objects.		

The controls are very simple. You move left or right to balance yourself on your unicycle. You move up and down to adjust your weapon. That's it!The aim of the game is to hit your opponent with the end of your weapon, and avoid having the same happen to you. It's pretty fun due to a few of the randomizers that go on. As you play more, you unlock weapons. Every round, you have a random chance to get any of the weapons you've unlocked, which makes for some interesting battles as you might find yourself with a short rolling pin, yet your opponent will have a long rake.You can also hit chickens at your enemy, or have to climb up a ramp. Stuff like that keeps the game interesting. There are also a few features which make for some funny and intense moments. If your two weapons clash, they will bounce back, and if your heads touch, your characters will kiss and bounce back.Keep in mind at the moment it's strictly local multiplayer. No online, and no singleplayer. There isn't too much to keep you playing the game for long after maybe half an hour. Although it's a fun little game that you could pick up for a few rounds every now and again when your friend is over!			",1645,509,63,143,162,24,171
