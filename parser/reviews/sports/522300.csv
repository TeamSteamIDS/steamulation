								Disclaimer: played over 3 hrs offlineI think that is very promising, considering that is the first release of a one man dev team.Very nice low poly art assetsThe engine is Unity and keyboard controls are ok.Run fine (50 fps) even on an old Nvidia gt120m.Actually 7 levels and one map only but I hope that the Dev will deliver what he promised in store page.Suggestions to Dev:- Change turrets art to some thing more ""anti air"" style.- Add ability to paint plane: main color, secondary color, logo.- Add ability to choose pilot (male, female, several accessoires: glasses, hats...)- Endless survival mode with turrets and enemy AI planes.

								This is a lovely lo-fi homage to Pilotwings 64, which is to say: it's an accessible, arcade-y flight sim where you do short (2-5 minute) missions: fly through rings, shoot at targets, land on runways. The amount of content right now is rather limited, but I'm eager to see where this goes.			",556,158,4,66,39,6,60

								This game is absolutely amazing, I'd love to get my own input on this game too as I feel it would make Polywings more enjoyable to certain fans.1. Multiplayer Dog Fights. (Steam, not Port Forwarding.)The physics and weapons are perfect for Dog Fights (Two or more planes go up, but only one will stay up.)I've never seen a good game where Dog Fights have been perfected, except the old Star Fox 64 Multiplayer mode, this game is right up there with the classics!2. Terrain and Plane degrading/destruction.Another thing from SF64, if you strike your wing, it will become damaged, eventually breaking off and resulting it extreme tilting, or in a regular plane, it would cause you to spiral out of control, and your only option is to try and find something to heal your broken wing, adding a powerup system would be perfect for that.You can also break your propeller, forcing you to glide and land as best you can, since you can't slow down normally, you need to use your knowledge of wind resistance to slow down.3. Dog Fight exclusive: Lock-On missiles.Weak homing missiles designed to home in on your enemy in the sky, easy to dodge, unless you're not very good at combat games.4. Workshop.Allow players to build their own planes, customize their character and create stories and maps to go with them, giving Polywings an infinite replayability rating, because as of now once you're done, it's done. (Until the new updates, but still it's not endless.)5. Land and get out of the plane.Adding houses, pit stops, garages for the planes and other interactable environments would work great if you could get OUT of your plane, and hop into another one, or grab gasoline, or find hidden unlockables inside of places too small for your plane to enter.6. (Ties with #5) Parachute.If you're in trouble, or just want to have fun, or test your freefalling skills, hop out of your plane mid-flight and open your parachute! You must be high enough though or else you won't have enough drag on your parachute for it to open and save you, or you'll hit the ground hard...7. Cyclops boulder physics.As of now, when the little guy tosses his boulders they go straight, maybe adding an arch to it would make it seem more realistic, and add a challenge to it since players can't go down to dodge it, only left, right or up.8. (Ties with #6) Freefalling battles.Once you're out of the plane and falling to uncertain doom, you'll also have a pistol to assist you, if you and your enemy both are forced to abandon your planes, you can parachute down while shooting at them, trying to poke holes in their chute, or killing them in mid-air.9. Don't abandon your game like other devs, you'll miss out on great opportunities and only kill your game, which I for one would hate to see happen.Keep up the great work and I hope one or more of my ideas has been taken to heart, and hopefully I'll see it in the game one day!
