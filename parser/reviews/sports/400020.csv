												Wow, I am simple amazed. ATARI has finally nailed it, the compilation is great, controls are very customizable for each title (mouse, keyboard or gamepad), including gamepad sensitivity. I'm using a Razer Sabertooth and had no issues with controls on various games. Ease to access a multitude of titles, including a fast access / recent played games list.Some pluses as original boxes, manuals and other reliquia add value to the package.Totally worth it!
