												This is a card solitaire game in which matching cards allows your offense or defense to do their job in the game.  Match enough and you'll have the forward motion you need for a first down on offense.  On defense, you'll stop the opposing player's advance.Having to draw a card carries the possibility of a ""Big Play"", a short text event that can end the play or change it significantly.  And it might not end in your favor!  Your draws are unlimited on offense, with a high possibility of a Big Play, but on defense you have a limited number, with a lower possibility of the play ending suddenly.  This makes for an interesting dynamic, with poor play leading to even good defenses collapsing.  The mechanic forces you to allow your opponent some gains, and hopefully you can hold them to less than they need for a first down without drawing.Another mechanic has you attempting to guess your opponent's play call (run or pass, it's not complicated) before each play.  Each team has stats for running, passing, special teams and the like, so you can predict somewhat how they will play.  If you guess correctly, you get an extra card slot for the play, which is a big advantage.Teams are tracked through a season and rated relative to each other.  Don't pick a weak team hoping to play it up, at least not to start with.  That's a sure path to disappointment.  There are three difficulty levels, which affect the basic yard totals for plays based on your play guessing, and this is a solitaire game, so no multiplayer.The football mechanics are notional - you need forty yards to complete a first down.  Why?  Because this helps shorten the game so that a hand of solitaire is not an hour long.  :-)  There are still halves and quarters, and punts and field goal attempts.This is a fun game of football and cards, enjoyable whether you understand football or not.  Buy it!  You'll like it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gridiron Solitaire does a great job of emulating the rhythms of the game -- the push and pull, the big plays that are alternately exhilarating and heartbreaking.  It also plays very well on a touchscreen.			",118,42,1,40,27,2,45

												An incredibly fun solitaire game with a cool sports slant.  The ""Big Play"" button is a huge gamble that draws me in every time and there's definite tension as the random text events are ""revealed"".  I'm impressed by how the game captures the back-and-forth feel of football.  I just had a terrific come-from-behind victory early in my league career that I felt like I really earned.That's right.  Earning it. Tension. Back-and-forth.... in a solitaire game. Not a bad accomplishment.			",292,90,2,47,50,7,84

												I thought I'd share a summary of my full review here. [www.oneguytoomanygames.com]I didn't really have any expectations going into Gridiron Solitaire. I knew a little about it, but none of the details. For such an abstract representation of football, it does a great job at capturing the flavor. This is one of the more enjoyable games I've played for a game with such simple mechanics. While I thought the matching mechanics were too simplistic, managing the Big Plays was great fun. I was getting excited both when things did and didn't work out for me. Bill Harris included so many little touches that just tickled my shoulder pads - not the hideous 1980s women's shoulder pads, but the cool football ones.Mr. Harris does have plans to continue to improve the game, but I don't have any details about what may be included in the updates.If you sometimes like to relax with a more casual game and don't mind games with a good chunk of luck, consider purchasing Gridiron Football.

												First impressions: http://www.cublikefoot.com/gridiron-solitaire-first-impressions/Gridiron Solitaire. How do I even begin to describe such a game? It took me quite some time to grasp just the bare basics of the game. The game is a bit difficult to explain, so please bear with me.The game essentially combines solitaire and football. Yes, that sounds a bit strange, but it surprisingly works, no idea how the devs managed to pull that off, but props to them for doing so. Basically, you have to match cards (against the opposing team) in order to get the offense/defense to do their thing.There's also a ""Big Play"" mechanic, in which you're able to draw a card during your turn, placing another card onto the field. This mechanic can tremendously change the outcome of  a play, in either your own favor, or the opposing side's favor. When playing offense, you can use as many Big Plays as you wish, but you only have a limited number when using them as the defense.The game has three difficulties to choose from. I went with the normal difficulty, which may have been a bad idea for a complete noob to the game. The game also goes deep into team customization and rankings. The teams are tracked per season and compared against each other for that specific season.For someone who does not care for football, I thought I had figured out the game just fine during my play session. I'd recommend it only to those willing to learn how to play it, as it's quite difficult to understand going into it.			",1413,555,55,149,194,17,226

												I've played this game for almost 40 hours now and it can best be summed up in two sentences: ""It is what it is. No more, no less."" It's literally a game where you match up cards, hope that the RNG (Random Number Generator) is good and try and out score your opponent. Most of the time it does seem that the RNG is definitely NOT on your side, especially when you're on defense or it's late in the game and you're trying to mount a comeback or stave off one. If you're looking for a good time waster and/or a game that you can play without thinking to hard, this is for you. However, anyone looking for a true tactical and/or a true American football like experience you'll be mightily disappointed.			",33,7,0,20,8,1,13

												I've been waiting to play this game for a LONG time and have followed the development since it was announced.  The lead designer turned me onto Fairway Solitaire long ago, and that became a favorite of mine.  I'm about three hours into Gridiron Solitaire now and I'm not disappointed.  I think the most interesting thing to me is the uncanny way that this card game feels like football.  Something about the rhythm of it feels right.  I would not have believed that I could feel a sense of tension while playing solitaire, but when I used my last defensive Big Play of the game and saw the computer drive to the end zone in disturbingly short order, I started to panic that my 14 point lead might not be enough.  It was a squeaker, for sure!I recommend this game - a great little indie title that knows exactly what it wants to be.			",82,11,0,24,11,1,15

												A blast to play! Combines solitaire and football into one exciting package. The developer has really supported this game with continual updates.  My favorite solitaire game of all time - and indeed one of the best card games overall.You see me listed for 15 hours, but I've played probably twice that including offline.The difficult (on default setting of 'Rookie') is perfect for me - I almost always make the playoffs, but often don't win the superbowl.My most recent playoff run included a 21-20 victory, followed by a 27-26 victory -so those games couldn't have been more close, balanced and exciting.Really a fun game for short time periods - such as a lunch break - or as a nice relaxing game at the end of the day.Very highly recommended - I've gotten way more than my money's worth out of it.

												Not sure what tweaks have been done to the game since the other reviewers played it, but this is a definite thumbs down. Supposedly, you make good yards when the computer guesses wrong, and very little, if any, if it guesses right on offense. On defense it is supposed to be the same. But it doesn't work that way. When on defense, and you guess wrong, the computer opponent STARTS OUT with a 25 yard gain, and it takes solitaire matches to reduce it. But there are very few matches. Even when you guess right against the computer opponent, it STILL starts off with a 12 yard gain that you have to whittle down, again with very few matches available.Now when YOU are on offense and the computer guesses wrong against you, for a pass, you start at zero yards, and MUST get THREE matches in a row before you gain a paltry 8 yards. Subsequent matches add yardage, but again they are few and far between. When you run the football, and the computer guesses wrong, once again you start at zero yards, and add 4 yards for subsequent matches. Now if the computer guesses right, it is that much harder to gain any yards.And the computer sneaks a peak at what you choose as well, I purposely ran nothing but pass plays for three possessions, gaining some yards, and figured now I'd start off witha run. Of course the computer 'guessed' right on run, when there is absokutely no possible way it could have, based on previous play calls.If this game sounds interesting to you, wait until it is at least 75% off, and be prepared for a mountain of frustration. Even at 75% off you may very well regret your purchase.NOTE: A new update to the game was applied on July 4. It added kickoff and punt returns, plus penalties. Penalties reduced your chances even more of getting matches, and running plays now only gain 3 yards per match, instead of 4. Also, when you guess right on defense, the computer opponent starts off with a 15 yard gain now, rather than the original 12.I also noticed special teams plays result in TDs (for the computer opponent, of course) more often, plus more turnovers (again, for the computer opponent) when the player uses a Big Play, regardless of weather.Bottom line: Made an already extremely frustrating game even more so. I now wouldn't even recommend buying it even at 75% off. Save your money and the frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There aren't a lot of American Football games on Steam, probably because EA has a lock on the NFL with its Madden series. Whatever the case, when a football game like Gridiron Solitaire appears here, it's a rare sight to behold. What's even more unusual is that the gameplay in this title is via a card game.If you've ever played Fairway Solitaire (or any of the million similar games out there), you know how this version of Solitaire works. Suit doesn't matter (in fact, I don't think it even exists in GS), but color does matter. You need to alternate between black and red cards, as well as choosing a number above or below the face-up card on the deck itself. What happens if nothing works? Well, it depends if you're on defense or offense. When you're defense, you can hit the ""Big Play"" button to bring up a new card (or in rare cases, an event), but you have limited use of this. A finite number of uses, denoted by green dots, are supplied each half, not quarter. So use them sparingly. On offense, the ""Big Play"" button appears again, but this time it's infinite in its uses. While that sounds good, in practice you'll get an event that somehow harms you roughly 99.9% of the time. In most cases, this involves your runner being blocked or knocked down, or your quarterback being sacked. Sometimes, however, you can also fumble or be intercepted, both of which are terrible, especially if near your own end zone. You don't get to choose actual running or passing plays. Instead, you pick which you'll attempt (run vs pass), and if the AI guesses your action, you'll lose a card, plus it'll reduce and limit any gains in yardage you might acquire in that round. That doesn't mean it's impossible to get anywhere — I have made a running a play that eventually turned into a touchdown, even though the AI figured out my play ahead of time — just that it's generally more difficult. When you're on defense, you do the same to the AI. In this case, you'll simply limit and reduce their gains, since the AI doesn't use cards. All the teams are fictional, but you can edit their cities, names, and colors. This means if you want real teams, the only thing stopping you is a little effort on your part to rename and recolor them. That said, I don't believe you can rename players, but it doesn't really seem to matter anyway. Every team has stats (ex: run offense, pass offense, run defense, pass defense, and special teams) that dictate your chances in a game. These stats can and do change, and will be affected by draft choices. In my own experience, whatever stats your team or the opposing team has produces a minimal effect. What mostly matters is chance and whatever strategy you employ.You can have five seasons saved before you need to delete one to open a slot. Saving the game only occurs before and after a game, as well as during half-time. Given that GS is turn-based, this shouldn't be too much of a problem for most people, but if you find yourself needing to shut down your computer or close Steam, you might lose your progress up to that point. To tell you the truth, I don't know for sure because that's never happened to me yet. Would I recommend Gridiron Solitaire? I'd say ""cautiously yes."" It's very irritating how much chance (especially when using the ""Big Play"" button on offense) affects the outcome of any play or game, but in real life, sports have always had a ""luck"" factor to them that's difficult to emulate in a computer game. Regardless, I wish that using the ""Big Play"" button would actually result in a positive outcome every once in a while. Whenever I use it now, I cringe and turn away, not surprised in the least when there's a negative result. Having said all of that, it's a very entertaining Solitaire title and introduces several game mechanics not seen in other similar games. I don't know if this will truly satisfy anyone who's been longing for an American Football game on the PC or who's a die-hard Pro/College fan, but for most gamers who either have a passing interest in American Football, Solitaire (or both), I feel that Gridiron Solitaire works nicely.

												Coming into this game, I thought that it would be hard for a football game that abstracted out the football part out into a card-based gameplay loop. I still think that, but Gridiron Solitaire works completely. This, along with games like Civ V and OOTP, give me that ""just one more turn"" mentality, running a play, to a quarter, to a half, to a game, to 10 games, to finishing a season. Incredibly addicting, and surprisingly fun. Definitely a must try.			",20,16,0,2,12,1,11

												The gameplay of Gridiron Solitaire consists of linking cards that are opposite color and one number apart.  At its core, it's a basic solitaire game.  However, the strategy elements and the uniqueness of each game/puzzle brings a surprising level of depth.  The Big Play feature adds a surprising level of excitement and strategy.I was disappointed with the off-season portion of the game.  The game punishes you for doing well the previous season.  That part of the game just misses the mark for me.I'd been looking for a game I could mindlessly veg out on to appease my need for stimulant while I'm doing tedious tasks such as taxes, paperwork, or when I want to play a game that I don't have to get invested in to enjoy.

												After playing through a few seasons, I'm deleting this game. The idea is great but how this game plays out really sucks. I win about 1 out of 7 games. Home field advantage is OVERDONE somehow. I don't think I have EVER won an away game. Passing is useless, depsite your rating. And early in the game it seems like you'll enounter playable cards. Later in the game, playable cards are really rare. Overall, winning feels like pure luck. Yes, be careful of how you choose your cards to match up on each play (IF you have anything to match) but that's it. Pick a good or crappy team, change the settings to make it easier. Doesn't matter. This game feels more about luck than anything else. Terribly inconsistent gameplay. Winning 1 of 7 games isn't fun. Time to delete and move on.			",16,1,16,0,2,2,2

												It's OK for a solitaire game, but I expected something a little more, I guess.Given that it's solitaire, it would be much easier to quickly spot the matches if the cards were a bit more traditional -- something more along the lines of a football-themed Bicycle deck, if that makes any sense (especially given how spread out the cards are in the ""formations"").If you go through the in-game help, you'll see stuff mentioning relative team strengths, etc, with the note ""THIS IS IMPORTANT!""  Yet, the only time that information is available is in the pre-game ""broadcast"" -- once it's underway, you'd better remember what it was, 'cause there isn't any way to see that stuff (at least that I can see).  If it's that important, why isn't it in the main game UI anywhere?Overall, it's not a bad game, there just isn't enough game there for the ten bucks IMHO, especially given the low-budget look and feel. If it comes up on a Steam sale for $5 or less, it's worth a shot if ""football solitaire"" sounds appealing to you.  As it is, I gotta lean towards thumbs-down, given that my options are ""yes"" or ""no"".			",378,101,7,82,63,6,100

												Very fun. Easy game mechanic to learn, similar to solitaire but with some strategy involved. Games typically take 20 minutes to play.			",19,7,1,4,6,2,9

												This game is great! It's just what I was looking for. I wanted a sports game with a card mechanic. I tried the Big Win games but they didn't do it for me. Like everyone has been saying, This game feels like real football. I just had an epic match today. I was a team I made up called  New York Raiders. the score was 35 to 37 (or 38) they won by a field goal. It was a brutal match. I had a few sacks and they had a few key turn overs. I hope the Dev's  do more of these and add the other sports like Basketball, Soccer, Baseball, Boxing ect. Also I wonder if you can do a multiplayer version.			",117,30,1,35,34,3,53

												Well another update that kills a game, now My team fumbles about 50% of the punt returns, also when my team fumbles on offence I never recover , its always a turnover, yet if the computer team fumbles, it recovers the ball. Not saying the game is total ruin now , but sure isnt as fair as it used to be.. oh well , time to find a better football game.  dont waste your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can see how some people could enjoy this game.  However, its important to potential buyers to know a couple of things.  First, its almost completely luck driven.  The AI seems to pick defensive and offensive plays at random, so there's little to no strategy involved in play-calling.  Then, of course, there's a the luck of the cards themselves.  Secondly, there are a couple of very strange design choices.  Offensive passes need 3 matches to be complete.  But when the opponent passes, its automatically complete.  Its just a question of how many yards are picked up.  And the ""unlimited"" Big Plays on offense are ridiculously limited.  Most often, you don't even get a card.  Why it wasn';t handled like it is on defense is beyond me.I desperately wanted a truly good football strategy sim.  This isn't it.			",0,19,0,13,10,1,8

												It's akin to Fairway Solitaire. The football mechanics are more relevant though than the golf is to Fairway Solitaire as you've got real decisions about run vs. pass given yard and down. The big play mechanics throw a bit of resource management into it.It's absolutely not a football simulation though. It's a solitaire game with an extra layer on it. It's also something you can sit down and play for 15-20 minutes and complete a game, so it's a great option when you've got a short time to fill.			",26,23,3,29,7,2,18

												Gridiron Football is card solitare that attempts to simulate a football game.  After watching a short cute video about the game, you can choose some options then begin.  At the main screen, you will see all of the teams available along with their strengths and weaknesses.  After choosing (and even renaming) your team you begin the game / season.You are presented with a choice of choosing a running or passing play.  Both options are there regardless if you are on offense or defense.  If you hear ""Break"" you outsmarted them and the less yardage you have to get / block....if you hear a tackle sound, they guessed correctly and you need to get / block more yardage.  Then you see red & black football player cards of differing numbers (they range from 1 - 13).  Your objective is to take a red (or black) card & pair it with the nearest number of the opposing color.  IOW a Red 3 can take a Black 2 or Black 4...Black 9 can take a Red 8 or Red 10...and so on.  The more matches in a row you can make, the further down the field you go or the more yardage you block your opponent.There is more to the game, including an offseason mini game to improve stats,  a Big Play button which gives you either another card to help you or an event which can either help or hurt, weather affecting play, home field advantage, playoffs...etc.  LikesTension of making tough decisions on plays (do I end the play & let him get the 15 yards or risk a Big Play and hope for a card / action to help stop him.Big Play button giving you at least one extra chance to stop or increase the yardageWishes:- The 4 NFL league (NFC N & S and AFC N & S (their GFC equivilents of course)) Right now there are only 2 divsions- When you are able to get a penalty on them / receive one, I'd like to see text of what the penalty was...adds more realism.I will edit this review with other Likes, Wishes, Cons as I play more & especially as I finish my first season and experience the offseason mode.Gridiron Solitaire is a fun solitaire game that really does do a fine job of simulating an American football game.  The developer is continuing to work on the game and is responsive to suggestions from the community.  I look forward to see how the game develops.  On the graphical surface, $9.99 may seem like a lot for a solitaire game...but considering it is much more than a matching card game in that it has random elements, strategy by you & the AI, events that can alter the outcome of plays...I'd say the price is very fair.

												I can definitely see where this game is going, and it will have its market when it gets there.  However, in its current state, it does not justify its current price point.  I had no technical problems and the game ran fine on my system, but it feels a bit unfinished in terms of gameplay.  It is neither Solitaire nor Football enough to make it feel like anything more than a random dice roll on each play.  I'm not a game designer, so I wouldn't presume to tell the developer what this game needs; but I would like to see additional options for strategy and perhaps a multiplayer option down the road.

												Biggest piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥I've ever played, usually I love solitaire style games. This is one is ♥♥♥♥ing dreadful though, I've tried it multiple times and never managed to stick with it. The game is entirely based on luck, you may as well just click a button and get an RNG to tell you whether you won or lost. I really want to like this game, it's the only American Football game I own and I want to enjoy it! God damn it. This game sucks so hard.			",409,82,5,65,53,8,46
