Do not, I repeat, DO NOT support these developers!They call themselves ""Vae Victis Games"", and if you'll read (even on WIKIPEDIA[en.wikipedia.org]) about origin of this latin sentence, then you will fully understand why they've picked this name for their company. It fully reflects what they're doing, both literally and figuratively.Second game made by the same people ""Racecraft"" can be found HERE.Yes, they jumped from one game to another before they finished even half of their first ""work of art"".""Victory: The Age of Racing"" abused ""Early Access"" idea for a long time and from all directions.To be honest - this title already died long time ago. It was a regular paid-game in the past and developers switched into ""Free to play"" model showing middle finger to people who already paid for it.It is just a weak shell of a game, a clean rip-off from early-alpha. I think I know how we can call this with a clear conscience -  early-alpha demo of early-alpha game. This title is dated already in every point - graphics, sounds, mechanics. There's a lot of interesting racing games available on Steam, so simply do not waste your time on this abandonware garbage.What about Racecraft?I gave it a chance and played a bit, and it's even worse than this! and I am 110% sure it will stay in this form for whole eternity.

								I bought this game some time ago. Then they announced they're done making this game and continue with RaceCraft (we got that for free instead of Victory: TAOR). Now today I get an email that it's become free-to-play and that you can buy a DLC called: Steam Founder Deluxe Pack.I ♥♥♥♥ING bought this game and I don't even get the Steam Founder Deluxe Pack for free? I get nothing back for buying this game in Early Acces, only another game that I never wanted. This is really bad and awful of you guys.... shame on youTL;DR: Paid 15 euro on steam store where it was never mentioned it would go free to play. 2 years later it goes f2p and they dont even give me 6 euro DLC???

tl;dr This game is fun, but overwhelming and dead. Developers have abandoned this game and left to work on the next one.Victory: The Age of Racing is a racing simulator akin to stuff like Formula 1, but with arcade gameplay controls in the vehicles. I'm much more of an arcade racer (hence my repeated Black Flags when I play anything in here), so Victory does cater to my tastes as well as the average sim fan. The cars are very well modeled, and the tracks are pleasing enough.However, the UI is incredibly overwhelming to me, and it's not intuitive for me to get around at all. I'm sure I haven't even discovered half of the menus because of how much there is to take in. Additionally, the multiplayer is dead and you'd be lucky to find anyone who plays this.Most importantly, as other reviews have pointed out, the developers - Vae Victis Games - have fully abandoned Victory. The game has not been updated in two years, since April 2014. They're working a new game called Racecraft, and they have given free copies of Racecraft to everyone who purchased Victory before they made it free-to-play. Essentially, there's no reason to get Victory as it's superseded by Racecraft (which will not be free).It's up to you if you want to give Victory a try, but it's dead.			",341,77,19,57,40,3,51

Early Access Review
								Before I begin, I just wanted to share a very important fact. This game was available for free through amazon. When I first found it on amazon, it was a free to play game. that's all well and good, but when I found it for $15 on steam, that got me kind of iffy on the whole thing. it basically told me that they're charging for something they were willing to give out for free. But, I can get past that.What this game does well is customization and gameplay. the controls are solid, the cars feel weighty and there's a fair bit of options available to customize your car right off the bat. all plusses in my book. So, The reason I don't recommend this is because there was no offline modes to be found. every single race was online. on top of that, there really aren't enough people playing to fill a race. personally, I had a hard time finding just one more person so I could actually race. That's because the race won't start if you're by yourself. the only time it does is if you're in hotlap mode. but the thing about that is this: you don't get credit for hotlaps. Nope. no rewards for that. none.All in all, Age of Racing is a story of high potential with all the resources already there. but the game was let down by always online gameplay that's even brought triple-A games to their knees. if they ever add offline, I'll recommend it. but as long as it stays online only, I can't bring myself to do it.

Early Access Review
								I'm going to go ahead and say this from the start, if the thumbs up didn't indicate it already. I highly recommend this game. Granted only for certain people, I understand not everyone likes racing games, especially ones that have some simulation aspects to it. This is more of a simcade, and as people have said about this before, it's easy to get into, hard to master.I do call it how I see it though, even though one of the devs asked for me to review, I have no issue with that, and no, I'm not getting any kind of reward for it nor do I care for one, I just want to see the game succeed and get more players. Starting on developers, they are awesome. I had one personally work with me to troubleshoot an issue I had with the game crashing, and come up with a fix for it, and provided me with a modified .dll file to get the game working until the patch was released the next morning. (this was LATE at night, almost morning when it happened)The game doesn't have many issues for me, but whatever issues it does have are being worked on by the devs atm. They listen to feedback and issues that the community encounters. Like the FPS problems some people are having. I was talking to a dev last night and they have acknowledged the issue and are working to fix it. In that process though they broke cockpit view online, once they quickly found out about that from players, they fixed it the same day. This is what more games need, devs that listen and actually work to change/fix things. I can forgive games that are broken if the devs ACTUALLY TRY. (I'm not saying this game is broken by the way, it is far from it) If you can't at least respect a developer for that, I've got nothing for you.The community of this game, so far, is all friendly. This can of course change, as people are people and the more people that play, the higher chance for bad people to show up, that's just life, don't fault a game for that. There's a MMO like chat ingame, you have a public chat for anyone to talk in, a race chat for a race you're in, and a friends list separate from Steam and a racers tab to show EVERYONE online. You can check out their rank, nationality, and private chat from there. Quite simple and functional.The driving mechanics ingame are quite nice in my opinion. It's definitely not a sim like Assetto Corsa, but it's not super arcadey like Need for Speed games. There's a good balance of fun and realism, combined with the options of automatic gear changing, semi auto, and manual, and various assists you can enable and disable on the fly. The cars all feel nice to drive too, they have good weight to them, you can feel the cars grip (or lack thereof), the cars respond to different surfaces, and changing car setup makes thing vary quite a bit. Running the default setup will work fine but you certainly get an advantage if you take the time to set up your car properly for a certain track, be it the under/oversteer of the car, the suspension stiffness to help cornering, the downforce levels, front/rear brake bias, and even gear ratios, and it does it in a fairly simplified but useful way. Their are descriptions for the settings on the side to help explain, and instead of some settings like camber levels and toe, and ARB settings and spoiler and wing angles, it's simple clicks left and right toward a different setting. I'm a huge fan of racing games in general, arcadey and sim. My main issue with sims is a lot are just plain better when using a racing wheel, which makes me happy to say this works EXTREMELY well with a gamepad. This itself makes it more accessible, which isn't always a bad thing.The amount of content ingame is something I can't comment on too well right now, as I haven't played for that long. The game is only about 500mb though, so keep that in mind. There's a decent amount of tracks from what I've seen, and they're all fun, for me at least. There are preset cars ingame to buy, quite a few for each career and team, and some on the market (using ingame money).But then we get to the car creator. You can choose between the 3 car types, and the different performance groups, then mix and match between different front, middle, and rear pieces of the car, and then change the paint and decals, and choose between a lot of different cosmetics like exhausts, brakes, rims, mudguards, steering wheels, etc. And depending on the car chosen, you get a different amount of PI to spend on your car. These are basically skill points in an MMO, you put points into things like braking, power, grip, etc. And in the same area you can select different engines and tires that will also change the PI settings of your car a bit. This adds a lot of personalization to the game and makes everyones car feel different. So in that aspect, there's a lot of content, and I'm sure there's more to be added.A thing I forgot to put in somewhere about the car types: They're all F1 cars. There are the older ones running V6's if I remember, the Classics. Then you have the Legendary cars, I think these are using V8's ingame, I forget. They are based off more modern looking F1 cars though. Then you have the Formula class, these are using V12's ingame, and are the most modern looking cars.When it comes to graphics, not too much to say. They aren't bad, certainly not the worst. If you really judge a game based on that, well, I don't know what to tell you. The gameplay is very good, the graphics work well and don't detract from the game. Fairly straightforward here. The only thing negative I have to say about that is with the graphics quality, there shouldn't be performance issues, but there are. BUT, like I said earlier, the developers are working on this right now. Like literally now.Regarding peoples butthurtness towards ""in app purchases"". Yes, there are some. You can pay real money to get ingame money from what I understand. But it's optional. There's literally nothing you can get from that, that you can't get ingame by just playing normally, and it DOES NOT make up for lack of skill.Any of these things are subject to change, as this game is still in Early Access and is being worked on still. This was put up on 2-14-2014. If anything changes that makes any of my points irrelevant or outdated, I'll try to remember and edit this.I'll say again, I highly recommend this game for just about every kind of racing fan, and definitely for people that like F1 cars.It's quite accessible too, so not being the best isn't a reason to pass this by.

Early Access Review
								A few things so far about Victory: The Age of Racing:(This is not an actual review)- The game menu looks quite satisfying and is clearly arranged.- This game is definitely pay to win. Proof? The developers are presenting the ""build your own car"" thing as one of the main features. At the beginning you have already one car of each class so you can start right of racing. so far so good. to build your own car, you need at last (probably with extra parts and stuff a few 100 more) 5200 Gears Credits (the only ingame currency). If you win one of these early multiplayer races (don't know if its getting noticeably more when you progress) you get ~100 GC. So, to build your own the cheapest car of any class, without spending real money, wou have to win like 50 races. Races i've driven were appr. 4 - 6 minutes. In comparison: You can buy one of these predefined cars for the half of the price, which might be even a bit faster. So i think that the real money thing ones again ruins a game by slowing it down horribly, which equals pay to win to me. - Gameplay is (after years of developement of this former-free-to-play game) like Mario Kart without Toads and bananas, but more buggy and erratic. But still quite fun to drive, a bit like trackmania. In conclusion this game is very arcadish, while it is published to have ""realistic car physics"".One of the game developers once said in an interview with insidesimracing on Youtube (2012), that at the beginning, when they startet the title as free-to-play, they thought about not making one of these ptw games. Now the game is still in developement, is ptp and even ptw, too. I kind of regret buying it.At the moment i have, to be honest, no MASSIVE complaint about the game how it is. It's okay, not more or less. But if you make the ""mistake"" to judge this game by what it pretends to be, it's absolutely not enough and seems like a bit of a hoax.At the end i have to put a careful ""YET"", as the developers have time to and possibilities to fix these points, hopefully.

								For those downvoting the review please keep in mind that I am reviewing the Early Access Game and as such and will update my review based on the current state of the game.Feb 19th 2014: The game is brilliant! A couple of issues such as VERY LOW fps on races, where time trials are a blistering 60+ fps, and some black flags on corners being cut on very tight lines, but I understand early access. I got quite a few hours in yesterday with nothing game breaking happening. Such a great combination of simulation and arcade with such a community driven competitive component. This brings me back to the fun times I had with Hot Pursuit 2 2002. With the developers actively engaging the community and updates coming in fast I am very excited to see where this game goes.Feb 17th 2014: Game won't start for me. Stays on the splash screen with only an exit button. I'm all about supporting Early Access games but only if they actually provide, access. Day 3 with no reply on this issue. I'm beginning to think a refund may be in order.			",596,134,30,64,46,4,66

								This is one of the best racing games I have played in a while. You may think it is a simulator but in fact it is not. It may look like an arcade racer but it doesn't exactly feel like one. Granted the 'cartoony' feel may not appeal to some but that just adds to the fun when you are racing. The online side of things is great as long as you can in fact find a lobby to play in. The hot lap challenge is probably the best option when first starting out as it gives you a good feel for the game without others crashing into you. There are not that many tracks to race on at the moment though as this is early access you have to expect change and improve over time. I would highly recommend this game to someone who is looking for a race yet sort of serious and highly competitive racing game. If the price seems a bit steep for an early access game then wait till it is a bit further in development, although it feels really polished at this current stage.			",944,268,79,89,125,17,147

								TL:DR Pay to win rubbish, glad i got this in a bundle and didn't pay full price like I was going to the previous week.Positives: The driving model is quite good, not too easy but with a but of practice, I'd imagine you could hone your skills to what it wants you to do.Negative: The UI is a bloody mess, if there's a single player game in there, I cannot find it.Starting my ""career"" at rock bottom in a legends car with 25 PI(performance index? So much of this game your left to guess what is going on) and my options appear to be hotlap or multiplayer.Hotlapping ceases to be fun after 3 laps so off to the multiplayer I go. A grand total of 30 people online does not bode well but I wait it out in the only lobby I can get into with my 1960's shopping trolley. A few minutes later and the green flag is out, 4 of us race off... rather 3 race off and I'm toddling away at the back. This is when I notice they all have cars waaaaay better than mine.So, no single player AI racing, no chance at getting a decent multiplayer race and worst of all, the much hated ""pay to win model"" where you can buy upgrades for your cars which last the duration of a race, or longer, to give you the advantage.Nope. Just nope, I paid £3 and I still feel had.The driving model is workable, just everything else is infuriating.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Ive seen alot of reviews stating that this game is ""dead"" because there is simply no one online to race against. While this is true MOST of the time, (just recently raced against 6 other racers in a major event) those leaning on this one flaw in the game are missing out on alot of what Victory has to offer. Victory: The Age of Racing is simply the best racing game I've played on Steam. Hands down. The blistering sense of speed is better than all but one of the many racing games I've experienced, F-Zero GX being the best in that category. The three classes of cars: Legend, Classic, and Formula, each have thier own handling characteristics and quirks, and each reqiring a different skillset to be brought to thier fullest racing potential. Combine that with probably some of the most fun and frustrating original tracks in a racing game (Mario Kart notwithstanding) and you have one hell of a racing experience. That, quite honestly, only gets better with the addition of rival racers. When they're on of course.Car customization is another thing Victory has down. The paint room is very Forza-esque in it's function, but one thing I like about it better than Forza is the fact your graphics don't get warped on curved sections of your car. The decals curve with your cars curves, which makes painting replicas pretty satisfying. Plus the fact you can MAKE YOUR CAR LOOK HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO. You want a crazy front wing that looks like it wont even work aerodynamically? Slap it on there! You want a two story tall rear wing on that Classic car? Go for it! Dont want wings at all? Who da heck needs downforce!? The styles of car are endless, and it's very interesting to see all the custom cars drivers make. From F1 replicas to ""How is that even working?""Also, well, going back to the point that there arent alot of people playing this game. The few who do, at least the ones that I know, are all really friendly. If you come in and see some one on, dont be afraid to ask questions. From what I know, the community in Victory recognize the lack in number of players and will help any newbie who needs help in anything. I will definitely answer any questions asked to me if im on. As you can see with my hours on record, I'm on quite a bit. So dont let the ""Mixed"" reviews on this game turn you off to it. Ive had so much fun with this game in the near 10 months I've owned it, even made a few really good friends. If you see video games as an investment and not as an opportunity to have some fun, I can't help you there. But if you're looking for a well made racing experience in a fantasy setting, look no further. Come on in, theres a car with your name on it waiting to be driven.No seriously, the cars have your name on them. It's pretty cool.-------------------------P.S. Forgot to mention. It's small, but probably one of the coolest features in this game is the fact that you are still in control of your car after you cross the finish line. Adds a level of immersion I haven't experienced in any racing game I've played before.			",103,14,23,4,16,2,11

								This game deserves a longer review as it offers so much fun for comparitiveley little outlay, but I.m gonna keep it short so that I can get back to playin'Buy into this now, if you want loads of fun building and racing cars in an arcade looking world with very sim like physics, not too sure then read on.......... Great bright, shiny racing game. Nice twist that gives you the ability to put together your own personal ride, just choose from one of three base classes of car types and then choose front/mid and rear end combos and customise with paints and decals.The driving model has a real pedigree ( based on the Kunos NetKar Pro engine ) and is very rewarding, you have to work with it a bit but then you get good feedback and with that control with the legend cars four wheel drifting and the classics snapping back from oversteer nicely.The tracks are coloutful! with fantasy swooping tracks offering various surfaces adding to the fun and there is promise of procedural tracks adding a huge number of layouts in the future.The racing is online already! with races and live hotlap parties, you earn level up race points, widgets to add boosts to and Gears to spend on improving your current ride.Now it is early access, so there are some minor issues and it is developing, but the Devs are very much active on the forums ( that was a major factor in my purchase ) and the community is small but very encouraging.As I said short review there is more in this game to discover and enjoy,			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Arcade sandboxy formula racing <3Points of interest:- Make your own car! Can get pretty deep with accessories and paint designs!- Little to no grind (300 base GC every time you beat your PB with a car in Hotlap Challenge. Records are on a per-car basis!)- Car setups make a difference! - Challenging tracks for formula cars!- Nice solid physics with great feeling!- Beautiful reactive UIs - I am in love with the interface designs!- Fun race modes with many race settings and well implemented networking!- Races generated in real-time by the server!- LAN mode!- Steering with a keyboard is really excellent!and in the future:- Procedurally generated tracks!- Race editor- Oculus Rift supportPoints of negativity:- 'Widgets', seriously? Artificial car boosting per race?! The game used to be f2p, so this is probably a remnant of that design. I don't use it, don't even bother, I don't even want to know about it.- There is fps lag in races with more than 4 players, you can workaround it (?) but to me it's gamebreaking. But I am fully confident they will fix this - one and only - issue as they continue to develop this otherwise beautiful and very personal racer. Besides, hotlapping is unaffected by this.Great game, dirt cheap - I will be playing for as long as there are other people!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game says SINGLE PLAYER and multiplayer.However, no matter how hard I tried there was no singleplayer content.I saw the Driving school, surely since this is my first time playing it wouldat least let me practive driving offline or give me a tutorial of some type?I click Driving school and get dropped immediatly to a screen where I select any add-ons I want to purchase.Set-up my controller, get my ""drivers license"" which basically choosing your car type and team.Then nothing. My car sites on an empty grid.Only choices I have are car set-ups settings, exit to spectator and exit session.Maybe I need to set my car up first.Nope.Nothing I would do would let me actually drive.The only thing I didn't bother checking was Hot laps becauseI don't like driving around a track with no other racers, that's what Rally racing is for.Then it dawned on me (after about 10 minutes of clicking every stupid button on the menu and every keyboard and controller command)...I HAVE to be on a multiplayer game and I HAVE to have other people in the server to even practice!What in the hell?Okay, ok, so it's not actually single player (Maybe they shouldn't list a lie like that on their product page)So I figure I'll join a server.Not a server to be found that actually had a single soul.I sat there for 15 minutes. I even tried making my own LAN server thinking then I could add AI.Nope.So unless you can find a populated server, you can't even drive, not one single time.So, who's bright idea was it to throw someone new to the game into a populated server with not a single second of practicing beforehand?Who's idiotic idea was it to make a driving game with NO AI drivers to race against?Like I said, never once did I see a single person on any servers.I know this is free 2 play now (cough, not really, all kinds of crap to ""buy"" with ""points""), but I can just imagine how mad people may have been if they purchased this before it was free-2-play only to find you have to have other human drivers in a game before you can race anything.A complete and utter waste of time.And by the way, if you are going to make a game like this, maybe you SHOULD EXPLAIN these requirements of NO AIat ANYTIME of either (preferably) before actually installing the game, or at least when the game starts, or hell, maybe when you get in a game session and you cant figure out why the camera just spins around the car and you can't actually drive.Dumping a new person into a game with these type of restrictions does one thing, it pisses them off, just like I am right now.Stay away from this piece of garbage.

Early Access Review
								Facts: I'm a game moderator (voluntary user); I can be biased, but I know this game really well; also, remember that this is Early Access, so still a beta phase.Talking about the game: first of all, despite the tags, this is NOT a simulator; it's more like an arcade racing game with realistic features (don't expect to drift on every corner or have random racing lines); still, the model is really satisfying: the racing experience and setup know-how is rewarded, while beginners won't have many problems driving their first cars. With the inclusions of new events, career mode and other stuff there's plenty to do, and car customization is one of the best ever seen in a racing game, both on visual stuff like paint and development. Good races are real fun, and the tracks are inspired and good to drive in. The devs also are very active, and try to fix bugs in a quickly way (also are active in the forums, which is nice).Bad things: excluding random bugs (which I'm not experiencing at the moment, save for some really minor stuff) the worst part is the performance of the game in this phase. We know that graphic optimization and new shaders are coming very soon, but at the moment on many computers a race with full roster will make the fps drop. There's also the minor issue of a little population, but hopefully this will change in the next weeks (it's still early - early access), and the races and events still flow very nicely, so it's not really a problem.What will come next: full Steam integration, procedural race tracks, track editor and Steam Workshop support. Probably some of the best features to have in a game like this.For old users: the payment model has changed. This is now a buy-to-play; so you will need to buy the game if you want to play (it's not going free to play after the beta) but THERE ARE NO MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS in the game. Also, the reward were raised quite a lot, so buying new cars is much faster.Conclusions: in my opinion, if you like racing games, you are curious or look for a relaxed fun game go for it. There's plenty to do, the game has some good depth, the class are really different one from each other and at this low price it's worth the entry, also because new features will flow in and make the game even better. Still, if you like only Simulators, beware that this game is not one; don't expect an Assetto Corsa or rFactor or iRacing here, because it's not (and it does not pretend to be one).

								I am a player who likes the race simulation and I follow Victory since the first beta. The game has an arcade side, but can be set for the simulation too. The game meets the novice players and sim lover players.I can disable the driving aids, adjust the setup as I like... and I like to make my cars more agile on short track, and faster on long tracks... I can adapt the car setup to every aspect of the race.The difference is there, both for hardcore and casual players. With this I can compete on equal terms, and play for victory. In the open beta period were introdouced many new features. Many things were created, and many have disappeared and this thing is very important for a development team: we’ve really influenced them and I feel part of this project now! I love this game!

												I had this on my machine for a while, and loaded it up mainly becuase i finally have a controller and this seemed an apt choice.After leaping into the first car and thundering down a track my first thought was ""Oooowh yeaaah baaaybe""Great sound, fantastic sense of speed even though graphics are dated, handling is wonderful and fully customisable per car, and we get old school stuff! Woohoo! As a biker I was happily thrilled with the experience.Multiplayer online was a bit shaky and jumpy (read laggy) for me, but I'm in South Africa and pretty much everything is laggy *sobs* but it was perfectly playable and could still finish 2nd on almost every race I did.There is one facet to the game that is not immediately obvious, and these are the boosts. They are purchasable using in game generated credits pre race and boost your vehicles stats either for that race or for 3 laps. Now this isnt a bad thing at the outset IF all users are aware of it 1. and  2. if you have the ingame coin.So far i have not been out of coin, but im not sure how that would work if I was constantly losing...So this might be a game breaker for some.All in all, its FTP, great fun, small download and the guys online are a wide range of skillsets so something for everybody I feal. Give it a go!			",200,37,4,18,19,1,25

								Addictive and entertaining racing. The cars look cool and the car customization tools are easy to use, you can make some nice cars. The driving physics model feels fun, I'm not a super good driver but I can do ok without any assists on and it just feels enjoyable. Force feedback on a G27 wheel feels better than in many expensive games by big studios. The developers listen to the players and the game has already gotten better in the few days I've played it when they changed the amount of gear credits you get from good lap times. I only wish it will get many more players in the future. I've tried to get my friends to play it but many seem to be put off by the arcadey look which I don't mind at all even if I prefer realistic simulation games, as the car's handling is just so fun in this. Some are also saying that it needs other types of cars than open wheel formula 1 cars.			",136,20,34,20,32,0,19

								I can't really recommend this game.  It is beautiful and the controls are nice, however there is nobody online.  Maybe once it's out of early access I can change my review, but even if there were people online to play with, the game has other issues.  Namely, no controller support in any of the menus.  It's very obviosuly designed for PC, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but in this case it is.  I'm trying to play on my TV while sitting back in my recliner and the menus are difficult to read and navigate.  The UI is overly complex for a racing game, in my opinion.

								The essence of ""Victory: The age of racing"" is FUN! Lots of FUN!First of all, the best feature of the game is the physics. I've never found such a nice physic in a non-simulator type of game. Everything feels very realistic and still, it's easy to play even with a standard keyboard. It's the best compromise between realism and arcade. Very easy to pick up, very hard to master.Second, the game is in early access and i can tell you already that so much stuff has been added since it's release (not on Steam) some years ago: Public events, Team Careers, Hotlap Challenge, Tons of Customizations... and soon also procedural tracks to expand the current 15 track to almost infinite variations.What else can i say, play it and you won't regret it.

								Nothing new, but perfectly acceptable driving game. Not overly realistic, but not very taxing either. An amusing diversion for a while but with one MASSIVE drawback - there's noone to race against.Pointless having an online racing game if you can't race against anyone.In about 2 hours spread over different times, I've managed to get into 2 hot lap races with other people. But seeing as though you just drive a lap and compare it other people's laps, and never see another car, it isn't racing.I might revisit this in a month or two in the hope that more people will be online but it will never be more than a mild diversion for 30 minutes or so, even with packed servers.

								When I first started playing this game, I felt like a retard.  Couildn't win, didn't understand what the hell was going on with all the different divisions, racing widgets, etc.  But when you start to level up and earn credits to buy new cars (creating your own or buying team cars) and learning each curve in the tracks, you start to gain confidence.  I just got my first team car win, and it is one hell of a feeling.  Buy this game - it is one of the best racing games I've ever played.  It is simulation\arcade mixture (leaning closer towards the area of simulation) and it is a hell of a fun time.  Very addicting.  Very impressive for an early access game (meaning it will only get better).			",441,116,28,53,35,6,54

								*I hate racing games in general.*   If there is one racing game to play, it's Victory: TAoR.   Drive like a pro with all the works, or turn on all the automatic options and cruise along with the ease of 2 joy sticks.  How cool is that?  If you can't drive, this is a good place to start.  If you've played racing games for years, there are tons of customization options in the garage, letting you fine tune to your personal driving style.  This game is actually thrilling.  IAP is sensible, mostly cosmetic, & each player starts with enough to build there 1st car.  Fully playable as Early Access, there seems to be a lot more on the road for Victory, still yet to come.

								Pros- Friendly community and players.- Good gameplay and a lot of fun competing with friends.- Customisable cars and decals.- You can beat expert players at this game if you practice and don't give up.- Has leaderboards, hotlap records, world records and race rankings so you can keep track of your progress against other players.- Has single player hotlap challenge where you can practice alone on any track to improve your driving and hotlap record time.Cons- Slow Updates- Underrated game- People underestimate this as a terrible game for its graphics and that it is ""not real F1 racing"" without trying it first.- Hardly anyone on the server except for regular players.- New players give up playing this game too easily without practice and patience. Nearly happened to me when I was new but I managed to pull through. It is a shame this game is underrated. But I would recommend this game for the friendly players and gameplay. Hopefully the new update will eventually come soon. (New graphic engine, Track Generator, etc.)			",14,1,4,0,1,1,1

								I havent played on line racing since 2002.I found Victory poking around with Google.I've been addicted ever since.I understand it's still in development stages,and I can deal with the issues.The game has improved dramatically since I downloaded it in January this year.I like the story line and premace of the game.User generated cars may be my favorite part.I would like to be able to customize a helmet for each car.and I understand that is in the works.I realy enjoy the mix of arcade and simulation.Every aspect of it is user friendly.If I can do it it's easy : P.   I would like to see single player against ai mode.I have recomended Victory to everyone I know.The Mods in the game have helped out alot.Those guys are awesome.The whole community accualy is a great group of players.Would like to see more players.Whether Im doing well or poorly in a race Im having the time of my life laughing like a small child with a new toy.My advice to new players is this:Enter with an open mind and dont compare Victory to anything else .Have fun with it ,after all it's just a game.

								This is an addictive game, since I started to play this game it cost me less in cigarets but much more in sleep time!!!! XDIt can take a years to master every single option the game can offert but it's really enjoyable if you got a friends to start with. It's not a Simulator It's not an Arcade it's a ""simularcarde"" all the simulation tools packed with a semi-arcade gameplay.15$ looks seems tomuch for you? Any free to play will eat a 20$ from you someday and you will say 15$ for a full game isn't much and less stupid than waste 20$ a month on a game with limited content/Feature.Great support team and Fast reply!

								This is an awesome racing game.  You get different cars to start off with.  You can customize cars, and practice doing laps before you join a race, or you can create your own race and invite friends, or anyone online in the game to race with you.  You can fine tune the controls of your cars so that you optimize them to your own skills and preferences.  It's fun to try to beat your personal best times by finding just the right balance of power, steering, brakes, grip, and traction, among other factors.  Plus as you improve, you can play again better and better human opponents so it never gets boring!  In short, play the game.  You'll love it too!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Victory: The Age of Racing is a free to play car racing simulator.  It worked, looked ok, sounded ok, able to get into races. The graphics looked good and i guess it would be an ok race game.Somebody might like this game if they know how to get it to work. Game has high learning curve, need to have experience with other racing games.CONS:- I could not figure out how to set up controller that worked. - Could not get car to drive with keyboard.  - There is no tutorial on driving car and no manual. - There is no test track to drive by yourself. - It is all PVP races, you have to have more than 1 player car to start a race.  - Tried using my xbox controller, but it didn't work in a race, since there is no freaking Test track to try it on. - the UI is clunky.- I have tried other race games and have been able to figure out how to get the car moving in a test drive.

								I really enjoy this game. The graphics are awesome, the physics of the cars are great, and the tracks are sweet. You really get a feel for the car and the track. There is a bit of a learning curve and detailed car setup, but it's awesome. They used this same technology Assetto Corsa . I play that as well now. Assetto Corsa is another game you will love if you dig this game. This game is really fun, coming from a guy who's purchased a lot of racing games and been very disappointed until now.

								I am an avid fan of racing games and racing in general. I own all the race sim games you could dream of and I go out to see as many races as I possibly can. As you can expect, I'm  not much of an arcade racing game fan, the look feel and mechanics don't appeal to me at all. Untill I played this game.Starting up this game, you immediately notice the abandoned F2P mechanics still left in the game, you buy parts and upgrades with an ingame currency and you're able to buy boosts to your earned currency, or ""gears"", as well. surprisingly enough this is actually fun, it almost feels like you're a fledgling racing car driver, trying to get his team off the ground with a limited budget.The racing itself is surprisingly good, the cars feel heavy yet powerful, the tracks are interesting to say the least and the car designs are one of the craziest yet most satisfying I've seen in any game. You can customise your own ""Formula One"" car from any era which leads to absolutely ridiculously satisfying designs. The game itself looks rather bland, the cars and menus look ok at best, but the tracks, while enjoyable, look plain bad. I do realise that this is a early access game, and I sincerely hope that they adress this.All in all this game is an unexpected diamond in the rough. I'd urge the casual racing fan and even the hardcore fans to give this a try as the customisation alone is something barely any other AAA developer has ever attempted. I consider this a well made game that mixes the wackiness of Trackmania with the accessibility and controls of Racedriver: Grid.			",439,131,42,42,70,4,83

								It has much improvements than the last time I played in alpha state. But it would be good if there's more cash rewarded from event. The amount of money rewarded after a race is so little, that grinding wouldn't make a significant different. Overall it is a good game with a lot of customization stuff. The thing that I like the most is you can make a car that looks like a Mini 4WD/Tamiya car.			",16,1,2,2,3,0,2

								Short review I would pass Long Review this game is very limited only formula style cars and pay to win. Before each race a screen pops up that offers you to buy with real money stats booster for your car for only that race. Which turned me off right away.Another thing is only about 20 people online so not many to race with at all.I would recommend Simraceway if you want a more sim experince which is free to play or Auto Club is more arcade that is also free to play.

								  FIRST OFF: Victory, to me,  is NOT a racing SIM. IT IS NOT PAY TO WIN to the best of my knowledge. This game seems like a hybrid...very customizable, but you don't have to count every tooth on every gear in your car. Yet, every change I make to my car, no matter how small, affects it's performance. I like that.   With all the control options, I must say that Victory is the most accessable/intuitive racing game I have ever played and the community is extremely helpful towards new players. My steering wheel I use (MS Sidewinder FF Wheel)* can be adjusted in game. I would recommend enabling ""Reverse force feedback"" for those having issues with the ""feel"" of your wheel. Worked for me. Graphics are good. The scenery isn't as alive as some racing games. I haven't seen huge crowds or sponsors I recognize. You'll forget about that the moment a race starts.  The Sound, to me, is spectacular! I can hear the audible whine of gears straining in the transmission as the engine approaches 12000rpm. I can hear the realistic ""WHOOSH!"" of the wind getting louder and louder as I pass 200mph! THAT CORNER IS COMING UP FAST!      WHAM!You will learn every day that you are getting a bit faster with each lap. You'll find yourself starting a server of your own and inviting people to your race. And you can set up a race that will temporarily degrade the performance of seasoned drivers. It levels the playing field. People flock to these ""handicap"" races! That's my experience.Sooooo...............OLD FOGIE'S BEWARE! KEEP YOUR HEART MEDICATION HANDY! XD   YOUNGSTER'S, STOP LAUGHING AND WATCH OUT! OLD FOGIE'S WILL KICK YOUR A**!OLD FOGIE'S! HELP OUT YOUNGSTERS! GIVE THEM ADVICE AND GUIDANCE! RAISE THEIR FRAGILE SELF-ESTEEM! LET'EM WIN, ONCE!   YOUNGSTER'S! THEY BOUGHT IT! NOW, IT'S ON! THE SECRET TO WINNING IS OUT! HA HA!Truth is, I haven't found the ""secret"" to winning. My experience is that skill and practice, along with the community exchanging ideas for the betterment of whoever is asking for assistance....THAT is most important to me having fun in this game.Again, all I have to say is WOW! The sense of speed while driving in Victory and the excitement of racing others online...and losing to them...again and again...can be matched only when you win your first race! AWESOME! I've played a lot of mostly EA(tm)'s Formula and NASCAR(R) series and appreciate the vast mechanical customization available in these games. I would spend hours and hours fine tuning and customizing my car. The pre-race practice, tuning again, qualifying and racing on actual real-world tracks was awesome! (Customization on the car bodies used to be great. Over time, I've noticed that I'm having to buy ""custom cars"" as DLC....hmmm.) Anyway....  Then I got a job. And a relationship. Then the military. Back to school...again! Where did all my time go?  I accept now that my alone time is at a premium and micromanagement of every tooth of every gear in the tranny is not feasable at this time. Man! What a bummer!   Victory: The Age of Racing has enabled me to use a system of simple* sliders to adjust each of the major mechanical  groups on my car....gears, suspension, downforce, brakes, etc. I am up and on the track in moments. And, yes, the in-game customization is, in my view, the best in the biz. Check out some user made cars online. Yep, most are created by ppl like you and me. A very, very intuitive system with too many combination to go into. I love the customization in Victory. The only thing that beats it WAS early NASCAR(R) Sims where I could practically create a car skin with my face on it! As I mentioned earlier, it seems I gotta buy many cars from EA(tm), now.PLEASE, I have never spent any more $$$ than the original purchase price on this game! As far as I know, and I'm approaching 700 hours of game time, all purchases through ""gear credits"".  ""Gear credits"" are awarded by driving hotlaps for the best time, or racing humans from around the world. Believe me, there are good drivers out there! Few are playing at this time, that's what I'm seeing. I believe there is an anticipation in the community of major news. The standard events are down, but I can create a server and people who are in ""stealth mode"", where players can  choose to appear offline to do personal stuff (creating cars, practicing, etc) suddenly join my race. It appears many times that the servers are dead. Only a very few times have I put out the ""bait"" and sat there on my track and no one joins. Some people don't want to be interrupted while they are perfecting their car. Sometimes I am busy and don't necessarily want to race....I'm in the middle of finishing my next Formula Car! BTW: Races are restricted to cars of the same point class. The amount of points you put into your car will have a great influence on it's performance. These 0-60/70 points are put into YOUR OWN CAR, CREATED BY YOU. The points are allocated to your own preference. You can customize aerodynamics, downforce, braking, grip, etc and,  more importantly, EVERY car is different, in my opinion. AND I CANT, NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY, FIND ANYTHING REMOTELY ""PAY-TO-WIN"" HERE! BELIEVE ME, I'M A HUGE FAN OF PAY-TO-WIN AND VICTORY IS NO ""PAY-TO-WIN""! Victory: Age of Racing will make your hair stand on end. If you think you're not getting anything out of it, like me...losing a lot more than winning, ask someone in game to give you some advice on a generic set up for your car. You will be amazed at the level of control you'll gain when you understand what the points and sliders do to your car.			",230,30,33,45,71,3,94

								There was a time when I played this game and there many were people online, the game had potential, but it seems the devs couldn't decide it this was going to be an arcade or sim racer. While there was a good idea behind this game, and there were many customizable options on the cars. It seems the biggest issue were the tracks, there just weren't enough, and also some tracks were just not suited for all the class cars. So in the narrower/slower tracks, there was just too much ramming with the faster cars, while the faster wider tracks had no challenge with the slower cars, yet there was still ramming. When you started out, you had no upgrade points or upgraded parts, racing against other people who had maxed out the performance of their cars and had all the upgraded parts was not fun, and then the vice versa also wasn't fun, beating new people who had no upgrades. So there was no balance and no real skill involved, with enough grinding you could win without using much skill.I went back to this game a little while ago and the game is dead, no one is online and it's pretty boring racing alone or waiting 10 minutes for there to be enough people in a race. I still get emails on event's though, some poor sod on max level is winning all these event's.To those who bought the game (or bought gold when the game was free), at least you'll be able to get race craft for free. Lets see if this one is any better and that the devs have made up their minds about how they want the game.			",117,4,17,5,5,0,9

								This game has sucked me into it verry fast. It liiks like a racing simulator but it is far from the simulator feel making racing alot more enjoyable. the graphics look good and runs smoothly. The costomization is simple to learn and works rather well. The courses are very well constructed and they all have somthing different in them. The car stat costomization is excellent letting you choose how you want your car to drive and how well it can drive. Somtimes its hard to get into a race with somone else when not much people are playing, but there is a hotlap mode where you race arround a track and get in game currency (gears) every time you complete a lap with out crashing or beating your best time. I would love to see more people play this game and grow the allready awesome community.			",32,1,11,4,5,2,3

								If I were to compare this to another series of titles I would say it reminds me of the Track Mania titles in a sense with more traditional style track layouts. As a wheel user I think Vae Victis has done a good job to create a Universal Generic Controller Profile setup that has good ffb recognizes my ClubSport Wheel and ClubSport pedals and maps with ease and recognizes my ClubSport Shifter as a secondary input device then allows for axis sensitivity adjustments. If your familar with what is considered an Arcade Racing game you know wheel support is hit or miss with most any title. The fact Vae Victis has it right for the most part goes a long way torward my overall outlook of the game and it's developer. Vae Victis is worth keeping around and their efforts deserve our support!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								The game is lame even for early access. The graphics is from early 2000, physics is from those times as well -- given that the game is posed as a semi-serious simulator! The car constructor limits you to 2-3 details of each kind -- and building a car is really expensive. You would need to hang out in the empty lobby for a long-long time until you can afford one. The scoring system is somewhat mysterious, rewarding ""participation, not victory"". Also, English translation is weird sometimes.On the positive side, the game does not crash, supports side controllers like steering wheels (although the settings menu is poor as a gradstudent -- no way to adjust sensitivity, deadzones, linearity or whatever) and has something like 15 tracks in 3 environments, which is the most abundant element of the game so far.In the end, the idea is worth the praise, but the implementation pretty much sucks. No noticeable improvements occured over the past three months. If you want to race somewhere similar, I would advise Trackmania Nations or F1 2013.			",57,6,14,8,13,0,16

								I've had some pretty good fun with this game with a controller.  Anything other than a controller is not really worth it... even a wheel.  The wheel support just doesn't feel right but it is an arcade game so the controller is just fine and sometimes more ""fun"" this way anyways.  Some confusing UI is about the worste part.  Not much multiplayer and not many people playing but for a fun start to racing it's really not that bad.  Not great though.			",86,8,19,1,29,1,20

								A confused mess of a game.A mix of arcade and sim racer, which is struggling to evolve from a pay-to-win freemium game into a normal ""pay once to play everything"" model.  Think ""Trackmania"" mixed with ""F1 2013"", run by bad management and covered by a layer of confusing, over-complicated and muddled interfaces and options.Oh, and it doesn't work properly with many racing wheel/peddle set-ups and for those it recognises, the force-feedback is applied at the wrong times and in the wrong directions!It might get better, but it will take many patches...

												Honestly, I Love the concept of this game, also let me just clarify that customization of cars is a far better feature than randomized tracks. *cough racecraft sucks cough*. However there are a few bugs which if fixed could make this game amazing. Obviously the server issues have been adressed already, but also the games needs to be smoothed out, the lobby is a mess and i would much rather have a quick match button that puts you in que until a certain amount of players are found, and a tournament button that does the same, also a private race button for practice and custom races. next just tidy up the home screen and make it clear what im looking at, all the toolbars are over crowded  The Racing is great with a few glitches here and there. Bring support for STEAM CONTROLLERS please. In short: Racing is great assuming no lag, car design great, lobby not so great, glitchy, but with love and support this game can be one of the best out there ( yes way better idea than racecraft).

								I've been burned many times in the past by Early Access. This is the last time. Victory, in its current state, is nothing short of an underwhelming experience that left me wanting what was promised from the current release.- Car editing is, to be honest, boring. While the livery editor is decent (if not a little fiddly), the amount of selectable blocks is low and there's no visual customisation outside of that. Customisation of the car's stats is easy but you have to pay a virtual currency to make any changes - eliminating any aspect of trial-and-error.- Online racing is just awful. With six players maximum on the track and a lobby system that is a completely confusing mess, actually getting into a game is hard enough. Getting into a competitive one with players you can actually *race* against players instead of lapping or being lapped is even harder due to big imbalances.- While the game isn't free to play, you can tell that it used to be at one point. You can use your gears to purchase boosts to your cars for single races (which is hugely unfair) and doing anything related to new cars costs some. For a game that advertises the freedom you get in modifying cars, you sure are locked out of doing many free things. Even modifying stats costs gears - it just goes too far.This game has potential, but it's hugely untapped potential, and while the driving model is pretty cool and the upcoming track editor seems promising, in its current state I am not impressed.

								Very fun game and well worth the money. That said, I uderstand that the game is still in early stages of development and there are changes that will be implimented, but can a countdown timer please be implimented when delayed collisions are on as I ran into a player because I was unaware that collisions were going to be turned on and that caused me to begin flipping endlessly. Other than that, I love the game! Just a few bugs to squash.			",90,7,7,10,12,3,8
