												This game is good as a prototype or as a proof of concept but it is very unpolished (even for a free to play mobile title).Some problems I had with it:-no margin of error, I died within 2-3 seconds in on the first ~30 races-don't expect a racing game, this is more akin to Super Hexagon/Duet -there is a huge learning curve at the beginning and because scoring is still done like in a racing game (points for positions) the game does not reward progress and improvement until the player is at least somewhat competent. Moreover, racing is completely random, no matter the performance the final position always seems random-you have to learn the tracks to be able to get any enjoyment out of this (e.g. not dying 2-3 seconds in) as it is impossible to avoid oncoming obstacles based on pure reaction (after noticing them), player have to make evasive manouvers preemptively-menus are hard to navigate (e.g it's hard to distinguish highlighted buttons), controller support is completely random in them (sometimes only the mouse works...)+sense of speed is good			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

+ Insanely high movement speed, which makes for a load of fun! You are going sooooooooo fast from start to finish, and have so many close calls with deaths as you zip through each lap of the course.+ The tracks are very creative and have a lot of verticality to them. It felt a bit like F-Zero + Works very well with a controller+ Great background musicThis game is in Early Access so these are subject to change- Extremely basic controls / gameplay mechanics. Basically you simply steer left or right with no other controls.- Lacking Content. Needs more things to do or more tracks to compete on. Possible suggestions: Power-Ups, Boosts, Jumps, Ramps, Longer length tracks, different environments / hazards, perhaps even earning various rocket upgrades.			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

Early Access Review
								I don't do reviews very often but, when I do I really enjoy the game and want to see it grow so... why not put out a review for it? This probably isn't very professional but, the game is very enjoyable I have only played for a little bit but I can just see how amazing this could be with a few friends and at this time it's only five bucks so I'd say it's worth it especially if you are into fast paced racing as well as ridiculously unforgiving in terms of crashing and what not. A few things that need to be added to the game are things like time trials not sure if abilities would help this game or not but, it could be cool and my only problem I've had with the game is there is no music at the main screen which is just a personal preference if this sounds like a pretty good deal try it for yourself.

												This is a fast game.It pegs my 980Ti at 100%. Far Cry 4 on Ultra can do that, too. If I'm honest, Far Cry looks better.More tracks would be nice.Fun little toy. Best purchased on sale.			",396,105,34,16,28,4,20

												Feels more like an abandoned project.The ""amount"" of tracks to what you can do and not fixed the physic's or gameplay/controls.For me the controls suck and/or are sooo sensitive or just hard to use ""right"".The content makes it last 10m more or less.Gameplay does NOT make you wanting to come back to it (unless you are able to get some fun out of it)He did talk about an track editor, but 2 months and no responses.A dead title to me.

								Id recommend it. Id say the game is pretty fun. Its got that labor of love feeling that too many games nowadays are missing. Its similar to f zero speed. I look forward to seeing it progress.Things I like:Its fast, its fun, the courses are challenging. The characters are nice looking. The gameplay is balanced.Things I'd like to see improved:AI feels impossible to knock off or push around, and is on rails tied to you and the track. Some variation in their play would be nice.

								I've been playing for under half an hour but I already know this game is something good. It's simple but effective, and even though I suck at it (can't even get two gates on Cliff Hanger) I love bashing into people and zigzagging my way through enemies.			",15,5,0,3,7,1,0

												-=My new favorite game=-I like this game so much i just HAD to write a review for it( even though its in early access )Its a really good game, i love the idea and i would love to meet the genius who came up with this idea and shake their hand.There ARE a few things that do bug me though, and most of them are the graphics and controls, here we go, 1. I would like it if you could change controls ( ie: i have a PS4 game controller and this game works with it, but i want to change the left and right to L1 and R1 ) 2. The graphics are pretty good, though it would be better if you could customise it a little bit more, say if one map is really laggy, I could turn down the graphics so that it would get better, therefore creating a more fun experience for me and my friends 3. There aren't alot of people online to play Multiplayer and alot of my friends live quite close to me and also play this game, I think it would be better for the game if you could implement Local Multiplayer, again, therefore creating a better and more fun experience for me and my friends 4. I don't like loading times and this game has possibly the fastest loading time yet! I can get straight into the action in around 2 seconds 5. This game also has one of the most user-friendly menu's and i like that you can change the colour of your' character right from the start screen!I can't think of any more things to say about this game, but it DOES remind me alot like F-Zero, Redout and WipEoutoverall, 10/10 -==- would Rocket Ski Dangerously again			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

								Certified fast. You will die. There are no respawns. You will transcend all known forms of speed if you can survive more than three laps.			",102,5,20,10,5,3,13
