												I thought I'd give this a try, seeing how it's only $2. Unfortunately you get what you pay for and this game was sadly not particularly good. The gameplay is very simple, as demonstrated in the trailer on Steam. But that's also all there's to it: a very light shoot 'em up.The game is incredibly repetitive. Monsters come at you from the exact same angles every few seconds, making the game more of a pattern recognition exercise than anything. You have a basic attack that you can pretty much spam continuously and a whirlwind attack that needs to be charged but only kills certain enemies. The lack of a health bar, score meter or progress meter to the next boss is very annoying.Graphically there's really nothing to it. Playing it full screen is not recommended, as it makes all the ugly stand out.There's also not much sound. Aside from the looping organ music, the sound assets seem limited to a whopping 3 sound bites.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where should I even start? The campaign mode is terrible. It has 3 levels, all of them which have a 10-minute long obstacle run that inevitably gets boring, frustrating and repetitive, followed by a boss fight that can be ended in as short as 15 seconds if you get some lucky shots and if you attack right off the bat. Besides the campaign mode, the current version offers survial mode, which is basically an endless torture of the same repetitive patterns of enemies and obstacles, the only difference being that bosses appear every 60 seconds. I'll be blunt about the mechanics: they just look like the developer/s wasted more time on prolonging the idiotic obstacle runs rather than actually working on the diversity of the game. The only things you can do are move left, right, and a tiny bit forward and attack in 2 ways: the normal, projectile attack and the whirlwind attack, which needs a second or so to charge and makes you invulnerable for a short period of time while also killing enemies in a very short range around you. That's literally the whole game. I wouldn't be bashing the lack of diversity of the game (it's normal in a game made in unity and with a cheap price tag) if it weren't for the awfully long levels. The enemies you will encounter are gargoyles, some banshees, wolves (most annoying enemy), and skeletal hands randomly placed in your path, while the bosses are cheap nicknames given to Nosferatu (The Phantom), The Headless Horseman (The Horseman) and Dracula (The Count, if I'm not mistaken), which have the same pattern of attacks over and over again, the only thing distinguishing them from the normal enemies being the increased number of hits required to take them down. A thing that I quite liked was the art style, I have to say that it turned out pretty well in my opinon. I certainly think that the game can be improved a lot and that an updated version with some fixes of the minor bugs in this one and added content (might as well have a bigger price, but I think it would be worth it) would have a pretty nice succes among the indie lovers. I can't reccomend it in its current state, maybe only for the trading cards and achievements (it will be a pain in the a** to get them all, trust me), but I do certainly hope that the game is not left unattended by the devs.TL;DR: A cheap game that might be worth getting at first glance, if you're looking for a couple of achievements (which are quite frustrating to get) and 3 trading cards, then go ahead, you might be satisfied with the purchase. But if you are looking for a nice little indie game for you to kill some time with, this game is certainly not what you're looking for (at least in its current state)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is worth the price; especially if you're paying with a coupon.  If you're looking for depth, look elsewhere.  But if you're down for a late 80s style Arcade shooter, this is the one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												the game doesn't start and not only for me. it remains stuck at the splash screen. no assistance by the developers on the forum, no assistance writing them via e-mail. 0/10 don't waste your money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
