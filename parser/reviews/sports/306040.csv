AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Howler Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: 2D; Simple; Puzzle; Strategy My Overall Grade: B- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Casual gamersREVIEWI love epic AAA titles that take three full work-weeks to complete just as much as the next guy; but sometimes I also enjoy those short and simple games that are easy to digest after a long day. The Howler is a great example of the latter. It has simple, straightforward mechanics with a pleasing, intimate art style. It is short and gratifyingly challenging without being too frustrating. And there is also an optional Voice-Mode which can be used to add a little dash of flavor to the experience. The game is comprised of a small amount of short levels. Most of them won’t take long to beat. The puzzles involve simple two-dimensional movement which requires timing and precision. It is all very simplistic. But if you want to try out something a little different, you can enable Voice-Mode, which will allow you to use your voice (via humming, whistling, or blowing into the microphone) to control the game. It’s kind of fun at first, but some of the harder levels require a lot of precision and it can be real difficult in Voice-Mode.The hand-drawn artwork is also very nice.  It is a pleasing mix of intimate, curious, and casual. It isn’t the most refined or aweing art, but it is unique and full of character, and it fits the game well.The last thing I’ll mention is that it is very short. To me, short games are great because I love variety and hate leaving things unfinished; but I know some people may have a problem with it, so be aware. Also, I generally try to not discuss price in my reviews, because everyone values a dollar differently depending on their lifestyle. But in this case I do want to say that I feel like the developers have priced this game reasonably considering its length. And so, like I suggested earlier: it is a nice, little game for those times you want something lightweight and intuitive. If that sounds like something you would be interested in, I would recommend you give The Howler some consideration.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

												DISCLAIMER: I was given a key for free by the publisher!The most outstanding feature of The Howler is the art style for sure. Hand drawn art for both background and foreground objects. The later actually appear like paper cut-outs attached to the former.Gameplay is simple and straight forward! You are only required to click the left mouse button to control your balloon (click = balloon will rise, no-lick = balloon will drop). Movement to the left/right is controlled by flowing air currents; e.g. if you want to move to the right, just let the balloon rise or drop to the corresponding current, but beware of sharp objects that will let it burst by touching.The object in each level varies from simply getting to the landing spot to picking up packes, dropping them off and land.As much as I enjoy my time with The Howler, there is one important thing to mention, which might be shortcoming for some people: There is NO REAL FULLSCREEN support, that is, even if you go fullscreen, the game itself takes place in a realtively small window!

												It's pretty, but it shouldn't be a PC game. The mechanic - tap to go up, let go to let fall - is perfect for a mobile game and frankly silly on a PC.Their main gimmick is that if you have a mic, you can use audio instead of mouse clicks and keyboard strokes, but it doesn't work. It relies on the machine having a built-in audio source. There are no options to choose input, and so if it doesn't automatically work there's nothing you can do.For the main gimmick, this is pretty shoddy, because without it it's a lacklustre jetpack joyride on PC.I do really like the art style, though.Fair warning, I got this for free from a marketing group.

												2.99 on steam or 1.99 on app store. Totaly worth it.It a simple game to play as you talk to your ballon and yell at it to go ""UP,UP,UP!""The hardest part is trying to go quiet when you want to scream for your ballon to make it through that hole while decending down.Artwok is beautiful, and it's got that addicting factor of...just one more time I swear....only cons I have are-no full screen and no options to make it so.-I can't find how to close the game without X'ing it out-can't access settings while in game or return to main menu so you have to close game in order to change mic sensitivity or w/e.-the option to make a quick,loud sound to drop a bomb/parcel is too finiky to work well as I drop stuff without even yelling that loud or sharply-TOO SHORT I WANT MORE!!!All in All again totaly worth the price of a cup of coffee.Do Play....

												I will admit, I only bothered to look at this game due to its very cool graphical style. Though, on watching the gameplay video and reading the main synopsis present on the store page, I became fearful of a very real possibility. Namely, that hiding behind an excellent artistic direction is a shallow, and probably irritating, gimmick driven “game”. Not unexpectedly, I’m obliged to report that my suspicions proved accurate, but also that my discoveries come with several reservations.First, the gameplay itself (and this should be obvious from the accompanying trailers), is minimal. The goal is to slowly raise and lower your balloon in tune with the weather patterns, which push you left and right, to varying degrees, and land at some designated point. As the game goes on, you’ll have to contend with the added complexity of doing this several times per level, and occasionally even drop things down holes or bombs on unsuspecting flying spiky balls. Playing with a standard mouse, this gets boring, and at times irritating, though mostly due to the slow nature of your balloon and having to wait for your chance to fail again. Chances are, you will have to reset levels several times due to popping or floating too far off-screen. This is where the gimmick comes in, and the developers clearly hope that people haven’t learned from every other throwaway peripheral and gimmick that console makers try to push down our throats. By using your mic, you can control the balloon with your voice. Or any manner of sound, I suppose, so long as you can easily fluctuate it. This is also where my first aforementioned reservation comes in. If you can entertain yourself for hours on end by making stupid noises in the dark, than by all means, play and thoroughly enjoy The Howler. If you’re considering this as a fun diversion for you and your drunk friends, ask yourself this – when was the last time you were able to keep a group of drunks quiet for more than 5 seconds? If you can’t answer that question, than you’re better dusting off the ol’ Kinect for another go around of drunk digital soccer.Now here’s my second reservation: the art design. It is superb, often ranging from the melancholy to the downright foreboding. And of course, the Wolf. It really bothers me that such a fantastic art style is wasted on a game like this. Given that this mediocre excursion could be beaten in little more than hour (provided you’re forced to reset as often as I had to), than I would seriously consider recommending this title given you have a fondness for such things. If you can forgive, or at the very least tolerate the gameplay, than you may have a better time than I did, if only for the joy of viewing the set pieces. Know, though, that for some reason the game is limited to a small window (surrounded by a large black border in fullscreen), and cannot appear to be changed. While this keeps the art crisp and clean, I am disappointed that I couldn’t have a closer look at some of the better murals.The Howler is based off of a book, and you’ll see a direct link to it on Amazon.com in the game’s menu. It’s a shame that there is absolutely no exposition or plot to the game’s events, offering only a quick phrase explaining your mission for whatever group and off you go!. Perhaps it might have alleviated the boredom of the actual gameplay mechanic to have given it all a more defined purpose. In any case, The Howler is something you probably shouldn’t even bother playing in the first place. Unless you really think you’re going to enjoy making stupid noises into your mic for an hour, or absolutely refuse to use google to find the game’s sublime artwork, I’d recommend you at least find a better mobile port to spend your time on.

												TL;DR: The Howler is a slow, extremely tedious game that will test your patience and relies on an art style that doesn't compliment nor is complimented by either the gameplay or the sound design, causing frustration (did I mention that you gotta wait for everything, even bringing the pause menu is slow) especially when using the gimmick, sound-based control feature.The Howler is another gimmick ""arty"" indie game that hides its more than shallow and lackluster gameplay behind supposedly stunning art and visuals; which I normally have no problem with but in this case the graphics are far from gorgeous: I presume it's supposed to fit into a certain art style given that (quote from the game's store page) ""All art used in the Howler was meticulously created by classically-trained experienced painters."" but this art style is not meant for games, it just doesn't work and looks like a scanned colored pencil piece of drawing. It has terrible affordance and does a very poor job at showing what element is going to pop the balloon and what is just part of the background.Still going on the art: the sound design is dull and repetitive, as if they forgot to implement any sound and rushed it at the last minute.I will however admit that the first time the balloon approaches the iron Wolf, and the jaw opens with a deep, metallic sound, it was pretty cool. The gameplay, even though not the most important part in this kind of game, barely exists: it's roughly clicking and waiting with little challenge other than testing your patience.The sound control gimmick (note that I'm consciously using the word gimmick rather than feature) is forgettable. It's not bad, but it's far from good. It's forgettable for the very reason that it has little to no gameplay to be applied on!And regarding the level design, I'm hesitant whether it has been made by someone with little experience or someone simply lazy: it's over-simplistic and very repetitive.As a conclusion I'd like to address some errors in the store page user-defined tags:- Adventure: No. It's certainly not an Adventure game.- Simulation: I can see why this tag, but it barely simulates anything.- Strategy: Oh please, strategy? No. Strategy is term that defines long-term thinking and process. Even the word ""tactical"" would be more fitting here.- Action: Ahah... If your definition of Action is: click-wait-click-wait-wait-wait-click... then yes, maybe.- Shoot 'Em Up: Oh come on! Now that's just blatant lies.- Sports: What the f...- Puzzle: Nope. The Howler is very simplistic so no thinking requiered.- Difficult: No. Tedious.I give this game the rating of 15/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Simple & hilarious // Recommended on sale, best with friends~Full Disclosure: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers~Microphone is heavily recommended for this title+ Spectacular, aesthetically pleasing artistic design+ Voice controls may be a bit gimmicky, but it can quickly become quite hilarious, especially around others; one may find oneself shouting nonsensical things in order to keep afloat+ Balancing momentum and wind currents does much to add to the title's challenge+ The casual nature of the title makes it very easy to pick up and play for a quick entertainment fix- Abysmal selection in the 'settings' menu; no resolution support whatsoever- Suffered frequent CTD (mostly when failing a course)- Limited replayability when not with friends; also suffers a sharp drop in entertainment value when using a mouse over voice controlsLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simple idea made great with awesome hand-rendered charcoal/paint/ink art. Looks easy at first but very quickly becomes a highly precise battle against the wind and gravity. Despite only running in a 4:3 black bordered box or window, The Howlers representation of a steam-punk Lithuanian capital Vilnius remains hugely atmospheric. Excellent.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was very surprised by this short but sweet game, particularly considering how cheap it is. The premise of the game, to control a hot air balloon, is very simple, yet made interesting by the challenge of having to navigate often precarious routes. The game's controls are intuitive, as the only control over the balloon the player has is to increase its altitude, and to drop objects. The balloon's direction and speed are left to the whim of the wind, as the wind direction and speed alter according to altitude. By keeping both the premise and mechanics of the game simple and intuitive, yet introducing a new idea or challenge with each of 16 levels, the game kept me both intrigued and somewhat intellectually stimulated. Some aspects of the game I particularly enjoyed are the art style and music, and ability to use audio as a form of input instead of the mouse, which works very well. However, as with almost any game, there are a few aspects I would have liked to see imrpoved. Firstly, the inability to rebind controls, such as using the arrow keys instead of left click, the fact that the game doesn't scale with screen size, meaning there is a lot of unused black space around it, and the inability to move the camera independently from the balloon as I sometimes felt that my field of view was unnecessarily constrained. Yet, despite all of its flaws, I was left thouroughly satisfied by the game, and despite only taking up to an hour to complete, I would not expect any more for its price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought The Howler around Christmas time on sale- and to be honest it has sat in my games list untouched until now. It's been sat, waiting patiently, for a day where I have absolutely nothing else to do. Today was that day, and The Howler certainly helped me get through a hour or so until I went to get my Chinese takeaway.The artwork, as others have said, is beautiful. Really really well done on that part :) But the main thing that grasped me about this game was the alternate controls- the ability to use your microphone to do all the controlling! None of my steam games have surprised me with a feature like this before- it made the game so much more fun! Others have said how boring and slow the game can be, but this feature brings your concentration to a whole new level.THAT said- there were a few kinks to be worked out with the feature. At times it can be a little TOO sensitive- when a car drove past outside my balloon would fly away, or even on the Wolf cave level, the sound of the passage opening would be loud enough to also blow the balloon away... I have to complete that level using the mouse, which was a little disappointing.One more point about problems while playing- your balloon CAN touch some objects/walls... but not all? And it's not obvious what will and what wont pop your balloon. This became quite frustrating in the more tightly spaced levels :/All in all, really lovely little game, I'd recommend it to anyone for the unique controls input alone, especially as it's so cheap. REALLY wish this game had some achievements!!! Would play through the whole thing again for some achievements (Wink wink nudge nudge Mr Dev)- also it was nice getting 3/5 trading cards from drops :) That made the cute little badge nice and attainable too (Y)<3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I will start off by saying I did not try the voice mode. Its 6am, and I live in an aptartment building. My neighbors dont want to hear me shouting UP! This game has a lot of character and the kind of Steampunk feel to it, that can draw you in. The game mechanics were pretty simple. Alla mouse click anyhow, Follow the current's, drop the package, dont hit things, land on the pad. I enjoyed what I put into it, for my 0.14 cents. This card collection booster game, might actually get a second lookDid i mention Steampunk?!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game. Simple control but can hard sometimes.This game has stunning concept arts. I really love steampunk tone in this game.All you have to do in this game is control your balloon to reach goal or drop something but it is not easy like that because you have to avoid obstacles and calculate wind directions carefully.

												First impression: cute little physics timing game.Physics and art - what can go wrong? As it appears, a lot: the game runs in 1024x768, but not stretched, it does a fake fullscreen by adding huge black borders. (You can make it windowed by pressing Esc, that's not in the settings menu.) The microphone input cannot be calibrated to a ""rest"" sound, as a result my balloon always went up into the sky. With voice input active, the game crashes a lot, too. Which means I had to play it with mouse and space bar.And you need a lot of patience: in the first 6 levels, the main game mechanic means you stay at one height to get up to speed and then quickly rise into a countercurrent to hop over an obstacle. Get the timing on this even slightly wrong, and you may need to do it again.. and again... and again. Add random annoying spikey bits that often don't even look spikey for extra aggravation, and borders you can easily fly out of in any direction to restart the level for that extra patience drain.I'm tired now and don't have the patience, and that's why didn't complete it and don't recommend it. Your mileage may vary.
