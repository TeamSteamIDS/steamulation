												TL:DR - Its too expensive for what you get. Its not terrible, in fact the first hour or so is fun, but definitely not worth the price. Especially once you realize that when you've seen the two types of track youve pretty much seen everything the game has to offer.So I love ancient Rome. An ancient Rome chariot racing game is an awesome idea. It reminds me of the chariot race missions in Shadow of Rome. (A really really fun PS2 game. If you are a fan of gladiator games, get it!  And enjoy cutting people's arms off, beating them with it, then tossing it into the crowd..) But this review isnt about Shadow of Rome. Its about Qvadriga. Which unfortunately, is no where near as cool as the concept could be. Now, I wouldnt have as much of a problem with it if it wasn't 20 freakin' dollars. So what do you get for 20 dollars? A tiny-graphic boring game. I normally dont really care about graphics if the gameplay is engrossing, but this game unfortunately lacks that quality, so all you keep on thinking were damn, this would be cool if it actually had decent images of the action.So a basic rundown. You start, and pick your faction. Different factions have different abilities that are explained in tooltips. Some are stronger, faster, can handle their chariots better. Then a map appears with different regions. There are many different regions, each with different tracks in them. Lots of tracks to run on with many random events is a giant plus, except for one issue which shall be explained later.When you start, you can pick one region, and each region has 1 track unlocked. Then a screen where you can look at your  charioteers, get vet services, repairs and healing, and upgrade your horses and chariots. Heres the kicker. Once you pick your first track, you cannot leave it until you get your ""fame"" up enough from racing. So if you pick a hard as hell track (as I did my first try), youre pretty much stuck. Pick which charioteer you want to race with, and you are off.The graphics are really simple, a top down view of chariots on a track. Looks like tiny mobile game graphics. There are two modes, one where the action stops every 10 seconds to give a command, one where it doesnt but you still only are give a command every so often. The commands are accelerate (to a certain level, then you can't), brake, crash right/left (slam your chariot into an opponent a la ben hur), lacerate (whip an opponent), small/medium/large move left or right (each one moves you farther across the lanes), watch for attacks (basically a block) and control (basically do nothing, but it makes your control go up), and finally whip (allows your horses to get a burst of speed, but you can hurt them).There are many different tracks to race on, some narrow, some larger. Each track has a brief paragraph about its history. Every time you race there are slighty different variables on the track, described in a simple sentence before the race. Theres lots of these, both bad and good and they provide some variety.Youre going to need it. This game is grindy as hell. See, you get money for racing, more if you win. You use this money to buy better guys, horses and chariots. You also need to pay for vet and repairs from racing damage. Each wheel, horse, and charioteer has a life bar. Take too much damage, and a horse dies, leaving you to pull with 3. Go too fast, and your wheel gets damaged. Go too fast around a corner and you can topple your chariot, leaving your guy to be dragged by his horses. You then have the option of running (and the other guys can hit you, or hanging on till youre in a safe spot to run.There are stats, represented by icons. The different stats ccombine to make the upgrades (say a horse with two speed icons vs a horse with 1 speed and 1 endurance - which one do you want.. The two speed will be faster but weaker than the 1 speed 1 endurance)But theres only 6 guy types (stats: skill - how good of a driver you are, and constitution - how much damage you can take) and 9 horse types (stats: speed - top speed, and endurance - same as con but for the horse) and 9 chariot types( stats: acceleration and size, again same as con but for the chariot). And they are expensive as hell. It also costs money to travel from track to track, and you can't race certain tracks till you get more famous. So you will probably doing the same race over and over just to get enough cash to go somewhere else. Theres two types of track, a tight oval type and a longer wider type. Except for this, there is absolutely nothing to differentiate them.A $20 game this is not. It can be fun for a little bit, and if it had some kind of multiplayer it'd be pretty fun. But as it is, its just boring after the first hour or so.			",211,106,1,118,39,0,27

												Okay, Qvadriga doesn't even look old, it looks completely ancient, and the concept of a turn-based top-down simulation of chariot racing isn't exactly mainstream. But don't judge a game on your first impression as you wouldn't judge a book by its cover (I have a feeling you'd like books as much as I do if you've come here). This game delivers unexpected levels of tactical depth and attention to details, and truly deserves its sale price if not its full price.The core gameplay is based on managing your speed and taking the decision to whip your horses to push them over their limits, or whip your opponents to incapacitate them, ram their chariots, cripple their horses, trample your dismounted rivals - playing it brutal is all part of the games, and the capable AI will use every trick in the book.Campaign-wise, racing is rewarded with denarius (the currency of the Roman Empire) to build your team with upgraded chariots, horses and skilled drivers-slaves. Good results also increase your fame which will open up the doors of more prestigious stadiums, several dozens of them available in seven provinces, up to the great Circus Maximus of Rome if you prove worthy. Completing a campaign requires about 10 hours of gameplay, more if you invest time to skill up your team of slaves and acquire the top quality chariots and horses. The little things: random events spice up each race. Cities offer various bonuses and some historical background. A random name generator use the cultural origins of your recruits and your rivals to give them all unique names. Successful drivers get their amount of victories tracked after their name. Last but not least, you'll pick up some Latin vocabulary to impress lesser-educated nerds! Stultorum infinitus est numerus, am I right? ;)			",73,21,2,13,5,1,13

												A fun game with an interesting concept. It plays like an old tabletop board game, or perhaps something from the earliest days of pc gaming. It's very well designed in terms of balance and mechanics. The problem is the price for the extremely limited amount of content this game represents. Qvadriga is an excellent $3 to $5 cell phone game, not a $20 pc game. *If* you can get it on sale, for an accurate price, then I highly recommend it, but in a world where indy games with staggering levels of content like Xenonauts and FTL are $25 and $10 respectively, charging $20 for this anemic little game is both insulting and insane.

												Qvadriga is a very fun little game and can even prove to be a bit challenging. However the game play does get a bit repetitive as the racing part of it is really all there is.The price is a bit of a factor, I feel it is quite overpriced for what it is, at best this is a $10 game but realistically a $5 one.The addition of multiplayer with leader boards would have made this game epic fun and more worth the price tag.A bit more depth in the gameplay would have also been helpful too, such as having actual stables to train horses, riders etc. Really any game content outside of the racetrack would have been nice like using money to build your own mansion adding to your prestige level that would in turn attract more skillful riders, chariot builders things of that nature.In the end it is pretty clear this is a tablet game converted to be played on pc, and the tablet version is exactly the same at a lower price so this gets a thumbs down.

What is it?A top-down racing/strategy game based on Roman chariot racing.  The game plays in either dynamic (real-time) where you give your aurigas orders on the move, or static which plays as turn-based control over sections of the course (rather like a board game).You start the game with three men, their chariots and horses belonging to one of 6 factions (each with its own strengths/weaknesses and a couple of extra upgrade points).  You visit the shop for repairs and upgrades, then kit out and send one team into a race at a time, allowing other teams to recover from your last folly (if you can afford the fees and repairs, that is)!  When playing the turn-based variant, each 'turn' lasts for a highlighted section of track around the circus.  Looking at the section and the positions of your opponents, you have a choice of moves you can click (only one action is allowed per turn).  Crucially, these include speeding up or slowing down, switching lanes, taking a defensive stance or whipping, blocking or even crashing into your opponents (no-one said this was a clean fight)!  If you're playing the dynamic version the chariots never stop so you have to think fast and give orders with good timing.  What you choose is pivotal to your survival and your success.  If things go bad (and they will), your man's chariot will break up, leaving him dragging face-first in the dirt.  Do you risk everything by insisting he hangs on until the very end (after all, a finish IS a finish...) or do you tell him to run away while he still has his life?  Your escapee causes the race to be forfeit but at least your man is still alive (if he didn't get trampled...).  New men are expensive to recruit, and no racers means no more game.  You have been warned!To keep things fresh, each circus has its own pros and cons, there are random events that help or hinder you, crowds might lob objects at you, or the debris of other casualties might just finish you off.   While it might seem that luck plays a hand, strategic moves will win the race.GameplayThe game is entirely mouse-driven and is accompanied by a decent PDF manual.  The races are simple and intuitive (all choices are displayed on screen in front of your horses and you simply click the move to be made that turn).  However, the user interface for the shop and upgrades is a little confusing (the game could really use some tooltip text help for its buttons as well as mouse-over feedback to show what can and cannot be clicked) but once you understand how to use it and how to buy the most suitable upgrades, everything is fine.Longevity and value]The game brings that level of addictiveness associated with any game where you upgrade and then progress a bit further each time to earn more upgrades.  Your campaign is lengthy and is retained between sessions so you can pick up where you left off last time.   This is no 10-minute throwaway game.  The idea is genius and it's a unique and original game.  Production quality is best described as 'functional' with no added polish (there is no fun commentary as was advertised in the video, and it lacks any graphic touches like cut-scenes of a win (or a tragedy).  This by no means affects the enjoyment of the game and will mean it can run on any level of kit, but it's sat firmly in the £15 territory where a little bit more polish is usually expected.  This is a minor gripe only as the game is otherwise excellent.  If you have doubts, there is a free demo you can download.  The game can also be bought on Android/iOS (full game with no in-app purchases).			",238,117,21,21,132,3,67

												This is neither a massive nor a complex game. Instead, it is simple, elegant, and surprisingly dramatic for a turn-based game.The premise is that you manage a chariot racing team, from humble beginnings on the outskirts of the Roman Empire, through to fame and glory in the Circus Maximus of Rome itself. Races are broken into ten second turns. On each turn you can give a single order to your charioteer, which could be speed management, a positioning manoeuvre, offensive, or devensive action. You need to play to your strengths at any given moment, and maintain a high level of situational awareness. I was particularly impressed by the AI. It's smart, but will still make risky decisions which can make for the kind of bloody and brutal chaos one would expect from any Roman sport.While at its heart, there is a fairly simple press your luck mechanic (i.e. do I push the horses and risk injury, can I take a tight turn or go wide, should I protect myself or go for position, etc.), the systems are well designed to create emergent situations where finding the right balance between risky and safe is a constant learning experience. Between races you spend your winnings on keeping your team in good order, and upgrades when you can afford them. There's not a ton of complexity to this management layer, but it is still nice when a better component to your racing team comes up for sale and you can afford it.Having sunk over 10 hours into Qvadriga, I'm not sure I'll be dedicating a great deal more. But that was more than enough for me. I felt that the game respected my time. There was a progression, but it felt like it was far more about my skill in the game improving than it felt like I was grinding to go forward. When I got over my initial hump early in the learning curve and gained some confidence, then I was able to bet heavily on myself during most races and plough through the mid and late game relatively quickly. Even late in the piece though, random events at the start of a race (annouced before placing bets), a single bad move or dramatically unlucky roll could easily lead to a disastrous outcome in a particular race.This is definitely not a game for everyone. The RNG can feel really harsh while you are learning the game. It's definitely possible to mitigate its effects with skill, but at least for me that skill took several hours to properly cultivate. I came close to giving up, but I'm glad I didn't, because it turned out to be well worth my time. I also felt like I had to be willing to take more lost races than I was used to in a single player game. Early on, just coming out ahead in terms of earnings to expenses is really the order of the day.My one tip for anyone who does end up playing this game, never whip the horses while at the end of a high speed turn. Every time I did it I crashed the chariot. Even if there was just a few degrees before opening up into the straight, whipping my horses just before fully opening out into a straight was invariably a recipe for disaster. Most of the time in this game any advice will be based on relative positions between you and other racers, as well as the exact condition and abilities of your Quadriga. But in this one case though, it's a 100% bad call to attempt this kind of manoeuvre. Many a race was lost stubbornly confirming the futulity of this move.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is way overpriced. Even at a 10 dollar (50% off), I wouldn't consider this game to buy. At 5 dollar, it is worth it. The gameplay isn't bad. It is actually fun...for the first few hours. After that, you have seen basically the rest and it gets repetive quickly. Add a twenty dollar price tag and you have a non recommandation from me.

												Totally fun game.  If you like the idea of racing chariots and managing a team then this is the game for you.  Basically you buy and sell chariots, horses, drivers as you travel around the ancient world trying to win races to gain earnings.  You can bet on the races.  During the races you have options of shaking the reigns, whipping your horses, crashing your chariot into other players, whipping other players,  moving the horses from lane to lane and must avoid obstacles as well.  Be sure to keep your driver and horses alive as if you can no longer maintain a team you lose.  So far I am great at losing...			",518,223,40,57,75,16,130

												I am kind of surprised about how i enjoyed this game... I took some time to read some of the reviews and all those negative reviews are about the pricing and i personally it shouldn't be mentioned in a review at all especially on steam where the price tag of a game vary very often...Anyway let's just talk about this game...I never even thought that it could be possible for me to enjoy a turn based racing strategy game, but the devs from Turnopia proved me wrong...I actually put more hours on this game that i even expected to and those were quality hours i enjoyed playing this game. The game is kind of difficult since you can't really have a viable strategy that work 100% because there is many factor in consideration, some random events, the probability to hurt your horses so they lose some of their maxmum speed, your chariot can broke and sometime get totally destroyed and the actual skills of the pilot are all things that can influence the game result...I personally like that kind of game that are challenging and sometime even if you plan all the way a perfect strategy, anything can go wrong from one turn to the other...There is differents race tracks that change the play style i use, some have more chariots than others and the numbers of oponent can vary from differents race on the same exact track.You can manage your team and have up to 4 pilots, 4 chariots and 4 pack of horses that can have differents stats that influence the outcome of a race.The options are quite limited for the management, but it's a simple game with some twist in it that make it fun to play in my opinion. If you want to play an easy game where you can win everytime without much difficulty, then i guess you should avoid this genre since the game can be frustrating some time.The game can become repetitive after some time, but what game don't get repetitive after spending some time in it anyway?I recomend this game if you like the turn based slow paced strategy game, there is another mode called dynamic races , that is pretty much the same thing, but more fast paced and can be hard to hit the right button in the right time. There is probablly some people that may like this, but i personally don't so i won't spend too much time on this mode since i did not tested it alot...			",193,96,3,43,17,2,77

												That's a great mobile or office game, one of the very best of them, but sadly it totally lacks any endgame content or storyline, or characters so it's not the best choice for PC gaming, still I've had enough of fun with it to recommend it to every turn-based strategy fan at least to try it out. Good realistic AI & carrieges' physics model along with 10 second real-time turns with pauses between them make it an ultimate gambling entertainment where you can simultaneously identify thyself with a brave rider, wealthy horse owner & an affectionate rooter. The gameplay is simple yet effective. You get gear: horses (speed & endurance), carriage (acceleration & endurance) & rider (turning skill & endurance), when they lose health their quality lowers so you want to get leading the race without losing too much of those resources. Every 10 seconds you have to make one decision - speed up or down, change lanes (1, 2 or 3 to each side), bash or whiplash rival moving at your side. You also get a random condition either good or bad which significantly changes your strategy. You can also bet on yourself. The whole point is to make money & become a prominent stabling. The Mediterranean region with lots of towns is at your service, every town has it's own hippodrome, their configurations & sizes are different, so you have to change your habits. When you become a champion at smaller arenas you can go to Rome, Constantinople or Alexandria to compete with the best & earn even more money - that's all, no logical game ending here. Still if you are fond of things like 'King of Dragon Pass' where your decisions are regularly put to the test of random outcomes & you can follow the mechanics of your triumphs & catastrophies in detail - you should by all means try out this small game with perfectly balanced risk-reward gameplay!

Posted: July 22, 2016
TL;DR SUMMARYOne of the most enjoyable strategy race games in many years. The worst part is the non-sensical pricing strategy of the publisher ($19.99 on PC, $9.99 on Android, $4.99 on iOS - all for the same game). Put it on your wishlist and wait for the price to hit $9.99 or less on Steam. Most negatives about this game center on the price, not the game itself. This is mispriced gem.DETAILED REVIEWThis game was so enjoyable, I spent dozens of hours experimenting with factions, upgrading my drivers, chariots, and horses, developing racing strategies and collecting game data about different cities, just so I could successfully manage teams to the Circus Maximus at Rome.The game is deceptively simple - each ""turn"" of play you pick one order for your driver. The trick is dealing with the other drivers while positioning your team for the next corner. Drive too close inside, especially with an inexperienced driver, and you might suffer a costly crash. Horses, chariots and even your driver can suffer damage. Flipped or wrecked chariots result in the driver being dragged by the horses until he escapes, crosses the finish line, or dies.Each individual race takes 5 to 10 minutes to play. However, it takes multiple races to get the ""feel"" of the hidden variables and probabilities, so you can race intelligently and make money - instead of losing your toga (like I did the first few times). But the real game starts when you play the campaign.The campaign starts in your choice of a (probably distant) Imperial province, in a small city, with a few drivers, horse sets and chariots. It's your job to make enough money racing that you can cover the inevitable damage costs, upgrade your team and build your fame. With fame comes access to higher status cities with better rewards and better equipment. Eventually you'll want to travel to new provinces with more cities, on your way to the ultimate racing venue: the Circus Maximus in Rome.The game's user interface and graphics are indie in spirit. The track and chariots are in top-down view. Gentle tints on the driver, chariot (wheels) and horses show exhaustion and/or damage. Despite this, the game oozes atmosphere, from the type fronts, to the crisp clear icons, to the blood smear on the sandy-tan track marking the death of a charioteer. Everything about the game reminds you of Imperial Rome.From a game design standpoint, the inner workings are excellently balanced. Chances of damage or disaster change with multiple variable. Even a risk-averse manager will find rare, random event can set back the best laid plans, or provide an unexpected success. Incautious, wild racers are heavily punished - you cannot rely on ""good luck"" or constant aggression to win this game. The AI drivers are intelligent, and occasionally unpredictable. If they have no hope of winning themselves, they may even block your chances out of pure malice or spite! The temptation to bash them off the track is strong, even though it won't profit you.This game reminds me of chariot race boardgames from 30 to 40 years ago. However, Qvadriga is vastlymore playable than those clunky endeavors. Those old boardgames had fewer variables, took 1-3 hours per race to play, and had no AI players! Besides, Qvadriga's campaign game is infinitely more interesting and playable than anything available in those old boardgames.Yes, it would be nice if the game had beautifully animated isometric or 3D racing graphics. We all dream about drivers that animate appropriately in response to your orders, or when victims of attacks, not to mention chariot wheels coming off, chariots flipping, horses dying in collisions, and chariots bouncing over the wreckage of other chariots and dead horses, plus drivers being dragged or running away, sometimes to a gruesome death. However, the chances of that game being made is infinitely small, given the current state of strategy games, publisher investment resources, and the technical limitations of building games for mobile as well as the PC. Yes, it would also be nice if the game allowed for human opponents. But do I want to wait hours until another human player is available? Am I expected to run a private serve? Do I expect the poor, cash-strapped developer (or publisher) to maintain a multi-player server for me and the nineteen other English speakers in the world who just might want to play each other? Do I expect an online chat system as well? For a niche game like this, it is quite understandable that we're limited to offline play only.The only REAL fault with this game is publisher's (Slitherine's) inane pricing strategy. Today (July 21, 2016), the very same game costs $19.99 for the PC (on Steam), $9.99 for Android (at the Google Play Store), and $4.99 for iOS (in the iTunes store). Yes, the game is priced lowest on the platform that has the richest customer base! If I were the developer, I'd be outraged by this inconsistent pricing. As other reviewers have noted, the $19.99 price needlessly discourages PC purchases. Personally, I believe the publisher has simly lost track of any rational pricing strategy for this two-year-old title.  It's really a shame. This is a timeless, great, little racing game. Put it on your wishlist and wait for $9.99 or less.			",38,11,1,24,22,0,33

												Such a simple and fun game.  I like to play this in a side screen while doing something else. The mechanics are exceptionally simple and surpassing the AI is not that hard with a little patience.  Once you learn the ropes (curves, the commands, what upgrades to what in game), then the game becomes one of patience as you grind your teams.Really simple... I paid only a few bucks.  Easily worth $5 on special.  Not worth the list price of $20.If you like simple games like Desktop Dungeons (although that is more puzzle solver than this), or enjoy grinding skills and a simple structured game, then this is worth a try/buy.If you want complexity or really nice graphics, move along.

												OK, first, I have a lot more hours on this game, but they were in the non-Steam version as originally published by Matrix Games. As related in other reviews, this is a turn-based (with optional real time) top down chariot racing simulator. Conceptually it goes back to a board game origin, but it has been quite successfully brought to the PC. The rules aren't too complex, but there is strategy in the development of the drivers, the horses and the chariot. And there is likewise a lot of tactical decision making during a race. The inclusion of random events keeps the game from getting stale. There is also a business aspect in that doing well in races (and making smart bets!) will give you more money which allows for chariot upgrades, better horses and more qualified drivers. Also money is needed to care for injured horses and drivers and repair damaged chariots. One of the great aspects of the game is that it can be played in small blocks of time, a race not taking more than ten minutes at a time. So you can do a race or two, or really dive into the campaign mode if desired. Post if you have questions!			",92,12,37,10,55,1,38

												I'm not sure where the video attached to the store page comes from, but that makes it seem like the game has way better presentation than it actually does.  However, the game itself is fun for both turn based strategy fans and fans of sports games.  The game is slow, but that's because it's turn based.  The subject matter makes a turn based approach believable.  There are also RPG elements, although simple, that gives the player a sense of progression throughout the game.  And while it's not terribly hard to beat, winning the Circus Maximus three times feels like a tremendous accomplishment.Don't be overly aggressive.  I think the AI is overly aggressive, so being more conservative is a pretty good strategy.  Prioritize your speed around the track (take turns as close to the middle as possible) before attacking other racers.  Whipping your horses will wear them out quickly and you may regret doing it at the end of the race.  Finally, learn to block.  Blocking is easy to do, but difficult to master.  The AI is really good at blocking which explains several of my second  and third place finishes.  Grumble.			",64,23,2,19,36,7,35

												This game is excellent! Playing a campaign with dynamic turns is nail bitingly tense, provides tons of depth and interesting trade offs, and is very satisfying.Dont play with static unless you are learning the mechanics, without a time incentive and the ability to monitor the situation and reapond to new threats the static turns are just inferior.

												It's probably overpriced at full price, but it's an addictive game. The graphis are super simplistic, but there is a lot of thinking that goes into winning at the turn-based races, and a variety of ways to build your chariot teams, allowing you to approach races in different ways. Overall a good game.			",84,28,1,46,35,0,36

												So, let's get the bad stuff out of the way:  This acts like a converted boardgame.  The graphics are from the 90s if not late 80s.  The game will not hold your hand - if you act stupidly, the game has no issue with punishing you.That said, this is the best racing game I've played in a very long time.In Qvadriga you control a team of charioteers (aurigas).  You're responsible for selecting them, buying and upgrading horses and chariots, and paying for medical care/repairs when things don't go well.  Your sponsor will give you certain advantages:  Perhaps your aurigas are tougher than average, or your horses faster.Once you've taken care of maintenance and the like, it's time to race.  Simply put it's three times (usually) around an oval track, with rewards for finishing first, second, third, or even simply finishing.The commands are intuitive enough once you've played a few games:  You can accelerate by shaking the reins, whip the horses (which might hurt them and lower their overall speed), pull back on the reins, change lanes, whip to the left or right to try and injure enemy drivers and horses, or ram your cart left and right for the same reason.  Action by default is turn based.  There is an option where the turns run together, simulating an RTS, but I feel it's not worth it.Since the commands are simple enough you can focus on strategy.  Whipping the horses is a great way to surge past the enemy ... but if you hurt them too badly it'll hurt their base speed and you'll be paying for a vet later.  Sometimes beating the crap out of your enemy is the answer, but that tends to slow you down.  Do you take the turns at full speed and hope you don't crack a wheel?  Or do you focus on stabilizing your chariot or even slowing down to make sure everything you make it?  Having your chariot shatter under you and being dragged is no fun.   Letting go of the reins and getting run over by an opponent is even worse.Strategies are affected by random events.  For example in a recent race my auriga was so mad at the world 'he' decided that accelerating by shaking the reins wasn't an open, and if I wanted to win I'd have to rely on the whip much more than I like.  In another event drunken spectators thought throwing trash on the outer lane of the track was great fun and several drivers got hit in the head.Don't let the graphics scare you off.  This is an intuitive racing game with good strategic potential.  Enjoy!			",88,39,2,37,40,7,30

												The genre of ""turn based chariot racing game"" should however have been my first hint of how this was going to go.The truth is that neither the management side of the game, nor the actual racing is that great.On the management side of the game there is no training. You effectively just need to pay for repairs as appropriate and select the squad that has the highest health. There is nothing on this side of the game that is even noteworth. Every skill is reduced to a three point scale, where you either have zero, one or two of each stat. With the racer, chariot and horses each having some skills.Because there is no variance in the types of races there is no question between whether you put in the horses with higher endurance or not. You race your healthiest and highest scoring squad every single time, no question.Also, the time played on this game is screwed up because there's a start menu that counts as the game. So that was open after I stopped playing and added way a good amount of time to my playtime.So the game doesn't offer much on this side of the game, what does it offer in terms of racing?Unfortunately there isn't much here either.Each turn you choose between accelerating, whipping (""advance acceleration""), lane changes, stability for turning corners or some form of attack on your opposition.That doesn't sound like an issue until you start to see how much of a grind that actually is. There is always a clear best decision, I think the only time there's debate of which decision is best is when choosing which attack. Unfortunately the attacks are too strong. One bad attack against you and you've almost certainly lost the race and might as well give up.I don't know what you should pay for this game. But I'd certainly be waiting for at least 70% off.

												What a fun and addicting game. This is by far my favorite guilty pleassure game. It is very challenging with a smatter of luck involved. It can be frustrating but for the most part the frustration is do to my own aggressivness and stupidity. Nothing worse than seeing my favorite jock, ""Crapus Irregulus"" Die a bloody death because I tried to take a turn too fast. Or my up and comer ""Redd Doggybone"" be whiped to death because I failed to put the defensive posture on because I forgot or thought the other jock wouldn't whip me to death.I love the strategy of should I take a chance and go fast arond the curve or swing wide and avoid all the traffic. Whip them early and often and hope to hold on or save your horses stamina for the end. Whip them to go faster and hope the dam jock in front of me to the left dosn't decided to cut me off or change lanes to get away from hims so I can whip them next turn.Great game!

												Slitherine has a reputation for overpricing their games, and not all their games are good. But when they DO make a good game, well, bite my nuts and call me Skippy. Yes, it IS overpriced, but look beyond that and you'll find Qvadriga to be one hell of a game.			",618,144,25,79,84,5,130

												Good idea and well researched with pretty good mechanics. That being said, the content, variety, UI, polish are totally at odds with the ridiculous price. ATM it's $22 and that's nearly criminal as it should be around the $5 mark. So while I would normally recommend this for its unique and interesting take on a rarely covered genre, I can't at its current price.			",282,66,12,59,85,6,121

												Qvadriga is a brilliantly unique game where you manage a chariot racing team in Rome. The best part of the game is the uniqueness, as no one has really tried this before. The gameplay is great as it is hard but rewarding. You can whip other chariot racers next to you, as well as crash into them, but the same thing can happen to you. The only thing I don't like is that towards the end of races when you have the lead it can get boring. Otherwise its a great game, 9/10 excels in originality and rewarding gameplay. Also multiplayer would be cool but we aren't getting that rip.			",166,17,6,11,22,3,41

												I would say that people who like slow simulation games (like I do) will like this game... but not for $20.  There is VERY limited content and the gameplay is lacking in flavor or complexity.  If it's $5 and you like this type of game, then it's a good deal, but for $20 there just isn't enough to it to be worth the price.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Got it in a Humble Bundle for $1 with 4 other games, very good deal.I can certainly understand the complaint about the price, it is VERY expensive and would barely be reasonable at $9.99,but after you whip another racer till he explodes in a shower of red and then whip his horses until one of those also explodes into a fountain of gore it's pretty damn satisfying.

												If you were a fan of Circus Maximus by Avalon Hill, this is the game you want.  Played in Dynamic mode, its plays like a real time chariot race, and it is brutal.  Very little quarter is given, and in the campaign game you will very soon develop a champion driver that lives on the edge of disaster each race.  When played on Epic mode, this is old school, with no saves, no going back for your body, no fluff.  Like in real life, your champion gets all your best gear to give him that edge, and in flash of hooves and blood, it could all be gone.  If you ever wanted to manage a team of chariots for a faction and race them with the final hope of getting them to Rome and the Maximus, this is the game for you.  The graphics aren't stunning.  The sounds are adequate, but nothing more.  This is a simulation and racing strategy game.  Crash your opponents?  Lash them with your whip into submission?  Go for speed and try to out run the mayhem?  It's up to you.  Well done Turnopia, I look forward to your next release.			",14,8,3,11,45,0,17

												First, I love ancient Rome and have studied it's history extensively, I even wrote a paper on the circus factions, so I bought this game the minute I saw it. I honestly really enjoyed it for a couple of hours and liked figuring everything out and getting better.But... then it was over and kind of quickly. There just isn't a lot here. Too little meat on the bone. I want to recommend this game, I really do, because I want to support any game about antiquity especially when it tries to be somewhat realistic. However, at twenty bucks, I just feel let down. There are good things here though, it's a really good idea and it's a lot of fun for the first couple of hours. I just really wish there was more to it to sink your teeth into. Especially the circus factions, which barely make any real difference. I hope to see maybe some DLC or something in the near future that will help me to change my mind.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An enjoyable and unexpected game. I really didn't think I'd play this as long as I did, but there's a fair amount of tactical depth within the seemingly dated graphics and interface. It's a blast racing against as many as 15 other opponents, and while I wish there was some more variation and customization options (late-game races consist of top-tier riders all with basically the same stats), it's fairly challenging experience and it's awesome trying to run a tight corner and watching your biggest rival flip his cart.I'd recommend playing the fluid-mode instead of turn-based- much more satisfying and challenging.

												I've put a few tens of hours in on this before I moved it to Steam, on both the pc version and the iPad.  This is one of my ""Game of the Year"" picks.Qvadriga is a single-player chariot racing set in the Roman Mediterranean. You choose one of seven factions to race for, and your ""stable"" is one of several your faction may operate in each city.  There are many cities to race in across the various provinces.  Each city offers it's own special bonus, like half-price drivers, or cheap chariot repair.Each city has it's own racing stadium, varying from 8 lanes wide to 4 lanes wide, and generally either an oval or a U shape. Your tactics have to change to reflect the number of teams racing and the width of the track - a six-team race on four lanes is very different from 8 teams on 6 lanes, and so forth.You can have up to four teams in your stable; you start with three.  Drivers, chariots and horses each have two skills to be gained, at up to two points for each skill.  For drivers, it's constitution and driving skill; for horses, speed and endurance; and for chariots, acceleration and durability.  So there are 9 combinations for each skill, and three sets of skills, for 729 different driver/horse/chariot combinations.Each race has a special condition, given before the start, which mixes things up.  You might have corrupt Praetors drinking up some of the prize money, or fog making everyone more cautious, or two teams fighting at the start line, or even a track littered with previous race debris for the crowd's amusement.  Add to that the various chariot/driver/horse combinations and the width of the track, and each race is different and unique.Your faction gives you a set of skills to begin with.  For example, the military faction favors skillful drivers and horses with good endurance, along with heavy chariots.  Other factions have different mixes.  This provides the initial differences between teams in a race.  You must learn to adapt to your equipment and drivers - is your team going to win based on fighting other teams, or getting ahead early and holding the lead, or coming from behind in the final lap?  And bear in mind, as your gear and horses and drivers change, your tactics will have to adapt as well.Once you are in a race, you have a number of actions you can take each turn.  You can slow or speed your horses, or really goose them by whipping.  You can change lanes (subject to someone being in the way, or your momentum in a turn) and you can crash into other teams or try to whip their driver.  Most actions, including cornering and even just driving, carry a risk of damage, which increases as you take damage through the race.  So you really have to consider every turn carefully; even if you are far in the lead coming into the last turn, one mistake can see you with a destroyed chariot being pulled along the track by your runaway horses.  Each race has it's tense moments and you can go from being on top to crashing out in an instant.Once the race is over, you get money if you finished; more if you placed in the top three, and then if you win, you can collect your private bet if you placed one.  Your teams will need repair, rest and healing, which cost money; this is why you start with three, to let them come back to full strength over several races.  Your drivers will be ranked by victories, and as your fame climbs, you'll gain access to other cities and regions, and can compete across the empire.  Eventually, the goal is to become the leader of your faction empire-wide, and in Epic game mode, to become the most successful rider in the empire.In short, this is a great racing game with a good deal of bloodshed and heartbreak, and more than a little historical accuracy.  It's well worth it if you like racing games and history at all.  There is nothing else like it out there.  Highly recommended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Terrible company , Wonderful game.  As with most of Slitherine's game, if you are a warmonger they are excellent for the most part. Some are overblown, intentionally tedious (to make the player and fanbois ""feel"" smarter and deeper than they actually are). Some are restrictive for the sake of, well, stuck up intellectuals who demand a certain formula tailored to their egos as opposed to their actual ""gamer prowess"" and above all SERIOUSLY overpriced in total. You can look for sales though on occasion or consult Robin Hood for further advice. The company's self aborption is only matched by the items listed above in relation to Slithrerine's ""Personality"" as a company making almost any pruchase , no matter how much you enjoy the game itself, come with a bitter aftertaste, and waiting for the ""10% off kings"" to go on a decent sale would leave you on your deathbed. BUT, all that being said. This game itself is a gem for sure, with almost no games of this nature out there it makes the choices...well...nil for the most part. The ""open world"" campaigns if you will/want to call them that, I prefer the term, ""Career mode"".., are excellent, leaving a great deal of room for immersion and personalization...certainly one of those little games you keep on your comp forever and come back to when you wish to get a little playtime in. Worth 20$...absolutely NOT, But then again, not a game in their library is wotth more than 40% of whatever price they ask considering assets vs price.If you can find it on sale though, it IS a very very good and fun game. You can grab it on Humble this week (12/20/2015) for 1$ in their weekly bundle....but again, I do love this little game I just have a dislike for Slitherine that matches their dislike for Steamers which their owner was none to shy about stating.
