+ Visually appealing with 4 unique environments with great use of lighting.+ Gameplay is solid. It is classic Chess with nice simple controls + Great for learning how to play Chess or improving your knowledge / skill. + A few other game modes such as chaos-mode and chess puzzles- There is no animation when moving pieces, so they instantly move across the board. This makes it a bit hard to see what the computer's last move was as it happens in an instant.~ I would have liked to have seen more environments			",2904,1026,99,265,347,21,392

												I did not want to review this. Not because there is anything wrong. It is because it is chess. I like chess. Lots of people like chess. It is not a game that can change drastically or dramatically. It is chess. As long as there is a board with the correct number of squares, the correct number of chess pieces and it all works... there is nothing else to do. I do recommend this to anyone who has not played chess as it will not let you move a piece into a place it cannot go. You can also click a button and learn the history of chess. The interface is easy to navigate. Bumblebee did a nice job at making sure this can be played by as many people as possible. This makes a great addition to the chess games you already have or the perfect chess game to learn how to play. Like math, chess is a universal language. This can help you speak that language fluently. On an important and slightly related sidenote: math and (some form of) chess would be some of the things we have in common with beings from other planets. I also recomend this to anyone who has a checkerboard because you are already half way there. You might as well see what else that thing can do.			",91,22,40,7,32,1,8

												Cute game with pretty graphics, but limited camera angles and limited difficulties make this not worth the money.   I found the that it does not live up to the hype, all flash, no substance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I play a lot of chess, there's something nice about the simplicity of 3D chess. The background noise has a pleasant calming effect that seems to boost your concentration, & the pieces & the backgrounds are easy on the eyes. I like that we are allowed to contribute our own puzzles, & the developers are quite friendly & seem genuinely interested in everyone's feedback. I own Fritz for fun, and I can't stand the headache it gives me from the myriad of meaningless features. 3D chess is basic & beautiful & it gets the job done.			",8,3,0,1,3,0,3

												I received this product for free for reviewing purposes. This has in no way altered or affected my review.TL;DR I wish there was an ""okay"" button, because that's what 3D Chess is. Just okay. It doesn't stand out or offer much in comparison to other chess games.As said, the visuals are great, but there's not much variety with only 4 environments. Each environment has no music, only a sound effect which loops (Volcano-bubbling lava, Ancient Rome?- fire crackling, and Graveyard-typical spooky sounds). I was expecting the game to have some great music, hence the trailer, but there's no music at all in the game. The sound effects are stock and get so repetitive that I end up just muting it. Gameplay is just like classic chess, and works well. You can play against the computer or another player on the same screen. Computer has 3 difficulties-easy, normal, and hard. There are also 2 other game modes- puzzles, which you have a limited amount of moves to complete 1 of 3 objectives (checking opponent's kind, avoiding check, and checkmating opponent's king), and chaos mode, where the computer plays randomly. Chaos mode is good for beginners to practice chess without repercussions.What really irks me though is no online compatibilty. You can't play against another person, unless they're in the same room, but in that case, you may as well just play with an actual chess set. Point being, there are other chess games on Steam that have more features and online gameplay. Only get this if you want to practice or play against the computer.			",61,87,0,23,9,0,7
