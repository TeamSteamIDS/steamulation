								Still no patchesUpdated first new patch Nov 1st 16:Devs took on board comments and now have included the 1, 2 and 3's.  The pitch is full size including the crease which is great.  Bat and ball connection feels spot on, no more silly edges going miles in the air and when you hit a six it feels like you've worked for it.I'll keep updating as the game progresses.  The only thing I'd add is cricket is sport only played by a handful of countries and I have no issues with the price point being a cricket fan, but I'm sure there would be more takers if discounted for a period of time who may not be famiar with cricket.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Good to see another dev supporting cricket in VR.  My first impressions are that there is good potential here for a fun cricket game with nice graphics. I've only got 40 minutes or so into it but a few things below which I hope the devs may implement:Pro's:Nice graphics for VR with stadiums addedNice front endAnimation of bowler are good (bodes well for fielders)Tracking of bat is good10 Overs is a workout - yet to complete ten thoughLeaderboardsSwing your head round after a six and you'll see Billy BowdenNegativePitch size is too small, it feels like it's 70% size but you can bat overly powerfulNo score for 1's, 2's or 3's (even if this was in place the field size is too small to get a run)Some edges go into space Too many balls down offsideWhen I played a block a few times it rocketed off for sixNot sure power of stroke affects the shot (as above)Minimal game modes but expected being EAFor the futureMaking a 4 or 6 more Pazzaz when you score rather than a font appearingAdd sounds for bat hitting floorFix the game so you can go back to the menu (I couldn't find menu or quit whilst in game)Show bowler speed and how far you have hit a sixI didn't feel any difference between medium and hard level while playingGive options for full size pitch and also the crease is too smallBe good to have different run up's of the bowlers (fast and leg spin the same)More variation and turn with spinShow replays of the ball that was just bowled as an optionMore umpire choicesMake it so the bat will break the wicket/stumpsAdjust height of wicketMix up fielder positions each over and hopefully their hit zone will go when the animations come inFinally: Make hard sim like, feels arcadeAll in all a good little game, especially if you like cricket.  I can only compare it to Just Bat as I don't have the King of Spin and this feels like it has more potential, but Just Bat at present feels more responsive to the shots in regards to what the outcome will be off the bat stroke.I'll update as it progresses.
