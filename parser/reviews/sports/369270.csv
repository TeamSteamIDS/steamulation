Early Access Review
Megatect is a very good looking sandbox building game with the 'fast-paced arena scene' in mind. Looking at its current state it's easy to say Minecraft + Quake. But being a creative game like this it's really up to you to decide what you make out of it.+ A few weapons to test out and possibly have your friend join to have a little frag fest in a custom made map+ The different themes for each map allows the creator to have a decent range of customizability (for now, very early in its current state, great potential)+ Art style is unique especially the 'grid' system+ Graphics are pretty solid+ You can use buttons & wires to make trap doors in a custom arena map that you can also make (I smell a Deathrun game type/map)I'm very happy to help support this game and its developer. I see a lot of potential for a game like this. Being made by only 1 person it may take a bit of time, but regardless of how long development takes, at this games current state it's definitely playable & enjoyable. Also the price tag is great as well. :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
