								Another mobile game on steam!  How do companies think they can get away with it? Because a sucker is born everyday.  This is just another pay2win luck based game.In the first 5 minutes you can literally buy a character that will beat every free player in the game. Go #TeamPay!Each time they (mobile companies) release a cancerous ""luck based"" or ""wait for a timer""  game they somehow manage to wipe peoples minds of their past actions. In just a few months another will come out. How will we stop it? We can't. We can use steams review system as a weapon. Download this game, let it idle for 5 minutes, and then give it a thumbs down.Have you been in the Android or iPhone markets? All those games are just itching to take over steam and make steam a filth pool. For whatever reason, people buy them and expect different. A sucker is born everyday, such a true statement. The developers that make games like this are scum, they are directly responsible for the slow downfall of gaming. I would go on more but my ""luck"" ran out and my game crashed before I could pay money to beat everyone that did not pay money...fair!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
