												Imagine a gorgeous, detailed graphical story. A story of goblins, dragons, wonderful lands and gorgeous colour. Imagine a story made of heroes undertaking an epic quest to protect the kingdom from a terrible menace and journeying far and wide. Now imagine that story being brought to life, animated, and you being in control of the heroes. That's Trine 2.The artwork is jaw dropping, not because of technical wizardry or the number of polygons it pushes on screen, this isn't a game that will murder your graphics card, but instead the artistry comes from attention to detail. The watercolour feel of the skies, the glorious use of colours and sweeping vistas to sell the graphical novel element, and the heroes and villains, brought to being in near hand drawn detail. Behind this rests a solid, if somewhat generic feeling soundtrack, but a narrator who really sells the atmosphere, combined with solid voice acting for each of the protagonists (and indeed, the antagonists), it helps immerse you in the game and the story as a whole.The mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine ""AH HA!"" moment. It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging. The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references. In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately.Do please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention.			",1647,571,92,264,280,18,321

												This game is completely different from all other 2d games... It's like you put your headphones on, ignore everything around you and you're in a new, amazing world, full of things to discover with a facinating nature. The best part about the game is the enviroment, its beyond all other games. The details and animations are awesome. It puts you in the mood for epic battles and doing puzzles like never before. The atmosphere is a drug itself. Does have funny achievments actually worth to spend time getting, they're both fun and challenging. You can upgrade your heroes to do even more neat stuff. Also got multiplayer, cooperactive mode so you can play it with your beloved friends. I must say that this game is catchy, not addictive in a bad way, but once you get the hand of it, you really wanna play it alot. BIG shoutout to the music, it fits the game perfectly. Worth the money NO doubt. I think this game is why god invented the word 'magic'. Do yourself a favour and buy it. Yes, right now.9.5/10 ",104,11,8,5,8,3,7

												The best thing that I like about this game, is its graphics.Every single level, character, enemies, background and platforms are well refined. Just look at the trailer and screenshots! It is exactly as pretty as the actual game itself.It is a puzzle platformer with a little bit of action in it. There are a lot of ways to tackle all the puzzles, and a lot of different approach to advance the levels.The story itself is quite interesting. The puzzles are interesting and not too overwhelming. The boss fights pose some challenge but not impossible if you get to know how to fight (or just checkpoint-abuse).The flexible difficulty settings make this game suitable for different type of player. After you defeat one playthru, you can replay all the stages from the start again with your already-unlocked skills to get past the stages in different way, and to collect the experience vials whereby you cannot collect in your first playthru.Multiplayer is best played with friends that has almost the same progress to avoid spoilers and trolling.The achievements added quite a bit of challenge and replayability if you're going for 100% completion.My score: 10/10			",1147,444,52,156,149,12,246

												This game is a proof that 2D gaming is not dead at all. The game is beatiful, the artwork the colors and design.The way you have to go is linear (to the right),  but to make it there you will find a lot of puzzles and obstacles. You control 3 characters, each one with different talents to learn, and abilities to use. you will need them 3 to get through the puzzles the game presents.The game is not short, it will take you a good time to get to the end. And even if you do, you will not have unlocked all your abilities. After you finish it you will most likely try to complete it on the hard difficulty, and get all the collectibles.After you find every single collectible item, you will be able to play the locked levels.The most fun I had with the game is playing with my brothers. The online play on this game is amazing, as you will find the three characters at the same time, interacting with each other.Pros: Beautiful game amazing graphics, tricky puzzles that don't get repetitive, as they are always different. Great online play. I recommend it, as it's a very enjoyable experience.Cons: Sometimes getting through the game to find collectibles can be a pain. The game is not perfect, there are ways to 'cheat' and skip puzzles, specially on multiplayer mode. Try not to find gameplay guides and videos, they will probably show you the wrong way.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Trine 2: Complete Story Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Platformer; Adventure; Puzzle; Coop; Beautiful Artwork   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 10-25 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWTrine 2 is the sequel to the instant classic that was the first.  And it successfully takes a big step forward from the first game in all the positive aspects.  However, not too much was changed, ensuring that the charm achieved in the first game is still prevalent. Like its forefather, Trine 2 is a light game that is easy to digest but offers gripping visuals, a mystical atmosphere, and enticing gameplay.  All of the features of the game are simple in design but intricate in execution.  The gameplay, aesthetics, and narrative all come together to create a whimsical and charming adventure.  I highly recommend this for all gamers to consider; and for fans of the genre it is a sure bet.Keeping in the tradition of the first game, the best aspects of Trine 2 are the stunning visuals and alluring atmospheric presentation of the setting. Each and every environment you explore is diverse, captivating, and charming. The ambiance really captures the mystical aura of the game perfectly. Trine 2 somehow even manages to feel even more mystical than the first, and also has one of the most immersive 2D environments in the realm of video games.The gameplay is light and quick to grasp. Anyone should be able to dive right in, regardless of ability level. But various difficulty levels and a “hardcore” mode ensure that skilled players can still find a challenge. And whether you are playing on “easy” or “hardcore,” the gameplay is entertaining. Trine 2 also offers a decent amount of increased depth to the character development aspects of the game compared to the first installment of the franchise. There are more abilities and items; and more varied strategies are needed to solve the puzzles.As a direct sequel, the whimsical narrative is continued from the first game and the endearing trio of characters return. Even though it is a direct sequel, though, the story is quite separated from the original. So it won’t be the end of the world if you haven’t played the first game; but you probably should because it is also fantastic.Also the option of playing in cooperative mode adds an additional layer of possibilities, as the unique gameplay of the Trine series is a joy to experience with friends.So like I did with the first game, I would say that Trine 2 is worthy of your consideration regardless of your standard preferences. Check it out.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! ",488,241,24,56,32,8,71

TRINE 2: COMPLETE STORYA majestic platform puzzle game with a dash of action.Rating 6/10It’s similar in many ways to the classic Shadow of the Beast series and The Lost Vikings. You take control of one of three heroes, a wizard, thief and knight, whilst being able to character swap at any time even mid jump.  It's this fluid change from styles in the middle of battle or solving a puzzle that adds another dimension to what could turn into fairly simplistic gameplay. There are times when it doesn't work such as having your thief or knight die and only being left with a wizard who is rather useless in a fight. However there are enough character reviving checkpoints that it doesn't become too much of an annoying handicap.Despite being a fairly traditional side scrolling platform game it's a truly beautifully made game, in artistic terms it's near perfect. It's this beauty coupled with the fun physics puzzles and quick action that keeps you playing as the plot is non-existent and the voice acting is weak.The DLC adds a few new environments such as dusty desert and the inside of a giant worm and whilst every bit as stunning as the main game by this stage Trine 2 has overstayed it's welcome and it's a fairly boring slog through the last seven extra levels. The DLC doesn't add any real new mechanics or gameplay, it’s just more of the same.So whilst trine 2 doesn't offer much in the way of innovative gameplay or a great story it's beauty has to be seen.

												Trine 2 is a wonderful physics-based platformer. The levels are all well-designed and afford just the right amount of leeway to let the player figure out creative solutions to obstacles. All three heroes that the player (or players - the game has online co-op that works great) controls have unique abilities that can be combined in clever ways to traverse the environments. Sometimes it feels like you can abuse the physics engine to bypass things, but I'm pretty sure most of it is intentional, as the inverse that is often present in physics-based platformers just isn't there: you'll never feel like you came up with a solution that should have worked but got cheated because the physics went wonky. It's just the right blend of physics sandbox and puzzle game.The only real issue is the combat. It's super simple, and so long as your warrior is alive, absolutely trivial. It's perhaps best to treat enemies as just another physics toy. Fighting them hand-to-hand quickly becomes dull, but you can pick up enemies as the wizard and see how they're affected by the environment. Thankfully, it's a small enough part of the game that I don't think anyone should be dissuaded by my complaints, especially since respawning at a checkpoint doesn't reset enemies, so you never ever have to go through a fight again.On the presentation side, Trine 2 is absolutely flawless. The supersaturated graphics are utterly gorgeous. Every single frame of this game would make an excellent wallpaper. It simply is that beautiful. The audio is perfect, with great music and excellent voice work. And the story is simple but very well written and charming. Everything comes together to look, feel, and sound like a fairy tale.

												Trine 2 is a beautiful game. The gameplay overall is decent. The problem is that the gameplay is too simple and too recognizable. Puzzles are basically you levitating stuff to get to shiny balls in the air and if you are aiming for a complete playthrough that is what you are going to be doing the majority of the time, and after a while it gets to be a chore. The combat and platforming works well enough but is hardly challenging and even boring at times. If you have played Trine 1, then there's nothing new in Trine 2 except the visually pleasing looks. If you expect a beautiful standard platformer you wont be disappointed.

												10 REASONS why you should buy this title:1. Easy to understand controls (recommended to play on X360 controller)2. Characters has unique personality (each class has its own ability)3. Simple Skill tree (upgrades are part of the game If you stuck and don't know what to do, you should start thinking about purchasing upgrades)4. Outstanding graphic (even though game is quite old It's still nice looking 2D platformer)5. Tons of fun (play with your friends to share better experience)6. The narrator voice fits in this game7. Long-but-interesting-story (there is FREE DLC INCLUDED!)8. Cooperation at finest (If Knight can't go up somewhere, call Wizard)9. Stuck? Reload last Checkpoint (If one of you will go further, you can either load last checkpoint or wait till it teleports you)10. They've announced Trine 3 (yay!)Not convinced? Well take a look at the gallery then.			",241,37,3,11,17,5,19

												What about Trine 2? The first had been great, the 2nd manages to be better in every aspect, the addition of the coop for example is a resource that matches perfectly with the game.The gameplay remains based on intelligent puzzles, but the coop gave another dynamic to the game, there was the addition of new skills to characters, as well as a greater number of enemies, a factor that was limited in the first. Graphically the game is amazing, the art work is one of the finest I've seen, the sound part is also amazing, soundtrack, effects, voice acting. The plot is simple but effective. The Goblin Menace DLC is a good extension to the game and a very good way to prolong the fun, features beautiful and varied scenarios, although it has some minor glitches, but doesn't affect the gameplay at all.I highly recommend it, especially in coop!9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												La version française de ce commentaire se trouve aprèsA great and very beautiful platform game: splendid graphic and animation, great music and the puzzle are could be quite challenging (not every time as some as easier than other). Also, you have some battle to go through (against goblins mostly and other kind of monster as well as boss). And to do all that you are in control of 3 different characters in 1: a mage, a thief and a warrior.Let me explain more exactly what is all about : in fact, you manage one character at the time but you always have the choice to change during the game as each one have his own strength and weakness. So to pass some of the puzzle you have to use one specific character... but you can make it more challenging and try to only use one character during the whole episode.The story itself is not the most original even if it is funny, but is quite interesting to follow and is well tell.I have not yet try the multiplayer part, but for what I have seen in some videos, you play with  one or two partners one of the hero and so you can help each other... well that could help to pass some puzzle faster and have great fun as well ;o)So to make it simple, is for me one of the best platform game of this year (2014)! I don't see the time going and have some difficulty to stop playing. Luckily, there are always a pause between the different chapter (and a quite funny one).-----------------------------Un très beau et excellent jeu de plateforme : graphismes et animations magnifiques, très belle musique et les casse-têtes peuvent être plutôt exigeant (pas tout le temps car certains sont plus faciles que d’autres). Aussi vous avez quelques combats à faire (contre des gobelins majoritairement et d’autres types de monstres ainsi que des boss). Et pour faire tout cela vous allez devoir contrôler 3 personnages différents en 1 : un mage, une voleuse et un guerrier.Laisser-moi vous expliquer exactement ce qu’il en est : en fait vous allez contrôler un personnage à la fois mais vous aurez toujours le choix de changer durant le jeu car chacun a ses forces et ses faiblesses. Donc pour passer certains casse-têtes vous devez utiliser un des héros… mais vous pouvez vous donner plus de défi en gardant le même personnage durant tout l’épisode.L’histoire en elle-même n’est pas la plus originale même si il y a pas mal d’humour elle reste intéressante à suivre et elle est bien contée.Je n’ai pas encore essayer la partie multijoueur, mais pour ce que j’en ai vu à travers plusieurs vidéos, vous jouer avec un ou deux autres joueurs un des héros et ainsi vous pouvez vous aider… en somme cela peut permettre de faire certains passages plus rapidement et pas mal s’amuser ;o)Donc pour faire simple, c’est pour moi un des meilleurs jeux de plateforme de cette année (2014) ! Je n’ai pas vu le temps passer et j’ai eu du mal à m’arrêter. Heureusement qu’il y a une pause entre les différents chapitres (et vraiment drôle avec ça).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not so fun as a single player, but still worth a buy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine 2 is easily one of the most beautiful games today. It is a really addictive game, with an innovative approach to the platformer genre.The main point that makes Trine 2 so enjoyable is that it requires thought to play: you have to solve puzzle after puzzle in each screen, and eventually fight some enemies and bosses. There are plenty of bosses.Another nice thing (for me, at least) about Trine 2 is that the difficult increases gradually, but the curve is not too steep: you get a chance to learn how things work in Trine 2's world, and how your powers work. Trine 2's characters are very well designed, and they complement each other nicely, leaving nothing to be desired. All in all, Trine 2 deserves one of those Oscars for games, if there were one.  The only downside I see in Trine 2 is that some of the Steam Achievements are nearly impossible to get, but that doesn't get in the way of the game at all.I highly recommend Trine 2.

												Okay... So that wasn't what I expected from this game since I have played the 1st Trine.Trine 2 is way more better than it predecessor (the childish Trine).This game is most enjoyable when playing with friends (I did play it with my friend till the end).I have finish all the standard levels + DLC levels and find this game quite challenging.There is a bug that make a level unpassable and I have stucked for 30 minutes trying to figure out what's wrong.Turned out you need to restart the level to progress.Despise that, this game is really worth the hassle. Try it out! ",2912,1178,88,323,376,34,380

												Platformers come in many shapes.Twitch-platformers and reflex-platfomers, which I can't stand, and puzzle, action, and physics platformers, which I enjoy.Trine 2 is an action-puzzle platformer, maintaining a good, steady progression flow [versus getting stuck trying to hit the same platform jump for 10 minutes, like some platformers], offering a good variety of physics, combat, and puzzle challenges.Few of these challenges will be overly demanding on you- combat especially isn't meant to hinder your progres as much as offer palate cleansing or distractions to puzzles,  But there's a lot of creativity and style in the game, and it ends up being enjoyable in the same way all the best classic [eg, nothing like Meat Boy] platformers are.PROS*Fun single-player with plenty of unlocks and secrets, that manages to keep you steadily 'just challenged enough' to make for a relaxing-yet-stimulating engagement.*Astoundingly good co-op. You thought single player was fun? Imagine being able to leverage your partner for crazy combos, reinterpret all the puzzles in new and delightfully clever ways, and, best of all? 'Accidentally' drop your partner into lava, drop a box on their head, or smash the platform they're floating on.Hey, it's what friends are for.*Co-op is easy to set up, has a decent selection of hosting options, and plays very smoothly.*Good variety of stagesStages range from small dungeon corridors, to open city or dungeon expanses, to vertical shafts, to underwater caverns, to skyscapes and more. I never found myself dissatisfied with stage progression.*Good variety of puzzles*Good variety of unlocks*Good, consistant blend of action, combat, puzzling, platforming.*Very stable (very few bugs and no major bugs)NEUTRAL*Each stage tends to emphasize the same enemies. Would have been nice if there was more variety and sub-bosses.*The expansion abilities offer tons of fun new dynamics- but can significantly reduce game difficulty.*While the stages and enemies have flair and creativity, there's no story whatsoever to speak of. Generally not something that platformer players really worry about but since this is also RPG, I'm going to make a note that's a tag based only in being able to find items to gear your characters up with, and being able to unlock/upgrade abilities.*Workshop support, but last time I checked, no legitimately decent offerings. The few that look good, tend to have a lot of bugs, like falling into or through terrain.*The characters are a bit dim. The humor here is definitely subjective, though thankfully, never offensive or intrusive [think mild 'you're so fat' and fart referencing humor].CONS*The expansion content feels like a clumsy afterthought. If you already own Trine 2, you really don't need to buy Complete Story unless you really want to play the main game again, and try the new expansion abilities in it.---This game is one of my absolute favorite co-op games, and if you're at all into co-op gaming, I can't recommend it enough.The most 'nasty' things are spike pits, carnivorous plants, skeletons, and goblins, so it should be playable with relatively young children, as the game doesn't include gore, frights, or offensive humor.4.5/5Bonus:If you like Trine 2, you may also want to give Ibb & Obb a look- it's a pure puzzle-physics platformer, so a different vibe, but it has good puzzling co-op (and is far more of a challenge for the brain than Trine 2). Do however note that there's a bug that, if not yet fixed, makes the last level unable to be completed for a small number of players.			",647,380,19,136,44,14,153

												Trine 2 is the definition of what a plaformer should be.  The graphics are top notch with great lighting.  The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls.  The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring.  Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful.  The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game.  The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles.  Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle.  The addition of the Goblin Menace, the Dwarven Carverns and now the Workshop has helped expand and continue the gameplay of this fabulous series.  The best part of this game is the multiplayer offering.  Now with online multiplayer, this game truly shines when playing with two or more players.The price for this game, when on sale is typically under $4 for the entire complete story.  Take advantage and don't miss this great game.  Bound to be a classic in gaming history.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												After the release of Trine 3 which is considered a mixed bag it is high time I reviewed the sequel which is better in every which way than its predecessor.The premise remains the same in the 2nd episode of Frozenbyte's amazing franchise: the mysterious object called Trine binds 3 heroes together who all have different abilities and gameplay style. In terms of story they have switched from skeletons to goblins. Not much of a change but you know it's all about saving the kingdom once more. We have the same 3 characters from the first episode and in terms of timeline we are a couple of years after the events of Trine 1.What shines in Trine 2 is its graphics. Not that the first one was ugly, quite the contrary! Still, they managed to make the game even more beautiful (the water effect is stunning). In fact, the first game was updated with the sequel's engine and it is now only available in Enhanced Edition version.Overall, the gameplay remains the same but they have tweaked it a bit here and there. For instance, the wizard cannot conjure floating triangles but can pick up monsters. The heroes all received some new abilities and each now seems to be more useful. And, of course, we have some puzzles that utilise physics and have to be solved accordingly.The longevity of the game has also increased. Levels are more complex and much bigger. There are tons of collectibles to find - poems in treasure chests and also paintings (no equipment, though). You'll probably not be able to collect them all in one go! And let us not forget about the achievements - there's now a threefold increase. I believe Trine 2 is an example as to how a sequel should be done. For fans of the first one it is a must and for those hating the 3rd (and preferably last) a revisit has been due for some time. The game also features proper multiplayer i.e. it is not LAN anymore.

Posted: December 4, 2013
												The indie games market became a very good alternative for the young game developers willing to step up in their careers. And I’m not only saying this because many of the games I am talking about are truly masterpieces of their genre from any point of view. On the contrary. Fun characters, divine graphics- the starting point for an impressive gameplay. Still, I never would have thought that a sequel was going to animate my screen and I couldn’t have been more wrong about it.  Trine 2 is here, I’ve played it and, since I’m a hard-working guy, here’s a very meticulous review.Same as the first game, the three heroes, The Wiseman, The Knight and The Thief…pardon me, I meant The “Inventive woman” are united by a magical artifact called The Trine, whose goal is to protect the land from a new threat. Therefore, the inevitable goblin infestation. So, the three characters are up for a new adventure which, unlike the first game, takes a little longer time to play.In a very bizarre way, Trine 2 makes me think of Terry Pratcher’s novels, maybe because of its strange atmosphere that I picked up by reading this author’s books. The Universe presented in this title is so subtle that you can only be overwhelmed with its complexity. Even if it is an Indie game that we are talking about, the narrative value can not be ignored since this time, the characters are better shaped by their developers, humanized I might say, from the voiceover’s point of view as well as from the action’s point of view. I will even go further and say that Trine 2 offers a very pleasant story for all ages, even if it’s a 12+ game, precisely because the narration has something to offer to everyone. Nostalgic to say at least! Still, there are some missing bricks to this wall. The key of this story is nice indeed, but the main problem is the poor narrative construction. I think everybody would have been happier if someone would have added some solid touches to this aspect. The motivations are clear, meaning that the land is full of goblins, but the story as a whole concept could have been more complex. Who knows, maybe Trine 3 will surprise me when the time comes. The three key-elements that a player must take into consideration when starting this game are : cooperation, cleverness and physics. These elements are as important as the three main characters. Even if, on a regular basis, Trine 2 is a platformer, these elements are very necessary while dealing with a certain level. At the beginning of the game, there is a tutorial to teach you what every character can do. The Wiseman, because he is your starting point, is not the every-day Gandalf that everyone got used to. He is more of a clumsy magician for he has no idea what a fire ball really is. Still, he has his own tips and tricks, he can make objects appear from nowhere, such as boxes, or even make them levitate to get to certain locations. The Knight, on the other hand, is the muscled genius among the three characters. Even if he’s not very bright, he’s compensating by his strength, also being the best choice when it comes to a one on one fight with your enemies. Equipped with a shield, a hammer and a sword, he’s the defensive one of the trio. Last but not least, The Thief. And no, you’re not going to break chains or sneak behind your enemies, because her abilities are more rogue-like. She has a hook to reach to certain points otherwise inaccessible and an elastic loop to fight at the distance. What’s truly interesting and new is the way you switch between these characters to complete a level. The puzzles are sometimes so twisted that they really work your cleverness off! But that doesn’t mean there’s only one way to deal with a puzzle. Frozenbyte finally made it with this platformer: the experience is multidimensional, despite of its puzzle-platformer prejudices. To solve a certain puzzle, the player has at least three ways, which is pretty unexpected among the game mechanics that other developers use.  The characters’ control is absolutely beautiful. After pressing a key or a button if you’re playing on a controller, the task is immediately registered by your game. This is one of the most satisfying platformers I’ve played since Sonic Generations. No platformer fanatic could ever find a misstep concerning this aspect. The game control is perfect, I would say.Trine 2 is not only made of twisted puzzles, but also of battle sequences and a handful of bosses every now and then. These fights are meant to break the monotony of a certain level, full of enigmas. Still, the gameplay is so rewarding that the player can use his characters’ abilities to knock down the enemies. And because something had to be done when it came to options, each hero has a set of five abilities that can be improved using the experience points you get. What I find extremely stressful is that some of the abilities you get using this tree are only necessary for a specific level. The player has to reassign some of his points in order to finish a portion of the puzzle. I must say that this procedure is free, so you don’t have to repeat anything to get more experience afterwards. One of the major gains of this game is the cooperative multi-player, online and local, a huge step from the previous game and probably one of the reasons for which we strongly recommend a bundle. Two more players can be added to one session, each one of them being able to control in an active way one of the three characters, which makes the puzzles a lot easier, as far as I’m concerned. That being said, I must admit that I found myself playing this game even for the third time, just because it’s fun to find new ways to complete a level: a very nice move coming from Frozenbyte, although Zon@ thinks they should have done this from the beginning. We are finally getting to graphics. Did I mention this is an Indie game that comes from a small studio where are working about 20 people? Well, Trine 2 is a masterpiece of beauty. Want to hear something more spectacular that this? The game engine has been totally reconstructed. The game not only that looks divine, but its physics is very accurate. From the well animated background to the small details , nothing has been left out. And everything is the work of a very small, but talented, team. I know it sounds like I’m trying to get under their skin, but I’m telling the truth. The animations, the flow, the light and all the other elements gave me the impression that I was watching a moving painting. The colours also made a huge impression on me, one I will not easily forget. The sound itself is quite an experience. Not only that the narrative part is well represented on script, but the voices and the entire performance of the characters are as authentic as they could be. It sounds just like a very posh movie. The soundtrack is exactly what the game needed to complete the atmosphere: the way it highlights the key points of the game makes your blood rush and your adrenaline keep pumping which turns the whole experience into a sound feast.  Is Trine 2 a good game? I’ve been praising it a lot so yes, it is! It’s one of those games you have to play in order to find out what a creative genius really means. If the first game managed to get my attention, Trine 2 has upgraded to a very high standard among platformers.  ",992,322,46,138,106,11,169

												This game is amazing... especially the online and local co-op puts it on a very high spot of my ranking list. That is before even considering the amazing gameplay, beautiful graphics and great music. A lot of details can be found on every screen of the game and the game really benefits from playing it with three players. This mix of platform, beat 'em up and puzzle elements just provides a lot of unique gaming moments and is highly recommended.

Amazing!Game has nice puzzles and it is the best when you play it with a friend or event two friends. But first, I would recommend the first Trine, due to the connected story.

												This is one of the most enjoyable cooperative platformers I've played.  It's perfect for having an easy-going expireance with any age group.  I played through the whole game with my little brother (15) and sister (10) and we all had a great time.The puzzels are varied - most of them aren't chalenging, but ocasionally some with requier a crazy act of skill too get past.  This slight chalenge really never got frustrating as much as it infused the game with a little excitement.  Almost everything about the game is fun.  Simply put.If you have 2 other people in your family who would enjoy a good time, get this game when it’s on sale (or a full price if you want).One technical note is that one of the characters is a lot easier to play with the keyboard and mouse – rather than a gamepad – so 1 person on the PC with 2 others on controllers is an ideal setup.

Trine 2: Complete StoryIf you liked the first, odds are you'll love the second. What did it for me was the visuals—they're even more breathtakingly enchanting than the first instalment of the series and that was enough to make me want to keep playing. The gameplay felt very similar to the original title, although that wasn't really an issue for me: not much of an attempt to improve, but then why try to fix what ain't broke. The story is the low point in my opinion, and felt like it was just there to feed lines to the characters and narrator—who are all still doing a great job.Pros:Visuals are even more detailed, gorgeous and immersive; Clever, slightly more challenging physics-based puzzles;Fantasy creatures on a larger scale;Build-up to boss fights increases anticipation;Gameplay adapts to your play-style;Casual base, yet deceptively intricate mechanics;Soundtrack and VO are true to the first instalment;Goblin Menace DLC adds a bit of much needed length;Co-op doubles the fun.Neutral:New upgrades are original and fun, but ultimately aren't enough to change/improve core gameplay in a significant way.Cons:Uninspired story and collectibles;Trine 3 advertisement each time you quit the game; ",382,83,22,62,14,2,56

IntroTrine 2 is a amazing looking game with great dialogue thoughout the game which are its best features. There are three characters to choose from and a ton of collectables in the game.Good Points The grathics look great with bright colours and amazing visuals, Each level looks diffrent from the last so you wont get bored of the looks. Controls for Thrine 2 are simple and easy to remember, if you dont like using a keybored and mouse then you can use a controller since it has full controller support. Trine 2 runs very well which means almost any computer will be able to run the game. If your still not sure then you can play the demo to make sure it runs alright. There is a bit of replay value, you can can play the game on hard mode or you can try and find all the secrets and get all of the   achievements which arnt so hard. The dialogue and Narrators are great and fit in with the game perfectly. Some times they can moke you laugh and sometime they make you think. There is a co-op option which is great fun with a freind which makes the experience even better. I would recommend you play Trine 2 with a freind. Being able to choose from three diffrent characters is a great idea becasue you wont get bored of the gameplay since you can just swich to a diffrent character. Its very useful to solve puzzles.Bad Points The storyline is... Rubbish. Its a simple ""kill the bad guys to save the world from evil"" style which has been done so many times and they done nothing to spice it up. You end up not giving a damm half way though the game. I find the game to be easy, really easy. There are puzzles in every level but you end up solving them in seconds. The enemies are the same from biggining to end and since you level up, it becomes easy. The game time is short. You can complete it in about 5 hours if you dont collect or find secrets. If you want to find the secrets and take things slowly then it will take about 7 to 8 hours.OverallOverall I think Trine 2 is a good game which is fun to play with freinds. But its easy to move on to diffrent games. You will most likely end up forgetting about it once you have finished the game. I would recomment Trine 2 if you want to play it with a freind and if you like good looking games. I rate Trine 2 7 out of 10. ",116,9,1,8,13,0,3

												I've had so much fun playing this with my friend! We set limits on what we could and couldn't do  (almost never used the wizard) and it was incredibly engaging. I'll be so sad when it's done. 10/10 would play anything these people made again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For someone who's not played Trine 1, this game has been a joy to experience. The story is easy to catch on to, even if you like me haven't experienced the prior game. The characters are different and likeable, and the whole game has so much charm to it! The game looks and plays beatiful(ly). Solving puzzles and platforming in stunning environments is a lot of fun, and Ari Pukkinen's soundtrack really adds to the experience. The only slightly negative thing I have to say, is that while the story is pretty good, it sometimes feels a little bit too slow. Some levels are a bit long without any proper story progression in them, and I wish that there would have been a bit more funny dialogue in levels like this. This is hardly the game's fault though, probably just my impatience..All in all Trine 2 is a really good game, and I reccomend it to all people who like platformers mixed with puzzles! :)			",50,2,0,4,2,0,1

												A rare beast:  A game which works equally well in both single AND multi-player modes!  Indeed, the very nature of the puzzle-solving changes quite dramatically depending on which way it's played, as many puzzles have multiple solutions, and some of these solutions require more than one character to implement them.  An almost perfectly-designed game in every regard, with sumptuous graphics and charming characters and oodles of imagination and, oh my Lord, a STORY!!!  It's all impressive enough to even bypass the prejudice I generally harbour these days towards ""lighter"" fantasy fare, no small feat, I can tell you.   Guess I should play the first one some time...Verdict: 9/10.			",745,418,6,57,40,5,78

												The short length of the campaign and a few overly challenging puzzles are minor blemishes in an overall entertaining and worthwhile experience. Fans of the side-scrolling and platform genres need not look elsewhere, Trine 2 offers a wealth of truly innovative puzzles that are a welcome getaway from the current market of repeated genre titles.

The levels are well paced and the gameplay is challenging without being infuriatingly difficult. The game is presented almost like a fairytale.

Haven't played the single player yet, but am hoping to complete Trine 2 in the future with friends.Here's some highlights from an earlier playthrough we did:

												Trine 2 is the same as Trine (1) and keeps the story of our three heroes on. You (as the player) can switch ingame between the wizard, the knight and the thief. All three got their own specialties and you switch characters on spot (so one disappears from screen and is replaced by the other).I think that the big success of the game is exactly that thing. In an RPG you would have to choose your character/avatar before you even start playing, but here you can create a box with the wizard, climb with the thief and fight the enemy on top of the tower with the knight. I gotta say that it isn't addictive, but it is fun.So if you hate playing RPG's because you always regret which class you picket in the very end, than this is an nice adventure you will like. It doesn't last that long, comes at a fair price and is enjoyable.8/10 Okay wizard! You do the ramp in front! Thief, you jump over it and in midair I will crush-land on the enemys skull!

												Frozenbyte continues the legacy of the original Trine in this worthwhile sequel as the game features many of the same trademarks that made the first so successful. Trine 2 plots a new story and setting that takes full advantage of the developer's creative prowess. This action/adventure platformer maintains its unique perspective on the classic genre and revitalizes to modern standards. Any casual gamer armed with a good controller will find themselves lost in world of Trine given its clever structure, voice-acting and detailed fantasy world. It should be noted that Trine 2 features a downloadable content pack called ""Trine 2: Goblin Menace"" that is played as a separate campaign.The Goblin Menace downloadable content (DLC) is a worthwhile expansion for Trine 2 that unveils a variety of new settings with increasing difficulty. The story is rather simple, but stems directly from the sequel so the plot seems like a true continuation of the original game. Fans of the Trine series owe it to themselves to purchase and play through the Goblin Menace!			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												As soon as you hear the opening music you just know this is going to be an enchanting  game, and Trine doesn't disappoint! Beautiful, bright, and simple fun. Yes, it’s all very straightforward, but just so very well done.  Steps from one beautifully drawn scene to the next, using the various talents of the main characters to solve the puzzles along the way.  You can switch characters and that means that there is never a shortage of ways to solve a particular puzzle even if you are playing solo. Best, of course, as a team game, but however you play it, it’s just lovely. Buy it! You won't regret it, I promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An immensely beautiful game, this has to be the best side scrolling puzzle game I have ever played. I started this game with a couple of friends and I was quite surprised as to how amazing this game looks. It really is mesmerising, there is quite a few different settings you explore in this game. Be that snow, forest, cave, castle, desert or whatever else, they are all done so well and just look amazing.The characters are pretty distinctive from one another and the story is narrated like a fairy tale, which gives the game more of a fantasy feel to it.The puzzles are interesting and require team work to get through successfully, which makes the game a lot of fun. There’s enemies to kill and bosses to defeat, working together to defeat all evil and save the day!From what I did hear (which wasn’t much because of the nutters I played with) the storyline seemed pretty decent, and soon after we completed it they brought out DLC as well. Which I haven’t yet completed, but looks just as fun.This is a great indie game franchise and I think everyone should give it a go.			",421,281,31,20,33,5,36

												I finished the ""Complete Story"" version of Trine2, which is an extended version of the regular Trine2. The extra content (""Gobling Menace DLC"") is almost of the same size as the original, and it's equally nice, maybe even prettier! It took me about 13hrs to beat the whole game, and it wasn't particularly difficult, especially when you get the hang of it.GameplayIt's essentially a puzzle platform game, with a bit of action (battles) at some points. You have three characters (fighter, mage & rogue archetypes) that you switch to any time during play; each character has unique abilities that will help you get through the various puzzles you come across. Each level of the game (there are about 20 levels for the ""Complete Story"") has about 10-15 puzzles to complete, with save/checkpoints every one or two. Most puzzles are typically ""get to the right of the screen"" type, over chasms or mechanisms or beating foes, and can usually be solved in a multitude of different ways. The puzzles weren't too challenging, and some of them might be a little repetitive, i.e. you could easily go through them using ""standard"" techniques. There's also hints to get you going, if you're stuck on a puzzle for too long. I played with WASD keys + mouse, and there are also some more keyboard shortcuts; controls were quite simple to learn & master and I encountered no problem. No glitches or weird bugs fell to my attention, and the physics engine of the game was quite robust.Theme/Graphics/SoundThe story is all set in a fairy-tale world, which some might find a bit ""underaged"" (as if it's meant for children, i.e. far from ""mature""), but I didn't mind that so much. The graphics are ASTOUNDING, computer-made but beautiful, and fleshed in 3D even if the game is essentially 2D. Lighting and other visual effects are particularly well done and there's some pretty animations at the end of each level. There's a great variety of ""worlds"" you're going to have to go through: from dark dungeons to ice-caverns, to jungles, to deserts, to floating-islands, even to the belly of a giant beast! Each is rendered in a very pretty and unique style. The three heroes (along with the narrator and some other characters) are very well voiced, all along the story and at each level. The music is nice too, although I can't state anything special about it.My OpinionRecommended, if you like puzzle-platform games that aren't too difficulty. The graphics are also a BIG plus to this game. You might wanna pass this, if you don't like fairy-tale settings or puzzles :)			",43,33,0,13,8,0,13

												A pretty good platform game with decent co-op. These games are well-known for their graphic design. It looks really good. The story is alright too, if not a bit thin and a little short. There's a certain dose of humor in there, though, which is good. A few annoyances with the physics and manipulation of objects, in particular when playing with someone else. A small dose is just funny, but at times it becomes a bit too much, I feel. There are plenty of ""hidden"" stuff to find, which I really appriciate. Some are very hard to reach. I experienced a few connection hiccups when playing co-op, but the cause might have nothing to do with the actual game.The game certainly deserves a recommendation from me.			",254,50,2,25,15,2,21

												""Beauty is power; a smile is its sword.""Trine 2 represents a 2-D jump & run adventure game with impressive artwork, beautiful design and sophisticated puzzles. As already introduced in the original Trine you can switch on the fly between three different characters, a knight, thief and wizard (still no fireballs). It is also the basis for the great puzzle system this game offers, and the multitude of possibilities to solve each one of them.The balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.The DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.Overall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.Fun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms.--My rating system consists of five categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere -	Details-	Puzzles-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: A-RankDetails: S-Rank(It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.)Puzzles: S-Rank(To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often.)Story: B-RankCombat & Controls: A-Rank [with a gamepad]--To conquer all achievements of Trine 2, you will most likely spend around 40 hours.

The game is actually relaxing, because it's like you're being read a fairy tale but you're also getting to play a very well executed platformer style game. Most games get me hyped up and my adrenaline flowing (or bore me so bad I stop playing them), this game was actually soothing, which I have never been able to say about a game before.

												First thing I noticed was that this game has very beautiful graphics. It is a 2D platformer, but it looks so dynamic and magical. I enjoyed a big part of the game almost only because of the graphics. It enhanced it, let's put it that way.The gameplay is good as well. There is some action and you have to solve some puzzles to get further in the level. The combat is simple, and not overwhelming. Some puzzles are simple, others are quite difficult to solve. The co-op mode is good as well. You play basicly the same levels, but now with two characters. I doesn't make it easier at some points, because you really need to help each other. So it makes it really interactive.The story is nice as well. The characters are good, they are well involved in the story, not just observing people who don't interact at all. Really, I don't have anything negative to tell about Trine 2. I just love this game, it is fun to solo, and fun to play with a friend. I would recommend it to everyone. It is on sale quite often, so you can save a lot of money on that.My rating for this game: 8/10			",120,71,1,58,31,0,22

												26-Aug-2016 : Finished main story + extrasSetup : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80-2QE Notebook, Logitech F710 GamepadREVIEW :I have mixed feeling about this game. I love the first one, but this one... it's like the developer hates the players and just want to make our gameplay miserable. The thing that I hate most about Trine 2 level design are ""slippery when wet"". This slippery floor make it impossible to backtrack to get missed collectibles, you either have to restart from checkpoint or restart the level entirely (if you're playing hardcore mode). The collectibles are a lot more than the 1st game and some of them are in really hidden and challenging position, but the not so fluid control make it really frustrating to get them.Other than that, like the 1st game, it has beautiful graphics and music. The story is mediocre, more like children story. Since it has multiplayer up to 3 players, I guess it's a good family game to play with your siblings or children (if you're a parent). CONCLUSION :Recommended on sale price.			",120,7,2,11,0,0,2

												There's something special about the Trine games. They combine the best parts of artistic design and exploration for the sake of beauty with a thinking mans puzzle mechanics which can be combined and utilised in interesting and unexpected ways. Along with fantastic extras like co-op, challenges and the likes (all of which are actually worth trying out and fun in their own rights) this is one of the games I've loved from the moment I first picked up.As for the rest of the series, Trine 1 holds a special place in my heart because I picked it up first and because it set the bar so high, but Trine 2 raises the bar and takes nothing away- it's prettier, it has more content, it's more responsive and technically improved and it's just an all round improvement, and then Trine 3, while I appreciate it a lot more than most despite its failings is still the lesser of the three.Picking up the whole series is absolutely my recommendation, but if you only have time for one, Trine 2 is my suggestion.

												Beautiful 2D action and platforming game with some very interesting puzzles, most based on the game's unique physics. Some times it feels like the game was made for co-op though and can get very frustrating. Overall, however, it was a very fun game.			",156,15,2,9,4,1,15

												If somebody told me six months ago that I'd ever play a game as beautiful as Trine, I would have scoffed, and yet here I am, playing its sequel - a game that takes its astoundingly high production values and raises the bar to unimaginable new heights.So, for anybody who is unaware, Trine 2 is the sequel to Finnish developer Frozenbyte's 2009 side-scrolling fantasy puzzle platformer, which refines and continues to build what I suppose I should be calling the ""Trine franchise"". All the majesty of Trine is present, though there are a few changes that are definitely worth giving attention to.Read my full review (with screenshots) here: http://cheesetalks.twolofbees.com/trine2.php ",315,129,2,23,29,5,58

												Second Trine was my first Trine that I've experienced. What can I say? After that I bought Trine 1 and 3. It's a great and pretty long game. The colors in the game are just amazing, they make your mood bright and energetic. It's something indescribable, you just have to try it. It worth the money!+ The look is awesome+ The story line is interesting+ You'd need many hours to complete it- Even though it supports controllers, playing with them isn't so comfortable as with keyb+mouse- I encountered a bug which made me restart the level (I turned a mirror on wheels upside down and wasn't able to fix it)			",45,35,2,0,2,0,2

												I have to say that I was much more happy with this game than the first one, and that is simply because I was able to play online co-op with a friend. The whole premise isn't necessarily original, but the levels you go through are pretty interesting, and it is so enjoyable to plan things out with a friend as you are playing along, accomplishing the puzzles.Some of them took us a good while to accomplish - some because they were actually hard, and some because we simply missed something and would feel stupid afterwards. But that's why I liked this game so much more than the first, because I had a friend to talk to that gave a different perspective. Neither of us one-sided the game, meaning that both of us were able to give our perspectives on what we were supposed to do - it wasn't like one of us had all of the answers.Further, both of us easily assigned ourselves roles: I was the thief, and my friend was the wizard (sorry, knight, you're not exactly that useful unless you're absolutely needed!) and we got through the game in one sitting. Playing the first game got sad because things are much more annoying to accomplish on your own in the puzzles, and I simply don't think it's as fun.So would I recommend the game? Yes. Great graphics, some nice humor to the premise, nice little puzzles and levels. But definitely make sure you have somebody to play it with!			",159,61,0,14,6,1,6

												Trine 2 is a very fun and challenging little game that features both singleplayer and coop! I find the game to be much more enjoyable to play with two friends, but it's completely fine to play it by yourself too.In Trine 2 there is three characters availible to play as, Pontius the Knight, Amadeus the Wizard and Zoya the Thief. Every character has its own attributes that is needed to complete the puzzles and continue through the levels. In singleplayer mode you can switch between all three characters when you need to, and in coop every player plays one character.In the first game your heroes saved the kingdom from an undead invasion, after that the heroes separated and lived their own lives, until now. The Trine warps the trio to a mysterious place that they have never heard of or seen before. The three heroes slowly discover the path out of this mysterious place while someone is observing their progress through a magic mirror...There is also a DLC called ""The Goblin Menace"". If you are unsure if you want to buy this game, I can totally recommend it! I've had tons of fun playing this with my friends, was it laughing at eachothers deaths and ridiculous ragdolls or trying to figure out the puzzles, finding ""cheaty"" ways to skip the puzzle and try to get to the next part of the level.The DLC adds quite a few more levels of gameplay and an amusing storyline which was very enjoyable!I recommend this game to anyone! Especially if you have two friends to play it with. And while at it, why not get the DLC and have even more fun?			",226,29,5,17,18,2,26

												Trine 2 is a side-scrolling action platform and puzzle video game developed by Frozenbyte. It is the sequel to Trine and was released on Windows, OS X, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on December 7, 2011 and for Linux on March 31, 2012. Trine 2 allows three players to play the iconic roles of a wizard, a thief, and a knight in a simultaneous cooperative mode. A Director's Cut edition was confirmed during Nintendo's conference at E3 2012, and was available via Wii U's eShop on the console's launch day in all regions except Australia and Japan.The Director's Cut edition is Frozenbyte's first self-published title on a console format, although this edition will be released by Nintendo themselves in Japan on January 2014. On October 28, 2013 it was announced via the PlayStation Blog that Trine 2: Complete Story will be coming to PlayStation 4.It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 4 in North America and Europe. It's the first PlayStation 4 game to support stereoscopic 3D.Trine 2 is a puzzle platform video game, requiring the player to use the skills of the three characters, Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight, to navigate each game level. As with the first game, the mystical ""Trine"" has bound the three characters together into one common entity, and thus the player controls only one character which can be switched to the other two at any time. Each of the characters has unique abilities: Amadeus can use magic to grab onto certain objects in the game world, and create boxes and planks to be used to get around; Zoya can strike at objects with her arrows, and grapple onto certain surfaces; and Pontius is strong in combat against foes, can bash apart walls, and deflect projectiles with his shield. A combination of these elements is necessary to complete each stage in the game's world.Characters have individual life meters, and if one character's meter depletes, that character cannot be used until the next checkpoint is reached. If all three characters lose their life meter, the player must start back at the last checkpoint. Throughout the game world are special magical vials, and for every fifty of these collected, the player receives a skill point, which can be used to gain abilities through a skill tree for each character. These skill points can be used collectively for each of the three characters, and can be traded between them.Trine 2 also supports up to three players in a cooperative mode. In this mode, each player controls one of the three characters, but all must be unique; three players will be forced to play as Amadeus, Zoya, and Pontius. Two players can switch characters as long as both agree to the swap. If a character dies, the other players can revive the character at the next checkpoint. The skill tree is shared among all characters, based on the hosting player's saved game.Rate: 10/10			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												When did gaming culture love graphics more than content? This game right here. This game is the perfect example of how you can make a turd of a game, then make it look pretty and everyone will love it. Other than that there are no saving graces what-so-ever. The story line, is the most cookie cutter thing you can imagine. ""We need to save the princess."" -> That's the entirety of the plot. The characters are bland and boring. Each of the three main characters, are about as cookie cutter as you can get. The interactions between the characters offers no additional story or plot mechanic to make you care about any of the events or personal ramifications of their quest.Gameplay, terrible. Just terrible. Can you press the RB button on a controller? Yes, then you will destroy this game no problem, even on hard. Spam the mage abilities to solve the ""puzzles"" (this term is used to a looser degree than my mom), it really is that easy. When in battle, just switch to either the warrior or rogue, fight off the enemies, of which there is really only 1 type with a couple variations, then switch back and run forward. With all the ""hints"" turned off from the beginning, I never once got stuck on a ""puzzle"" for longer than 45 seconds. Don't buy this game, it's just a turd that was spray painted gold. The last boss of the main game, I laughed when it was over because it was so bad. I would rather sit through the last hour of Mass Effect 3 again, than buy another Trine game... Fact, not fiction.

												Usually with 2D platformers, you're given an obstacle with one answer on how to solve it.  Trine has been that exceptional, and very beautiful 2D platformer that allows you to create your own solutions to the level obstacles ahead.  With Trine 2, not only has the difficulty increased, but it now allows for online co-op where three friends can take control of each of the three characters, creating the new challenge of how to get everyone across the obstacles together.  This is a wonderful game to play with your two closest friends that can also provide quite a laugh when your friends formulate plans that look far too dumb to work and then it actually succeeds.  When you find you or your friends saying, ""wow, was I supposed to do that?"" you just know a game like this is truly the refresher that the 2D platformer needed, even for people who didn't originally care for the genre.  I would easily recommend this game, especially for the $15 price tag.  Hell, I'd have paid $30!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine 2 is a sidescrolling game that includes jumping, puzzle solving and fighting, all in a pleasant and well measured mixture.Game looks nice, style is childishly charming and fanciful, in line with it's fairytale theme.Player takes control of one of the three characters - a knight, a thief and a wizard - and freely changes between them during the adventure, using various abilities available to each one and combining them to overcome obstacles, be they botomless pitfalls, weird contraptions or enemies.Gameplay is smooth and fun, game is fairly easy and causes little to no frustration but there's still a hefty dose of satisfaction when you manage to reach some hard to notice collectible crammed in a niche in the ceiling or a hidden chest after using up a trick or two. Levels are fairly diverse, from bread and butter enchanted forests or dungeons, to walled towns under assault to really cool and weird stuff such as being inside a sand worm's digestion system.I unfortunately haven't tried multiplayer as of yet.I haven't played anything of this sort since childhood times of Prehistorik and Prince of Persia in the early 1990ies, so I don't have much modern first hand experience for comparison. However Trine 2 (as well as Trine) left me very pleasantly surprised after I got it due to a random urge to buy something on a discount. Being used to ""serious"" games such as aviation simulators, rpgs, Total War series, raiding mmos, Eve online etc in the recent decade(s) I remembered how it felt to play games when I was a kid and I must say the change of pace is welcome.All in all, I can recommend Trine 2. I imagine children would love it, while some of us older warhorses used to dark fantasy, dark science fiction, serious modern warfare etc can find a welcome break in this little gem.

												There's absolutely nothing negative to say about this game except for that it eventually ends.The music is some of the best and most enchanting music you'll ever hear.The aesthetics and graphics are truly the most beautiful I've EVER seen in any games, and I've played a lot of games! I often found myself just standing still, admiring the colorfull scenery. It's extremely immersive. It's the Disney cartoon of games. I cannot overstate how tremendously good the atmosphere is in this game.If you enjoy platforming, if you enjoy vivid rainbow colors, beautiful environments, enchanting music AND the ability to enjoy this in co-op with up to 3 friends, then you simply MUST have Trine 2. Ofcourse, if you haven't played any of them first, buying Trine 1 will not disappoint you.			",120,21,1,25,15,1,23

												Trine 2 follows up the original game with everything one could have hoped for in a follow-up: more variety (in combat, enemies and environments), more beautiful graphics (which I did not think was even possible), and last but not least, support for online co-op multiplayer! Simply put - it is the perfect sequel. Everything that was great about the first game (refer to my previous recommendation for details) is still great in Trine 2, if not better. Other notable changes include boss fights and the removal of the limiting ""magic meter"" mechanic of the original. The story this time around is also pretty neat and the same humorous banter between the three characters is on display. The game is extremely fun to play with a friend or two online, but it is definitely also worth playing solo, if that's all you can manage. In summary, Trine 2 is an all-around amazing game, and the price is right too. Highly recommended!			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

  TL;DR  : Trine 2 is a platformer / puzzle game, and is one of the best coop games I've played. The game is gorgeous and runs very well, but the story is quite meh imo. Story / SettingReally wasn't the best part of the game, I'm not into these stereotypical RPG game stories. The characters and dialogues can be fun sometimes, but that's it. Maybe I wasn't paying attention, but I feel like the game doesn't even explain what the Trine is, and the backstory simply wasn't interesting. The content of the hidden chests disapointed me every time, but well, at least I got the achievements that went with it. GameplayThe game really shines when you're playing with someone, online or localy like I did. It can be fun alone but cooperating with someone makes it way better, wether its for the puzzles or for the combat. The only issue can be the point of view when playing multi, its not always easy to see some areas where things can be hidden, but it might be the same in single player which I haven't tried. Overall the game is easy, a few puzzles took us a few minutes but that's it. If you really want to find everything in this game it'll be more about looking everywhere than solving hard puzzles. Some entrances can be hard to find. The fact that you can just rearange the skills of your characters made it a bit too easy as well. Same thing with the respawn system, you can die on and on and on and respawn a few meters behind, whereas the enemies keep all the damage you've done to them. Some achievements are a bit harder and were the only real challenges in this game, but all of them were fun to get. PerformanceWonderful graphics, even for 720p mid quality. it runned at 30 fps with these setttings which was enough for me in a game like this one (no need for high response time or super smooth gameplay like in a FPS)Style / Graphics It was probaly the best looking game I've been able to play on my laptop. Every map or areas is full of great lightning, creatures, buildings... etc.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   TL;PL  : Trine 2 est un platformer, et est un des meilleurs jeu coop auquel j'ai pu jouer. Le jeu est magnifique et tourne bien, même si l'histoire n'etait pas très intéressante. HistoireClairement pas le meilleur élement du jeu, ce genre d'histoire de RPG stéreotypées sont assez lourdes. Les dialogues et les personnages sont marrants parfois, mais c'est tout. Peut-être que je n'ais pas fait attention, mais je crois que le jeu n'explique même pas ce qu'est le Trine. Le contenu des coffres etait décevant à chaque fois, mais bon au moins ça permet d'obtenir des succès. GameplayIl faut vraiment jouer au jeu en multijoueur pour l'apprecier complétement, que ce soit en ligne ou localement comme j'ai fait. Ca peut etre sympa tout seul mais le fait de coopérer avec quelqu'un rends le jeu milles fois mieux, que ce soit pour les puzzles ou les combats. Le seul problème en multi est le point de vue de la camera, c'est pas toujours facile de voir certaines zones à l'ecran, où certains objets peuvent être cachés, mais c'est peut-être la même chose en un joueur. Globalement le jeu est vraiment facile, certains puzzles nous ont pris quelques minutes mais pas plus. Pour tout trouver dans ce jeu, c'est plus une question de regarder partout que de résoudre des puzzles compliqués. Certaines entrées peuvent être vraiment difficiles à trouver. Le fait que l'on peut simplement changer les compétences que l'on a assignés aux personnages rend également le jeu un peu trop facile. Pareil avec le système de respawn, on peut mourrir autant de fois qu'on veut et réapparaitre un peu derrière, alors que les ennemis gardent tous les dégats infligés. Certains succès etaient compliqués et ont été le seul vrai challenge du jeu, mais tous les succès sont sympas à obtenir. PerformanceLes graphismes sont supers beaux, meme en 720p et qualité moyenne. Le jeu tourne à 30 fps avec ces options ce qui est assez pour ce genre de jeu à mon avis (pas besoin d'un temps de réponse très rapide ou de gameplay très fluide, comme dans un FPS)Style / Graphismes Probablement le plus beau jeu auquel j'ai pu jouer sur mon portable. Chaque map a de supers effets de lumières, et de très beaux batiments et créatures.			",109,29,1,5,5,0,5

												Frozenbyte did it again, best 2D/3D sidescrolling platformer become the bestest!if you haven't play Trine before, you should be, the story about those 3 hero hook up with Trine 2.but if you just skip the first one it's not a big deal tho, not much different. Trine Reviewhere my review link for Trine, since there's not much different for the second Trine, Trine review still legit for this one.I'll just review the different between those 2, I differentiated it to positive and negative, since it's my opinion you may not agree with me with some points. here it is :+ New type of puzzle, not like the first one that concentrate on destroying, opening gate with lever, grappling platform to platform. In Trine 2 really test your cunning eyes and sense, play with waterfall, bubble, and else!+ Removal of floating triangle is a beast, now it's not a Thief-centered-puzzle-solving anymore since Zoya can't grapple to any of Wizard hand made box or planks.+ Pontius got a big buff and become more dependable in fight and puzzle solving, now he can jump farther with charge jump, and range attack with throwing hammer.+ Amadeus now can levitating enemy, so now he can be used for fighting while Zoya or Pontius not available. It's a big buff for him, not like on the first Trine, when your attacking hero both dies you'll ♥♥♥♥ed up if surrounded by enemy with Amadeus.+ Despite of increase damage of fire arrow, level 2 skill give Zoya explosion, it's a good nerf altogether with buff, it's done a little improved damage and makes take down enemy from afar much more harder.+ Reworked fire arrow projectile and damage. damage now based on how long you stretched your bowstring, not just 2 spam fire arrow attack can kill almost everything. and the fire arrow projectile now same like normal arrow, not boosted speed like before.- The first thing you'll notice is there's no Energy consumption in Trine 2, so there's no energy vial to be sure. In my opinion, removal of energy consumption makes this games a little bit easier. apparently, you can use unlimited fire arrow and levitating.- Zoya can't shoot grapple below 45degree shooting angle, it's a little bit annoying. whilst in Trine you can shoot below that point- removal of individual skill points, em-em, yes it makes the entire gameplay of Trine 2 become harder, you may not miss every single exp vial since gaining skill point is a tough job.- There's no equipable item anymore in Trine 2, so you can't modify each hero more farther just like before. I really don't understand why they remove this feature. Now hidden boxes just give you secret, artwork, or piece of letters. d'oh.TL;DRBest 2D/3D platformer I've ever played! the gameplay, story, graphic, it all absolutely perfect.It is obviously better than Trine, but that not makes you skip the first one, since they offer you different type of puzzle (not much).

												Trine 2 is a good indie title and it improves over solid foundations of first installment. Visually, Trine 2 looks beautiful. Gameplay is slightly improved and it feels better controling three different characters (especially playing with mage). Level design is good with enough variation (I especially liked DLC campaign) and puzzles are mostly at the right level of difficulty/complexity, although a bit too much on easy side.7,5/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												Trine 2 takes the strong points of its predecessor - beautiful visuals, a wonderful soundtrack, and strong level design - and adds onto it even further. Changes such as new, rebalanced skillsets, removal of the MP system, and the new online co-op system all makes for a wonderful playthrough, whether casual or hardcore, a single player or group of three friends. With the now built-in expansion DLC increasing the length of the game by more than 50%, Trine 2: Complete Story is already worth the starting price, and an absolute steal if it's ever on sale.

 A compelling game, that is at the forefront of the genre Genre: Puzzle PlatformerYea!-Gorgous Graphics-Multiple ways to pass each puzzle-lots of collectables to be had for 100%Meh!-Character Interaction and Story-Nice and simple combatBleh!-Same as Trine 1, not really anything added-Length, wish it was longer(will pick up DLC in future)The LowdownA nice and easy going puzzle platformer which is very forgiving. There are multiple solutions to every puzzle from swinging accross to making boxes to jump over. COmbat really is not a hidderance and mostly just there to break up the puzzles, which is not a bad thing at all. The game's art asthetics are just gorgous, the backgrounds are simply amazingly detailed, which you just have to be amazed by. There are tons of achievements to achieve if you are into that as well as many hidden objects to collect in each level for the scavenger. While not necessary a bad thing the game is more of an expansion to Trine 1, with not adding any new elements. But Trine 1 did everything great so its great they didn't tweak with the formula that works. AT about 7 hours it is a short game without the DLC, but I do plan on picking that up sometime in the future.Verdict: BUY IT [/b] ",439,123,12,73,77,7,70

												Gameplay 8/10:Each of the three playable characters comes with a satisfying and well-balanced kit, though after a few upgrades, synergistic puzzle-skipping patterns emerge. So, in a sense, levelling up is being punished by making the puzzle elements of the game less challenging. The same can't be said for the combat elements since the game offers two difficulty sliders that can provide a fair challenge to any team, pulling thus the genre shift known as this-is-a-great-platformer-oh-no-it's-a-beat-em-up.Plot 5/10:A scarcely noteworthy plot that should have been better, considering the craftsmanship that went into this game.Character 3/10:The heroes all suffer from caricature syndrome. The Trine is underdeveloped. The woman is what, a queen or something? The goblin king is a baddie. The other final boss likes to kidnap old ladies and suffers from asthma? I don't know.Diction 7/10:Though at some points it can ring false, it maintains qualities suitable to the characters.Melody 7/10:The only grievance one would have with the soundtrack is repetition. You got yer battle music, yer boss music, yer exploration music, and that's 'bout it, I reckon.Spectacle 10/10:This game is the absolute definition of beauty. Forget the gradual polycount increase you see in tech demos that add gameplay as an afterthought. Forget the pseudo-artistic vomit that comprises of nothing but dark silhouettes or blocky sprites that preys on the clueless hipster. Here is a very finely crafted and detailed game world that comes alive, despite only utilizing two dimensions of space.Final verdict:It's the quintessential 3-way co-op side-scrolling puzzle platformer/beat-em-up on PC. Do not settle for imitation products; buy Trine 2 today!			",76,9,3,8,12,0,16

												This is coming from someone who never played (or heard of) the first Trine and played with a friend on the Medium difficulty. I’ve played it a bit in single player before doing that, and I wasn’t terribly impressed with it.Trine 2 is basically a playable fairytale; it’s not a very interesting story, but it’s set in a very charming and magical world. The playable cast are the traditional Mage-Warrior-Thief combo, but they each are quite charming in their own way (like the world of Trine itself). Amadeus (the Mage) can create boxes and planks, Pontius (the Warrior) is a great fighter and can use his shield to both fly and protect himself and his allies, and Zoya (the Thief) is, quite refreshingly, an archer with lots of nifty tricks up her sleeves. All three are rather stereotypical: Amadeus is a smart coward scared of his wife, Pontius is a gluttonous stereotypical hero more concerned with food and saving princesses and Zoya is a shifty, greedy woman. Sadly, they don’t seem to really interact all that much during the game except during moments where the player has little (if any) control. It’s a shame because the personalities clash so much that it makes for some fairly amusing dialogue.I can happily say that while this game is a sequel to Trine, it never feels like you missed anything. Sure, there are some little references to it (as far as I can tell, at least), but it’s a standalone story in its own right. Sure, it’s nothing special to begin with, but it’s refreshing to play a little fairytale instead of this big complex story with multiple plot twists. It took my friend and I about 8 hours to finish the main game (I’ll edit this when we do the DLC) and it never was too hard, though I would recommend playing on Classic and not Unlimited, as that really does force you to work together and not independently. However, I would also highly recommend playing the game with two players instead of three or one for reasons I’ll delve into later.This is mainly a puzzle game where you have to find a way to go from point A to point B with all the tools given to you, such as boxes, pipes, fire, portals and more. However, there are a TON of hidden little nooks and crannies scattered throughout the game, and since it’s mainly EXP (because yes, there is a levelling system), it’s actually rewarding in a concrete way. There are also hidden paintings, which are basically concept art, and hidden poems, which are foreshadowing the story. Not necessary, but certainly fun to hunt down. Notice how I said this is mainly a puzzle game. There are little combat breaks in the game that seem to separate puzzles, which is a welcome addition. However, they lead to a problem within the mechanics of the game and they’re why I can’t recommend playing this with three players (on Classic). To properly explain, however, I have to address the levelling system. It’s quite simple: pick up 50 hidden doohickeys and you level up, gaining a skill point for your account that can be used for either Amadeus, Pontius or Zoya. Amadeus will be able to create more objects, Pontius mainly gains combat abilities and Zoya gains different kinds of arrows that can assist in both utility and combat. As a result, Amadeus will not be very useful during combat, while Pontius and Zoya will be very useful (especially Pontius). The problem here is not quite Amadeus: it’s Pontius.See, the bulk of the game is puzzle-based, so Pontius can’t really do much but stand around and wait for the others to clear the way to the next battle. Furthermore, his special ability (breaking rocks and wood) becomes obsolete as soon as Zoya gains explosive arrows, which are much more flexible since a lot of the hidden EXP bottles are hidden up high. Therefore, the player stuck with Pontius (in a 3P Classic situation) would be mostly useless and Amadeus finds himself helpless during battle (he can help, but not as much as the others). As a result, I found that playing with two players, one dedicated to Amadeus and one dedicated to Zoya, led with the most satisfying game experience as we could switch to Pontius whenever needed instead of having deadweight with us. We didn’t even need to get Pontius’ skills until Zoya (for me) and Amadeus (for my friend) had all their skills unlocked.While the game is very, very forgiving (except, I’m guessing, on Hardcore), having lots of checkpoints that fully heal every character as often as you wish, there are still some annoyances (provided you don’t mind how forgiving the game is, which I didn’t). This mainly comes with the few ‘boss’ battles that appear throughout the game. They always take the same form: a big goblin with a massive club. Furthermore, this goblin kills anyone in a single hit and takes a fair bit to kill compared to other enemies, which is quite annoying. Also, I can’t imagine fighting the last boss in single player, though it’s a great fight where, once again, Pontius isn’t very useful.Visually, the game is actually pretty stunning, being very colorful. Lots of shadows and lighting make the game ‘pop’ and seem alive. You can clearly see everything on the screen even when it’s dark, which I feel is crucial in a puzzle game as the main challenge shouldn’t be finding the pieces, but figuring out how they fit into one another. The music is also very pretty, being very soothing most of the time and kicking up the tempo and intensity when needed. However, none of the songs really stick in your head, instead blending into an immersive soundscape. The whole game, being a playable fairytale, has a delightful cartoony feel to it, from the character designs to the story to the sounds and visual design. While the shallow combat seems a little tacked on and only created to give Pontius a purpose, the combat scenes are so short that it shouldn’t be counted as a huge negative. I would highly recommend this game for 2P coop players and cautiously recommend it for 3P coop players and single players, as I feel the former would leave one player bored (assuming they play on Classic, as Unlimited is simply too easy as far as I’m concerned) and the latter feels like it’s missing something. The game isn’t too hard either, making it perfect for both casual and hardcore players, though it does seem more casual. Nevertheless, it’s a nice little game that’s definitely worth your time.Do note, however, that the trailer (quite sadly) shows more of the DLC than the game itself. I’ll edit this when my friend and I get through the DLC, but know that it’s like a sequel (or a part 2) to the game; Trine 2 itself has 13 chapters and the DLC adds 7, to give you an idea. Who knows, maybe my complaints are fixed in the DLC?			",192,25,8,27,4,3,10

												Trine 2 is a good indie title and it improves over solid foundations of first installment. Visually, Trine 2 looks beautiful. Gameplay is slightly improved and it feels better controling three different characters (especially playing with mage). Level design is good with enough variation (I especially liked DLC campaign) and puzzles are mostly at the right level of difficulty/complexity, although a bit too much on easy side.7,5/10			",286,100,6,60,33,1,81

												Trine 2 takes the strong points of its predecessor - beautiful visuals, a wonderful soundtrack, and strong level design - and adds onto it even further. Changes such as new, rebalanced skillsets, removal of the MP system, and the new online co-op system all makes for a wonderful playthrough, whether casual or hardcore, a single player or group of three friends. With the now built-in expansion DLC increasing the length of the game by more than 50%, Trine 2: Complete Story is already worth the starting price, and an absolute steal if it's ever on sale. Don't miss out!			",125,19,2,7,6,1,14

												I quite enjoy this game. The art, and the British accents make it all great, and the gameplay is very nice, too (reminds me of puzzle games from my childhoods)My favourite character is Stoya, because her movies have been a favourite for many years.I'm not a big fan of the hippie, even though he can spawn pandoras box, despite the game being based in times before the Android Phone was invented.I still don't know why they have made King Henry so slim in this game, though. But hey, I'm not the one designing it.In total, I'll give this game a Ben out of Ten.Geddit?Because Big Ben is British?Oh god, I need a career in comedy.			",597,160,22,78,49,9,68

												Pretty much very basic fantasy story that starts off with a mage, thief and a warrior. Every one of them has it's own strenghts and weaknesses. It has amazing visuals, sounds, and decent voice acting, the weakest part i can think off is level design. Not a must play title but if you have a co-op partner to play with, or enjoy light fantasy you might enjoy this too. 6/10			",61,11,0,4,2,0,2

												Frozenbyte did it again, best 2D/3D sidescrolling platformer become the bestest!if you haven't play Trine before, you should be, the story about those 3 hero hook up with Trine 2.but if you just skip the first one it's not a big deal tho, not much different. Trine Reviewhere my review link for Trine, since there's not much different for the second Trine, Trine review still legit for this one.I'll just review the different between those 2, I differentiated it to positive and negative, since it's my opinion you may not agree with me with some points. here it is :+ New type of puzzle, not like the first one that concentrate on destroying, opening gate with lever, grappling platform to platform. In Trine 2 really test your cunning eyes and sense, play with waterfall, bubble, and else!+ Removal of floating triangle is a beast, now it's not a Thief-centered-puzzle-solving anymore since Zoya can't grapple to any of Wizard hand made box or planks.+ Pontius got a big buff and become more dependable in fight and puzzle solving, now he can jump farther with charge jump, and range attack with throwing hammer.+ Amadeus now can levitating enemy, so now he can be used for fighting while Zoya or Pontius not available. It's a big buff for him, not like on the first Trine, when your attacking hero both dies you'll ♥♥♥♥ed up if surrounded by enemy with Amadeus.+ Despite of increase damage of fire arrow, level 2 skill give Zoya explosion, it's a good nerf altogether with buff, it's done a little improved damage and makes take down enemy from afar much more harder.+ Reworked fire arrow projectile and damage. damage now based on how long you stretched your bowstring, not just 2 spam fire arrow attack can kill almost everything. and the fire arrow projectile now same like normal arrow, not boosted speed like before.- The first thing you'll notice is there's no Energy consumption in Trine 2, so there's no energy vial to be sure. In my opinion, removal of energy consumption makes this games a little bit easier. apparently, you can use unlimited fire arrow and levitating.- Zoya can't shoot grapple below 45degree shooting angle, it's a little bit annoying. whilst in Trine you can shoot below that point- removal of individual skill points, em-em, yes it makes the entire gameplay of Trine 2 become harder, you may not miss every single exp vial since gaining skill point is a tough job.- There's no equipable item anymore in Trine 2, so you can't modify each hero more farther just like before. I really don't understand why they remove this feature. Now hidden boxes just give you secret, artwork, or piece of letters. d'oh.TL;DRBest 2D/3D platformer I've ever played! the gameplay, story, graphic, it all absolutely perfect.It is obviously better than Trine, but that not makes you skip the first one, since they offer you different type of puzzle (not much).

												I liked this game its fast paced and easy on the eyes, there were some challenges along the way, but with the power of friendship and team work we managed to beat it.Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great This game is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. Trine 2 is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that""he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100%movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.

												Summary: Awesome game to play with friends and a true challenge if you like Achievements.This is definitely a *casual* game with not so much replayability IMHO, but it is a lot of fun. If you are an achievement freak like myself, prepare for a challenge. Luckly, these devs here didn't go in the trend of making impossible multiplayer achievements (which is utterly annoying), and they can usually be obtained solo. Some few require multiplayer but they are more often than not just silly: stand on the top of the Knight's shield and so on.Also, it is SO PRETTY.			",176,110,1,20,21,1,21

												Longer than 1st Trine. Played on Hard difficulty but it was not a big deal to pass levels - the hardest part is definitely the last boss. Huge graphical improvements - i considered Trine 1 as beautiful but this is much better - the best graphics I have ever seen in platformer game - amazing fire, water, wind effects. Environment is dynamic - trees, water, mushrooms, plants, monsters - everything is different. Skills tree is upgraded - you can finally reset your points at any moment. There is also a story but i don't care very much about it - in my opinion, platformer don't need a story to enchant the player. Number of checkpoints are sufficient, you don't need to repeat a long part.If you like platformer genre, this is one of the must-have games.CONS: ---PROS: amazing graphics, skills tree, environment, each level is different			",45,16,1,0,7,1,4

Great for all ages.I guess, if I had to critique, I would say the story could have been better (rather than just serving to get you from one puzzel to the next). Also, I am not sure how much fun this game is if you are playing it alone, since it was designed for co-op. Also, an xbox controller is recommended.			",69,5,6,5,12,2,7

												Best choice ever for this holiday. Both action, platformer and puzzle game. You use 3 characters and switch between them to solve puzzles that usually block paths in order to keep going further (you will also get ambushed by goblins during certain chapters). If you want your friends to help you solving the puzzles, you can invite them to join your party or, if they are at your home, they can play on a local co-op by pressing the Start button from their controllers (they will play as one of the other 2 characters). In the end it's a good puzzle-solving action game with a pretty creative style and puzzling.			",138,24,6,19,13,2,16

												A very fun and interesting game; any individual can challenge him/herself by using only a character for a level (which is also part of the achievements).However, just like any other games, this game is not absolutely free of bugs - characters can somethings take damage even before an attack animation by the mummy mobs (can be a headache if you're playing hard HC) or die out of nowhere suddenly (in the 6th level of DLC expansion when you're standing on the goblin machine). This can really be a pain.Furthermore, if you are those who like to pursue achievements, some of them for this game can be extremely cancerous to complete, like the experience collection achievements. The devs like to hide some of these exp in places you can barely find without the help of forums and online tutorial videos.But all in all still a good game if you just want to have some fun relaxing gaming moments during leisure time.

												There are several reasons why I like to play Trine 2:1. Very good storyline2. An exciting puzzle game3. Photographs and graphic designs are terrific4.This type of game can encourage people to work as a team to complete chapters5.The background music is fitting every chapters(sometimes relaxing sometimes thrilling)6. I personally like to play adventure games and this is a good one in my opinion7. The character settings are awesome as well8. It is easy to do some tricks but it is also mind challengingAnyways, GREAT GAME!!			",12,1,0,1,0,0,0

												Trine 2 is less of a sequel, and more radical cosmetic surgery. Frozenbyte have exploded the formula into a beautiful, rainbow-sodden spectacle. You don't realise how few purple and green crystal-lit caverns there are out there, until you're forced to stop and bask in one. Trine is a fairytale platforming adventure, based around a magical floating sconce that's bound together the souls of a wizard, a knight and a thief. The story itself is sweet enough – perfectly charming and a shade too earnest – but what really drives you, beyond the irresistible instinct in platformers to travel to the right, is the satisfaction that's gained from solving the inventive physics-based puzzles. Playing solo, you can swap between characters instantly as you require their different skills. The Wizard can levitate objects, conjure boxes, and eventually planks, allowing him to bridge gaps and create steps. But he's all wizardy and crap in a fight, so tap him out when goblins and bosses appear. The Thief can fire a grappling hook and swing from wooden surfaces, and her bow makes her the best ranged fighter. Then there's the Warrior, who dishes out the melee damage with his sword, deflects lava with his shield, and smashes delicate stuff from afar with his hammer. If you've played the first game, you'll be thinking “well, this sounds pretty familiar. Shouldn't you be focusing on the new stuff?” The weakest thing about Trine 2 is how broadly identical it is to the first game. The energy bar has gone, and there's online co-op play, but Trine 2 amounts to a skill reset and a bunch of gorgeous new levels. The flexibility of the puzzles and the overlapping powers mean that often there's no pure, one-way solution. In particular, the Thief's agility becomes less essential as the Wizard learns to conjure more simultaneous objects. Solo, this doesn't matter. Multiplayer changes the nature of the game. First off, and this is such a superficial observation that I feel obliged to say it in a stupid way, it's nice to do a solve on a puzzle with a friend. The first Trine had local multiplayer, bizarrely hidden in a sub-sub-menu, but Trine 2 brings it to the main menu, and adds online matchmaking and text chat. It's now easy to drop into a game with strangers or pals. More fundamentally, dividing the powers between three players, instead of one player swapping between the powers as he sees fit, means that progress that could only previously be made by one character now has to be achievable by all three. Frozenbyte have addressed this in two ways. Firstly, the Wizard can levitate items that he's standing on in multiplayer. But life's too easy with a magic carpet. A more elegant solution is Unlimited mode. Tucked away in the 'host a game' options, this allows multiples of each class on screen. It's more chaotic, more flexible, and more fun. It solves some huffier moments, like when the Thief realises she's a complete spare wheel. And that moment where the Wizard decides to avoid a boss fight, hanging out by the partner-regenerating checkpoints while an endless stream of Thieves and Knights do the work. Trine 2 may retread a lot of old ground, but it's beautiful. It's like Frozenbyte are saying “Oh, did we make Trine? We meant this.” The same moderate puzzling challenge, the same characters, the same charm and some problems fixed.			",218,63,8,25,14,3,18

												This game is sooo good. It's so shiny and dazzling %) Beautiful visuals and entertaining game play. Puzzles lack certain elegance, but are ok overall. I think it took a great improvement since the first Trine. While I never felt like to rerun a level in the first game, I do enjoy complete levels in Trine 2 over and over again. And I haven’t enjoyed co-op this much since Bionic Commando on PS3. That’s says a lot, trust me :) I really recommend this game. Really fun experience that you can share with your friends.

												Just like the first game, Trine 2 is a puzzle-platformer indie with action/rpg elements, and a game similar to the old Lost Vikings game. You have to solve puzzles, prove your platformer skills, and sometimes fight some enemies in 20 different beatiful levels. You can switch between 3 characters, a wizard with magic, a thief with a bow, and a knight with heavy armor and weaponry, and use their different abilities to progress through the game. In comparison to the first game, i really like the new leveling/ability system and the few boss encounters.If you're a fan of platformer games, or if you enjoyed playing The Lost Vikings, you really should consider buying this game, especially when its on sale!

												If you enjoy playing with your friends puzzle games that require teamwork and would also love to see beautiful colorful graphics, boy do I have the game for you! Trine 2(and soon Trine 1 the enchanted edition) will satisfy both of these needs of yours.The story of Trine and Trine 2 are not connected, so even if you have not played Trine 1 you dont really miss out anything other than a great game, storywise you miss nothing. :)In this game you will control 3 different characters(the same ones you used in Trine 1) Zoya the thief, Pontius the knight( and Amadeus the wizard. Each one of these chracters have their own unique abilities that are all needed in the puzzle that you will encounter in the game.A little bit about the characters:Zoya: she offers ranged attacking with her arrows(which you can enchance once you gain some levels) and great amount of utility with her hookPontius: he is more of the ""its time to fight"" character with his hammer(which can be thrown but its very slow!) and sword & shield combo. He will gain later on a little bit of utility as well but, that is once you gain some levels.Amadeus: he offers a great deal of utility. His main ability is to create magical boxes you can jump on to, naturally you will learn to create differnt kind of things when you gain more levels. Amadeus is the only one who can not harm enemies with his abilities alone. ",44,8,0,8,2,0,2

												I started playing this when my internet was down for the weekend. It is a really good puzzle game, with amazingly beautiful graphics that keep you enthralled for hours. I was so addicted I finished it that weekend (unfortunately it is a little short), I just couldn't quit the game. This game is great if you like an RPG sort of adventure with puzzles and collectibles along the way. I would very much recommend this game at its current price and if it goes on sale, you have an even better reason to get it. It also has Co-OP so you can invite your friends to play with you!

												I don't think that I regret buying the game since I did have a fun time playing it. But I'm torn between whether source of that fun was the game or the fact that I occasionally got to kill my friend by being a straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I wouldn't go so far as to warn people off by the game by any means but at the same time I'm not going around telling anyone to buy it. But I guess that if you do have a few friends willing to try a co-op puzzle experience then Trine 2 wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for you to try out together.If you want to read a more detailed review of the game you can find it over here on my blog: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2014/08/trine-2.html.

												The most gorgeous puzzle side scroller you may ever play.  The art work is absolutely breathtaking.  Game play is as you would expect from a side scrolling game but with the added help of being able to switch between 3 different character each with their own unique skill required to proceed through levels.  Co-op is excellent altough character switching may get a tad confusing especially when you get accustomed to a particular character but only for a few seconds.  You will find that you and your co-op buddies will spend most of your time gushing about the vividly stunning visuals.Absolutely recommend this one.  ",75,10,2,9,9,0,17

												If I had to describe Trine 2 using only one word, I would use this one: beautiful. I actually think this is the most beautiful game I have ever played. It is basically a magical adventure which focuses on solving more or less difficult puzzles using the unique skills of the three main characters. Even if you are not a fan of platformer games, I am pretty sure you will not be able to resist this game's charm. Do not hesitate to enter the magical realm of Trine 2, but beware - once you enter it, you may not want to leave it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Played Trine and if you love it , this one is a lot better, Although there are more skills and puzzles. This is a platformer well designed and updated graphics, The controls are nice with a keyboard, I have found it hard to play with a controller only for the wizard as you have to draw objects to spawn them, which can be a pain with a controller vs a mouse. You can also play with friends as well, Which is always my favorite part in a game and extends game play if you plan to get all the achievements. I am hoping for a Trine 3!			",181,18,7,13,10,1,6

												Trine 2 has easily earned its rightful place as one of my favourite videogames of all time. Absolutely gorgeous, fairly intelligent and easy to play, the game is eye candy through and through. The mechanics are fun to manipulate and I love the fact that levels can't be solved with just one way in most cases. Another aspect of the game I thoroughly enjoy is the voice acting. It's pretty obvious that the game is meant to appeal to a younger audience as well, but it still manages to avoid cheesy liners, instead delivering clever dialogue and amusing conversations. If you're looking for something relaxing that looks and sounds good do yourself a favour and buy Trine 2.			",59,12,0,9,9,0,14

												Trine 2: ːcsgostarːːcsgostarːːcsgostarːːcsgostarːOne word for this game: Amazing.First of all, let's talk about the art style. I particularly love games with good art style maybe 'cause I like to draw, and this game has a great graphic in terms of art style. So much vibrant colors, sometimes a exuberant jungle with a lot of tones of green, or a desert; dark caverns, frozy mountains and much more. One place richer in detail then other.Another thing... there are puzzles, a lot of them!! Not so hard that anybody can solve them :D each puzzle require some kind of skill from our characters. Even with so much puzzle, this game doesn't becomes boring 'cause always can change your current char ːsteamhappyːI didn't give it five stars 'cause sometimes the physics in the game doesn't work correctly. Without this, I can say that I enjoy the game!			",134,33,2,1,3,0,6

												Trine 2 is a pretty fantastic 2D puzzle-side scroling/platformer. Don't judge me by my playtime, since I already  play the first one for a decent amount of time, and I must say that Trine 2, stays true to the original while improving every aspect from the first one.  Beautiful graphic and clever , well thought mechanic is the strong point of Trine 2 (also 1).Story (9/10)Since I just play a small amount of time on this game and haven't got at least a quarter of the journey yet, I leave this one mostly at 'pending'. You probably ask why I give it a 9, its solely because of the excellent, bedtime-fairy tale story narrative, the narrator is just plain amazing. And I really look forward for the rest of the story, so far it has an excellent main pot, setting, and pace.Graphic (11/10)For a 2D side scrolling, Trine and Trine 2 offer a very distinct art style and stunning background, lifelike, and capture the fantasy setting perfectly. The graphic is the first thing that caught my attenttion to this game. I'm not  a fan of 2D platformer with 3D background, hell.. I find most of the background-character combination is just bland and dull, I'd rather play a full 2D platformer. But Trine manages to do it flawlessly. No or really rare platformer treat your eyes  like this. The set pieces are also varied, atleast until now, but I can see the creativity in there, I bet I'll see many more gorgeous places as I go through. It's purely beyond amazing. Gameplay (10/10)Balanced, well thought, unique, diverse, and clever. I like on how you solve the puzzle, its not 'linear', with 3 characters available, you can choose a variety of ways to solve the puzzles. The map layout is one of the best layout I've ever seen in a platformer-puzzle game. Also, this game make an intellegent use of its physic. Overall its fun and of course challenging without being unreasonable / over the top. What I meant with ""over the top"" is in many puzzle game (not only platformer), the puzzle is like..complicated, complicated in a way that its breaking the fourth wall, I mean..when I solve the puzzle, I was like..uhh..really? Trine didn't fal lto that category, the solutions are logical. If I can name other game, it'd be Portal 2, the same unique concept with 'ordinary but creative' problem solving method.Music (9/10)Another game which has an amazing soundtrack, when I can say a game OST is amazing? Its when the soundtrack is well placed and help to set out of the mood. Conclusion (9/10)Apart from the story, its a great game so far, I'm looking forward to find another great places, puzzles, and when the story unfold. Stunning graphic, awesome music, and consistently great gameplay and puzzles are the reasons why I could give a high score on my really early review.P.S: I probably won't review Trine 1, since Trine 2 is a much improved version of Trine 1, so my review will be the same for both game anyway.

												This is a game for you if you like platforming and lite puzzle solving. The game also features very stunning visuals throughout the entire playthrough. Most of the level backgrounds are impressive and give the platforming layout a nice sense of depth.Hard difficulty is recommended as the various traps can be run through in easy and medium difficulties without taking much damage. In hard difficulty you usually die instantly if you try to run through the traps like a headless chicken.Online co-op is available for maximum of 3 players which I highly recommend as every character has their distinctive (and important) roles to play. The character roles also become more apparent when you play co-op as you can't swap between the characters (like in offline) as you please (if you disable the option), but need to work together to overcome the obstacles. Plus, it's always funny when someone screws up and as a result the whole group dies instantly.The three playable characters are wizard, knight and thief.Wizard can conjure various metallic platforms to jump on and is especially useful to reach some of the very hard to reach places. He also has a cute wizard's hat which usually flies off hilariously when he dies.Knight has a shield + sword combo for defence, and to assist the wizard with platform creation he can magnetize the shield. Knight can use the shield to glide through the air like Mary Poppins.Knight also has a big hammer which he can use to bash enemies and break wooden objects.Thief is the nimble one as she can use grappling arrows to swing from wooden surface to another. She also has few stealth tricks to confuse the enemies, and can create low gravity bubble which comes in handy from time to time in co-op. In addition to normal arrows the thief can also shoot ice and fire/explosive arrows.The levels are scattered with experience bubbles and vials which are used to unlock all the abilities of the characters. In addition the levels feature treasure chests in various secret places which unlock poems and concept art that can be viewed from the main menu gallery.Checkpoints are frequent throughout the levels. Characters are healed (amount depends on difficulty) and resurrected at the checkpoints.Enemies are mostly goblins with various equipment like shields, spears and armour. The enemies drop experience and sometimes health pickups that heal every member of the party. Levels also have themed wild life which can both aid and hinder your progress.As a negative point the cutscenes cannot be skipped in multiplayer which isn't a problem in first playthrough, but can become tedious if you're planning to play it through more than once in co-op.

												First thing you notice about this game is its beautiful scenery and detail in every backdrop. Gorgeous game overall. Single player, you'll be playing through various puzzles, switching between three characters each with special abilities and using them to get past various obstacles. Playing multiplayer with your friends will make it easier and harder at the same time - make sure you guys can work together well! Definitely recommend this game.			",95,19,0,8,8,0,7

												This game is incredibly beautiful, both visually and the music. It's a fun puzzle game where you play as either a humble Wizard, a brave Knight or a sneaky Thief who are on a quest to see where the Trine takes them this time. Not so much fun to play alone perhaps, but if you have a friend to play it with, it's an amazing little game with a lot of character. I'd really recommend it if you like these sort of games or just appreciate the beauty.			",203,35,4,19,7,2,15

												Trine 2 is a pretty fantastic 2D puzzle-side scroling/platformer. Don't judge me by my playtime, since I already  play the first one for a decent amount of time, and I must say that Trine 2, stays true to the original while improving every aspect from the first one.  Beautiful graphic and clever , well thought mechanic is the strong point of Trine 2 (also 1).Story (9/10)Since I just play a small amount of time on this game and haven't got at least a quarter of the journey yet, I leave this one mostly at 'pending'. You probably ask why I give it a 9, its solely because of the excellent, bedtime-fairy tale story narrative, the narrator is just plain amazing. And I really look forward for the rest of the story, so far it has an excellent main pot, setting, and pace.Graphic (11/10)For a 2D side scrolling, Trine and Trine 2 offer a very distinct art style and stunning background, lifelike, and capture the fantasy setting perfectly. The graphic is the first thing that caught my attenttion to this game. I'm not  a fan of 2D platformer with 3D background, hell.. I find most of the background-character combination is just bland and dull, I'd rather play a full 2D platformer. But Trine manages to do it flawlessly. No or really rare platformer treat your eyes  like this. The set pieces are also varied, atleast until now, but I can see the creativity in there, I bet I'll see many more gorgeous places as I go through. It's purely beyond amazing. Gameplay (10/10)Balanced, well thought, unique, diverse, and clever. I like on how you solve the puzzle, its not 'linear', with 3 characters available, you can choose a variety of ways to solve the puzzles. The map layout is one of the best layout I've ever seen in a platformer-puzzle game. Also, this game make an intellegent use of its physic. Overall its fun and of course challenging without being unreasonable / over the top. What I meant with ""over the top"" is in many puzzle game (not only platformer), the puzzle is like..complicated, complicated in a way that its breaking the fourth wall, I mean..when I solve the puzzle, I was like..uhh..really? Trine didn't fal lto that category, the solutions are logical. If I can name other game, it'd be Portal 2, the same unique concept with 'ordinary but creative' problem solving method.Music (9/10)Another game which has an amazing soundtrack, when I can say a game OST is amazing? Its when the soundtrack is well placed and help to set out of the mood. Conclusion (9/10)Apart from the story, its a great game so far, I'm looking forward to find another great places, puzzles, and when the story unfold. Stunning graphic, awesome music, and consistently great gameplay and puzzles are the reasons why I could give a high score on my really early review.P.S: I probably won't review Trine 1, since Trine 2 is a much improved version of Trine 1, so my review will be the same for both game anyway.

												The most gorgeous puzzle side scroller you may ever play.  The art work is absolutely breathtaking.  Game play is as you would expect from a side scrolling game but with the added help of being able to switch between 3 different character each with their own unique skill required to proceed through levels.  Co-op is excellent altough character switching may get a tad confusing especially when you get accustomed to a particular character but only for a few seconds.  You will find that you and your co-op buddies will spend most of your time gushing about the vividly stunning visuals.Absolutely recommend this one.  ",75,10,2,9,9,0,17

												Veridict: 9.0This is an adventure sidescroller with graphics worth a best photography academy award, add this to a very fun gameplay with a constant change of roles between a Warrior, a Thief and a Wizard. The Trine show itself again and it's those three heroe's duty to discover why it is back and save the kingdom again.Choose Pontius, the warrior when you need an invencible wall and a mighty hammer throw to resist any harm and bring down any obstacle or threat on your path.Choose Zoya, the thief when you want to sneak past your enemies, swing through death pits, or kill anything with her explosive/frozen arrows.Choose Amadeus, the wizard when you need to solve puzzles that only his magic can help, create and build bridges and stairways to get to the next level or just imprisonate anyone who try to hit you.Every level is full of ferocious enemies and mindbreaking puzzles that makes you want to continue evolving your player skill to get to the end of this magical history. This is a must have for any fan of art, magic, challenge, and a good adventure.			",69,23,3,9,7,1,5

												This is a game for you if you like platforming and lite puzzle solving. The game also features very stunning visuals throughout the entire playthrough. Most of the level backgrounds are impressive and give the platforming layout a nice sense of depth.Hard difficulty is recommended as the various traps can be run through in easy and medium difficulties without taking much damage. In hard difficulty you usually die instantly if you try to run through the traps like a headless chicken.Online co-op is available for maximum of 3 players which I highly recommend as every character has their distinctive (and important) roles to play. The character roles also become more apparent when you play co-op as you can't swap between the characters (like in offline) as you please (if you disable the option), but need to work together to overcome the obstacles. Plus, it's always funny when someone screws up and as a result the whole group dies instantly.The three playable characters are wizard, knight and thief.Wizard can conjure various metallic platforms to jump on and is especially useful to reach some of the very hard to reach places. He also has a cute wizard's hat which usually flies off hilariously when he dies.Knight has a shield + sword combo for defence, and to assist the wizard with platform creation he can magnetize the shield. Knight can use the shield to glide through the air like Mary Poppins.Knight also has a big hammer which he can use to bash enemies and break wooden objects.Thief is the nimble one as she can use grappling arrows to swing from wooden surface to another. She also has few stealth tricks to confuse the enemies, and can create low gravity bubble which comes in handy from time to time in co-op. In addition to normal arrows the thief can also shoot ice and fire/explosive arrows.The levels are scattered with experience bubbles and vials which are used to unlock all the abilities of the characters. In addition the levels feature treasure chests in various secret places which unlock poems and concept art that can be viewed from the main menu gallery.Checkpoints are frequent throughout the levels. Characters are healed (amount depends on difficulty) and resurrected at the checkpoints.Enemies are mostly goblins with various equipment like shields, spears and armour. The enemies drop experience and sometimes health pickups that heal every member of the party. Levels also have themed wild life which can both aid and hinder your progress.As a negative point the cutscenes cannot be skipped in multiplayer which isn't a problem in first playthrough, but can become tedious if you're planning to play it through more than once in co-op.

												Worth every penny. Every single scene in the game is like ♥♥♥♥♥♥s for your eyes. It's a pleasure just to sit for a second and admire the detail that went into every bit of the game. The multiplayer is unbelievably fun, with everyone trying to work together its choas but the best kind. The puzzles are challenging but not to hard that you get annoyed. The storyline isn't amazing but its sweet. The voice acting is enjoyable. The dialog is great with a few dirty jokes thrown in. The characters are great, and you'll fall in love with each of them. If you enjoyed Dust or Castle crashers you'll love this game! The only ""Con"" for me is I occasionally crashed, mostly when trying to host a multiplayer. But you can save at any time, and all-in-all I did not crash enough for it to really put me off. Loved it.			",50,6,0,7,3,0,1

												Buy that. Because its awesome and fun. You get to play (and swap if you want) one of three classic paper/rock/scissors characters - mage, warrior and thief. Mage creates and levitates items, warrior can bash things and thief can swing across on a rope and fire different elemental arrows.Each level is unique and insanely beautiful. With hand drawn backgrounds, secrets and amazing music this game has one of the best designs i ever saw.That said - it is rather short. There are however different difficulty settings for hardcore players and it does have some replayability, especially if you can find 2 other decent players.			",103,15,1,19,33,0,33

It is simply beautiful, with enchanting music, not spectacular but good story,  some action and some physics based puzzles. If you are looking for a great couch co-op game, then look no further. Also consider getting the Complete Story pack, but Trine 2 will be the most outstanding part in this bundle. My daughters simply love this game. Thumbs up.P.S.

												The Good: Online co-op (finally!). Scenery so colorful you may go blind (in a good way). Awesome puzzle platforming that doesn't restrict your options (there's usually two or more ways to solve the trickiest puzzles, and the simple ones always have more). Unlimited character play so you can co-op with up to 3 wizards if you want, then switch to 3 thieves or 3 knights if need be. The boss battle at the end of the game (which I won't spoil) is freaking epic!The Bad: The Wizard used to be able (in the first game) to conjure 7 boxes, 6 planks and a triangle that floated, was grappleable, and could be made to explode, now he only conjures a maximum of 4 boxes OR planks, and the triangle is sadly missing (this is partially solved by playing in Unlimited mode, as each copy of the Wizard can have their own stack of 4 objects).The Ugly: What ""ugly""? This game is gorgeous!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a newcomer to side scrolling genre, I was sceptical on how I will perceive the game on my point of view. This game was able to put my interest into any game that shares it genre. As for presentation, Frozenbyte shows us that this game is more than getting the character from the left side of the level to the right side of the level. Unlike any other games that sometimes can feel like chores playing them, this shows me otherwise. I was literally astonished by the beutiful background and some of the best ambient music in today's gaming.Apart from it's eye candy graphic and artwork, this game packed with the puzzle and gameplay. All of the puzzle that I encounter is not too hard but it requires some brain exercise on figuiring out which way is the best in cracking the puzzle. But, as the game progress, I found out that some of the puzzle can be easily bypassed by gravity field. It is not game breakiing, but it left me some bad taste in my mouth.In overall, this game set the bar high for any other games in side scrolling and platforming genre. I have tonnes of fun investing my hours into this game whether alone or with my best friend. Playing coop is highly recomended. If you guys into action fantasy type of game, this game is must owned.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Goblin Menace DLC deserves a special mention since it takes the game to a whole new level both in term of variety and features - loaded with new abilities and off the charts looks this is perhaps the best DLC ever created for any game.Topped with brilliant music that soothes you and gels well with the game dynamics - the highs and low provide a perfect blend with the ever changing moments in the game. The really intriguing aspect of the game is the gameplay - a whopping 20+ hours of normal gameplay is not expected specially from an indie developer which obviously came as a surprise. You can stretch anywhere between 40-50 hours if you gunning for 100% achievements.Aside from few lackluster boss level (which is good but not groundbreaking ) and some minor glitches here and there - Trine 2 is a gamer delight - oozing with beautiful graphics, bright colour, great gameplay with ever changing dynamics and tactics makes the game a must have item in your game library. Here's hoping that the next installment will be even more challenging and gorgeous than ever. ",71,22,0,1,6,0,8

												Buy that. Because its awesome and fun. You get to play (and swap if you want) one of three classic paper/rock/scissors characters - mage, warrior and thief. Mage creates and levitates items, warrior can bash things and thief can swing across on a rope and fire different elemental arrows.Each level is unique and insanely beautiful. With hand drawn backgrounds, secrets and amazing music this game has one of the best designs i ever saw.That said - it is rather short. There are however different difficulty settings for hardcore players and it does have some replayability, especially if you can find 2 other decent players.			",103,15,1,19,33,0,33

												Did you want yet more platforming adventures like the original Trine? To once again take on the role of the three intrepid hero’s on another adventure? Then this is definitely the game for you.This game is just stunning to look at. The backgrounds are designed beautifully and drag you into a fantasy world that just screams to be explored. Every level offers something new and exciting. With so many varied climates and locals this really does feel like an epic adventure, even more so than the original.This platformer took everything its predecessor did and multiplied it by 3. The gameplay is super fun, again like the first one there are always multiple ways to finish each challenge, whether it be by brute force or graceful finesse there is a play style to suit you. I loved the differences between each hero and how all their skills complimented each other. The story is great, it has far more depth than the original. With the clues as to what happened scattered throughout the adventure I was very eager to see its conclusion. Also with the addition of the complete story DLC another mini adventure awaits that is very enjoyable. From start to finish this title is phenomenal.I loved this game to no end. I don’t usually like platforming but this is just too good to pass up. Just the right amount of challenge. You would be a fool not to get this even at full price and now with the DLC included there is no excuse not to try this game. Just make sure to play the original one first, after all that game is great too.Have fun ^_^			",226,21,1,16,7,0,15

												I don't want to get into details about the game, because you can try it with the demo version. It is simply beautiful, with enchanting music, not spectacular but good story,  some action and some physics based puzzles. If you are looking for a great couch co-op game, then look no further. Also consider getting the Complete Story pack, but Trine 2 will be the most outstanding part in this bundle. My daughters simply love this game. Thumbs up.P.S. At the moment I keep a tally on two game music composers: Matt Uelmen for Diablo 1/2 and Ari Pulkkinen for Trine 1/2			",122,28,3,18,8,1,19

												Worth every penny. Every single scene in the game is like ♥♥♥♥♥♥s for your eyes. It's a pleasure just to sit for a second and admire the detail that went into every bit of the game. The multiplayer is unbelievably fun, with everyone trying to work together its choas but the best kind. The puzzles are challenging but not to hard that you get annoyed. The storyline isn't amazing but its sweet. The voice acting is enjoyable. The dialog is great with a few dirty jokes thrown in. The characters are great, and you'll fall in love with each of them. If you enjoyed Dust or Castle crashers you'll love this game! The only ""Con"" for me is I occasionally crashed, mostly when trying to host a multiplayer. But you can save at any time, and all-in-all I did not crash enough for it to really put me off. Loved it.			",50,6,0,7,3,0,1

												This is actually what the first Trine should have been! The game looks great, the monsters and the universe are well-designed, the puzzles are entertaining, the action is decent. The story is some ridiculous bull**** which is perfect because nobody plays platformers for the story. Athough I must add t that I would recommend this game only to someone insisting on playing a platfromer.			",31,15,0,1,0,0,0

												This game (much like its predecessor) is a pure masterpiece, and I am convinced that it will be considered as a classic, in the years to come.So, what is it all about? Well, the game combines standard puzzle-platforming with some ""Lost Vikings meets physics"" elements. This is more than enough to get your attention, but Trine franchise doesn't stop there.Graphics, sounds, voice-overs and overall atmosphere in this game are absolutely brilliant. It oozes with ""fairy tale feeling"", so the end result feels like interactive story.To put it short, buy this game (along with the original Trine), because you will enjoy every minute of it!

While the storyline is not a complicated trouble, it allows the player(s) to have a fun and fluid game experience, with few combat encounters and many puzzles, most of them with more than just one way to get over them.Trine 2 allows you to play solo or coop, being the Wizard, the Warrior or the thief, any of them with their own skills, and many puzles will need the combinated partnership of all them. This game goes on his better when you have 2 mates to play with, but still as a solo adventure will grant you many hours of enternaiment.This game offer also a beautiful music and visual experience, whle being a 2D working, Trine 2 shows some incredible scenaries, and the soundtrack will get you deep into the game.

												Trine 2 is everything the gorgeous, satisfying, and creative original Trine was, just a little greater. Each character has a greater selection of abilities which means a greater range of solutions to every problem. The greater number of levels each feel themselves greater: more entrancing, more extravagant, more epic. The storyline... hasn't changed much, which is to say that it still barely exists and that still suits the overall experience. There's no need to play this series in order as there's so little to miss. Even mixing levels from the later Goblin Menace expansion into the main campaign of the original wouldn't lead to much confusion, save for the loss of all those new abilities. The new highest difficulty, however, is noticeably more punishing than the original's, and sadly this isn't a good thing. Trine 2's Hard plus Hardcore setting has more of an effect on combat than any other aspect, which is by far the game's weakest feature. Trine is, after all, a puzzle game at its core and once established, it's difficult to make a puzzle harder without mucking it up with added complexity. And complexity isn't what Trine's about. It's about relatively simple people on a relatively simple quest acting creatively.			",46,31,0,7,6,0,7

												Trine 2 is undoubtedly the sequel Trine deserves. Stepping up and changing several things to make the game somewhat different than it's predecessor. Let's begin with the graphics, for a start. The back drops for each level provide each stage with variety. From lush green woodlands to a witches' home scattered with books, potions etc. Each stage is different and unique. Providing different puzzles and secrets to find. The puzzles are very similar to the first game. Using Amadeus the wizard to move blocks and Zoya to climb up to otherwise unreachable areas, and of course Pontius just killing stuff for the most part. The puzzles do sometimes have a certain level of challenge but for the most part can be solved by knocking heads with your friend(s) and working it out. As I mentioned in the previous review of Trine, this is undoubtedly a series that is best played friends, for the full experience. But if you do happen to be somewhat of a Billy no mates then you can play alone, which does however make the puzzle solving seem a little more difficult. The characters, as previously mentioned are the same as the first game;Zoya the Thief, Amadeus the Wizard and Pontius the knight all with their signature qualities. The level up system still exists as well allowing you to gain various useful abilities to help you solve particular puzzles or just kill enemies quicker. The characters themselves also seem fairly three dimensional, in terms of personality, compared to the first game. Pontius is a kind hearted yet fairly clueless knight. Zoya is a strong willed thief and Amadeus is a fairly cowardly wizard, who at times comes across as a bit of a perv too.Trine 2 is definitely worth a look if you've played the previous iteration of the series or enjoy the challenge of platforming and puzzling. A wonderfully looking game and definitely worth a look. Good Day!			",292,75,3,32,18,0,15

												You and your friends are in a puzzling situation, as there are plants shooting straight upwards in a big gap infront of you, you say to your friend, playing as the thief, ""how should we cross without diing?"" and he says ""i have an idea"" and he switches to the mage, he creates a block and tells you to jump on, you do so, and he slowly moves the crate across the map with his magic ability, once you are across, you switch to the mage, and he jumps on, letting you guide the block towards where you are.In this lovely little game, you will expierience much harder challenges, i just told this one because it was quick enough to tell. This game is truly boring in single player, make sure you have a friend to go along with you :) otherwise the expierience is boring, you can hold up to 3 players, and the server is non-hamachi, so anyone can make it. the graphics, even on lowest setting, look very beautiful and the music is amazing, and if you get its dlc Goblin menace you get a special ability along with the ones you already have, such as, for the thief who wields a bow, a special arrow that once it hits any solid area, will make a big bubble, anything in side the bubble expierences low gravity, this allows players to jump through the bubble and get a bit of a jump boost beause of the low gravity, the special for the knight is he can hold his shield over his head and use it as a glider, the wizard, or mage can magnetize the object he makes, so that he can make an airship, or a platform on a wall, AGAIN YOU CAN ONLY GET THESE THREE POWERS IF YOU DOWNLOAD THE DLC, the dlc also  comes with the complete pack, which happens to be on sale at the moment. Heres someting i love about trine 2, say you are hosting a private server, and you have the dlc, but your friend doesnt (this actually just happened in a match i was in, i had the dlc) what will happen is your friend cant unlock the special powers, but the one with the dlc can, this makes up for some interesting teamwork,magnitize this, low grav bubble that, fly across here.now here is how you unlock powers, you have to collect 50... gems, we will call them, once you collect 50 gems you get one lvl up point, you can use that level up point on abilities. the most points it takes to unlock the ability that requires the most, is 4, and gems arent too rare, but i do suggest trying to get every one you see, the abilities are VERY helpful, maybe you need to solve something so you an get over a wall OR unlock the low gravity bubble and just jump over it, you need to take advantage of the abilities you unlock, they are helpfull.If you seriously read all that, feel free to friend me, and congratulations for being awesome, you diserve  this :)http://www.pinterest.com/pin/341851427934625882/ ",138,17,0,8,13,0,2

												If you play Trine you should defenetly play it with at least one friend because in this game, the enemies are not the riddles or the goblins you encounter. It's your friends because this game has nearly infinite ways for you and your friends to ♥♥♥♥ eachother over, for example you can destroy platforms under your friend to let them fall into certain death, deflect firebolts into your friends, levitate chests so they can't jump up, destroy everything the magician builds or as it happened to me hold a burning explosive barrel above the thief while she's falling down so the rope hits the barrel and instead of beeing safed she pulls herself into the explosion.... I hate my friends.... and my life.10/10 the last time I've hated a friend this much was in Super Mario Party 5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Heres someting i love about trine 2, say you are hosting a private server, and you have the dlc, but your friend doesnt (this actually just happened in a match i was in, i had the dlc) what will happen is your friend cant unlock the special powers, but the one with the dlc can, this makes up for some interesting teamwork,magnitize this, low grav bubble that, fly across here.now here is how you unlock powers, you have to collect 50... gems, we will call them, once you collect 50 gems you get one lvl up point, you can use that level up point on abilities. the most points it takes to unlock the ability that requires the most, is 4, and gems arent too rare, but i do suggest trying to get every one you see, the abilities are VERY helpful, maybe you need to solve something so you an get over a wall OR unlock the low gravity bubble and just jump over it, you need to take advantage of the abilities you unlock, they are helpfull.If you seriously read all that, feel free to friend me, and congratulations for being awesome, you diserve  this :)http://www.pinterest.com/pin/341851427934625882/ ",138,17,0,8,13,0,2

												This game (much like its predecessor) is a pure masterpiece, and I am convinced that it will be considered as a classic, in the years to come.So, what is it all about? Well, the game combines standard puzzle-platforming with some ""Lost Vikings meets physics"" elements. This is more than enough to get your attention, but Trine franchise doesn't stop there.Graphics, sounds, voice-overs and overall atmosphere in this game are absolutely brilliant. It oozes with ""fairy tale feeling"", so the end result feels like interactive story.To put it short, buy this game (along with the original Trine), because you will enjoy every minute of it!

												If you play Trine you should defenetly play it with at least one friend because in this game, the enemies are not the riddles or the goblins you encounter. It's your friends because this game has nearly infinite ways for you and your friends to ♥♥♥♥ eachother over, for example you can destroy platforms under your friend to let them fall into certain death, deflect firebolts into your friends, levitate chests so they can't jump up, destroy everything the magician builds or as it happened to me hold a burning explosive barrel above the thief while she's falling down so the rope hits the barrel and instead of beeing safed she pulls herself into the explosion....

												Great and fun physics platformer that's bigger and better than the first.  You play as three heroes joined together by this magical artifact called the trine and you progress through the levels by switching between the three (mage, rogue fighter).  There are usually multiple ways to solve puzzles but I do think had a little too much emphasis on the mage.  Also has a co-op mode but haven't tried that yet.  Overall fun, and pretty too, game and worth price of admission.			",205,43,1,25,9,0,33

-Quick Review-Trine 2, is a 2D platformer that combines three different heroes into one (if you’re playing single player) or select one hero and work with two or three friends to try to complete the various puzzles in the game.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  You are summoned by the Trine (A mysterious Dwarven object), which links a Wizard “Amadeus” , a Knight “Pontius” and a thief/entrepreneur “Zoya” together to save the kingdom. The story itself is put together like a bed time story, very straight forward and amusing to listen to.Game Play: (note, at this time 06/20/14 – I have not played the original Trine) As has been hinted above in the story section, you can switch between three very different heroes. You can actually complete the levels without switching at all, but generally switching makes solving puzzles much easier.There is a little bit of combat where you need to smash in some Goblin heads, but the most challenging aspect of the game is the environments which are definitely out to kill me. Plenty of death holes in the ground.There is also a quaint leveling system in the game, when you collect “experience orbs” you level up and are given a skill point to assign to a character and ability. By upgrading skills you make puzzle solving much easier and often times dynamic. I’ve solved puzzles with Amadeus’s boxes that I could have done faster and easier the “correct way”. But that aspect gives the game a sense of freedom.Multi-player:  I had the privilege to play this game with a friend, and let me say this game is amazingly more fun to play with one or two friends. The difference is that if you are playing with others, you are limited to which character you play as. If you’re playing with just one friend, which leaves one free character either of you can switch or rotate with. (For us, it was Pontius… Sorry buddy, you’re good at fighting, not at plat forming). Achievements: Here’s the basic break down for the achievements: Collect all the things, Find all the things, Do a few special things with each character, then Beat the game on Hard core mode on Hard difficulty, and you’ll have all the achievements.The game has 97 achievements, I was surprised that a game like Trine 2 had so many achievements, but it provided a great deal of entertainment and a fair bit of replay-ability to get the rest of the achievements.Price: The price for Trine 2 is $19.99. I played 30 hours (and that will increase as I work on getting the hard core achievements) that is a pretty fair price for how much time I’ve put into it. Good news though! We are in the Steam Summer sale (06/20/14)! The game is on sale right now for 85% off, in other words the game is $2.99 That is a great deal, if you’ve been wanting to play a platformer puzzle fantasy game, now is your time. You have until June 30th to get it at this current price.If you’re still not sure if you’d like to play it or not, you can also download a demo to test out first; you can’t be persuaded anymore than that. Conclusion: I really enjoyed the game. If you’re just looking to relax and play a fantasy adventure game, I highly recommend this game. It was fun to play, not overly difficult however the Hardcore kicked my butt; it’s not something you’ll just waltz through. But the easiest difficulties make the game seem very friendly.

												WOW! What an improvement over the first one!Mostly pros and a few cons.Pros:- The first game was stunning and this just blew me away with how much it improved over the first game - It has better puzzles- More level traversing mechanics that work REALLY well- More character skills that are easier to execute- No mana (this was mostly superfluous in the first game)- Enemy battles are more engaging- Much more fluid controls  > Using the Rogue's grappling hook to get on to a platform from underneath is much easier > The ability for my character to make it onto a platform with a jump is much more lenient > Easier to summon and destroy things with the Wizard (quick squiggle = box, botched line = plank (yay) instead of box (boo), which was frustrating from the first game)- I can read the narration and skip faster to get into the level as a resultCons:- The only thing they haven't improved from the first game is that the Rogue needs a grappling hook aim when using a controller as she often latches onto the wrong platform or the wrong part of a platform. The grappling hook should also be able to retract further making it as easy as it should be to get on to platforms (despite that they somewhat improved this from the first game).- Things that are CLEARLY made of wood can't be grappled on to- Spiders sometimes spawn camp and this can become a little annoying- The camera is appalling in so many instances (normally too zoomed in) and it would be far better with a player controlled zoom function!

												One of my most favourite games on Steam!!The graphics are beautiful. The puzzles are fun. Collecting all of the experience is a great hunt!Figuring out how to make best use of each character is fun. The wizard is crafty, the thief is acrobatic and the knight is your muscle and defense. The levels are longer than the first game. Hard + Hardcore mode can be quite challenging in quite a few of the levels. Replayability is great too.			",66,81,0,26,5,1,5

												Purchased this title on sale on a whim since it is co-op and it sat untouched in my library for a year(the Steam curse).  I finally got around to trying it out with a friend and I regret not trying it sooner.Pros:-Artwork is really stunning.-Puzzles are fun without being frustrating-Variety in the characters makes for a unique experience-Variety in level design with hidden areas abound.  Was very surprised at the level of exploration given the game's nature.-Co-op players aren't ""screen-locked"" to each other so you are free to explore above, below, and beyond your other mates.Cons:-Puzzles lean towards simplistic however working co-op with someone on them makes them enjoyable none-the-less-Controls are ""okay"".  At some points they are crisp and responsive but there are a few motions/jumps that feel a bit wonky.  While occasionally frustrating, not a deal breaker.  Have not tried with a gamepad, that might be part of the issue. -While there is no ""screen-lock"", if another player reaches a checkpoint bubble, you will be teleported to them no matter what you are doing.  Once realized it is fairly simple to avoid but some puzzles do not allow you to double back after being ported out.Trine 2 is a solid buy, particularly if you have friends to run co-op with.  The environment, story, and stunning artwork combined with crisp and exciting gameplay make it one of the best co-op platformers I have ever played.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was a huge fan of Trine1, the atmosphere, gameplay, music and puzzles were great. I was unsure how they could make Trine2 any better, Oh, how I was wrong. Frozenbyte did an amazing job with this new installment of the game. The game seems like art, it's very colourful with amazing background imagery while you're playing throughout the game, and the music fits right in. This is a very pretty game to play and be amazed. The way Trine2 is played is pretty much exactly the same as Trine1 with a little bit of differences, like the skill trees.COOP has been a lot of fun with 2 or 3 players. It can get a bit chaotic(and hard) if you're not working together and just missing around.If you played through Trine1 and enjoyed it, you will love this game. I would highly recommend picking up this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Part 2 of the Trine story. The trine returns to our heroes, the rogue, wizard and fighter and takes them on another journey, which doesn't last very long, yet is entertaining and very fun to play out in coop.The Complete Story also features some post-story gameplay about a Goblin vendetta against the human race. This game has some awesome graphics and offers a ton of laughs when playing together with a buddy.Final verdict 8/10+Neat story, very fun in coop, great graphics in each of the levels- Some puzzles are harder to solve than the end bosses are to defeat			",207,42,1,22,27,0,25

												A trine is a group of three. It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix.The first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. There is always something amazing to distract you. Trine 2 easily makes for one of the prettiest games of the year.  If you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me ""have fun,"" -- and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is.It does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizards platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long.When playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flame thrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying.The few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though.			",305,66,10,50,25,5,73

												I'll be honest. I didn't even try the single-player. I played the co-op mode and it was one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had. The graphics and music are beautiful, the voices are fitting to the characters, and the chance to choose a character with unique abilities really helps to cater to the strengths of individual players.If you're looking for a great co-op (or single player, I assume) game, definitely try this one.

												Hi There;I got this game ""some sales ago"" as a gift for my kids. It's a sidescroller alright but in such a way that you have the feeling you are playing a 3rd person game. The game is an absolute gem. There is a lot of detail and the colors and lightning are superb. The atmosphere is amazing. My kids play it together on the bigscreen with two controllers. I must say that if you are not used to controllers this game can be difficult at some points but my kids are flying through the environment.It starts easy but as you advance everything on your path will test or kill youAllong the way can (well must) pick up vials thats give you XP. There is a talenttree for each of the 3 chars you can play with to boost weapons or unlock other weapons or abilities and can be (re)set whenever you want so your chars got the proper tools for the fight.Just buy this game alright!!! And get the 3-pack so your friends can join you			",75,5,0,1,3,0,6

												I rarely/never play 2D platformers mainly because I generally don't enjoy them. But Trine 2 is the only exception. The vibrant and elegant graphic style were breathtaking, the story telling felt like a fairy tale story that parents read to their children at night. The gameplay was great, a tradtional 2D physics platform with a simple skill tree system which balances out really well. This game is truly an indie masterpiece.

												One of my most favourite games on Steam!!The graphics are beautiful. The puzzles are fun. Collecting all of the experience is a great hunt!Figuring out how to make best use of each character is fun. The wizard is crafty, the thief is acrobatic and the knight is your muscle and defense. The levels are longer than the first game. Hard + Hardcore mode can be quite challenging in quite a few of the levels. Replayability is great too.			",66,81,0,26,5,1,5

												TL;DR: You can't go wrong with this game and if it's on sale I recommend that you buy it at once!GRAPHICS:It has really beautiful graphics with a great attention to detail. I can't think of any platformer that could match Trine 2 at that.Look on youtube or at some screenshots to see the beauty that is Trine 2.GAMEPLAY:The platforming mechanics are well done, but it even get's better - since you have three playable character that you can switch at any time this means that you get three different playstyles: a wizard, a rogues and a warrior. The rogues and the warrior have some interesting tricks, but the wizard was the most interesting because it's quite different from what you usually do in a platformer. The wizard cannot shoot fireballs, but instead he can create boxes and planks or various sizes, move objects using telekinesis and do many other things. This makes solving the games puzzles even more interesting.MULTIPLAYER:If that isn't enough you can get two friends to play with you and make the game into a different, very enjoyable co-op puzzle solving and platforming experience.VERDICT:I definitely recommend this game to anyone that has even the slightest interest in it and if you don't look at some screenshots or video...and then buy this game! :)			",191,74,5,23,18,1,12

												Trine 2 is a wonderful experience that is best enjoyed with a friend or two. The cooperative play is surprisingly fluid, with multiple ways to solve a puzzle and work together with any of the three classes (even your own). The game's technology and general look is far from outdated, and is still quite pretty even when compared to more recent titles. All in all, this is another must-have to add to your collection.

												Part 2 of the Trine story. The trine returns to our heroes, the rogue, wizard and fighter and takes them on another journey, which doesn't last very long, yet is entertaining and very fun to play out in coop.The Complete Story also features some post-story gameplay about a Goblin vendetta against the human race. This game has some awesome graphics and offers a ton of laughs when playing together with a buddy.Final verdict 8/10+Neat story, very fun in coop, great graphics in each of the levels- Some puzzles are harder to solve than the end bosses are to defeat			",207,42,1,22,27,0,25

												Trine 2 is an amazing game. Especially with 3-player co-op. It is more of a puzzle type game with you having to work with each team member (who each have special abilities) to complete a certain area. The graphic are one of the stand out features hovever. The world looks so beautiful especially the water, the underwater areas are the best looking parts of the game.I would recommend this game, however, after about 3 hours of playing, the areas began to feel a bit repetitive in terms of gameplay, but still a great game in general.8/10			",8,0,0,0,9,0,3

												Holy hot dang! Frozenbyte finally delivered a great game! Trine 2 is everything the first Trine should have been. Trine's main faults, IMO, were brought by its level design, where every obstacle could easily be passed by simply exploiting a single character, often ""breaking"" the feel of how progression should have gone. Now just about every screen feels like it was exquisitely planned out. It's brilliant, and not only that, it's gorgeous! Godddddd, is Trine 2 ever purdy!Also fun as the mfin' dickens to play with friends.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

PROS:+ awesome gameplay mechanics with 3 characters+ level design+ skils/powers of each character+ fairy tale story+ visual look+ online co-opCONS:- couple of bugs/glitches- removed items from first gameComment:A fantastic and gorgeous game, loads of fun when you play with your friends! It takes what Trine gave us and enhances it through online co-op and 20(!) levels. The enemies are more difficult this time but the gameplay still revolves around puzzle solving and obstacle removing/dodging. If you loved the first game you will love this. They even added various difficulties including Hardcore mode which does not let your characters respawn until you reach the next checkpoint. I can really recommend this game to both casual and hardcore gamers.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Played with 2 of my friends. Had lots of fun. Never played Trine 1.This game is very similar to Little Big Planet, however there is a specific role and abilities each player has. In order to progress through the game players have to use skills in combination. Some levels can be completed with only 1 or 2 players using their abilities in sequence. Other leves require all 3 players to communicate in which sequence they are going to use their abilites. Needless to say it provides lots of fun when things don't go as planned and someone keeps messing up that sequence of abilities.			",28,3,1,2,2,0,2

												Beautiful game, I bought it to have something to play with my little sister and I played it twice, the first time to make sure that it wasn't too brutal or spooky or anything as my sister is only 7yo and the game is usk 12, and then a second time with her.On a high difficulty setting the game is rather challenging, but you can also turn it down and switch on things like friendly levitation so you have a really relaxed an casual experience / can enjoy the game with your little sister that isn't yet used to the concept of pressing buttons to make a character jump/attack etc.The Co-op is really fun and works really well, better than playing alone and switching between the 3 protagonists.The Story is also nice, although not the main selling point of the game in my opinion.If this game is on sale for 2.50 or whatever it is an absolut must buy and at 10 bucks it is definitely still worth it!

												Trine 2 is Very Enchanting, Mystical and Fun!  A Side Scroller, platform, puzzle Game with everything thrown in to make it feel like you are at Fantasy Land in Disneyland. Choose from three different characters. Wizard/Thief/ Knight. All three can be used during gameplay. Certan situations call for each proffesion. Although it is possible to complete the game with only one. The music is very magical in tone. This adds to the enchantment. The graphics are beautiful and very rich in color. You will pause from time to time to look around. It's that captivating! Throw in a fantastic story with good voice acting for each character......... Oh Sheeooot! I can ramble on till the next day about how great Trine 2 is JUST GO BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!! You won't be dissapointed.  ",124,12,0,8,12,0,16

												Steam sales have ruined me.I honestly forgot about this game because I had it on the back burner. I played 20 min, then switched to some other game I was dying to play after a steam sale, and then forgot about Trine 2. Never again. I'm so sorry Trine 2. You didn't deserve my neglect. But you were worth the wait.I seriously love this game. If you like platforming/puzzle games like Rochard, you will love this game. Granted, I have not finished it yet, but I had to stop mid game to say that I'm seriously impressed. This game offers the beautiful styling of a 2D platformer of the modern genre, yet offers a unique twist. There is an RPG element of leveling a class of character. And you get 3 primary characters to level and play at any given time. With 3 different classes to evolve and switch between at any given moment.... That's a mouthful. It sounds confusing but it's easy once you experience it. Lets say you have an enemy that is best suited to be taken down with brute force. Push left bumper, swittch to my brawler and take them down. 3 seconds later, I have a puzzle that requires some blocks to be moved around. Push left bumber, switch to my wizard. Move those blocks with my magic. 3 seconds later I have an obsticle that requires a finess jump. Push left bumper, switch to my archer/acrobat. Jump over that obsicle. It's really just fun. Pure and simple. If you like platformers. If you like modern, rich graphic, puzzle solving platformers, then I bet you will enjoy this game. I'll update this review after I finish the game... but so far I'm thoroughly impressed.			",90,11,0,8,2,0,3

												The second installment of trinity: galactic expedia unleashed, breaks new ground in the gaming landscape. Trinity, or Trin for short is a tale about Duncon Stone, a recently rehabilitated drug addict recovering from severe trauma at an asylum in baltimore. Duncon, or dunk as the inmates call him was a former software engineer for microsoft but after raising a mutiny against steve jobs he was publically executed on the streets of johanesberg where he worked. What they didnt expect was that his corpse was exported to colombo where the doctors worked on him. they utilised various new implants and turned him into a man like machine called the Trine. Trine is a code name for the project, Transplant Ressurected infantry of new Eden. New eden is a bioengineering cartel that spans oceanic borders that funnels billions of dollars worth of biotechnology and unlicensed equipment into key geographic areas. The TRINE project is an attempt to create a global po-lice force designed to implement a new regime once individual governments topple following an expected economic collapse post global financial fiasco. As a Trine unit you are subordinate to your task master, some inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who goes by the name of ""the cammel's muel"".  CM is what the guys in the lab call him, but to Duncan stone he is the epicentre of a world of suffering under his rule. CM send you all over the globe doing secret missions to merge and consolidate important equipment under his roof. On one uneventful escort mission to secure a new type of balistics device, Duncon gets hit by the typical natural disarster employed in all games these days, you guessed it.. lightaning!. that's right, he takes a bolt to the head which fries the inhibitor chip that CM daddy uses to control him. But the other players know this. and they're coming for you. The game then turns into its multiplayer feature here, which is essentially a treadmil of experiance grinding in order to gear up for the boss fight back in the New eden facility. Its very uninspired and doesent add much to whats already out there in terms of Trinity's mian competitors, namely farming simulator 2000 and football manager 2014. In any case you get some cool guns and the matchmaking system is okay. Once youre geared up you get to face off against the cammels muel in an all star battle of the ages. We're back to single player here now guys just for the record. after a grindy battle of tearing down his health and toking up on heal potions through the entire fight you eventually kill him. Unfortunately for stone, the facility does actually explode trapping him in the compartment underneath. THe game ends with duncon stone putting himself into cryosleep since he is faced with no other alternitive. This sory arc therefore is the prequel of Demolition Man, which aired in the 80's. Overall, not a bad film. Demolition man had some cool plot twists and the actor played the part well. 4/10 in terms of special effects, the 80's dont really compare to where we are today. Either way, if youre keep to tune into some good old fashioned film, Demolition man is the way to go.Until next time, stay snazzy!			",93,6,2,7,5,0,17

												Holy hot dang! Frozenbyte finally delivered a great game! Trine 2 is everything the first Trine should have been. Trine's main faults, IMO, were brought by its level design, where every obstacle could easily be passed by simply exploiting a single character, often ""breaking"" the feel of how progression should have gone. Now just about every screen feels like it was exquisitely planned out. It's brilliant, and not only that, it's gorgeous! Godddddd, is Trine 2 ever purdy!Also fun as the mfin' dickens to play with friends.			",728,235,9,105,37,7,84

												I simply wouldn't change anything on this game.Graphic is top-notch, sound effects are nice and music is awesome. Graphic and music together create on the player a relaxing magic world feeling that kills any stress (also because puzzles are not hard if done with all 3 characters).I loved the irony of the dialogues between the 3 characters that more than once made me literally roll on floor laughing.Now, the gameplay part. The game is quite easy BUT there are challenges (such as achievements) so that even if the puzzles are easy, they ""suggest"" what to do to make them harder.To sum things up, this is one of the best games I ever played (works on linux too) and I enjoyed every hour I spent on this. I strongly suggest you to buy it.			",325,125,7,44,34,2,49

												Not only a game that I played with my girlfriend (and that I could play with my girlfriend in the first place), but one that gave an equally good, fun and fullfililng experience for the both of us. We enjoyed every moment of it, working together solving interesting (not frustrating) puzzles, jumping around in one of the best looking game environments I have ever seen; and the co-operative aspect of lending each other a hand where neededI cannot make statements about the solo experience of this game. However, if you have someone in mind/have someone you want to play a game with, this easily is a no-brainer. I am sure you will not regret it. We like it so much we are planning on going back to the first trine because we wanted more and will buy trine 3 whenever it releases. Coming back to trine 2 if you are looking for a great a co-operative experience in a perfectly designed world and don't mind doing some thinking, besides the jumping and fighting; this is the game for you. Pro's:- Amazing world- Interesting puzzles- Great co-op- Cool character dynamics- Almost perfect mix platform/puzzle/fight elementsCon's:- Average at best story (dont play it for the story)- No tactical aspect within fighting; feels like a (thinking/puzzle) layer could be addedGrade: 8,5 (must own within this genre)Part of DoubleR's Hall of Exceptional Games (DHEG)DoubleR's Mark of Originality			",78,20,7,26,24,0,7

												Coming off it's success of Trine, Trine has lost none of it's glamour, and in the process has added only everything wonderful. I really enjoyed the first trine. It's story, music, gameplay, all of it was generally delightful, allbeit short. Trine 2 follows wonderfully in it's footsteps.Here we find our three heroes not really looking for adventure per say, but the Trine once again find it for them. This time they are taken off to save a world of enchantment and a battle between sisters. In the process they find themselves fighting goblins. There is no reason to argue with story line here, as the story is short, succinct, not complicated, and enjoyable for the game. In terms of gameplay, Trine 2 builds on it's predecessor, working out many of the physics kinks that were so lauded. The characters do basically the same thing, with the addition of a few extras - the knights glide, and magnet shield, the thiefs special gravity arrow, and ability to hide herself, and the wizards magnetic objects, and ability to trap enemies inside boxes, as well as ability to pick up enemies. All in all, the gameplay of this game is smooth and for the most part without problems. 9.5/10In terms of graphics, Trine 2 looks superb. The artists who worked the concepts of this game have done a phenomenal job yet again. The colours, the look, and the increased depth make this side-scroller look even better. The graphics themselves could be a little nicer, sharper, and slightly more realistic in some areas - the characters for instance - but all in all this game is more than pleasing on the eyes. 9/10Music in this game is one thing that I really enjoy. The embience coupled with the wonderful sound track is above par. Music is a lost art when it comes to video games sometimes, but Trine 2, like it's predecessor, does an excellent job of creating wonderful atmosphere and putting the right music at the right time. And just add in here, the narration of Trine 2 is just as fun as the first. 9.5/10 (BTW, I'm a music teacher)Co-op is such a hard thing to get right. It's hard to know when it's too much, or when it's not enough. It's a good thing that co-op over the internet was added to this game. It makes it so much more fun to play that way. The only drawaback to this games co-op is the same as last times, the controller configuration. More often then I would like to admit, the control configurations seem to be out of wack. Responding to the wrong thing, or not working at all. Multiple keyboards is still an impossible task sometimes. The co-op itself is fun to play with friends, but if the work on controller configuration were fixed the co-op would be even more fun. 8.5/10Overall, this game is wonderful. It can be short, or long, depending on what you plan to do with it. It can be easy, or you can challenge yourself, as I have, to find new ways to beat certain areas. If you find it too easy, put it in hardcore mode, on hard, then give it a whirl. Enjoy the colours, the embience, and try and find a friend to play this game with you. You won't win any major tournaments while shooting dozens of people, but you will find yourself enjoying the fact that you've made it through a game using your brain.

												i'll give this game a 9/10.  what this game is, is fun. its a bit challenging playing solo, though with 2 of your friends this game is the perfect amount of challenging to where you can just chill and talk to friends and play the game. graphics are obviously stunning, especially with sweetfx on, not much else i can say about them other than them being great.  many of the puzzles have multiple ways to be completed while playing with friends, many of those involve using your upgrades to kind of cheat the system, either way you end up with the same result. many of the bosses are quite underwhelming, most can be beaten in under 20 seconds, this is my only real complaint about the game.  just as the boss fights, the game isnt very long either, on a casual run with friends and all dlc included, i completed the game in about 10 hours.  the soundtrack is great, i could probably listen to it for fun.  theres some very small issues with the game, dead enemies stuttering occasionally, things like that (none of which are of any real concern to me.) overall its a great game and for the three dollars i paid for it on the steam sale, it was more than worth it.

												Trine 2 is a 2-D puzzle platform game. Unlike games like Braid and Vessel, there are multiple ways to solve each puzzle. Overall it is a lot of fun, there is a good mix of thoughtful puzzle solving and fast-twitch action and platform jumping. There are three characters with different abilities. Most puzzles are obviously designed for one character, but in a lot of cases you can solve them with multiple characters. It is fun to figure out the ""knight"" solution to a ""wizard"" puzzle. Also, there are additional challenges in addition to progressing through the game: experience pickups and chests. You can win extra achievements by getting all the experience pickups and chests for a level. There is a decent amount of replayability, although I had enough playing it through once. There are an obscene number of achievements available for this game, overkill if you ask me. There is a lot of content here, I have played ~19 hours so far without going back to replay any of the levels to pick up more achievements. The background graphics are very pretty and imaginative, althoug they obscure things sometimes. Overall I can recommend this game as a fun 2-D puzzle platform game, with a low price and tons of content.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the greatest puzzle game I've ever played, and it's not too hard puzzles, you sure have to think for the solutions once in a while but it stops there. You don't need to sit for hours thinking of what you should do next to advance further.*Excellent co-op both local and online.*The achievements are fair and glitch free (compared to lots of other games that's bugged and won't register what you've done.).*Good music, atmosphere and easy controls. There is really nothing negative about this game, not that I can come and think of.I enjoyed this game a lot and would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good time playing with a friend (or alone).

												Purchased this title on sale on a whim since it is co-op and it sat untouched in my library for a year(the Steam curse).  I finally got around to trying it out with a friend and I regret not trying it sooner.Pros:-Artwork is really stunning.-Puzzles are fun without being frustrating-Variety in the characters makes for a unique experience-Variety in level design with hidden areas abound.  Was very surprised at the level of exploration given the game's nature.-Co-op players aren't ""screen-locked"" to each other so you are free to explore above, below, and beyond your other mates.Cons:-Puzzles lean towards simplistic however working co-op with someone on them makes them enjoyable none-the-less-Controls are ""okay"".  At some points they are crisp and responsive but there are a few motions/jumps that feel a bit wonky.  While occasionally frustrating, not a deal breaker.  Have not tried with a gamepad, that might be part of the issue. -While there is no ""screen-lock"", if another player reaches a checkpoint bubble, you will be teleported to them no matter what you are doing.  Once realized it is fairly simple to avoid but some puzzles do not allow you to double back after being ported out.Trine 2 is a solid buy, particularly if you have friends to run co-op with.  The environment, story, and stunning artwork combined with crisp and exciting gameplay make it one of the best co-op platformers I have ever played.   ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Choose from three different characters. Wizard/Thief/ Knight. All three can be used during gameplay. Certan situations call for each proffesion. Although it is possible to complete the game with only one. The music is very magical in tone. This adds to the enchantment. The graphics are beautiful and very rich in color. You will pause from time to time to look around. It's that captivating! Throw in a fantastic story with good voice acting for each character......... Oh Sheeooot!

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous physics-based 3D platformer, and it’s meant to be experienced with friends. The most important difference from the original Trine is that this game supports three-player co-op over the internet. It may seem like a ""well, duh"" feature, but it makes a world of difference over the previous local-only game.By building on its successes rather than messing with its entertaining gameplay, Trine 2's simple concept of trekking toward the right side of the screen feels more like an otherworldly adventure than just another platformer. The abilities of your three playable characters - Wizard, Rogue, and Warrior - synergize superbly. Though at times you may feel overly dependent on another character's unique skills, the often misplaced trust you put in your friends’ talent will generally lead to hilarious and unintended successes. Frequently, the way to figure out a puzzle is to throw yourself at it until you discover a solution. A side-effect of this is death, but thankfully, it’s hardly a penalty. As long as one character remains alive and makes it to one of the many checkpoints in a level, the others are instantly revived. If everybody dies, all progress is saved and everybody is reincarnated at the latest checkpoint. This serves the flow of the game well, because your sense of adventure is never punished; indeed, being practically immortal in a platformer is surprisingly fun!Don’t expect much from the story; other than giving a reason to run to the right, it exists only to provide context to Trine 2’s challenges and puzzles. The reward for figuring out each scenario is mainly a sense of progression – but it works. Progression could mean accumulating experience potions that grant each character improved skills or new abilities, or it could mean discovering hard-to-reach chests that contain pieces of concept art or a narrated stanza from the main antagonist’s journal. Simply getting to the next level is often reward enough, because this game’s vibrant visuals are stunning.Trine 2's artistic merit is absolutely jaw-dropping. The title screen alone sets the bar for the rest of the game. (Try starting the game at different times during the day!) Half of my play-time was spent taking in the stunningly beautiful backdrops and set pieces. I felt guilty when I solved a puzzle without fully admiring the obscene amount of effort put into the graphical presentation of this game. The quality is consistently superb - worthy of your attention all the way through to the last chapter - and every shade of the rainbow gets a feature performance. The fun to be had in applying home-brewed solutions to solving puzzles with your friends is what sustains Trine 2 until its end. Along with constantly being rewarded with beautiful vistas and remarkably decorated interiors, finding all the hidden goodies will definitely tempt your inner completionist. Although you may need to set personal goals to warrant a second play-through, Trine 2 is a very entertaining game to play over a week with one or two of your friends.			",132,12,2,10,9,0,14

												Definitely a game worth playing! The level design is just beautiful to look at and the story line is cute and quirky. Even the dlc does not disappoint. I am unsure though whether the game gets more fun with the co-op or is just capped out at fun...nah, playing with friends makes everything better. Even if it can't get any better, such is life. 9/10 :D			",99,17,1,29,4,0,3

												While not quite the masterpiece Trine 1 was, Trine 2 is still a very good game.The difficulty was lowered for some reason, which is a move I can't understand since the first one was too easy in my eyes. The characters are mostly the same - though they seem to have lost their mana bar, and some abilities too.The inventory is gone, and with it all the relics you could collect. Instead, you get artwork and poems in hidden chests.The levels are still as beautiful as before - and with the ""complete story"" edition they'll last you far longer than the original Trine did.All in all, it's more of the same - and since Trine 1 was so short and fun, I don't mind that one bit.

												Trine 2 is a puzzle/adventure platforming game as ingenious as it is stunning. If you like puzzles, thinking outside of the box, and... bopping goblins? You will probably fall in love with Trine 2 in a heartbeat!Below is a list of attributes pertaining to Trine 2, and some personal opinion in regards to how they did.STORY: 4/10""Feels like it's missing something... Oh, yes! More goblins!""I'll give Trine 2 a cookie for being relatively unique compared to most other games. The execution is fine, though the game does leave you feeling like there should be more. Additionally, some aspects of the plot can be seen coming a mile away. Fortunately, there's at least one or two good twists in store. For the sake of spoilers though, I won't disclose them here. The story of Trine 2's is not one to be taken seriously.Of course, you weren't looking to play this for the story, were you?GAMEPLAY: 7/10""Think of it as a test of manhood. Or mousehood.""Earning a few extra points for its fairly clever implementation of skills and the three heroes, Trine 2 really lets you play the game in your own style, be it through finesse, sheer force, or stuffing boxes into sacred places they clearly don't belong! If you get stuck at some point or confused, the narrator offers some clues on how to proceed. Compared to most games that babysit you along, this is much more preferrable.Admittedly, the controls do take a little getting used to, and even Normal Difficulty can be downright brutal if you're new to the game. Thankfully, a lot of the achievements (if you're OCD like I am) can be obtained without getting your rear end handed to you. Some are possible right at the main menu! *Hint, hint.*DESIGN: 10/10""No pixel was spared.""Trine 2 is outrageously beautiful. Beautiful to the point of losing sight of your character on the screen! ... Seriously, this happened to me playing it. But that's okay because Trine 2 is a literal slideshow of eye candy and scenic splendor. Rewarding to watch just in its own right. Being able to play in it, let alone interact with it, is an added bonus.Perhaps the nicest part about its shiny graphics is that you don't have to cash in on your life insurance policy to make a system capable of running it. Even with a simple dual-core PC, Trine 2 runs magnificently at high detail.SUMMARY: 7 out of 10.Normally, I detest games that emphasize graphics since they usually have horrible gameplay and/or story about as in-depth as a piece of cardboard. Trine 2's storyline isn't the greatest, but it makes up for it in its unique and fluid style, gameplay, as well as the lovely panoramic scenes the game immerses you into. It's a game that isn't trying to sell you some epic story or brand-spanking new mechanic... It's just fun to play! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An absolutely awesome game with beautiful graphic and completely stunning soundtrack. Where you play as one of three heroes (or as all of them if you are playing alone): Amadeus a wizard who can conjure boxes out of nothing, Zoya a thief with a grappling hook and a bow with a quiver full of arrows with special abilities, and Pontius a brave knight seeking worthy quests. With this trio you will have to solve puzzles to save a kingdom. This is one of my favorite games and i totally recommend it.      9,9/10			",13,1,0,1,0,1,2

												Let me first just say the obligatory fact that this game is BEAUTIFUL. Normally not something I would think of as a defining quality of a 2D puzzle game, but it... you just gotta play it yourself to see just how amazing this game looks. I suppose because it IS 2D, it runs great on lower end machines while being able to still stay beautiful.As far as gameplay, it is a fun combination of puzzle, platforming and combat elements. There are three characters each with a defining set of abilities that work brilliantly together. They aren't complicated, but when put together with the crafty environment it really just makes for a plain FUN game! I would reccomend getting a buddy to play it with sometimes as well. Maybe we have missed something, but the way the multiplayer seems to work is that basically someone will be able to ""drop in"" on someone's story and be able to go through it together. This becomes a problem because one of use ends up going back and playing through something again, but it isn't too terribly bad. You find there were different ways to solve puzzles and then have fun trying to naviate with anothe player (and enjoy the scenery of course!).So, yes I would reccomend this game! I was doubtful at first, but it has come together to be a very enjoyable game from all fronts. I haven't completed the story yet, but it introduces new mechanics and new environments enough that it dosen't become monotonous. Awesome game!			",42,11,6,4,4,0,0

												An absolutely gem. My girlfriend, myself, and my brother eagerly blazed through this game and enjoyed pretty much every minute of it. The combat can seem a little cheesy, but the rest of the game is gold. Rarely is my breath taken away by sidescrollers, and yet the sheer beauty and complexity of the game had me dying for more. If there was a sequel, I'd preorder it in a heartbeat -- probably three copies. =D			",86,10,0,11,2,0,1

												Not only a game that I played with my girlfriend (and that I could play with my girlfriend in the first place), but one that gave an equally good, fun and fullfililng experience for the both of us. We enjoyed every moment of it, working together solving interesting (not frustrating) puzzles, jumping around in one of the best looking game environments I have ever seen; and the co-operative aspect of lending each other a hand where neededI cannot make statements about the solo experience of this game. However, if you have someone in mind/have someone you want to play a game with, this easily is a no-brainer. I am sure you will not regret it. We like it so much we are planning on going back to the first trine because we wanted more and will buy trine 3 whenever it releases. Coming back to trine 2 if you are looking for a great a co-operative experience in a perfectly designed world and don't mind doing some thinking, besides the jumping and fighting; this is the game for you. Pro's:- Amazing world- Interesting puzzles- Great co-op- Cool character dynamics- Almost perfect mix platform/puzzle/fight elementsCon's:- Average at best story (dont play it for the story)- No tactical aspect within fighting; feels like a (thinking/puzzle) layer could be addedGrade: 8,5 (must own within this genre)Part of DoubleR's Hall of Exceptional Games (DHEG)DoubleR's Mark of Originality			",78,20,7,26,24,0,7

												A game where you have 3 characters, which you can use in lan and online co-op! Amazing game for people who like RPG and puzzle games. Use Amadeus the wizard to kill enemies with boxes and build your way up. Use Zoya the thief to grapple on just about anything made of wood, and swing to the other side of the map, and kill your enemies with your bow and stealth. Use Pontius the knight to slash your way thorugh the enemies and break walls with your hammer of destruction!I would say, fun for everyone.			",51,6,2,10,7,0,7

												Great game.  The story is a bit boring and you never really feel connected to the story or the characters, but the scenary is some of the best I have ever seen in a side scroller.  I played the first one, and I'm happy to say that the Wizard has been nerfed a bit.  It is now much harder to kill enemies with his boxes, but almost every puzzle can be solved with him still.  The game play is fun, but not too challenging, and the game is very forgiving since it puts spawn points after every puzzle, or even half way through a long one.  To sum it up, it is a great game to play with some friends and have a good time checking out the amazing scenery, but if you are just trying to find a good solo game with a good story, look elsewhere.

												If you liked the first one. Get this. The DLC is totally worth it as well. The DLC is five stages long and a sixth stage that's simply a boss fight. New enemies, new locations, new skills, new bosses and just quality all throughout. It's what DLC should be.If you haven't played the first one well, then... it's a puzzle platformer with action elements. Perfect for kids and the difficulties range from beginner friendly to rather difficult.			",241,87,0,34,9,0,18

												Playing it by urself its an awesome game with challenging puzzles and fight scenes, playing it with a friend or two the puzzles and fight scenes are both easier but the fun factor rises by a ton!I've played it with two friends and we all enjoyed it tremendously!It's worth a buy either way but i defenitly recommand the multiplayer option as the best way to play it.few more points worth mentioning is that i have never seen a 2D game that looks this stunning (hence the amount of screen shots i've took) and that you dont need to play the first Trine game before this one (even though it was also pretty great).

												This game is amazing!!! The graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is really fun, and the co-op works great! The game is ment to be played with three people, although the single player is alright, in order to get the most out of this game, find two friends to play it with. All the puzles really work well in testing the players' ability to cooperate. Each character has their strengths and weaknesses, making it necessary to work together.As you play along, you get skill points to spend to upgrade your character, which can be refunded if you decide to switch characters with a friend.Over all, without giving too much away about this game, I have to say that it is a must buy. If you enjoy 2.5D games, puzzle games, co-op games, or even just hack-and-slash games, this is something you would enjoy.8.5/10			",70,4,0,9,3,1,2

												That's, probably, the most beaautiful game I've ever seen. But  gameplay-wise I like the 1st Trine better. 'Enchanted edition' makes it look good, it also adds coop, and I just prefer the old ways of playing. There was no need to fix something that had not been broken, imo. But still that's a great game, a jewel in many ways. Beautiful, stylish, magical, colourfull and sparkling. 100% Worth playing.			",49,20,1,7,1,0,2

												i'll give this game a 9/10.  what this game is, is fun. its a bit challenging playing solo, though with 2 of your friends this game is the perfect amount of challenging to where you can just chill and talk to friends and play the game. graphics are obviously stunning, especially with sweetfx on, not much else i can say about them other than them being great.  many of the puzzles have multiple ways to be completed while playing with friends, many of those involve using your upgrades to kind of cheat the system, either way you end up with the same result. many of the bosses are quite underwhelming, most can be beaten in under 20 seconds, this is my only real complaint about the game.  just as the boss fights, the game isnt very long either, on a casual run with friends and all dlc included, i completed the game in about 10 hours.  the soundtrack is great, i could probably listen to it for fun.  theres some very small issues with the game, dead enemies stuttering occasionally, things like that (none of which are of any real concern to me.) overall its a great game and for the three dollars i paid for it on the steam sale, it was more than worth it.

												Not only a game that I played with my girlfriend (and that I could play with my girlfriend in the first place), but one that gave an equally good, fun and fullfililng experience for the both of us. We enjoyed every moment of it, working together solving interesting (not frustrating) puzzles, jumping around in one of the best looking game environments I have ever seen; and the co-operative aspect of lending each other a hand where neededI cannot make statements about the solo experience of this game. However, if you have someone in mind/have someone you want to play a game with, this easily is a no-brainer. I am sure you will not regret it. We like it so much we are planning on going back to the first trine because we wanted more and will buy trine 3 whenever it releases. Coming back to trine 2 if you are looking for a great a co-operative experience in a perfectly designed world and don't mind doing some thinking, besides the jumping and fighting; this is the game for you. Pro's:- Amazing world- Interesting puzzles- Great co-op- Cool character dynamics- Almost perfect mix platform/puzzle/fight elementsCon's:- Average at best story (dont play it for the story)- No tactical aspect within fighting; feels like a (thinking/puzzle) layer could be addedGrade: 8,5 (must own within this genre)Part of DoubleR's Hall of Exceptional Games (DHEG)DoubleR's Mark of Originality			",78,20,7,26,24,0,7

												When I played Trine 1, I was in love with that game. Moving on to Trine 2, I feel I am sickly obsessed with this game. It made improvements in almost every imaginable way to an already perfect game. Characters have more diverse and interesting skills, there're a lot more secrets to uncover and the levels are ever more expansive and intriguing. And combat in general is a lot better because each character has more ways to deal with enemies.What I love Trine 2 the most is how each level feels very different from another, you have jungles, caves, deserts, snowy mountains, beaches, etc, essentially any imaginable environment you want to visit exists in this game, that great diversity combined with the game's amazingly charming visual shall guarantee one of the most pleasant experiences ever!

												If I could describe this game in one word it would be: Gorgeous.Wow. This game is just level after level of lush, beautiful backgrounds, foregrounds, props and items. Every pixel is eye candy. The gameplay is a clever mix of sidescroller platforming and puzzle solving with a bit of action thrown in.

												Perhaps one of the most visually beautiful games I've ever played, Trine 2 is a true masterpiece. But it's not just a pretty face. The game also comes with a charmingly voice-acted story told in the style of a traditional fairy tale, as well as 3 different playable characters with their own unique abilities and play styles, which can all be played simultaneously in co-op!

												I warmly recomend this game. It is with great soundtracks and great story line. I congratulate Frozenbyte and the composer of the music. The grafics and animations are made very realistic for 2D and are very beautiful. If you want to spend money in game - this is the game, which deserve this money.PP: The soundtracks are built on the main theme and they are changed with musical means and sounds very good. This wants to be very smart and clever. I am musician and for this reason i congratulate the composer of the melodies!			",27,7,1,5,2,0,2

												WOW! What an improvement over the first one!Mostly pros and a few cons.Pros:- The first game was stunning and this just blew me away with how much it improved over the first game - It has better puzzles- More level traversing mechanics that work REALLY well- More character skills that are easier to execute- No mana (this was mostly superfluous in the first game)- Enemy battles are more engaging- Much more fluid controls  > Using the Rogue's grappling hook to get on to a platform from underneath is much easier > The ability for my character to make it onto a platform with a jump is much more lenient > Easier to summon and destroy things with the Wizard (quick squiggle = box, botched line = plank (yay) instead of box (boo), which was frustrating from the first game)- I can read the narration and skip faster to get into the level as a resultCons:- The only thing they haven't improved from the first game is that the Rogue needs a grappling hook aim when using a controller as she often latches onto the wrong platform or the wrong part of a platform. The grappling hook should also be able to retract further making it as easy as it should be to get on to platforms (despite that they somewhat improved this from the first game).- Things that are CLEARLY made of wood can't be grappled on to- Spiders sometimes spawn camp and this can become a little annoying- The camera is appalling in so many instances (normally too zoomed in) and it would be far better with a player controlled zoom function!

												This is an example that you don't need an movie-like action game or a CoD replica to make a game. For those of you who already play platform games rub your eyes and prepare to witness some beautiful gaming. For those of you who aren't really into these games (and didn't immediately reject it before reading the reviews) I implore you to give it a try and experience a completely unique experience. Beautiful designs beyond comparisson, diverse gameplay with many different ways to solve any puzzle and a multiplayer option for a most enjoyable co-op session.			",173,26,4,29,15,3,46

												A platformer puzzle level game, I must say Trine 2 is one of my favourites platformer games. How they are designed, how are the characters abilities, how you can gain completeness by collecting all items and how they improved the fights despite the first Trine. Ah, and of course, its awesome graphics and music. Absolutely recommended.I really enjoyed this 2nd Trine. Although that fact, since I first played and finished the first one it shocked me that there was no mana and that chests give draws and poetries instead of items that give you POWER OMG. Think about it. In Trine 1 I could summon 7 boxes and 3 surfaces with Amadeus. SEVEN BOXES. Now I only could 4, boxes or surfaces together.Though I have to say that the change they made about experiences and habilities compensated this ""lack"" of awesomeness. (i.e. With the Illuminati Triangle in Trine I completed several levels with my brother, I summoned it and he hooked on it xD)Also they hardened the puzzles and these ones were more tricky sometimes.The art is sublime as always and the music as well. I set the difficulty on Difficult, to make fights more entertaining. Indeed they were. Sometimes I died more than a couple of times. Perhaps I should try Hardcore mode. Who knows.Still, I also really didn't like some levels. I don't know, for example the Sewers' One. It was all so claustrophobical and I died many times, MANY.The Goblins DLC was perfect, I really enjoyed it (only the Giant Worm's one I hated). So I reccomend to take it as well and wait for a sale to buy Trine 1, 2 and DLC. Or only Trine 2 and DLC.Ah yeah, another thing I'd like to add, is that in Trine 2 there was finally a FINAL BOSS FIGHT. It was something that I missed in 1st one. That level was going up, kill normal enemies and that's all. Instead of that, in Trine 2 you have a properly final boss fight. It was hard xD			",39,16,0,11,8,0,2

PROS:+ awesome gameplay mechanics with 3 characters+ level design+ skils/powers of each character+ fairy tale story+ visual look+ online co-opCONS:- couple of bugs/glitches- removed items from first gameComment:A fantastic and gorgeous game, loads of fun when you play with your friends! It takes what Trine gave us and enhances it through online co-op and 20(!) levels. The enemies are more difficult this time but the gameplay still revolves around puzzle solving and obstacle removing/dodging. If you loved the first game you will love this. They even added various difficulties including Hardcore mode which does not let your characters respawn until you reach the next checkpoint. I can really recommend this game to both casual and hardcore gamers.			",279,50,4,30,15,0,22

												Trine 2 is a puzzle/adventure platforming game as ingenious as it is stunning. If you like puzzles, thinking outside of the box, and... bopping goblins? You will probably fall in love with Trine 2 in a heartbeat!Below is a list of attributes pertaining to Trine 2, and some personal opinion in regards to how they did.STORY: 4/10""Feels like it's missing something... Oh, yes! More goblins!""I'll give Trine 2 a cookie for being relatively unique compared to most other games. The execution is fine, though the game does leave you feeling like there should be more. Additionally, some aspects of the plot can be seen coming a mile away. Fortunately, there's at least one or two good twists in store. For the sake of spoilers though, I won't disclose them here. The story of Trine 2's is not one to be taken seriously.Of course, you weren't looking to play this for the story, were you?GAMEPLAY: 7/10""Think of it as a test of manhood. Or mousehood.""Earning a few extra points for its fairly clever implementation of skills and the three heroes, Trine 2 really lets you play the game in your own style, be it through finesse, sheer force, or stuffing boxes into sacred places they clearly don't belong! If you get stuck at some point or confused, the narrator offers some clues on how to proceed. Compared to most games that babysit you along, this is much more preferrable.Admittedly, the controls do take a little getting used to, and even Normal Difficulty can be downright brutal if you're new to the game. Thankfully, a lot of the achievements (if you're OCD like I am) can be obtained without getting your rear end handed to you. Some are possible right at the main menu! *Hint, hint.*DESIGN: 10/10""No pixel was spared.""Trine 2 is outrageously beautiful. Beautiful to the point of losing sight of your character on the screen! ... Seriously, this happened to me playing it. But that's okay because Trine 2 is a literal slideshow of eye candy and scenic splendor. Rewarding to watch just in its own right. Being able to play in it, let alone interact with it, is an added bonus.Perhaps the nicest part about its shiny graphics is that you don't have to cash in on your life insurance policy to make a system capable of running it. Even with a simple dual-core PC, Trine 2 runs magnificently at high detail.SUMMARY: 7 out of 10.Normally, I detest games that emphasize graphics since they usually have horrible gameplay and/or story about as in-depth as a piece of cardboard. Trine 2's storyline isn't the greatest, but it makes up for it in its unique and fluid style, gameplay, as well as the lovely panoramic scenes the game immerses you into. It's a game that isn't trying to sell you some epic story or brand-spanking new mechanic... It's just fun to play! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game where you have 3 characters, which you can use in lan and online co-op! Amazing game for people who like RPG and puzzle games. Use Amadeus the wizard to kill enemies with boxes and build your way up. Use Zoya the thief to grapple on just about anything made of wood, and swing to the other side of the map, and kill your enemies with your bow and stealth. Use Pontius the knight to slash your way thorugh the enemies and break walls with your hammer of destruction!I would say, fun for everyone.			",51,6,2,10,7,0,7

												i'll give this game a 9/10.  what this game is, is fun. its a bit challenging playing solo, though with 2 of your friends this game is the perfect amount of challenging to where you can just chill and talk to friends and play the game. graphics are obviously stunning, especially with sweetfx on, not much else i can say about them other than them being great.  many of the puzzles have multiple ways to be completed while playing with friends, many of those involve using your upgrades to kind of cheat the system, either way you end up with the same result. many of the bosses are quite underwhelming, most can be beaten in under 20 seconds, this is my only real complaint about the game.  just as the boss fights, the game isnt very long either, on a casual run with friends and all dlc included, i completed the game in about 10 hours.  the soundtrack is great, i could probably listen to it for fun.  theres some very small issues with the game, dead enemies stuttering occasionally, things like that (none of which are of any real concern to me.) overall its a great game and for the three dollars i paid for it on the steam sale, it was more than worth it.

												This is a fun and easy to play game. Loved the cartoon style graphics and vivid colours. The game is full of little hidden nooks and puzzles, not all of them necessary to finish the game, but nice for those who like a challenge. The controls are simple enough to use and the game was airy and light, a nice time filler and suitable for kids.			",26,12,0,5,0,0,3

												Trine 2 is cute but stupid.  There are stunningly beautiful levels that coincide with a really silly, meandering, cliched and tropey story.  Play the game for the eyecandy levels.  Leave the game when it finally manages to conjure up and spit out an ending.  Otherwise, play it with friends.  Trine 2 is the best troll-your-friends simulator.  I hate this game now.

												I'll be honest. I didn't even try the single-player. I played the co-op mode and it was one of the best multiplayer experiences I've had. The graphics and music are beautiful, the voices are fitting to the characters, and the chance to choose a character with unique abilities really helps to cater to the strengths of individual players.If you're looking for a great co-op (or single player, I assume) game, definitely try this one.

												Hi There;I got this game ""some sales ago"" as a gift for my kids. It's a sidescroller alright but in such a way that you have the feeling you are playing a 3rd person game. The game is an absolute gem. There is a lot of detail and the colors and lightning are superb. The atmosphere is amazing. My kids play it together on the bigscreen with two controllers. I must say that if you are not used to controllers this game can be difficult at some points but my kids are flying through the environment.It starts easy but as you advance everything on your path will test or kill youAllong the way can (well must) pick up vials thats give you XP. There is a talenttree for each of the 3 chars you can play with to boost weapons or unlock other weapons or abilities and can be (re)set whenever you want so your chars got the proper tools for the fight.Just buy this game alright!!! And get the 3-pack so your friends can join you			",75,5,0,1,3,0,6

												I rarely/never play 2D platformers mainly because I generally don't enjoy them. But Trine 2 is the only exception. The vibrant and elegant graphic style were breathtaking, the story telling felt like a fairy tale story that parents read to their children at night. The gameplay was great, a tradtional 2D physics platform with a simple skill tree system which balances out really well. This game is truly an indie masterpiece.

New enemies, new locations, new skills, new bosses and just quality all throughout. It's what DLC should be.If you haven't played the first one well, then... it's a puzzle platformer with action elements. Perfect for kids and the difficulties range from beginner friendly to rather difficult.			",241,87,0,34,9,0,18

												Trine 2 is better than the first one with many more physics puzzles. You get to control three heroes, a warrior, a mage and a thief to try to defeat an evil queen. On the way you will fight goblins but mostly you will spend time creating square boxes to place on pressure plates to raise one platform or another. There are many physics puzzles including water, air, fire, ice, low gravity fields and steam pipes. It also has COOP and editor in the workshop. I had a blast with this and can't wait till Trine 3. 8/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												An extremely well-made puzzle game, and the mechanics of the game makes the puzzles solvable in various different ways, which makes it much more interesting than the usual puzzle games which only have one solution.Co-op is great as the puzzle is essentially the same, and having a friend in co-op would significantly make the puzzles easier, and more entertaining.Combat is extremely enjoyable, and I personally feel there's too little combat in the game, since each of the 3 characters have such a wide range of abilities and attacks that they can use.The graphics and audio is spectacular, and it allows Trine 2 to stand out among other games as a dreamy tale of magic, puzzles, and steampunk crates.For its remarkable gameplay and the relatively small price tag, Trine 2 is definitely worth the few beans in your pocket.

												Let me first just say the obligatory fact that this game is BEAUTIFUL. Normally not something I would think of as a defining quality of a 2D puzzle game, but it... you just gotta play it yourself to see just how amazing this game looks. I suppose because it IS 2D, it runs great on lower end machines while being able to still stay beautiful.As far as gameplay, it is a fun combination of puzzle, platforming and combat elements. There are three characters each with a defining set of abilities that work brilliantly together. They aren't complicated, but when put together with the crafty environment it really just makes for a plain FUN game! I would reccomend getting a buddy to play it with sometimes as well. Maybe we have missed something, but the way the multiplayer seems to work is that basically someone will be able to ""drop in"" on someone's story and be able to go through it together. This becomes a problem because one of use ends up going back and playing through something again, but it isn't too terribly bad. You find there were different ways to solve puzzles and then have fun trying to naviate with anothe player (and enjoy the scenery of course!).So, yes I would reccomend this game! I was doubtful at first, but it has come together to be a very enjoyable game from all fronts. I haven't completed the story yet, but it introduces new mechanics and new environments enough that it dosen't become monotonous. Awesome game!			",42,11,6,4,4,0,0

												This game builds on the previous game and has everything the previous game had. Gorgeous art, atmospheric soundtrack, excellent gameplay. The storyline is as almost nonexistent as in the first one, but essentially, Trine 2 sees you back in the shoes of the wizard, knight and thief as you try and find your way through the puzzle/platformer levels.The abilities of the characters have been slightly re-jigged, in order to keep the gameplay fresh, but also to avoid the RPG trope where a character loses all the abilites he got in the first game at the beginnign of the sequel! The gameplay still works best with more than one player helping each other out - in fact, perhaps more so than the first due to the new abilities.It has, particularly with the Gblin Menace expansion, a great amount of gameplay for the price. The Goblin Menace adds (amongst other things) another crazy boss level, but it's much more down to skill than insanity and pure blind luck like the first one! It still stands in my mind as one of the best examples of a final boss level - it involves using all the abilities and skills you've learnt and working with your co-players in a classic multi-stage boss level.All in all, following on from the last one, 9/10 - it's brilliant fun multiplayer with an Xbox controller, but loses the one point for the lacklustre storyline and confusing keyboard controls.

												Steam sales have ruined me.I honestly forgot about this game because I had it on the back burner. I played 20 min, then switched to some other game I was dying to play after a steam sale, and then forgot about Trine 2. Never again. I'm so sorry Trine 2. You didn't deserve my neglect. But you were worth the wait.I seriously love this game. If you like platforming/puzzle games like Rochard, you will love this game. Granted, I have not finished it yet, but I had to stop mid game to say that I'm seriously impressed. This game offers the beautiful styling of a 2D platformer of the modern genre, yet offers a unique twist. There is an RPG element of leveling a class of character. And you get 3 primary characters to level and play at any given time. With 3 different classes to evolve and switch between at any given moment.... That's a mouthful. It sounds confusing but it's easy once you experience it. Lets say you have an enemy that is best suited to be taken down with brute force. Push left bumper, swittch to my brawler and take them down. 3 seconds later, I have a puzzle that requires some blocks to be moved around. Push left bumber, switch to my wizard. Move those blocks with my magic. 3 seconds later I have an obsticle that requires a finess jump. Push left bumper, switch to my archer/acrobat. Jump over that obsicle. It's really just fun. Pure and simple. If you like platformers. If you like modern, rich graphic, puzzle solving platformers, then I bet you will enjoy this game. I'll update this review after I finish the game... but so far I'm thoroughly impressed.			",90,11,0,8,2,0,3

												This is another begrudging approval. Trine 2 is not a bad game, but it's also not awesome. Most of it is, well, boring. Admittedly, that boringness is nicely polished.The first Trine had a neat gimmick in the ability to instantly switch between the three character classes, and the fact that you sometimes had to use this to solve puzzles. The problem is that Trine 2 doesn't really build on this in any meaningful way. It's just more of the same. Add to that the fact that the story is even less relevant to our characters this time around (they don't even know the people who the story revolves around) and it's hard to care about anything that happens.The combat requires no thought and you can generally brute force your way through without any problems. Even the boss fights can be bulldozed through with simple repetition. And once you put enough upgrades into the wizard the same can be said for the puzzles. That means that the early game and first few levels are significantly more challenging because you won't have those abilities yet. But put in a little time and thought and the game becomes a breeze.It looks very nice - they definitely upped the graphical fidelity this time around. It comes at a cost though. The first Trine ran just fine on my standard work laptop, while Trine 2 gets about one frame a second.There also seems to be less banter and fewer jokes between the characters this time around. It's still there a little bit, but it's disappointing there's not more because that was largely what made the first game so charming.If you absolutely loved the first Trine then it's probably worth a quick playthrough of the second. But while there are some nice cosmetics and a few hours of diverting gameplay, the series seems to have misplaced its soul.			",204,75,1,29,4,2,23

												Trine 2: Complete Story is an hybrid between a platform and puzzle game developed by developer Froze Byte and follows the adventure of three heroes, Amadeus the Magnificent, Zoya and Pontius the Brave, as they are guided by a mysterious magical entity, the titular Trine, to face a dark plot involving their kingdom. The Complet Story edition adds to the original some tweaks and include the only major DLC for the game, Goblin Menace, for free.The main beef of Trine 2 is about using the unique perks and abilities of each character or combine them as needed in order to advance in the levels you are thrown in: while there are some enemy encounters through the game, they are a rarity and are easily overcame with the trio's basic abilities (even the few bosses featured are pretty straightforward, save for the final bosses, who are more puzzle game fare in nature). Amadeus the Magnificent doesn't have any combat abilities to speak of and is rather fragile, but can conjure crates or move elements of the scenery to help his comrades. Zoya, instead, is a classic rogue character: she can move faster and jump higher than the other two characters, use a grappling tool to swing around on wooden surfaces and damage enemies from afar using her bow and different kind of arrows. Finally, Portius the Brave is a very sturdy, shielded warrior who fills the role of the group's tank against enemies and heavy damage dealer: after unlocking some of his additional abilities, however, Portius also becomes useful during the platforming sections as a support character.The levels of Trine 2 feature several experience orbs you can collect to level up your characters: each level gained unlocks an ability point you can spend in the talent tree of each hero. Some of these unlocked abilities only enhance the skills the characters already posses, while others introduce totally new gimmicks capable of making the later section of the game much easier to handle.It can be argued that one of the main attraction in Trine 2 are its impressive visual, especially for being a side scroller game: all the characters and environments are rendered in great 3D detail and the scenaries are multiple layers to them. The art style also feels rather unique.One of the main novelty of Trine 2 in comparison to the original game are its only features: a party of three players can experience the whole adventure while playing together online, each controlling his/her own character. On top of being a rather entertaining experience, the multiplayer element also makes the game easier to handle and mixing the heroes' powers much more straightforward.Trine 2's replayability is a bit scarce: once you've been playing through the whole game and found a solution to all the puzzles and obstacles, the only real reason to come back for a second run is to play with your friends or change your default character. There are also collectables to be found inside the levels (pieces of poetry and paintings/concept art), but finding them isn't exactly a serious challenge.The Goblin Menace DLC is the only additional content released for Trine 2 and follows the story of Amadeus, Zoya and Portius after their great adventure as they try to save Amadeus' wife from an aggressive army of goblins. The DLC doesn't offer any new gameplay elements whatsoever, both in general mechanics and characters' abilities: on the other side, however, it lasts for some interesting hours, has its own story and, if possible, the level design is even more complex and gorgeous than the one from the main game.Trine 2: Complete Story is an entertaining game with its own peculiar identity and apparel that I found very enjoyable, moreso if taken on with a pair of friends along the way			",143,41,0,17,0,2,8

												For fans of stereoscopic 3D gaming, this game is a must-buy.  There are many games which look fantastic in Nvidia 3d Vision, but the Trine games (especially 2 and 3) are so good as to be useful for modeling the technology, in my opinion.  Furthermore, unlike many games that work well in 3D Vision and nothing else, the Trine games have additional 3D modes to make the game compatible with pretty much any stereoscopic setup you have.  If you have a modern 3D TV and choose to play this game in 2D, you are doing yourself a serious disservice.  Get an extra-long hdmi cable, if you have to, and attach your computer to your TV!  (Or invest in a 3D Vision setup, if you are a fan of stereoscopic 3D movies and games.)The game is oodles of fun with a friend, in both local and internet co-op, with the difference being that the two characters must share a screen for local co-op; netplay has no such limitation, and you can get separated if you are not careful.  That said, I recommend the latter for those who have both options available to then.Sadly, the game has its share of internet MP bugginess, worse than the first game did (but not as bad as the third).  It was so bad that my friend and I (with him in America and me in Japan, both of us with excellent internet connections) were not able to complete the DLC's final boss, which is arguably broken for multiplayer (possibly local MP as well, given the way the boss spazzes out and gets confused when more than one target is available).  So while I must shake my finger at Frozenbyte for not play-testing and bug-proofing the multiplayer more, I cannot in good conscious give this anything other than a thumbs-up, for its combination of appealing platforming, charming characters and voice acting, and jaw-droppingly gorgeous visuals, which really must be viewed in stereoscopic 3D to be fully appreciated.Artistic Value: 9.5Fun Factor: 8 (probably lower while playing solo and/or in 2D)My Score: 8.5			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you're looking for something to play with a couple of mates, look no further. Ridiculously good combination of action and puzzles, with a pretty good sense of humour. I play this with both casual and lifestyle gamers, and everyone loves it.Smoother controls than the original, and a bettere balance between puzzles and action. If you're the kind of person who likes telling people how to play games, don't play this game with your friends. It's really boring if someone is telling you how to do everything.

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous, fun game that I would wholeheartedly recommend, even though I am not someone who normally enjoys puzzle games. The world is vibrant and colorful, with great music and fun, if simple, characters to go along with it. It is a light-hearted, relaxing, fun game with a lot of charm. The puzzles were enjoyable. I had a good laugh with my co-op partner. We trolled each other and had quite a few memorable moments playing the game. I feel like the wizard was the most well-thought out character in the game and that the thief and knight didn't get quite as much attention as the wizard, but this is a very minor nitpick. Playing the thief and the knight wasn't a bore; I mostly played the thief during my playthrough and still had a great experience. The puzzles were creative, but not frustrating. I didn't feel that any of the puzzles were unfair. I found myself laughing at the silly mistakes we made more often than not.The balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.The DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.Overall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.Fun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms. The graphics are top notch with great lighting. The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls. The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring. Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful. The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game. The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles. Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle. The addition of the Goblin Menace, the Dwarven Carverns and now the Workshop has helped expand and continue the gameplay of this fabulous series.Trine 2 takes everything that made Trine fun and improves on it. It has better combat, and more entertaining puzzels. The soundtrack is great, and the game looks visually gorgeous, I have got to say Trine 2 Really is pretty great overall, and it is still modable, so again, this is a great aspect to have if you are looking to get your moneys worth. I would reccomend Trine 2 to anyone looking for an Indie game, a Sidescroller, Puzzle, or artsy looking game. I have got to say there is a good ammount of fun to be had with Trine 2, so dont pass judgement too quickly.The mechanics of the game are a refinement and improvement over the original Trine, with you switching between heroes on the fly and using their respective strengths to fight and puzzle your way through various environments, however this time it feels much slicker, and much more confident in what it does, there's many points where you'll be scratching your head, only to have the light flick on with a genuine ""AH HA!"" moment. It's never punishingly difficult, but it's pleasantly challenging. The lack of gore and fantasy nature of the game makes it very family friendly too, older children will get a kick out of the fantasy setting, and adults will no doubt get many of the references. In this it resembles a Pixar film, a comparison I make very affectionately.Do please check this game out, it deserves your time and attention. ",53,7,3,3,4,1,1

												The brilliant artistry, great soundtrack, and immersive real-time puzzles in this game are, if possible, even better than it's predecessor. Although Trine 2 features less RPG elements than Trine 1, the fun is none the less for it. In Trine 2, you play once again as Pontius the knight, Zoya the theif, and Amadeus the wizard, while battling new foes, using new abilities, and solving new puzzles, all in a thoroughly beautiful fairy tale world of action, myth and mystery.Once again, I recommend this installment of the Trine franchise to any and all gamers.

												Trine 2 is a gorgeous, fun game that I would wholeheartedly recommend, even though I am not someone who normally enjoys puzzle games. The world is vibrant and colorful, with great music and fun, if simple, characters to go along with it. It is a light-hearted, relaxing, fun game with a lot of charm. The puzzles were enjoyable. I had a good laugh with my co-op partner. We trolled each other and had quite a few memorable moments playing the game. I feel like the wizard was the most well-thought out character in the game and that the thief and knight didn't get quite as much attention as the wizard, but this is a very minor nitpick. Playing the thief and the knight wasn't a bore; I mostly played the thief during my playthrough and still had a great experience. The puzzles were creative, but not frustrating. I didn't feel that any of the puzzles were unfair. I found myself laughing at the silly mistakes we made more often than not.The balance between combat and puzzle sections leave no room for boredom. And the adjustable level of difficulty gives newcomers and veterans a fair chance to prove their abilities. Furthermore the multiplayer adds some extra life to the game, as the experience is genuinely different.The DLC in form of Goblin Menace adds a couple new levels, a new story, and several new skills which will also be available in the original game.Overall Trine 2 feels more refined than its predecessor and the beautiful artwork in combination with the creative puzzle sections are very persuasive and entertaining. In addition it offers enough content to justify itself as a worthy sequel to Trine.Fun fact: Due to relatively poor sales for Trine 2 on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the conversion for the expansion for these consoles was deemed not be cost effective, thus Trine 2: Goblin Menace was never released for these platforms. The graphics are top notch with great lighting. The fluidity of the animation and controls are perfect so that while some of the puzzle sections may be difficult at times they are never blamed on the slick controls. The levels are long enough to be enjoyable and not too long where they get boring. Each level offers a variety of landscapes and scenery, all of which are beautiful. The storyline is forgettable, but still sets up a good reason for why you are playing the game. The three different characters offer very different ways of playing and each offer different ways to solve the puzzles. Think of it as an action only version of Quest for Glory where each character has a different solution to each puzzle.

												Where do I even BEGIN with this game?First, the gameplay. The puzzles in the game CAN be difficult at times, but they can be solved in many ways.Second, the story. What could be said that hasn't been said already about it? It has everything anyone could possibly want in a fairytale story: Three heroes on a quest,  majestic fantasy lands, and a villain the heroes must wage war on.Third, the characters. They all have their own personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. Amadeus is a wizard, so he can conjure boxes and planks and lift objects. Pontius is a knight, making him the go-to guy for battling enemies. And Zoya is a thief--whoops! I mean archer. She has a bow for ranged attacks, and uses a grappling hook to swing from point A to point B.Fourth, the music. I'm just gonna come out and say it; Ari Pulkkinen really outdid himself here. Such incredible melodies and crescendos make it all the more enjoyable. Listening to these compositions, you'd think these were actually covers for songs by Blackmore's Night!Fifth, the cast. The voice actors from the last game made it to the sequel. Namely, Kevin Howarth(Amadeus), Victoria Kruger(Zoya), and Brian Bowles(Pontius). But there are also two other voice actors that do a good job as their characters. Also, Terry Wilton(narrator), I love you, but you GOTTA stop milking your role here. You're just too good! You have a gift.Sixth, and most importantly, the presentation. When Frostbyte said they featured every color of the rainbow, they weren't kidding. In fact, I saw a couple of rainbows throughout the game! it all looks so bright and vivid like a fantasy world would normally look.So, that's all I gotta say. Check this game out for yourselves. You WON'T be disappointed.			",60,15,0,4,3,2,0

												The wonderful and ingenius second installment of what I think is the best physics based puzzle game franchise. This sequel offers a unique fairytale storybook style in contrast to the dark, somewhat dungeon based original. The game feels more open than its predecessor despite removing items and replacing them with sparce non-gameplay influencing collectibles. This game is packed with impressive, long levels and excellent replayability. Players have to be more creative and conservative as puzzle are not as easily circumvented though solving them is more interesting and visually rewarding. This game is well worth buying at a sale (about $5) and has an equally incredible expansion pack (about $2 on sale) that adds a new chapter to the story and plenty of new levels and skills to play with. I truly recommend fans of puzzle games and casual gamers to buy this game. Also, see my review of the original Trine.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't checked this game before, I highly recommend getting it. I even suggest to go and get both Trine 1 and Trine 2: Complete story and thus support the developers behind this really beautiful game.I won't go into details what the game is about, since you can find that already on the internet, but if you're into puzzle-platformers, even slightly, this game is a must. In return, you'll be getting an amazing gameplay experience, beautiful rich graphics and phenomenal soundtrack.Although you can certainly play it solo, you can join up with two more people and the game will become even better.There aren't much games I'd actually recommend to people, but this is certainly one of them.

												Probably one of my favorite games. I'm really picky when it comes to games, but this one stands out to me. Ambition all around. Very detailed animations, great physics, controls are comfortable and it's just REALLY beautiful. Highly recommended to play in 3D if you can get your hands on it. But, it's probably less fun if you play it alone. Co-op it and you're going to be laughing a lot. Solo is alright too but it's really intended to be played together. But for the price, especially during sales it's worth it. (Still can't believe the price of this game actually drops to 1.50 during the sales, these devs deserve a lot more for this ambitious game.)Voice actors are silly, I find it pretty comedic. Story's easy to follow because they don't overwhelm you with a ton of hierarchies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												An excellent platformer. Beautifully made world, amazing sound work and multi-language full audio (played it through in Russian with full audio, although the Steam Store page noes not list the language as having full audio support). I love the local co-op mode with 3 xbox controllers. It is a very fun and bonding experience, which I have not seen replicated at this level so far in any other game. Cannot recommend more to play with friends or with kids, especially if you like puzzle platformers and have several xbox controllers lying around.			",98,20,5,7,5,1,3

												If you haven't checked this game before, I highly recommend getting it. I even suggest to go and get both Trine 1 and Trine 2: Complete story and thus support the developers behind this really beautiful game.I won't go into details what the game is about, since you can find that already on the internet, but if you're into puzzle-platformers, even slightly, this game is a must. In return, you'll be getting an amazing gameplay experience, beautiful rich graphics and phenomenal soundtrack.Although you can certainly play it solo, you can join up with two more people and the game will become even better.There aren't much games I'd actually recommend to people, but this is certainly one of them. For me, it's 9,9/10			",85,23,2,8,14,2,22

												Probably one of my favorite games. I'm really picky when it comes to games, but this one stands out to me. Ambition all around. Very detailed animations, great physics, controls are comfortable and it's just REALLY beautiful. Highly recommended to play in 3D if you can get your hands on it. But, it's probably less fun if you play it alone. Co-op it and you're going to be laughing a lot. Solo is alright too but it's really intended to be played together. But for the price, especially during sales it's worth it. (Still can't believe the price of this game actually drops to 1.50 during the sales, these devs deserve a lot more for this ambitious game.)Voice actors are silly, I find it pretty comedic. Story's easy to follow because they don't overwhelm you with a ton of hierarchies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The protagonists are heroic, brave and loyal, graphic is just stunning and colorful, the plot seems to be a naive and childish, but it only makes that game even more magical. And soundtrack, ahhh soundtrack. Wonderful, just wonderful. It reminds me of my childhood.The gameplay is pretty good, so you can't be bored while playing this game! You'll have even more fun if you play in co-op mode with someone! I personally recommend you not to play alone.Trine 2 proves that fairy tales aren't just for children :)			",27,3,0,2,3,0,0

A Magical ExperienceVery polished and creative, Trine 2 is a puzzle platformer like no other. Unlike other platformers, there isn't just one way to solve a puzzle in this game. At times you'll feel like you're cheating because you've found some way to bypass a puzzle--but that's the point! Use telekinesis, gravity-slowing spells, or kite-sails to explore a land run rampant with dangerous traps and enemies.GameplayIn the game, you play as Amadeus, a wizard who can conjure boxes and bridges to allow you to climb to victory, Zoya, a thief whose grappling hook swings her from platform to platform, or Pontius, whose shield will defend you from even the most dangerous projectilles. You can always switch characters mid-level and combine their skills to beat the challenges you face. Or you can challenge yourself to beat a level using only the skills of one character!And don't worry: there are secrets, collectibles, and achievements abound! Literally hours of gameplay outside of the main story are devoted to exploring this strange world.VisualsThe graphics are crisp and evoke the feeling of a fantastical world very well. The game itself is 2D, but everything is rendered in 3D. The levels simply feel alive. Trine 2 is probably the most beautiful platformer I've ever played.VerdictC'mon, get this game.

												One of the best games I've played so far - not in terms of gameplay (It's simple and repetitive but still fun) - but mostly it is the charm of the game itself. The graphic effects and ambientstyle, the physics and all these small little details wrapped in a 3-man  online co-op are really a great experience. I feel like I robbed the devs when I grabbed it on the sale.FYI: Trine is ported to the new Trine 2 engine and is called ""Trine - Enchanted Edition"" - FREE UPDATE for everyone who already bought Trine! That means: Also online co-op and a few new graphic/physic-effects for the first game!-> http://steamcommunity.com/app/35700/discussions/0/540744934272712260/ ",215,24,6,11,13,1,15

												Got Trine 2 in a bundled special offer together with Trine and Trine 2 Goblin Menace.Trine 2 developed pretty good. The story got a little deeper, the levels became more challangeable, and the skills also developed well.A few added cutscenes support story telling. The characters got the same synchronspeakers and the scenaries and background songs are as great as in the first part. If you need a more detailed review watch my review on Trine 1 which you can find on my profile page.Trine 2 has nothing new to offer in the game universe but is a great jump and run, puzzle game combined with fighting elements and a fun multiplayer option. The Goblin Menace DLC is a great addition and worth its price. If you are a bit short on money i suggest you wait for a special offer. Its a must have for everyone who loves this genre.

												Amazing looks for a game, with fun puzzles and a fun atmosphere. It is also very enjoyable with friends, so co-op is definitely recommended. The mechanics work very well between the three characters which makes for interesting methods of playing and solving puzzles.I have only one downside for the game, in which combat for Pontius is very easy (maybe that's the point idk) and the enemies could be buffed for more complex attacks.In conclusion, one of the best co-op games I have played.13/15 - ""Co op genius""			",68,3,1,8,6,0,4

												Kill my boyfriend and refuse to respawn him. 11/10.This game has beautiful visual effects, a trio of unique characters who each possess different abilities to help get you through the levels, and a co-op system so enjoyable that you can intentionally get your friends killed and troll around with them. (read above)The controls are extremely easy for both controller and keyboard, the music is addictively enjoyable and it'll have you (and friends) working together to get through the many puzzles and stages in each level. If you enjoy fantasy platformer games then this is an ideal game for you.Want this game during a steam sale? This is definitely worth it. But, I'd only recommend it for an on sale price as I wouldn't pay $20 for the full pack.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely beautiful. The graphics, gameplay and the story. It is even better if you got friends to play with!  Just brilliant. And the DLC is awesome too! Even though it can be pretty hard at some times. :D  I even bought the Trine 1 because of how great this game was!   10/10			",47,5,0,1,3,1,2

												First of all, great visuals on this game. In my opinion, it really pushes the limits of how great looking a classic-styled platformer can be. That being said, I personally was not able to get through the game by myself. That's not saying it's an incredibly hard game. I just felt like this game is best suited for couch co-op. Being able to work out the puzzles, and use one of three characters at a time makes this experience extremely fun with a friend. Great game, and it goes on sale enough to just have this one in your library for that time you need a good co-op experience.			",185,38,3,14,18,3,28

												Probably one of my favorite games. I'm really picky when it comes to games, but this one stands out to me. Ambition all around. Very detailed animations, great physics, controls are comfortable and it's just REALLY beautiful. Highly recommended to play in 3D if you can get your hands on it. But, it's probably less fun if you play it alone. Co-op it and you're going to be laughing a lot. Solo is alright too but it's really intended to be played together. But for the price, especially during sales it's worth it. (Still can't believe the price of this game actually drops to 1.50 during the sales, these devs deserve a lot more for this ambitious game.)Voice actors are silly, I find it pretty comedic. Story's easy to follow because they don't overwhelm you with a ton of hierarchies.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Trine 2, An advanced game with beautiful graphics. You take control of three characters who have skills such as moving objects, freezing enemies and throwing hammers. Plus many more. I have only played 7 levels of this game but I have played about ten hours in total. Pros:Gripping storylinecomplex puzzlesGreat combat (considering that trine is a platformer)Using your skills is addictiveThe ""weak"" mage can crush goblins with a rockMultiplayerCons:Slightly expensive (I recommend buying it on sale)If you are a bit nooby and play with friends, they will start screaming in frustrationThats it....In conclusion, wait for this game to go on sale and buy the three pack so you can play with friends. Just practise on single-player before.			",27,0,1,0,1,0,1

												The sequel of beautiful Trine can't claim anything really new. More puzzles (e.g. with water or plants), tuned skills, removed inventory. Still great graphics and music by Ari Pulkkinen. It's perceived more as Trine additional levels, but you should not miss it anyway.------------------------------Продолжение прекрасной Trine не может похвастаться серьёзными нововведениями. Новые виды головоломок (например, с водой или растениями), подправленные способности героев, упразднённый инвентарь. На высочайшем уровне остались сказочная графика и музыка Ари Пулккинена. Trine 2 воспринимается скорее как набор новых карт к первой части, но пропускать такую игру на ПК в любом случае нельзя.			",111,40,0,17,8,0,21

												Beautiful. Simply stunning. Trine 2 is the follow-up to the already graphically impressive Trine, which in essence is a modern day interpretation of the classic Ghouls 'n Ghosts game. A sideways scroller, you take on the form of anyone of the three characters within Trine - a thief, a wizard and a knight. Each one has their own unique abilities to enable you to overcome situations or puzzles that need solving to progress further.Thankfully, the HUGE gap between checkpoint saves that marred the first game has now been reduced. In turn, when all three characters happen to get killed, you're not replaying large sections of the game again.It's good with keyboard and mouse as the default input - but really benefits from the use of a 360 controller. Oh, and did I mention that it's beautiful too? :)			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

												I've now finished but not perfect cleared both Trine and Trine 2 with the expansions. I like them both. The humour works, the graphics are amazing, the puzzles are the right difficulty level for me (although admittedly I suck at games like this) and the game feels a good length. It is short but it doesn't feel like it needs to be longer. Unlike the first Trine, this game works well with the controller.			",119,45,2,49,10,0,13

												This game is fantastic. It's even better than the first game, and the first one was pretty great. Go see my review of that game as a starting point, then come back here. Trine 2 has pretty much all of the cool mechanics of its predecessor, but adds some really neat new ones. The visuals are even better than the first, if that's possible. There are new enemies and obstacles to overcome and some pretty cool boss fights. Almost anything that made the first game great is here plus more. The only thing I can think of missing from the first game is the items that you could find and distribute among the 3 characters to improve them. But I never felt they were that impactful anyway, so it was probably a wise choice to leave them out.  With the goblin story DLC this games has more levels than the first and has a ton of achievements to boot. You really should give this game a try.			",45,43,1,3,6,0,6

It is $3 now so why not????!!!Puzzle platformer with great co-op design and beautiful graphics. Gameplay: pretty standard puzzle platformer with some element of action, so if you are interested in this genre you will probably get exactly what you expected. No surprises, but still fun.Plot: Personally I don't think plot is that great. It is acceptable, but doesn't add much value to the gaming experience in general. Art: Graphics is fantastic - I have tons of screenshot just because it is a genuinely beautiful game. Co-op: I finished my first playthru alone and played with friends for several more. Playing alone is perfectly fine (and fun) but the co-op mode just makes it better- casual, funny, and no one feels left out.Difficulty: Platforming is not challenging at all. Some puzzle might take a while for the first time if you play alone but in general very managable (and having a few challenging puzzles is not a bad thing)Replay value: Acceptable, for collectables, achievements and new possible solutions from different skills. Also just fun to see how your friends play the game for the first time.Price: Slightly overpriced, but absolutely worth it when on sale (and it's on sale fairly often) ",66,22,0,11,2,0,5

												Beautiful. Simply stunning. Trine 2 is the follow-up to the already graphically impressive Trine, which in essence is a modern day interpretation of the classic Ghouls 'n Ghosts game. A sideways scroller, you take on the form of anyone of the three characters within Trine - a thief, a wizard and a knight. Each one has their own unique abilities to enable you to overcome situations or puzzles that need solving to progress further.Thankfully, the HUGE gap between checkpoint saves that marred the first game has now been reduced. In turn, when all three characters happen to get killed, you're not replaying large sections of the game again.It's good with keyboard and mouse as the default input - but really benefits from the use of a 360 controller. Oh, and did I mention that it's beautiful too? :)			",325,46,21,42,39,2,85

												I bought this because it was on sale (2.99) at the time, and was looking for another puzzle co-op game to feed in to my Portal 2 co-op mode obsession. This was totally different, but fun, some replayability due to different ways of solving puzzles, flexible enough to work as both single and multiplayer, and definitely worth the 3 bucks when on sale, I'd even say probably worth the full prize. This is the first I've played of the series and may pick up the 1st and 3rd soon.			",13,4,1,8,2,0,1

												This must be the first game I've played(that I remember) that I've also finished on the same day I started it on(according to Steam, it took me 8 hrs to finish so that would have meant I sat next to my computer playing this game from beginning to finish for 8 hrs straight), story wise I think that might be a credits bugged becauyse it kept rolling or this game has a really long set of credits to go through...? Or it was suppose to happen and it's just a matter of how long it takes you to get bored by reading the repeated credits? hahahaha I was expecting for something at the end, like a reward for watching through the entire credits, maybe a bonus cut scene or something. All done on medium difficulty.So the story continues from Trine 1 if you've played that, with the same three characters. I didn't really dwell too much into the story, more at having fun and trying to solve them puzzles....hahahaaa At least the puzzles here aren't as fustrating as the ones in Trine 1, or maybe it was because at times I had a coop random help me out rather me trying to solo it alone...? I don't know, I might try solo this to see if there was a difference in puzzle difficulty and length...when I can be bothered of ccourse...hahaha XPGameplay wise, is pretty similar to its prequel, though you have a slightly different system to upgrade your character's abilities from the first. For some reason, Trine 2 felt more fun to play than Trine 1, maybe I started off with mutliplayer coop(instead of soloing the campaign myself) and expected/hoped randoms to come drop by - which they did at times.Graphics, yeash definitely an improvement over Trine 1 original, though there's an Enchanted version that pretty much puts it on par with this game. My settings are as follows: 1920x1080 @ 144Hz, Anti-Aliasing @ Extremem so that apparently is FXAA + 4xSSAA and I also had V-sync on, so I don't have to worry about screen tearing. Graphics detail level is on Very High and I don't have anything to play this game on stereoscopic 3D mode so I leave it on default which is Automatic.Whilst ingame, I've notice I've never actually got to 144fps mark which was a shame because it didn't make good use of my 144Hz monitor... it seems to be hovering around 60-ish(sometimes up to 70 and up to 100 duringthe non-ingame cut scenes; I believe it hasn't ever dipped below 60, ok maybe 58 or so, but it hasn't gone down any further than that), which is still good. Though, since one of my GTX 770s is practically offline(as nvidia disabled SLi for windows XP on geforce cards 600 and up - which I later found out AFTER I bought two of these bad boys for the purpose of SLi; but don't worry, my windows 7 boot will make up for it - yes it's a dual boot system, so it wasn't all for nothing! :P Actually, I believe, since this game uses PhysX, my 2nd 770 might be the dedicated PhysX card for this system so that means less load for the first card which is offloaded to the 2nd card and since the 2nds card is also the exact same 770, it should be a *perfect* match up)But yeah, they look pretty.Sound, I believe this game appears to be running surround sound(I was able to get sound from my rear right and left, my my side left and right don't appear to be working or I didn't hear anything from them because they're so soft, so this could be a 5.0 channel game or 4.0 channel game...), though I'm not sure if there's an LFE channel or if the center speaker is in use(I didn't actually test this, I just wanted to enjoy the game for what it is and not try to find something to criticize about).Yeah, I had fun, so I guess I recommend this - definitely got my money's worth from this however much I paid for this - I don't actually remember how much I bought this for, apparently got it two years ago...or at least that's what it said before I launched the game today). I did play some multiplayer coop and yes it does work, but there's like hardly any one hosting, so best bet is to start your own and hope randoms come by and play.===========================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												The second game in this series brings a great deal of graphical improvements with environments that look and feel more interesting and intense than the previous game. Combat is pretty straightforward and the game foregoes the treasure system for a more simplified approach, with 6 of the skills unusable until the game has been completed. This time through I decided to play it with a friend and that made the overall experience much more enjoyable.			",217,103,1,22,12,4,23

												Much like Metro Last Light, Trine 2 is a shining example of how to do a sequel. I loved the original game but found the balance between the 3 characters to be a little out of whack. Trine 2 managed to keep the characters essentially the same, but fully balanced their skills out via gameplay mechanics.In the original game I’m fairly certain I used the thief 80-90% of my play time. For a game whose core mechanic is switching between 3 different heroes to solve different puzzles, this really takes away from the point of the design. Trine 2 introduces a physics based fluid system, steam and fire piping, much stronger AI, and a much better assortment of enemy variety. The result is that I’ve had to use each character almost equally to work my way through each level. I still default to the thief out of habit, but I frequently needed to utilize the others talents in very intuitive ways. For a game that is largely the same, this small change makes this sequel both a welcome revisit to the world and art style while making the gameplay feel highly polished, fresh and new.Whether you played and enjoyed the original Trine or not, Trine 2 should definitely be on your radar. As a standalone title it is fantastic and as a sequel it’s even better.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

Short version: 92% (73% for the DLC)Trine 2 takes a bold step and turns into a more puzzle-oriented game with a reworked and upgraded balance and ability system. Completed with larger, more detailed and even more charming levels, the game is superior to the predecessor in almost every way. Too bad the DLC couldn’t hold this level of quality.Long version:Like all sequels, Trine 2 tries to give you more of the things that made the first installment good while trying to re-balance or redo all the parts where it lacked.This of course means that the game looks even better than Trine. The levels offer more variety, they are more detailed than ever, and they are also are more challenging, forcing you to use all three characters for real this time.This also takes us to the more criticised part: whereas Trine was a traditional platformer, Trine 2 is more of a puzzle game with platforming elements. There are several parts on every level where you may need to stop and try to figure out how to proceed, and it usually involves the abilities of at least two characters. On one hand, it’s a major improvement, but on the other hand it does feel like a setback compared to the first game’s fluidity.Whereas Trine used the simplest of stories, Trine 2 tries to give you a little more complex narrative on why are you visiting the various levels. Don’t expect anything groundbreaking, though. The three main heroes also receive a makeover, giving them truly unique character traits and personalities, and their banter has improved a lot too.Sadly the game is not without faults, and these faults even have a name: the Goblin Menace DLC. Even though it gives you even more levels, all of them rely on one new gimmick: the anti-gravity arrow. You won’t find many puzzles where proceeding isn’t tied to this one ability, turning the new levels into a never-ending series of tedious trial-and-error jumps into thin air, which will wear very thin by the time you reach the floating islands. At least these new levels look even better than before, so it’s a small consolation.			",78,261,0,12,9,2,21

												This game has one of the most beautiful graphics.But the gameplay itself... It's just fine. There are some elements from Portal 2 in it, only less fun and challenging.What I particularly didn't like about this game, is that the puzzles require not that much of a brain as reaction speed.Often it's about how fast can you press the buttons or how precisely can you place objects. The game does not give you that much opportunities to enjoy your ability to solve puzzles.Compared to Trine, Trine 2 is better: both in big things like the story, the graphics and the mechanics, and in small things likethe ability to reset skill points (though, they also should have kept the floating platform skill from the first game);and the option to save the game at any point (in the first game you had to continue from the beginning of the level).Note: the DLC ""Goblin Menace"" is annoyingly hard, as the level design is wrapped around tight opportunity windows and precise reaction, which is quite problematic due to controls and mouse sensitivity issues.Despite all the flaws, the game is worth the money, specially with a discount. Better played in CoOp than single player mode, as some areas are insanely hard for a single player.I give it 6/10 ",139,38,1,27,5,2,24

												Trine 2 takes everything that made Trine fun and improves on it. It has better combat, and more entertaining puzzels. The soundtrack is great, and the game looks visually gorgeous, I have got to say Trine 2 Really is pretty great overall, and it is still modable, so again, this is a great aspect to have if you are looking to get your moneys worth. I would reccomend Trine 2 to anyone looking for an Indie game, a Sidescroller, Puzzle, or artsy looking game. I have got to say there is a good ammount of fun to be had with Trine 2, so dont pass judgement too quickly.			",375,144,14,85,57,11,89

I never really enjoyed many puzzle games, but Trine 2 was one of the exceptions. Trine 2 is a very fun platformer with 3 characters with unique abilities and uses that are used to complete the level. The experience system is very clever, and made me want to get all the experience I could get! With experience points you can then level up your characters to improve their skill sets. Kept making me log back in for more!8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A simply beautiful, addictive, fun and colourful one of a kind platformer. Whether you're creating things out of thin air with the mage or smashing and killing goblins with the knight or grapling and swinging onto ledges and platforms with the thief - This platformer with its interchangeable 3 characters creates a tactical and a  really interesting unique platformer that can be extremely enjoyable and hard to put down.At this price, it's an absolute steal.

												After playing this for a while I love it. Not the best story line in the world but its worth listening too. The graphics are amazingly amazing, and I decided to write this review after blowing up an army of goblins with an explosive arrow. I definitely reccomend it, as well as being one of the few games on steam being perfect for steam big picture. It also has a level editor that I am having fun messing with and I can't wait to make a mod for it. Overall I highly suggest it and the only con I have is it is a little hard to figure out the puzzles sometimes but there is even hints for it. Thanks for reading.			",30,6,0,6,5,0,4

												The concept has a potential but the game design has some flaws.Pros:+ Pretty graphics.+ Kids friendly.+ Has some puzzles in it that involve phyiscs.+ Production valuesOn the edge:? Combat is pretty simple? Thief character is limited to arrows and ropes.Cons- Reptitive puzzles solutions.- Puzzles are always about ""how do I get there"".- Co-Op is weak. You rarely feel that you have to work together and when you do, it just look weird and very awkward.Final recommendation:The game is not bad by all means. It looks and sounds wonderful. It might be fun for younger ages demographics. However, if you were a hardcore 2d gamer who emphasis on gameplay over production value, I'd say to give this a pass or buy it on discount.

												Trine 2 is perhaps one of the most visually stunning 2D platforming games. Either playing co-op or on your own this really is a fantasy-themed 2D platformer with a difference. The game sets a new standard for puzzle driven adventures and the relatively short-length campaign has a wealth of overlaying puzzles and secrets and is an overall entertaining experience and a joy to play.Instead of the usual jump and grind gameplay of the generic platformers, Trine 2 offers a more intricate puzzles with the freedom to find various solutions. Even more interesting is when you’re playing with two or more players the game becomes a colourful array of opportunities to help each other along in an almost sandbox like environment.Switching from character to character is the only way to make any progress when playing alone in single player but invite some friends along and Trine 2 really shines through. Trine 2 features three heroes – a knight, wizard, and a thief – whom you can switch between at any point through the levels. All have their own individual strengths that they can bring to the table at any given time; this keeps the entertainment of gameplay going so you don't end up rage-quitting when getting stuck on one bit for far too long.THE GOOD- Clever platform/puzzle gameplay- Wonderful graphics with physics effects.- Brilliant sounds and speech- Excellent online co-operative playTHE BAD- Sometimes the puzzles are a bit repetitive.- No combat mode for the WizardDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			",109,25,0,18,58,0,23

""What is Trine 2?""Was the very first question someone asked me about Trine 2 was:And I kid you not folks, I looked at the person and tried desperately to not shout out loud ""YOU DON'T KNOW TRINE 2!???"" To be frank, I just calmly(I'm serious) told the person it's a 3 player co-op action/adventure/small rpg/ side scrolling platformer game in a 2.5D environment with gorgeous graphics and puzzling puzzles to test your mettle on.The sequel to Frozenbyte's earlier title Trine, Trine 2 builds upon it's predecessor foundations and game-play by flushing it all out. By means of adding even more graphical options and making the game stand out aesthetic wise to fit the side scrolling theme. The rpg skills you earn have been expanded so you can learn more than the limited amount you can spend points on in the first game. The puzzles you thought were easy in Trine 1 are perhaps significantly harder(just a little wee bit hard, depending if you can handle the mental strain) Granted it's not intensive as puzzles as the Portal franchise from Valve. Rather the puzzles are just there to halt your progress and think about in a minute or two on how to solve it. Story wise our three unfortunate(Or fortunate in finding trouble along the way) main protagonists find themselves entangled with a princess to save her kingdom from evil... BORING! Would've been your first impression of it, but it's far from a simple adventure to save a kingdom. Far from it indeed. There are documents hidden in chests scattered throughout the levels to provide further back story on the game itself. Which is invaluably precious in providing insight onto the simple task assigned above by a princess. I'll leave the rest to your imagination to see how the story will unfold... 3 Heads are better than 2? or 1?I played Trine 2 with 2 other friends of mine and had an absolute blast of a time enjoying the co-op aspect and coordinating with each other to advance to the next level. With the occasional friendly fire I accidently(sometimes) hit them with. Unintentional though! I by no means am a sadistic friend who enjoys the torment of my friends dying before me... Moving on, the options to play in co-op are a lot. you can choose to turn off friendly fire(don't turn this mode off when playing with friends to enjoy their suffering), turning off the option to lift your comrades with boxes,  or put on classic mode and stick with one character, or cheat and have the ability to choose on the fly a different character. 3 Shield-Bro's!? No problem. Let's shield our way!3 Thieves!? Lots of swinging vines here and there...3 Wizards!? Oh, the Box and Plank madness ensues!!!^ Or perhaps you young adventurers want to dabble and mix and match.2 Knights and 1 mage2 Thieves and 1 knight2 Mages and 1thief Go play with the combinations and pick whichever one suit your needs. Honestly, the game has much more appeal and replay ability if you play with a friend locally or in multiplayer, or if you're a gamer who likes playing it solo by all means do so! It depends on your play style of course. Just remember to get the most enjoyment of the experience my friend! An arrow passes through the air at deadly speed nearly nicking off her companion shield-bro's ear. Undeterred by the onslaught of arrows from the shield-bro's companion he continues on, while in passing says to the thief; ""And watch where you aim those arrow!"" The thief only shrugs. Shaking his head softly, he continued onwards on the path, bravely with naught a hint of fear. He charges straight into a path of goblins barring their path. Knowing such large army impedes their way the shield bro merely tells him companions...""I shall clear the way!""Sprinting his large body with a big beer belly under his armor he continues to charge straight towards the goblins......Only to find them in cages?Befuddled, the shield-bro looks in wonder at how such goblins had become entrapped in such wooden cages.""Too slow, my friend,"" says the wizard. His ever grin plastered on his face like a devil.the ensuing cry of an angered knight echoed loudly in the valley that day...-An excerpt from the adventures of 3 friends in the world of Trine 2... Sometimes all you need are friends by your side against a perilous journey of the ages.Total Times Beaten:1Legit: 1(Played 1 full play through with 2 of my friends)Score: 9.5 /10(Score is based off how much I enjoyed the game)(Legit is based off no cheating whatsoever, no guides, walkthroughs, video’s advice, etc.)Date reviewed: 4/15/15			",131,16,2,17,6,0,22

												Really good game design. Unfortunately, the game is rendered almost unplayable by the people in multiplayer. Most of them and I mean 89% will never switch characters, will take forever screwing around, and most unbelievably  have a complete lack of problem solving capability. I think a new game rating should be instated besides E, T, M. It has come to a point in mass market gaming the rating system I for intelligence is sorely needed. Meaning you won't be able to play the game if your dumb, drunk , or high.			",51,6,4,3,6,0,4

												Trine 2 is a masterpiece of the genre.Everything is extremely well made, from the impressive graphics to the ingenious level design.The only downside of the game is that it's a bit short ( ~6 hours to complete the game ).But theses few hours will be worth it.			",222,52,2,18,15,2,19

												Really nice graphics, good optimization, good voice acting as well as interesting puzzles to solve with multiple ways to go about it, if you can't seem to figure it out the game gives you hints. (you can set it to how long to wait before it gives you a hint) so you don't have to feel fustrated and cheat by watching videos of walkthroughs) It's slightly longer than the first game.

Od krásnych lesov, cez púšte, až po vnútro púštneho červa, ktoré je slizky nechutné. Dynamika a fyzika hry funguje bezchybne. Pre 100% hry sa pripravte na multinásobné prechádzanie úrovní. Nie je to zrovna najrýchlejších 100%, ale zdá sa mi že oproti Trine 1 lednoduchšie. Nové schopnosti rozširujú zážitok.			",140,55,1,17,15,0,29

												The game is breathtaking. The visuals are amazing, the original game was pretty, but Frozenbyte took it to another level in the sequel. Not to mention Ari Pulkkinen worked some magic on the soundtrack, the lighthearted high fantasy inspired tunes do a great job setting the mood, and just being great to listen to. The voice work is quirky and well done, and the co-op is an extremely welcome feature that allows you and your buddies to either chew threw the game, or screw off. An absolutely amazing experience, an improvement in every way over Trine. [9.5/10]			",186,51,9,24,12,2,57

												Trine 2 is an excellent platformer, the difficulty settings accurately reflect what you sign up for, the soundtrack is again excellent, the visuals are breathtaking - and some of the puzzles clever and fights challenging. My only gripe is the ability to refund and re-spend ability points at will. It is great for experimentation, but honestly removes any sense of figuring a clever way around some of the puzzles. For example, you often run into a puzzle that you know you could have easily solved had you spent your points on platforms instead of new arrows. Rather than work out some ingenious solution around it - you reshuffle your points into platforms - pass the puzzle, and put them back where they were.It's a small mechanical decision but it dramatically effects my investment in play. There may be a mod to fix it, but this is a review of the base game and that's my only complaint. Other than that, worth the money if you like platformers. Check out the gameplay if you're unsure - it is exactly as fun and whimsical as it looks.Only people who may NOT like this are people looking for a fun co-op experience. With the full 3 players you can not switch, so if the crucial character dies - you basically have to respawn or backtrack. It seems like a system designed to make 3 friends hate each other.Other than that - worth every penny.			",121,54,0,22,12,0,31

												Trine is one of the very little number of games that has it all good. They hit the jackpot with co-op MP that set standards in how co-op should look like. ""TT games"" with their LEGO titles should really look up to how it should be done. Technically this game has no flaws. Kudoz on graphic options and possibility to set limit to framerate to as much as you want to. Story in game is awesome. Feeling is so tale like and those poems adds to do complete joy. Gameplay wise, I have nothing but the good words.. both Trine 1 and Trine 2. Imagine a game where not only that multiple solution to every problem exists, and creativity wake to try different things,,but a game where actually stuff that can go wrong like ""stuck bottle"" that happens as a bug, you can improvise to use enviroment and tools on your hand to get it unstuck or picked up even if it seems impossible :) That part is a 10/10 in my books. On top of that, replay value is awesome. I'm looking forward into getting all achievements.9.6 out of 10 ",33,4,0,2,1,0,5

												Outstanding game!Bought it along with Trine 1 (also great) on winter's sale, it was the best purchase I could have done.10/10 Graphics10/10 Gameplay9/10 Storyline (I'm just picky)10/10 MusicHowever the best aspect for me, it's the co-op. Lots of fun playing with others.There's no good/bad character, all three of them are equally useful on their own way.All in all,  if you seek an escape from the triple A titles, want to goof around with friends while having the time of your life, if you want to remind yourself of that essence that made you  become a gamer when Earth was still flat, this game is a must!

Not only is the in-game music relaxing while you fight off enemies and solve puzzles, the game prompts you with hints if it feels you've been stuck at a particular part of the level with a puzzle. It's an awesome game, with such a wonderful plot. GET IT, and let you be amazed!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I already know enough to give this game a review. It is such a treat to play it. I am only about 1/4 through and am loving every minute of it. This si what playing games is supposed to feel like, yet so often doesn't. It is a magical game. It improves upon everything not done properly  in the first game. You can play multiplayer co-op, although idiots will ruin it my running through and not letting you enjoy the charm. You can pick up where u left off in multiplayer and vice versa with single player. It saves your last checkpoint so no more having to finish the level. The music is phonomenal and soothing. The art, backgrounds, lighting, and ambience are all well done. All reviews have praised the beauty of a game. The thief is now more useful with a better working grappling hook and the mage can be somewhat offensive.			",452,80,11,25,16,6,21

												Gorgeous game. Trine 2 is gorgeous game. GORGEOUS! The world is beautifully built, enemies are beautiful, environment is beautiful, lightning effects are beautiful, everything is beautiful!Other than that, it's a great game. The puzzle mechanics are engaging and fun, but most of the time not hard at all. Combat mechanics are really simple, but it doesn't matter, it's fun and it looks great. Three very different characters offer very different play styles.The game generally isn't hard, but getting all of the collectibles and all experience points is really challenging. The one minor problem this game has is the amount of bugs. There is still quite few of them. Overall it's fantastic game, I can recommend it with all my heart. And did I mention it's gorgeous?

												Back in the early 90's almost every game was a platformer, so I had quite enough of them. Nowadays, I tend to avoid platformers for that very reason.Surprisingly, Trine 2 is an exception to the rule. If you remember The Lost Vikings, then you'll see a lot of similarities between that and the Trine series. In Trine, you also get 3 different characters good for their own abilities that help you solve puzzles and progress.The knight is for fighting the goblins and breaking things. The thief is about shooting arrows and climbing places with her rope (sometimes pushing goblins into pits in the process). The wizard is about conjuring boxes and planks, building from them and levitating everything that he can get ahold of.Unlike the retro platformers, this one is heavily based on physics. This applies to rocks, conjured items and monsters. It also makes the wizard a really fun character to play as.Another distinct feature of the Trine series is the graphics. The living backgrounds are beautiful and the colors are vivid, which can make Trine look better than many AAA titles.Compared to the original Trine game, the most obvious new feature of Trine 2 is its multiplayer mode that allows up to 3 players to play simultaneously. It makes it more fun and helps solving the in-game puzzles as well as finding all the experience and secrets on every map.On top of the above, and going away from the gameplay itself, Trine 2 is packed with little bonuses here and there. It's one of the very few games that support all kinds of 3D glasses out of the box (anaglyph, passive, active). It's also properly configured to be played with a gamepad. There's full Linux and Mac OS support too. And of course it's tightly integrated with Steam, having almost 100 achievements, trading cards and storing your saved games to the cloud.

I haven't tried coop mode, but judging from the videos I'm pretty sure it will be very enjoyable.Music: The music fits the environment, but sometimes I feel like listening to something different because I usually need to spend some time figuring out those puzzles, and the looping music sometimes gets old.I definitely recommend this game!

It even supports dual keyboards and mice.The story is told through in-game voice-overs, so the flow is rarely broken by cutscenes.Not much different from Trine 1, but why mess with perfection?

Gameplay         = 6/10- Well, the gameplay itself is quite simple and easy. Puzzles and platforming. There are also goblins which are very boring and way too easy to fight against, though the boss fights are awesome!AI         = 7/10- The AI ain't nothing fancy, but they do their job.Graphics         = 9/10- The graphics are really good, it's a 2D game in a 3D engine which brings lovely backgrounds!Details          = 10/10- HOLY CRAP, This is what makes the game so fun and exciting to play, the details are amazing. Every little corner has something and it's just cool looking. The background is so entertaining to watch, all the small details... they're everywhere! This is why you mostly want this game, play it with a friend and it's even better.Replayability         = 7/10- Well since the game is quite long, you will forget many parts of the game. If you want a REAL challenge then you can also try out hardcore mode (If everyone is dead it's GG). The game also includes some funny and somewhat hard obtainable achievements for all of you hunters out there!Music            = 8/10- I like the background music, really fitting for a fantasy game.Sound            = 7/10- It got some cozy sound effects, I like it.Glitchfree       = 8/10- I noticed some glitches, but not too many.Community        = 8/10- Well, right now I don't see any problems with the community. They seem nice.Developers       = 6/10- Trine 3 is coming, I'm so excited! The developers are still alive!Story            = 4/10- Rescue the kingdom blah blah... still has something to it though...Length           = Medium- Around 12 hours. [/i]Settings and Tweaks = 6/10- Not that many options to choose, basic audio options (music and sound). DLC             = Cheap- The DLC is included in the complete edition, which is the only version you can buy on steam.---------- FINAL RESULT = 87/100 ",162,34,2,11,9,2,11

The use of colors mixed with great graphics just make this game eye candy.  The narrator is really good.  He has a nice storybook adventure sounding voice.  In this side scroller game you get to play three heroes and they all have special abilities.  During the game you can switch characters at will.  The game has a mix of obstacles, goblins, bosses and lots of adventure.  I love adventure games especially when they make you feel like playing a story.  I definitely recommend this adventure game!

The music is charming, the characters are lovable, the story is a nice fairy tale and the gameplay is extremely rewarding and sometimes quite challenging too.I will never comprehend how a small game developing studio from Finnland called Frozenbyte could create such a wonderful and extraordinary game10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Highly recommended. Playing this cooperatively with three players on the same screen is hilarious fun.This may look like a console game, but the controls are crisp, and mouse support is superb. It even supports dual keyboards and mice.The story is told through in-game voice-overs, so the flow is rarely broken by cutscenes.Not much different from Trine 1, but why mess with perfection?

The levels are fairly easy, and navigation can sometimes be buggy.Despite all that the game features a wonderful scenery mixed with a wonderful narration. I would have liked if it was a bit more challenging, but as it is and for the price it is a wonderful game and I recommend it, especially if it's for younger audiences.			",391,154,14,44,32,2,48

												Um jogo lindo,o jogo mais bonito entre os títulos exclusivos para download, ""Trine 2"" é uma aventura de plataforma cheia de puzzles simples e personagens divertidos. O modo cooperativo amplia a diversão, mas também torna ainda mais fáceis os desafios do game. A Frozenbyte conseguiu melhorar diversos aspectos do ""Trine"" original e caprichou no acabamento do jogo, tanto nos gráficos quanto na física e na dublagem, mas faltou desenvolver quebra-cabeças mais complicados.

A bit of a disappointment.The game looks really neat, and the concept is great. So are the puzzles and I imagine multiplayer would be really good also. I don't have much of a review on this because as you can see I haven't played very much, and that's for one reason entirely. The controls are absolutely terrible. I'm playing with a ps3 controller which works perfectly fine with other games and while I can see that being intrusive for some elements like the wizard's gravity spell, stuff like jumping should be improved by this and it's just NOT. I stopped playing and deleted the files because there's a certain place I just can't jump up to. Some of the ramp based puzzles are made so much harder than they need to be. Why can I make Mario in 1986 jump onto a simple platform but in 2016 it's so ♥♥♥♥ing frustrating it makes me want to tear my hair out?			",14,4,0,2,1,0,5

												It's beautiful, and somewhat fun with a friend for all of ... an hour before gameplay becomes a tad gimmicky and repetitive, bordering on annoying. The games puzzles and graphics are not enough for it to survive alone as a full product and anything less than on a cheapo sale and you can do much more for your money. IMO this game is very over-hyped, I regret persuading my friend to buy it in the sale...as we both got bored in less than 2 hours.Perhaps it's good for a father and young daughter or son to play coop? I don't know, but the painfully childlike story is...more suited to children I think. Peace out.			",60,1,0,4,0,0,6

												If you're interested in games for pretty graphics and casual gameplay, this will be up your alley.  If you're like me and don't care about graphics and want something with good gameplay and a decent challenge, then you won't enjoy this much.  It's not a bad game, it's just very meh, and there are much better games out there that are enjoyable.  I imagine that most of the positive reviews come from people who played this co-op, but I played it single player and couldn't stand to play it for more than 30 minutes at a time without wanting to stop.     The gameplay focuses on combat, puzzles, and platforming, none of which are particulary compelling.  Let me break down 95% of combat in the game: Select Knight or Thief, spam sword/hammer or arrow attack, combat successfully completed.  Even bosses are extremely easy.  Most of the time you'll be able to heal up in the middle of combat and should you somehow manage to die, oh well, warp back to a checkpoint 10 seconds away and come back and finish cleaning up the rest of the enemies.  Combat provides no challenge and serves no purpose other than to break up the monotony of puzzles and platforming.     Now let me break down 95% of the puzzles, which are often repetitive:  Use XP to unlock fire arrows, use fire arrows to blow up destructible walls (if any), use XP to unlock wizard blocks/platforms, spam blocks/platforms, puzzle complete.  Occasionally you'll run into something where you have to stop and think a bit, but it's pretty rare, in fact, I think the only 2 times I ran into something like that was in the Goblin Menace DLC that came with the game.     The platforming is ok but sometimes your movement while jumping gets sluggish and you'll go plummeting to your death.  Particulary annoying is the Knight's hover ability.  You'll hold in the button for him to hold his shield up to hover and sometimes he just won't do it, or he'll wait until he's fallen for a second or two before the game finally figures out what you're trying to do and then you'll have to go back and try the jump again until he gets it right.     There's not much of a plot to the game, it's mainly there to give the heroes a reason to be in that area.  The characters aren't particulary fleshed out.  You'll get a little dialouge at the beginning and end of a board usually, but for the most part it's generic Knight, Thief, and Wizard.     Not much else to say, it's an ok game but there's nothing in it that's really warrants a playthrough.  Pretty graphics, simple gameplay, little challenge.  If that sounds good, you'll enjoy, if not, you probably won't.			",177,73,1,18,19,1,19

												The succesor to the original Trine is filled with even more platformer addictive fun, the single player story is around 6-7 hours. But is filled with puzzle elements and packed with action and adventure all throughout it, and to complement it, it offers a beatifull visual fedelity and with all honesty will drag the gamer into it's magical vibe....

												Rating 9.5/10Overview: 2d PlatformerThe Good:+ An absolutely gorgeous game both artistically and technically. Every level feels alive yet without being overly distracting towards the player. + Every level has its own unique environment. In addition the level design is equally impressive, the game does a great job of slowly introducing harder and harder platforming/puzzle sections. The physics based platforming means you can find solutions that were not intended by the developers. + Good blend between puzzles, platforming and combat+ The gameplay has remained relatively the same since Trine 1. You have 3 characters that you can change at any time to utilize their skills to progress through the level. + Killing enemies or finding experience allows you to upgrade any of the three characters. + A lot of options to customize the game + Soundtrack+ The DLC is fantastic and in some regards does an even better job of changing the environments every level than the main game. The Average:Hard to find an online game, not that big of a deal since the game is probably more enjoyable single player.Some of the experience in the levels are hard to see given the lighting and backdrop of the levels.The combat is a bit dull and not as fun. Most combat can be avoided however.  Conclusion:This is one of my favorite 2d platformers on Steam and should be played by anybody who is a fan of the genre. ",731,344,32,73,63,8,96

												Trine 2 is both a game and a piece of art that is fun to play with friends or in on your own. Firstly the three characters are unique, with both extremely different interesting abilities that range from the ability to create magical objects to the use of explosive arrows and flaming swords. Then the gameplay itself, the game is a mixture of physics based puzzles that can be solved in a multitude of ways and intermittent with onslaughts of goblins and more stranger creatures. In summery, I recommend Trine 2 as an blend of a range of traditional concepts coming together in a great way, but during longer playthroughs the game can become slighlty repetitative, this however is only after extensive time and can be fixed by simply leaving the game for half an hour and then coming back with a fresh mind.

												Trine 2 is one of the most beautiful and fun games I have ever played and has the best co-operative elements out of any game I have ever played and is some of the best and most fun and creative gameplay. The game has fantastic atmosphere, great level design with high amounts of detail and a fun use of physics. It's storyline is simple and a tad cliché but does have a lot of humour within it. A lot of humour also comes from co-op gameplay due to the puzzle solving required; the puzzles might I add are very fun and creative. The game has 3 characters witch the player alternates between with or without friends to get through the puzzles within the gameplay which is a great element to have, these characters are also very funny and have great story attached to them (background). Finally the game has artistic cutscenes to break up the levels which complement the game brilliantly. There aren’t really any downfalls to this game; it was a joy to play.13/15 - ""Fun and creative; brilliant co-op""			",246,34,6,26,27,2,18

												Trine 2 is a delightful change from the FPS stereotype of video games. The game is beautifully made with gorgeous lighting, and very detailed enviornments. Movements are smooth and fluid even on aging computers. There is a hint of humor here and there, along with a very simple and straight forward story. As an added plus, the online scrypt is very well written and remains smooth and glossy even on a slow internet connection. Over all, Trine 2 is a beautiful, relaxing physics platformer that is the perfectly executed and will provide about ten hours of gameplay for you and two friends (Three player co-op: Local or Online).

												Trine 2 is a delightful change from the FPS stereotype of video games. The game is beautifully made with gorgeous lighting, and very detailed enviornments. Movements are smooth and fluid even on aging computers. There is a hint of humor here and there, along with a very simple and straight forward story. As an added plus, the online scrypt is very well written and remains smooth and glossy even on a slow internet connection. Over all, Trine 2 is a beautiful, relaxing physics platformer that is the perfectly executed and will provide about ten hours of gameplay for you and two friends (Three player co-op: Local or Online).

												Graphics/Design - 9 Sound - 7Gameplay - 6Value - 7Single Player Play Time - 7-9 hoursOverall 7.1This is easily the best looking 2D game I've seen.  It has decent sound that fits the game but nothing special otherwise.  Gameplay is the weakest facet of the game as it's very simplistic with puzzles and fighting that provide little challenge.  They should have focused more on the gameplay over graphics.  There's three main characters that each have special abilities you'll need once in awhile.  The only interesting character of the three is the wizard that allows you to build ways to manipulate the environment.  The focus of this game definitely seems to be graphics as the fighting and puzzles in the game practically seem like an after thought.  There's not much replay value other than to use the game as a graphical showpiece to friends.  It's a decent experience that makes you hope for a fully realized sequel.			",105,11,1,5,3,0,12

The greatest thing about this game is the amount of ways you can tackle any task with. You can also upgrade each characters, unlocking even more abilities that will change your playstyle. On top of its amazing gameplay, Trine 2 is one of the best looking games of its genre. The music and voices are also really well done.			",253,74,7,28,25,4,27

												A great game to play through in a day with two friends.  There isn't much to say about this game, other than you can make new friends, or ruin old ones, depending on what they do, going into this game you can play singleplayer, but don't, the only way to play this game is with two friends, and the most compitant playing the wizard.  The wizard is the most broken character, and you can basicly fly across the entire map, assuming the mediocre AI doesn't shoot you down.  The other two characters are good, but the rogue is my personal favourite, being able to swing up high then shoot then enemys below you feels great.  This game is riddled with small bugs, but if you look past the graphical glitches it's a fun game.			",197,35,3,14,29,2,38

												Trine 2 is simply a beautiful game to behold, in terms of graphics, gameplay, narrative and charm.  Nearly every element of the game oozes passionate quality from the developers, with the experience immediately becoming apparent to the player.The gameplay, simplistic as it may seem, is immensely satisfying and complimented completely by the online coop aspect.  The sheer amount of fun you will have messing around while completing objectives is something that belays any concerns of cost.Trine 2 is a unique puzzle game with extreme polish, addictive coop online gameplay, beautiful graphics and a love letter to PC gaming.  If you have the slightest interest in puzzle games, purchase Trine 2.			",362,39,3,16,16,2,38

												One of the best co-op games I have ever played. Good pussels, great visuals and great music. A little repetitive with the bosses though and really anyone who knows what they are doing can beat them without dying, the harder part is getting there though. I would like to mention the story a bit but when I played this with my friends we were laughing too much to bother with the story because of how much we ♥♥♥♥ed up before the cutscenes. (and just in general)I would denfenetly recommend this game to anyone. Unfortunatly I think that 8 hours of gameplay (not 100% completed and DLC included) is not worth 16,99€ so purchase this during a sale or something, also get a couple of friends and make them buy this game and play together. It's made for co-op and it knows that.			",95,11,2,12,5,2,7

												If you liked Trine 1, you'll like Trine 2. 2-D Platformer.Only buy this if you plan on playing co-op with friends, can be played alone but its no where near as fun.Use the mage to drop items on your friends while they're attempting jumps, and kill them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great game to play through in a day with two friends.  There isn't much to say about this game, other than you can make new friends, or ruin old ones, depending on what they do, going into this game you can play singleplayer, but don't, the only way to play this game is with two friends, and the most compitant playing the wizard.  The wizard is the most broken character, and you can basicly fly across the entire map, assuming the mediocre AI doesn't shoot you down.  The other two characters are good, but the rogue is my personal favourite, being able to swing up high then shoot then enemys below you feels great.  This game is riddled with small bugs, but if you look past the graphical glitches it's a fun game.			",197,35,3,14,29,2,38

												Trine 2 is simply a beautiful game to behold, in terms of graphics, gameplay, narrative and charm.  Nearly every element of the game oozes passionate quality from the developers, with the experience immediately becoming apparent to the player.The gameplay, simplistic as it may seem, is immensely satisfying and complimented completely by the online coop aspect.  The sheer amount of fun you will have messing around while completing objectives is something that belays any concerns of cost.Trine 2 is a unique puzzle game with extreme polish, addictive coop online gameplay, beautiful graphics and a love letter to PC gaming.  If you have the slightest interest in puzzle games, purchase Trine 2.			",362,39,3,16,16,2,38

												Trine 2 is an amazing looking and very clever puzzle platformer.Alone or with friends, you take control of three characters with completly different abilities in order to solve puzzles and kill monsters. The greatest thing about this game is the amount of ways you can tackle any task with. You can also upgrade each characters, unlocking even more abilities that will change your playstyle. On top of its amazing gameplay, Trine 2 is one of the best looking games of its genre. The music and voices are also really well done.			",253,74,7,28,25,4,27

												Let's see- Where to start. This game has the most beautiful lighting I've ever seen, together with graphics that match the beauty of heaven itself. The music is great, and fits really well with most of the game. The multiplayer option is amazing for friends, so try to persuade them too. The experience it gives is more than just a game- It's almost like you're reading a book, watching a movie, and playing a game at the same time.The combat is balanced, and although there's not much bosses, there's plenty of strong enemies willing to crush your dreams. There's a level system, which allows you to choose your skills. Unlike the first game, there are no items, which is pretty unfortunate. There's a good amount of levels for you to play. The only downside is that you can complete this game in about 3-4 hours of non-stop playing. Overall, I would give this game a 9.2. By far one of my favorite games ever.			",57,13,0,8,13,1,1
