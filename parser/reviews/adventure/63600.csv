												It's Myst with 3D environments and free walking. Nothing has changed, except a mostly irrelevent age was added. Play it if you've never played the game. If you've ever beaten the game before, maybe sit this one out.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I loved this game and am still trying to get through the other 5. Before buying it i would reccommend doing a bit of research on tweaking it. This game (same goes for Riven) came out in the mid 90s. The fact they run at all still is amazing, if you decide to purchase this, it will take a few minutes time to stabalize it to run at proper efficiency. Message me if you ever need some help with tweaking riven uru or realmyst so you may enjoy this as much as i have. (I also would encourage you to read the old game guides because they are written like a personal journal of the character)			",69,12,1,8,2,2,8

												Anyone who is looking to play myst again should get this version of myst,it's far better than the original and it's still better than the new release,bare in mind that it's an old game and that it has not faired well in terms of compatibility but can be fixed easy enough by right clicking the .exe choosing compatibility and setting it to windows xp and put a tick in run as administrator and you will be sorted !For those who have heard of myst and are thinking of buying,this game is for everyone and anyone who likes to explore strange new lands,solve puzzles and be immersed in wonder and atmosphere,myst is like a dream from another dimension,one that you know nothing about but can't help but wonder about and want to know more about,it has lasted the test of time thus far,my six year old plays both myst and riven over most of my games and he is hard to please when it comes to graphics,he has fallen for the characters and locations,the sound and atmosphere,the interesting puzzles and the story just like I was many years ago and I still am now,not many games can do that.Play the game with an open mind,enjoy it's difficulty at times,accept the game for what it is and enjoy YOUR adventure.I recommend reading the three myst books in paperback or digital as it explains a lot and is a fantastic read in it's own right,it will also set you up for riven,the sequel to myst !Enjoy			",336,111,30,45,20,2,47

												realMYST is a remake of the original game Myst, re-rendering the entire environment in 3D and allowing for more normal FPS controls. For a game originally released in 1993, it actually looks and plays quite well - it will require a little bit of work (including one patch) in order to play properly on modern machines (the QT plugin isn't correct) so don't assume it will be plug-and-play.Controls are a little floaty, and the puzzles are not changed at all from the original game, so people who have played Myst before won't find anything all that compelling about playing through again. For people who are on their first play through but don't want to pay for the Masterpiece edition, this may be more to their liking (Channelwood, in particular, is a lot less obtuse when you're actually walking around).Beyond that....it's Myst. It's a very good point and click adventure game that manages to balance being obtuse without being unfair. Worth a playthrough in some form, at the very least.			",499,185,8,84,55,5,102

												Myst is a remake of an old point-and-click puzzle game from many years ago. I came into the game knowing it age, and realizing that I would be dealing with compatibility issues because of it. So, after a bit of tweaking- thanks to the Steam forums for help on discovering that disabling scaling on high-DPI in the compatibility issues would keep it from freezing- I was able to dive right in.With no death or real failure- mostly- in the game, it is a nice change of pace from most games in one's library to explore and investigate the ages, or worlds, bridged into by the linking books found on the island of Myst.The worlds were beautiful, the sound was excellent- though repetitive in some areas, and the atmosphere of the game was excellent down to the very end. While the interface took some getting used to, and remained a little clunky even after I got used to it, Myst is enjoyable when you play it for what it is. The puzzles may be easy to some, boggling to others, but its a fine little game if you come to appreciate it for what it is. If anything, I am a little saddened that the game was limited in its scope by the technology of the time.			",226,79,5,38,33,4,50

												For anyone using windows 7 who is having problems:Goto \steam\steamapps\common\realmyst.  Rightclick on the realmyst.exe file and select the compatibility tab.  Set compatibilty to windows xp sp3, and check the box that says run as administrator.  Save the changes.  When the game first starts it offers setup or play.  It defaults to 800 x 600 16bit color.  I changed mine to 1280 x 720 32bit color, but suit yourself.  It runs on my machine on 64bit Windows 7 with no problems.Everyone needs to play this game at least once in their lives.  It is beyond being a classic.  It is a necessisty.			",22,119,0,0,4,0,5

												I ran realMyst on:- Win 8.1 64bit- Intel Core i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz- GeForce GTX 980M- 16.0 GB RAM- compatibility mode set to Win XP SP3- running as an administratorThe original Myst came out when I was a teenager. I loved it then and devoured not only the game and its sequels but also the novels and the soundtracks.Now, many years later, I've revisited the island. realMyst ran well for me: no crashes or other issues on my modern hardware. Sometimes I saw some artifacting around the edge of the screen but this was minor. Navigation and clicking was a bit wonky at times but not too bad for what I expected. My only real complaints are that the Steam overlay never worked, I couldn't take any screenshots with either the Steam function nor the Print Screen key, and alt-tabbing was a bit finnicky.The game shows its age texture-wise (I will probably buy realMyst: Masterpiece Edition for the updated textures later) but content-wise it still held together well. It's been long enough that I didn't really remember the puzzles (was even stumped a few times despite knowing I should know the answer) and even the content of the remaining journals in the library was only partially familiar.The two sons evoke the right kind of emotional responseâ€”Achenar especially. For a game that isn't violent or frightening, it nevertheless has its disturbing moments, and this is perhaps made more potent because of the extra freedom of movement to get up close. There's a curtain in one room, and given the other paraphranalia present...I couldn't help but wonder...what's hidden behind that curtain...? Certainly not a window. And then I decided I didn't want to know.I enjoyed what to me seems to be enhancements from the original. Stumbling across the grave marker for Ti'ana in particular was an ""oh wow"" moment that has me wanting to reach for the books again. The bats in one of the underground tunnels were a nice touch too. Discovering the additional content after the original ""desired"" ending was a real surprise and quite satisfying.Definitely recommended.			",27,13,0,11,1,0,1

												While you can't go wrong with Myst: Masterpiece Edition, realMYST is a great game in its own regard. Provided you have a good computer and run this game in compatibility mode, it's a well-crafted environment that brings all the mystery and allure of Myst into a real-time 3D world that still looks pretty freakin' good. The widescreen support is a big plus, too, but the controls might feel a little odd, especially since you can sprint and circle-strafe to get from one island to the next in about 3 seconds. Buy this game if you want to see MYST in an entirely new perspective.			",484,161,11,42,40,3,29

												I love the Myst series, and when I stumbled upon realMyst I was excited to give it a try.  However, upon running the game, there were so many bugs it was nearly unplayable.  After searching forums for about an hour for solutions to the choppy gameplay, crashes and other issues, I gave up and moved on.  I certainly recommend Myst to anyone, just not this version unless you have the patience to problem solve the program itself before even getting a chance to play the game.			",196,51,3,25,19,0,30

												I've seen a lot of negative reviews of realMYST based on the game's tendency to crash. Running a Windows 7 64-bit, I initially had a few problems myself, but after changing the compatibility mode to Windows XP all problems stopped. Granted there are still occasional problems with hearing the dialogue.I grew up watching my father play the MYST games; and after years of being unsucessful attempts of even getting through the first level, I decided to give this game another chance. All it took was some patience and note taking. If you're a fan of puzzles, this game is an excellent place to start. If you're not to keen on solving the puzzles quickly, please take the time to read through the books in the game. The books are masterfully crafted and add to the richness of the story.

												I've played Myst, the original, the Masterpiece Edition, but never had I played realMyst.  This version offers a fully 3D rendered version of Myst where you can control the head and the legs of your character just like a typical shooting game rather than clicking on the screen to advance to another pre-rendered screenshot.  This actually worked rather well and I thought that even by today's standards that the world still looked decent.  Overall, the puzzles have not changed at all, neither has the story that the game tells.  If you already have Myst, this game is not necessary, but if you're avid fan of the series, this is a must play.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												I would only recomend this if you have an operating system older than windows 7, are very good with coputers, or are very very patient. Although I really enjoyed replaying one of my first and favorite games it was extremely hard to get through because the game kept crashing. It worked perfectly on my windows 7 computer until I went to the stoneship age, my second age, where the game crashed for the first time. I was able to get right back on but it happend two or three more times before I got back to myst. From there it worked fine untill my fourth age in the spaceship where it crashed again and wouldn't let me back on. I tried looking in the comments and help pages for a solution but I just got more error screens. So I undid all of it and tried the next day and it worked but still crashed like twelve times before I got back to the myst island. The back room in the bonus age was terible it laged like crazy and it crashed pretty much every minute but I did get through it after moving. saving, crashing, and restarting repeatedly.

												realMYST is undeniably the link between the MYST of the past and the gamers of today. While the original still contains as much as nostalgic value as it did the day I first opened it, this remake creates a modern experience for those who lack those original ties. If you've heard about MYST and want to try it without any prior experience or appreciation for the early-90's graphics and style, then realMYST might be just what you need.			",368,166,7,56,44,3,78

												This review is for the realMYST version and not the game Myst in general, that game is recommended many times over for any fan of adventure games.Graphics:This game is a full 3D remake of the original, with much better graphics that the original and I had it running in full 1080p resolution.  Some people have complained about some texture issues, but I haven't noticed it, but it is possible that there is more graphics quality inconsistency than the original, but everything is still better than the original.  I found that having fluid movement helped my immersion of the game.  Controls:Some people have complained about the game's controls, personally I found them better than the original.  You can adjust several control settings such as mouse speed and dead zone size in the options to suit your needs.  I found the game easier to play when using just the mouse and ignoring the keyboard, left clicking to move forwards.Compatibility:Be aware that some people have had some compatibility issues with the game; you should be able to get the game running, except maybe with some bugs.  Expect more issues if you have a 64bit system.  I personally ran the game with Windows XP SP3 32bit and the game ran perfectly for me, so if you can fall back to an XP system, that will work for you. I will update the review when I upgrade to Windows 10 64bit.Recommendation:I would recommend this version of Myst to any newcomer of the series.  The only issue is that it doesn't cater to nostalgia as much as the original version, so if you are playing the game purely for a nostalgia trip; you might prefer the Myst Masterpiece Edition.

												I got this working on Windows 7 Pro SP1 64-bit. After installing the game, just make sure you find the RealMYST.exe program file, right-mouse click it, and troubleshoot compatibility first before launching the game for the first time. Running as if in Windows XP SP2 works for me. Due to rundll32.exe related issues, you may need to find the RealMYST.exe running process in the Windows Task Manager and end it before attempting to launch the game again. I can also choose any of the video graphics options on the RealMYSTSetup.exe; they all work as they should (I have two Titan Black cards in SLI). I didn't need to do any crazy hex mods (as purported elsewhere on the internet) and the game doesn't crash for me.As for the game itself, this is probably my all-time favorite version of Myst. I had only briefly played the original at a friend's house a few times, but played and beat this version in the early '00s. I also like it better than the realMyst Masterpiece Edition as I think it does a better job of fully realizing and visually achieving the setting and mood of the game. Though the graphics are more dated looking in general, I think it still looks aesthetically pleasing and appropriate overall. Some of the textures, especially wood, can still hold their own more than a decade later.In the original Myst they had a very limited color pallet and resolution to work with by today's standards, so objects and visual features needed to stand out more to be seen and identified in a scene. This was largely corrected in realMyst with textures that made more sense, making it more of a true update. realMyst Masterpiece Edition seems like more of a nostalgia motivated rerelease of the original, but doesn't really hold its own nor make sense by today's standards. Things like the flashlight/excessively dark areas, marker arrow indicators, ""tower rotation"" being displayed on the Myst island map in the library, and so on just seem out of place and don't really add anything to the game.Even though I already own realMyst on disc, it was worth getting another copy of it on Steam for the current price.Enjoy.

												It's good old Myst but in 3D!! And with additional content such as an entire new, gorgeous Age to explore!Myst in itself has always been a game I held dear but this has some different things. First off: it's easier to get through the first puzzle, i.e. getting it to run.Then you have the fact that this is no longer a point and click slideshow. There's a good and a bad side to that. While you do lose one of the defining features of the original, it makes it so much easier not to get lost and faster to get to places. Channelwood is now suddenly easy to go through.The graphics aren't that great. I prefer the gritty look of Myst ME but this isn't ugly too. There's always realMyst ME I guess. Although the new lighting makes it so that a certain area that you wouldn't think of going into with the lights off in the original is now suddenly somewhat acessible as there's just enough light in there to make out where you are.The addition of the day and night cycle, while neat and athmospheric, makes it tough to progress on some Ages as you can't seeâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥and thus have a harder time getting the puzzles done.If it weren't for the added content I wouldn't recommend this but maybe check realMyst ME before buying this and see where you'd rather spend your money.

												Well what to say about one of the games that started it all, a adventure titan, and most sold adventure series of all time.and it all started in a garage. And when it cama out on CDs, CD-ROM sales went off chart. Becase of a game.Or should I say a gem.There are adventure games and there is Myst. Great grpahics even now, great story, parallet worlds, great puzzles, reverding gameplay.Puzzles are hard, so be prepared with at least a pencil and a notebook. My girlfriend and I used notebook, and small digital camera, to take pictures of different signs in the game. They are not only visual, technical but also audiatory puzles. Its just marvelouse game. An anyone into adventure point and click games, MUST play myst games. Because after 20 years the are still benchmark, and still to be taken down from the throne of best advenure games ever.Highly recomende!			",53,24,1,10,1,0,9

												You awake on the dock of a mysterious island. The air is clear and there's not a soul in sight. You find a few buildings and an assortment of levers, wheels, and buttons. You see a looming tower, overlooking a small, wood-paneled room. There is a shelf of books inside the room, but most of them have been charred and are unreadable. A few remain, still intact. You open one and begin reading. You soon realize there's much to uncover about this world on the isle of MYST.(Before we go any further, you should know that this 15 year-old game doesn't like to cooperate on modern hardware, so you'll need to mess with some compatibility settings or other workarounds to get it running decently) I'd heard about MYST for years. People always complained about its difficulty or praised it as one of the classics. After toying around with some settings, I got the game running fairly smoothly and I felt...confused. MYST is infamous for its lack of instruction, so I didn't find myself off to the best start. Unfortunately, this was a somewhat common theme for me, as I had to look up a couple hints and solutions along the way. Aside from a couple short video clips and some writings, you're pretty much on your own. Despite my early troubles, I think MYST's puzzles are generally very fair. Yes, they can be difficult, but most are straightforward and very logical. Most of the challenge comes from figuring out how to put together what's directly in front of you. MYST doesn't give you a lot of tools to work with. All you can do is walk around, open doors, manipulate objects in the environment, climb ladders, and pick up a small handful of items. This isn't really a problem, however, since the puzzles are focused and the small number of elements are very efficiently used. Overall, the gameplay is simple and challenging, and the mechanics are sound.Now MYST is already a great puzzle game, but the game's sound and visuals are what really makes it special. realMYST takes the original's pre-rendered static scenes and replaces them with a fully rendered and animated 3D world. Though this is a contentious decision, I think this change really suits the nature of the game and, from what I understand, it still preserves the original look and feel of the world. A movement speed setting would have been a nice addition, though. realMYST isn't exactly a pretty game by modern standards, but the graphics do convey a very desolate and eerie atmosphere. The textures, while dated, still make the world look fairly realistic. There are even day and night cycles in most of the environments, though their inclusion isn't exactly necessary. The sound design is top-notch, with howling wind, flowing and rippling water, chattering birds, creaky walkways, and more. The sound cues are even necessary for some puzzle solving, but they're used sparingly and expertly. An ambient soundtrack occasionally plays when suitable and it too greatly enhances the atmosphere of the game. Overall, the aesthetics combine to create moods of tranquility, fear, and melancholy, as well as a constant state of lonliness that really immerses you in the environment.This was my first real experience with MYST and it will not be the last. While the game is relatively short and it's ending abrupt, I'm more excited than ever to experience the other titles in the franchise and hone my puzzle solving skills. If you're a fan of games with puzzles or a great atmosphere, you should definitely play MYST in some form. I can now clearly see how much MYST has impacted both classic and modern gaming. If you consider yourself a general fan of games or a games enthusiast, I highly recommend you play this treasured (rightly so) adventure of the past.			",205,80,2,12,9,2,24

												realMYST is a 3D iteration of the original Myst. The game was designed as a point-and-click and the 3D adds nothing positive in this instance. In fact, it is optimized poorly and only makes the controls and figuring out what to do more frustrating. I would only recommend this to hardcore fans who are willing to endure to see the additional content. For everyone else, Myst: Masterpiece Edition is the better choice on Steam, and realMYST: Masterpiece Edition has also been released at this point, with updated textures, making this completely obsolete.

Be warned This isnÂ´t just another point and click adventure game. This is a hard nut to crack, but i had a great time doing it!			",219,75,0,19,25,0,46

												I bought this game in hopes of re-living what I think to be one of the greatest masterpieces to ever happen in video game history. What I got was my fps tanking down to 1-5 fps for no â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ing reason.â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥controls that not only borderline ruin the entire experience but make the game a chore to play and graphics that manage to be worse than the original! I want my money back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Aside from a few bugs this version of Myst is fantastic. I grew up on the Myst games, and entire series, and love them to death. Even after beating them I find them highly enjoyable. They were one of the first games to provide for me that ""immersion"" sensation where I could get completely lost in a video game. I loved the additions to the realMyst version and would highly recommend it to anyone either new to gaming or a savvy veteran.			",144,32,0,21,8,2,20

												This is probably the best updated version of Myst on the market to date. While further editions have lost sight of the atmosphere and detail of the original environments, this version gets the mixture of updated graphics and original feel just right in my opinion. Having played many other versions of Myst before the release of the realMyst series, I can say that this is also by far the easiest to get running, not requiring a whole ton of research into installing old versions of Quicktime and such.This is the version I reccomend for new or old Myst players. It's painless, and still feels like Myst without taking too much poetic license with the graphical updates.			",109,22,1,5,3,4,5

This version as well as the other ones, of the main first Myst game, do not work. I can only play for 10 mins, trigger the puzzle in the lighthouse and this freezes my entire computer. Have to hard boot it. This is a new Asus ROG too, not a cheap computer, but steam.. I will NEVER buy another game. Your digital copy gets errors and you refuze to replace w a new program  ?~!!?!?!

												Though the graphics are a bit outdated today, they were relatively great for the time they came from.  On computers with lower memory and graphics capabilities, Myst has a tendancy to crash.  On machines with higher graphics capabilities and newer opperating systems and more memory, Myst runs smoothly.  It is the mother of all 'escape' games. By that I mean the user must complete various and seemingly unrelated puzzles to move around between 'ages.'  I wish more of the story were told through a short video or pictures or even a vocal narration.  Most of the story is in books, and although books are the basis of travel between 'ages' it is tiresome to read book after book to get all the details.  Overall, Myst is a great puzzle/logic/thinking game where everything you do has a consequence.  It is challenging, and addicting.			",6,20,0,2,1,0,0

												I purchased this for my partner (who was a fan of the orignal game) But this game is unplayable. This is only game I have downloaded on steam that I cannot find a suitable workaround. The fact that so many people have had trouble running the game, even on better performance computers, really negates the point of having for purchase. In my opinion this is an utter scam. For me, personally, it's a let down and waste of money. And it's a bit soul crushing for my partner who has been searching for a non-disk based version for aaaaages and is given this opportunity only to have it jitter, jutter, and crash.I'm very disappointed.

												realMyst is a very weird experiment to bring the original Myst into the 3D world. Mostly it's the same exact game as Myst with it's brilliant story, lore and puzzles. But the actual game itself is terrible. It is also really hard to navigate with the world in this one and it makes some of the simpiler puzzles really hard not because it's tricky but because it's hard to actually do anything. The game incrediably unoptimized too. The game can lag on even higher speced computers and crashed often for me. If you want to experience Myst the best way to do it is to get the original. But if you want to be modern it's best to buy the remake of this version realMyst: Masterpiece Edition which fixes most if not all the problems realMyst has.			",73,11,0,4,6,2,1

												Having only recently discovered the Myst series I have to say it is an aquired taste. Compared to modern games, the Myst series can be merciless in how vague it can be about what to do next. I'm not joking when I say I'd suggest playing this game with a pen and paper available on your desk is almost mandatory. Essential clues are dotted about which can be visual or aureal and sometimes you won't need the clue until much further into the game, so taking notes about every significant sound or unusual symbols or every scrawled peice of text you is a very good idea. The Myst storyline is somewhat light so don't do expecting much but if you enjoy good brain teasers and solving mysteries I'd highly recommend this. Patience WILL be required though.

												Well, it's Myst. Myst itself makes for a good game. And this adds freedom of movement, day/night cycle, occasional rain and some additional content to the mix.But, well...It's a good idea badly executed.On Windows 7, you might experience frequent crashes. If you intend on keeping that OS, don't buy this game.The fortress rotation has some odd behavior to it.The animations are very wonky, and it's very annoying how badly they are aligned with their respective sound effects.There are some who say this has better graphics than the original. IT DOESN'T. Sorry, it just DOESN'T. As a matter of fact, those graphics were good back when the game came out. And Myst was exceptional in this regard.All in all, the game looks more like a cheap attempt to grab money. It's a nice thing if you can't get the original to run, but otherwise keep your hands off.			",223,96,2,17,55,0,60

												I have been playing Tiger Woods '08 PC on a regular basis since it came out back in 2007. No modern game has come close. That is until this game was released. The graphics are top notch and very realistic. The addition of trees and bushes since last year improved the visuals a great deal. The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidiaâ€™s graphics technology.Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to play with up to 8 players. You can stop and resume your round at a later time. There are loads of different play modes available. If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online. The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last round from a number of different angles. Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for the game is the freecam mode. Take a virtual tour of the entire game from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.This game has lived up to its potential. Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month. This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come. Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.			",127,14,1,10,5,3,6

												I had the orignal version of MYST years ago and thought it would be fun to pick up on the new version.  I'm sorry to say that it will not run without extreme lagging.  I even installed a game booster and disabled my internet raido button with no success.  It was terrible sitting in one place trying to move throughout the island.  This game is not one you want to run on your laptop.  Windows 10 - HP Pavillion  17 Notebook - X64 Processor - 4 GB memory .			",0,1,0,0,0,0,0

												More than a simple graphic overhaul, ""realMYST"" takes the original from '93 and frees the character to move about in real time rather than being at the mercy of pointing and clicking to see new screens. This makes navigation infinitely easier. A fifth Age is  added to the game, giving it a more suitable ending, and acts as a kind of trailer for the sequel, ""Riven."" If you have never played the original ""MYST,"" or want to give the concept a try, download this version rather than the ""Masterpiece Edition.""			",67,25,2,17,5,1,21

												Myst was the highest-selling videogame for nearly a decade, before finally losing out to The Sims in 2002.  That alone should tell you something about how great the game is.  Point-and-click adventure games with static backgrounds are still often referred to as ""Myst clones"", and for good reason.  realMYST allows you to explore one of the greatest visual experiences of all time with minimal restriction, using graphics that--while not photoreal by any stretch--are still some of the most beautiful sights in gaming.  If you haven't played this before, you're missing out on a truely unique experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent adaptation of the original MYST from a 2d point and click to a full 3d puzzle game. The puzzles are challenging but ultimately beatable. My only gripe is in the stoneship area the game designers seem to have made a rounding error which caused my calculations to be off by one on a puzzle and stumped me until I looked up the answer. Other than that minor setback the game is amazing. I filled about 8 full pages in a notebook to help me keep track of all the locales and data I needed to solve many of MYST's puzzles.

												A remake of a classic, realMYST still works on so many types of computer. Adds an extra Age to explore and loads of bonuses at the end. It also has a reference to the parody (Pyst), for some reason. It's one of the best games to this day. People may prefer better graphics, but they really don't need to ever be better than this.

												This is one of the most complex games I've ever played, and yet I remember it as such a time and thought-sink that I'm wary to really delve into it like I did when I touched it as a kid. I don't think I ever completed the full game, but for people who like puzzle games with detailed stories, this is certainly a game to pick up. The key feature of realMyst as opposed to Masterpiece edition is the 3D gameplay which Cyan used in Myst: V, (not sure if it was used in 3 or 4) The sequel is a stronger game, and it doesn't require you play the first one, but this is where it all started and it's quite the adventure.

												The first of a five part series, Myst was released back in 1993, and was one of the few true Puzzle games with a RPG element: Story.  While I didn't appreciate it when I first played it back in '94, it was one of the few games available on the elementry school's library computer back then, and it's puzzles were difficult (at least, to my 6th grade self it was).realMYST, is a step forward... literally.  The original Myst was point and click to move or to manipulate the environment of the current ""room"" you were in.  realMYST is redone with full 3d movement, with all puzzles and textures intact.Although the whole series aren't available to the PC market; Myst, Riven, and End of Ages are available, and are a must-have for any true puzzle fan.

												First off, let me clear the air. Yes, there are performance issues with RealMyst on Windows 7/8. When I first ran it, it was very choppy in certain parts, and crashed every 5 minutes or so. I tried a few solutions online, but none of them seemed to work. However, after setting the game to run as an Administrator and in Windows XP Compatibility mode it runs smoothly, and without any crashes. There is no guarantee that this will work, but it seems to solve the issue for most people.As for the game itself, it is the same old Myst that you know and love, only taking the time to add a small (but cool) age at the end of the game, and to update the graphics. The new graphics on highest settings look similar to the screenshots, though it is worth noting that you can add anti-aliasing and resolutions at least up to 1366x768. They add a refreshing coat of paint to the outdated visuals of the original, making it more than playable even in this day and age. Also, the new control scheme is pretty nice, allowing you to mouse and keyboard, though I preferred using just the mouse. Granted, the controls aren't perfect, but they aren't horrendous either.Now would I recommend this over RealMyst Masterpiece Edition? I only own this edition, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. However, it seems to me that the Masterpiece Edition's graphics jumble and confuse things more than they ought to. Watching videos of the Masterpiece Edition makes it seem like certain elements are harder to see, but that of course is up to personal taste and perception. It seems to me that this version is a fine version of Myst, and it's price is hard to beat. I don't know that the Masterpiece Edition's graphics are worth the extra $12.Bottom Line: If you feel like replaying Myst, or want to experience it for the first time, I think this game is the one for you.

												I finally got the game to work on my Windows 8.1 HP laptop thanks to my brother's efforts. Last time I payed this I had Windows 95 on a rickety old desktop that was as likely to give me the blue screen of death as launch the game. I forgot how much I missed playing this. The puzzles have not gotten that much easier with age and wisdom, though the effort it takes to solve them without cheating via google makes progression feel even more satisfying. I can appreciate having to work for it that much more now. I'm going to buy the books and read them again because nostalgia is kicking me in the head like an overly excited mule. I hope I find them as interesting now as I did when I was little. This game is not for everyone. It's not an exciting shooter and it's not fast-paced. The story is very good and the puzzles interesting. There is no hand holding in this game, you either find the right clues and put them together correctly or tough luck. Taking notes is helpful. Having a vivid imagination and curiosity makes things even more engaging and absorbing, especially if you have read the Book of Atrus which gives you a solid background of info to work with.

												I was a big fan of the original and figured why not get this upgraded remake?Sadly, even with a monster of a PC running it, it drops to single didgit FpS in certain areas. (I learned how to avoid them, and where not to look. Which if you don't know, is the center of the island, near the fountain, avoid looking at the dead center, to keep FpS in the 10+ range)Changing graphic settings doesnt fix it, as the game is just using really poor programming.And I would put up with this, if it were possible to actually continue, w/o the game closing out every 5-15mins.By the time you get anywhere, from having got stuck in a pool of single digit FpS, it's like trying to escape a tar pit, knowing th egame is going to close out any minute, you just don't have the time to sit back and enjoy anything.This seems to pretty common amoungst some of the reviews, so I would suggest you keep your money.

												No really, hear me out.  Myst is a game that came out in the dawn of CD based games, and was hailed as a masterpiece of technology with it's (holy crap) pre-rendered static 3D environments!  This was a game which in 1993 was squarely levelled at the thinking audience, not those playing Super Mario Bros 3.  Adults who never played another computer game in their life could become completely engrossed in this game and its mythology.  In these spoilt brat days of Unreal 3 based gaming, an interactive slideshow is frustrating and unlikely to hold your attention for more than the time it takes you to make one complete circuit of Myst island itself.  Your spatial awareness was so hampered that even the relatively simple puzzles could make you dizzy.  Enter, realMyst.  Yes, it's a DirectX9 engine, but when compared to the technology used to prerender the original game, it's like handing Plato your PSP, and he probably wouldn't have minded Myst.  (Aristotle would've sneered at it.)			",535,192,10,48,37,3,46

												I would definitely recommend realMyst to anyone who played the original and wants to revisit an old friend.I quite enjoyed this reboot to an old favorite and I must say I didn't find the new 3D interface as terrible as some reviewers.  (In fact, in some instances it made the puzzle solving much easier.)  I like to think back to this game with nostalgia, as it was the first computer game I played and am very glad I purchased a digital copy, rather than fighting with the old disk.  I did not buy this expecting the graphics to live up to the standards we see more modern games, and in that Myst had not lost one ounce of its charm.After completion of the game: I did not encounter any problems running this game in Windows 7 (no freeze-ups, no dropped saves, no glitched books, etcâ€¦).  Certainly there were a few frame issues stemming from the 3D port, but it did not affect my appreciation for the preservation of this classic. For those of you who have had issues running the game, I suggest reading up on the solutions in the forums.  My advice is to (1) make sure everything is up to date (your computer and the game itself), and (2) insure this game launches itself in compatibility mode (I chose Windows XP service pack 3).

												UPDATE: There is now a ""realMYST Masterpiece Edition. I haven't played it myself, but imagine I'd recommend it over this if I had. Original review follows.An excellent update of an already excellent game, it's hard to recommend RealMYST whole-heartedly. Mostly, the video sequences are much better in Myst Masterpiece; here, due to the real-time 3D (as opposed to pre-rendered screens), they look pixelated and are sometimes hard to hear. However, nearly everything else is fantastic, and you really do feel like this is Myst the way it was meant to be played. I'd recommend this version above all others (make sure you run it in the proper compatibility mode, though), and if you want to see how the video sequences were originally, you can probably find them on YouTube et al.

All of the graphics are updated, and I guess they changed some of the story to fit better with the sequels. I'm glad they went back and updated this game. It defined the adventure puzzle genre, at least for me when I was a kid. It took a bit of tweaking and scouring message boards to get it to work with Windows 7, but in the end totally worth it!

												The Gold Standard in Point and Click & Puzzle games in terms of story and difficulty, I was able to figure out the majority of the puzzles and what to do, but I had to use a strategy guide for some of the puzzles; something I hate to do.  I feel games like these help build your creativity in order to solve puzzles.  The story is different, the levels are one of a kind. Also, there are multiple endings, you can get a bad ending if you don't do certain things in the game.

												I was a big fan of the original and figured why not get this upgraded remake?Sadly, even with a monster of a PC running it, it drops to single didgit FpS in certain areas. (I learned how to avoid them, and where not to look. Which if you don't know, is the center of the island, near the fountain, avoid looking at the dead center, to keep FpS in the 10+ range)Changing graphic settings doesnt fix it, as the game is just using really poor programming.And I would put up with this, if it were possible to actually continue, w/o the game closing out every 5-15mins.By the time you get anywhere, from having got stuck in a pool of single digit FpS, it's like trying to escape a tar pit, knowing th egame is going to close out any minute, you just don't have the time to sit back and enjoy anything.This seems to pretty common amoungst some of the reviews, so I would suggest you keep your money.

												Myst was a Masterpiece in the history of gaming, and in 3D FPS I'd say it is even better!  The texture mapping was well done, and the atmosphere is only enhanced by being free to walk/look around the Ages.  I had the game crash on me only once, but thankfully my memory and the discovery of the run button (hold down the shift key of course) helped me recover two hours of gameplay in only about 15-20 minutes and it also taught me the valuable lesson to save periodically.  I recommend this game for anyone who loved the original, though it may still be quite bland to those who don't enjoy these sort of puzzle games.Note: If you are having issues getting this to play properly on Windows 7 or 8, try right-clicking the realMYST.exe file located at: Steam\steamapps\common\Real Myst and changing its compatability settings to run in Windows XP SP2 mode and check the box next to Run as Administrator.  It seems to be a common problem people run into and this is what worked for me to resolve it.			",520,233,24,117,32,2,109

												WHY AM  I UNABLE TO PLAY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its slow and i cant move 3 in without lag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is vary upseting.I have just leard that to play the game you will have toTry using compatibility mode.[whatever drive you have it on C for most people] -> Program Files [It might be Program Files (x86)] - Steam -> steamapps -> common -> realMyst. That could be entirely wrong depending on where you installed it to, but basically you have to find the realMyst folder. Within that folder, find the application. It should end in .exe. Right-click it and select properties. Click on the compatibility tab, try setting it to win xp service pack 3, if that does not fix the problem also try 2000 and me.But waht really bugs me is that last year cyan redux realMYST by makeing a master Masterpiece edition, it would have been nice to get that in the cyan bundle pack instead of a ton if dude games....dont get me wrong i love the co. but I am vary disapointed.... (sorry if i miss spelt anything)			",49,11,0,7,2,1,6

												I'm a real hardcore Myst fan. Have read all the books, got the OST CDs and played all the games mulitple times (Except Uru.. hated that one), so I'm coming at RealMyst as someone very passionate about the games as well as the genre.  It had been a while since I last tackled Myst, so the puzzles were vaguely familiar, but not easy to solve: e.g. I knew the way to solve the generator puzzle on Myst, but not the specific response.    The translation to full 3D brings this game back to absolutely fresh. It was great to be able to experience this all over again from a completely new perspective.    I'd say that many of the puzzles were a lot easier thanks to the ability to spin around and see the status of switches and pipes without having to step-move-turn-step-etc  to see.  The graphics are all quite rudimentary for a 3d game - polygons as well as shading and fogging artefacts show up a lot, reminding you that this is quite an old game.   Saying that, the translation to full 3D has been done in a really sympathetic way:  the ages all feel the way they used to, and the addition of atmospheric effects, variable lighting, day/night cycles and so on really adds that ""well loved"" feel to this remake.  The world feels exactly the same, basically, which is a remarkable achievement considering the time span between the original and remake, the different teams and technologies.The new team has added in some new content as well, including a new ""Age"" which helps to link to the next game, Riven.  There's a nod to ""Ti'Ana"" from one of the books, and other small additions here and there.  Very nicely done.The music and sounds have been lovingly ported over.  The music is exactly as I remember it, and the videos in the books look to be direct copies of the original video files: No upscaling or re-taping has been done, so the grainy feel of the books is perfect.The game plays through virtually seamlessly (see Crashing notes below).  The ability to only move forwards and backwards and spin is probably some way to make it 'feel' more like the original, so you gently slide into the ""myst groove"" as you move through the world.OK, so the game itself has clearly been remade by a team dedicated to the faithfulness of the original.. But how did they do technology-wise? Well if you're playing this on a modern PC (windows Vista or above) you're gonna run into problems.     The game really needs to run as administrator in XP compatibility mode to reduce the number of CTDs.  Secondly, the format of the videos in the books is the exact same ""Indeo v5"" that was used in the original game, so I'm guessing the video files are the self-same video files!   Unfortunately Steam doesn't install Indeo.  I had to hunt about to find an appropriate install. The ""official"" ones didn't install properly, so ended up going to cucusoft to get theirs... Once that was done, the book videos started to play, and I didn't get the wierd ""1FPS"" bug when I was facing towards the ""library"".Once that was all sorted, the game crashed on me about 5 times during the playthrough, so I advise saving every 10 minutes or so.  Set an alarm clock or something to remind you... Once I played for about an hour and it crashed.. not too pleased.Getting to the end was a real joy.  Totally enjoyed the addition of ""Rime"", but it confused the heck out of me when the game didn't ""End"", I was just left at (basically) a dead end.  This is intentional, and Even Atrus says that's what I should do, so I can't be too gripey, but it was a bit ""hunh?"".This is a fantastic remake. Anyone who enjoyed the original should get this and re-enjoy it all over again.  It doesn't take long to finish.  Just remember: save often!  Two-thumbs-up! ",210,93,7,32,33,0,53

												It's hard to describe exactly what MYST is.  Calling it a ""puzzle game"" is like calling the graceful albatross ""a bird."" People who played it (long ago) nod to each other and sigh, remembering simpler times.  The 3D version retains all of the 2D version's gameplay, and adds some nice environmental features; time of day lighting, dynamic insect life and water.  The graphics are far below modern standards, but it does run at resoultions far higher than the original, with the added bonus of actually being able to move and look around seamlessly.

												Myst is a fun game...and this version actually has more interaction which makes the gameplay go faster. Its no longer static like the original versions, but it actually has more effects and stuff. In the end its still the same myst, whether you like that or not.  I for one think its fun and thought inducing.			",74,19,2,12,8,0,4

												With my childhood memory of the original Myst, i've always been keen to love what Cyan spits out of their adventurebag. Especially this title, which combines 3D and the seemingly 2D world that is the original Myst. 5/5			",95,18,3,6,11,2,13

												A remake of a classic, realMYST still works on so many types of computer. Adds an extra Age to explore and loads of bonuses at the end. It also has a reference to the parody (Pyst), for some reason. It's one of the best games to this day. People may prefer better graphics, but they really don't need to ever be better than this.

												This is one of the most complex games I've ever played, and yet I remember it as such a time and thought-sink that I'm wary to really delve into it like I did when I touched it as a kid. I don't think I ever completed the full game, but for people who like puzzle games with detailed stories, this is certainly a game to pick up. The key feature of realMyst as opposed to Masterpiece edition is the 3D gameplay which Cyan used in Myst: V, (not sure if it was used in 3 or 4) The sequel is a stronger game, and it doesn't require you play the first one, but this is where it all started and it's quite the adventure.

												So far it looks great and the 3D is neat to explore and see myst in a new light. However, it gets bogged down to where I can not move on some parts, and it just crashed a few times while trying to read books. I am able to play other games on high settings with no problem, so I know its not my computer. Just not sure if anyone else has these issues or not.			",48,2,1,3,1,0,1

												More than a simple graphic overhaul, ""realMYST"" takes the original from '93 and frees the character to move about in real time rather than being at the mercy of pointing and clicking to see new screens. This makes navigation infinitely easier. A fifth Age is  added to the game, giving it a more suitable ending, and acts as a kind of trailer for the sequel, ""Riven."" If you have never played the original ""MYST,"" or want to give the concept a try, download this version rather than the ""Masterpiece Edition.""			",67,25,2,17,5,1,21

												Myst was the highest-selling videogame for nearly a decade, before finally losing out to The Sims in 2002.  That alone should tell you something about how great the game is.  Point-and-click adventure games with static backgrounds are still often referred to as ""Myst clones"", and for good reason.  realMYST allows you to explore one of the greatest visual experiences of all time with minimal restriction, using graphics that--while not photoreal by any stretch--are still some of the most beautiful sights in gaming.  If you haven't played this before, you're missing out on a truely unique experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
