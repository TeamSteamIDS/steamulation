												After completing this game on the hardest difficulty, I can say, that this is the only game that has a similar gameplay to the Hitman franchise. And if it didn't had an unlimited save option on the last difficulty, it was going to be a lot harder than any of the Hitman games. This game is definitly not for everyone. It is one of the hardest stealth games ever made and shooting your way out is impossible on most of the missions. The game has the wonderful stealth feauture of hiding in plain sight by using different disguises to infiltrate enemy areas. But most of the places are so crowded, that you will find it very hard to remain undetected, even if you take an unique disguise. Getting a disguise is not easy, enemies are hard to be distracted most of the times and after getting distracted, they can become very unpredictable, so you have to be very patient. Things I liked about the game are:+ this is a pure stealth game that combines a lot of elements from other stealth games+ disguises work significantly well, as long as you don't do anything suspicious;+ things like running, crouching or crawling are suspicious, so you cannot act strange in front of your enemy and hope you can get away with it;+ in order for you disguise to work, as a Russian spy, you must only carry enemy German weapons or they will detect you;+ disguises work only if they are acquired after sedating, strangling or stunning an enemy, which means you cannot shoot someone, take his clothes and expect to fool someone else, while the outfit is covered in blood;+ if enemies get alerted after sounding an alarm, like when they found an unconscious body for example, this will automatically mean you can no longer use stealth as an onption because enemies know there is something very wrong with the situation and won't be fooled again. So you must be stealthy all the time, in order to complete most of the missions;+ you have a lot tools at your disposal like chloroform for sedating, strangling wire, pliers, knifes, pitlocks, explosives, snipers an other other guns and most of the times, you can choose what you need the at the start of every mission; + the minimap and the detection meter are very helpful to complete the mission;+ you have a rating system that monitors your playstyle like in the Hitman franchiseThings I didn't like about the game are:- you don't have that much of a freedom like in the Hitman titles;- they can detect you too easily at times, especially when enemies tend to stare at you for no reason.- characters seem to be communicating with each other, but you can never hear real actual conversations- the story is very weak, so if you are looking for a good plot in the WW2 era and a motive to complete the levels to see what happens next, this is not the case- the character you play as is also too plain. You won't hear him say anything during the missions and you won't find him interesting at all like Agent 47 from the Hitman games.- the game was not polished and it has some technical issues Overall, this game was not fully developed. It has some very interesting and challenging gameplay and most of the times, it surpasses the gameplay of other stealth games especially in realism, but due to the fact that the game was made with a low budget, it wasn't developed to be a top-selling title. I only recommend this game to people who really enjoy playing stealth games, especially Hitman fans.			",53,4,0,0,0,0,0

												Death to Spies is probably the most niche recommendation I can possibly give.While by no means is it bad, it's definitely the type of game you're either going to love or hate.The problems it has are pretty big.It has almost no sense of atmosphere, with many levels lacking music. Most of the characters in-game are lacking any sense of real voice acting.Most blatantly the international version of the game is censored to not include swastikas or Hitler portraits.There are NO subtitles whatsoever, and the few english voice actors they brought on to do cutscene work are absolutely monotone, beneath even Bethesda level.Thankfully, if you're in love with stealth games, all of this is trumped by the frankly insane amount of work put into the game's levels and mechanics. You will probably never find a stealth game that's as hard, yet as fair as this one.You will work for HOURS finding the perfect disguise and route to penetrate the ONE small hole in security the developers made for you, and you will ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE it.That said? If you don't feel like spending loads of time, patience and thought on any given level in a stealth game, you're probably playing the wrong one.Death to Spies has levels so difficult and guarded that the game expects a degree of lethality, rewarding the best rating in spite of 10 or so guards killed at times. This makes it fairly unique amongst the game's peers in that while it doesn't encourage lethality, it makes it a necessity rather than shunning murder altogether.If you like tough as nails, yet fair and complex stealth games to the point that you can tolerate questionable delivery? Pick this game up.You owe it to yourself.			",379,32,7,19,21,3,36

												You are a Soviet counterintelligence agent reliving his memories of sabotage / assassination assignments for SMERSH through flashbacks during an interrogation. The storyline is scattered, as it features select important missions from the spy's CV. Each mission is thus standalone and the main character remains the mysterious strong & silent type. The graphics and controls remind me a lot of Mafia 1 and Max Payne 1 and 2. The shooting accuracy is very messy (not smooth). The game is undemanding and runs smoothly even on older / weaker rigs. Despite it being set in WWII, you won't get that ""nazi bashing"" feel you get with most games set in that era. DTS is a long enough (will take you 10-12 hours to comlete), stealth-oriented game, so you get lots of rewards for acting qietly - infiltrating enemy compounds, silently disposing of bodies and walking around in enemy uniforms, for the obtainment of which you get a rich array of tools (strangling cord, cloroform, poison, throwing knives, silenced weapons, distraction tools and opportunities, whistling, etc) and you get a rating for your work at the end of each mission.A lot of people and gaming magazines claim the game is overly difficult, and it is not due to the quality of AI. As a matter of fact, the game is difficult mostly due to their quantity. Some missions are literally spammed with civvies and soldiers (who are immune to spatial awareness) to the point where you can't reach your objective on time. Don't get me wrong, even on the easy difficulty, the AI has excellent sight, hearing and identifying capabilities. The higher up you go in uniform, the less suspicion you arouse. Enemies will also recognize foreign weapons and backpacks. Trigger an alarm and you'll have to redo a whole section. Save, save, save. I normally have around 7-10 saves per mission and each mission is about an hour long, mostly because of unknown variables, such as random civvies / soldiers walking in, or you walking in on an uncomfortable set of enemies. You'll spend a lot of time scheming and waiting for an opportunity to strike and hide a body, or a window to run past a diplomat, pick his safe and replace his documents. Compared to other stealth games like Splinter Cell, Death to Spies is more ""wooden"" and realistic in terms of the human limitations your character has - get in trouble once and it's over. He can't even climb stuff other than ladders. He's just a regular guy, and that makes fooling an entire enemy base such a rewarding experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a third person stealth shooter, where you play as a Soviet spy during the second world war. The graphics of the game are a bit outdated, and the AI isn't the best, but the storyline and the rather difficult gameplay make up for it. I'd definitely reccomend this game if you like stealth games. However, the game is extremely difficult, so be prepared to spend a long time planning how to solve a level.			",73,9,0,4,13,0,22

Pros:* Interesting level design* Solid Hitman-esque gameplay* Well thought out design requiring patience and creativity to succeedCons:* Voice acting is not the best.* You only end up really using 4 weapons for the majority of the game.* Less than streamlined HUD and inventory management (akin to DayZ).* Graphics, however serviceable, look a bit dated.How Long To Beat?~13 hours on normal difficulty.Review:Not since ""Hitman: Blood Money"" have I played a game in the genre that just felt so perfect in terms of what it offers. However, that's not to say it was without flaws though, because there were definitely some things that were less than stellar, and I did run into a few bugs here and there with getting stuck in doors when operating them, forcing me to reload. Luckily it only happened a handful of times throughout the game, and since there are no save restrictions (there's even a quick save), it didn't take much time to get back to where I was, which made it, at worst, a minor annoyance.You play the role of a Russian KGB agent, who is sent on all types of missions ranging from either capturing or assassinating German officers, performing acts of espionage, rescuing allies, to even blowing up places of strategic importance. The game is split up into 10 missions, each lasting anywhere from around 45 minutes to 2 hours depending on the difficulty setting, and style of play. There's a great amount of mission variety, making sure you never get too comfortable with a certain type or style of environment. The missions, while appearing quite linear are very open-ended in how you go about achieving your goals, and it's never about just meeting one objective either. In fact there are always several ways to succeed. To give an example of this, one mission has you infiltrating an internment camp where your overall objective is to rescue a friendly agent. You have no idea where in the camp he is though, so the first order of business is to obtain that knowledge. To do that you need to go to the officer quarters in the middle of the camp, which is something you can't just walk into wearing your Russian uniform, or carrying your Russian made weapons and backpack, as you'd just get shot on sight. So you stalk a patrol to a quiet place, where after having disposed of them, you slip into one of their uniforms. However you still can't just stroll right in, because there are certain types of German personnel who can identify you as not being one of theirs, and this will once again get you shot on sight, so after finding a weak spot in the fence surrounding the base somewhere, you cut a hole giving you access to the base itself. Once inside, you quickly locate the officer barracks, only to find a guard denying you entrance, telling you that someone of your rank has nothing to do inside. This means you need to find an officer and acquire his uniform in order to gain access, which is easier said than done. Once you've done that though, you're then able to access the officer barracks where you can find the correct papers, meaning you now know the agent's location. From here there are several ways to rescue him. One way is to stay in the officer uniform and obtain some access papers that'll allow you to escort the prisoner to the exercise yard, and go from there. Alternatively you can acquire a doctor's uniform, enabling you to escort the prisoner to the medical station, and go from there. You can of course also try to just kill everyone in the camp who gets in your way without getting caught in the act. However you choose to go about it, each way presents its own obstacles, which makes for an often very tense and always interesting game session.When a mission is completed, you're graded on your efforts by use of a scoring system. Did you take your time, and chose to subdue the least amount of enemies using only non lethal methods such as chloroform, or were you pressed for time and chose to not leave anyone breathing along the way? Furthermore, were you able to hide the bodies well enough so that they weren't discovered later on? Were you noticed, and if so, did you manage to kill the enemies before they could rush off to sound the alarm? All these things, and more, end up giving you a final score alongside information about how long it took you to complete the mission, though in truth it's all a bit irrelevant, and is really just for personal enjoyment, since as long as you complete the mission in any way, you'll still progress to the next one. There's no gear to purchase or leveling to be done.The game is well worth your time, though keep in mind that it was released in 2007, so adjust your expectations accordingly. However, if you're the type of gamer who can look past dated graphics and some issues, I'd very much recommend it, assuming you're a fan of the genre.Personal Notes:I happened upon this game by pure accident. The only thing I knew about this game before buying it, was from what I could gather from about 5 minutes of gameplay footage on youtube, showing off what looked to be a good Hitman clone. I'm really glad I decided to take a chance on it without doing a ton of research first, because there's something to be said for going in without a lot of preconceived notions.I hope you found the review helpful. Should you have any feedback - positive or negative - please don't hesitate to leave a comment.			",330,130,11,49,21,0,42

 This game is overall very good.   It is very different from your average WWII game which there's a lot of shooting.  This game involves careful planning and stealth.  You will find yourself dead very quickly if you start shooting.  I will discuss this game under these heading:LEVELS: There are 10 levels in total.  Most of them take at least 1 hour to complete.  The levels include; a German concentration camp, a British hotel, an American military base and a German military school.  A detailed tutorial mission can be done at the start of the game.DISGUISES: Disguises are an important element of this game.  Most levels you start off in Soviet military camouflage clothes.  German soldiers will immediately start shooting at you until you get a disguise.  There are different disguises available.  A German soldier is the most basic disguise.  Most German soldiers will not bother you but higher ranks may see through your disguise.  Some levels require you to get officer's uniforms, staff's clothes (e.g. a chef) or a worker's clothes.WEAPONS: Before you start each level you can fully customise your equipment.  You can carry a shoulder, side and a knife weapon.  Main weapons include MP40s, MP44s and Stens.  Many pistols are also available.  The silenced pistol is he most useful.  Knifes can be carried - they can be used at close range or thrown.  For silent kills you are equipped with a choke cord and chloroform.  You can also punch people, although this is nosier.VEHICLES: Vehicles can be driven in some missions.  Trucks, motorbikes and cars can be driven.UI: You can swap between a main map and a mini-map.  You can use the + and - keys to zoom in and out.  The AI are shown as green, yellow, red and grey icons; green meaning no suspicion of you, yellow - vary (don't stay around these guys too long!), red - alert, usually if they see you they will raise the alarm and grey - civilians.  A suspicion meter appears at the top of the screen when guards are suspicious of you.  If this fills the alarm will be raised.AI: There are many different types/appearances of AI people, though they aren't great.  Once you start shooting they tend to run around crazily until they compose themselves.  Mostly they're OK though.Sound: The sound is good in this game.  German music can be heard coming from gramophones and the environmental sound are good.  The AI are pretty wordless.  This is improved in the sequel Moment of Truth (they say ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to you if you're dressed as an officer!)OTHER: You can pick locks, spy through keyholes, sabotage functions to distract attention away and more.This is a great game I recommend you buy it (wait for a sale somewhere - and get the Gold Edition, it works out cheaper).  If you like a game with lots of pace and action this may not be the game for you. ",23,11,3,0,9,0,5

												This game is amazing, and has so much more than you would expect! It is certainly a challenge. It is not a ""shoot anything that moves"" game, rather, it is more of a game of stealth. I started the game on easy mode, and figured I could just charge in and shoot all the enemies to complete the mission, like you would do in a call of duty type game. I ended up dead realy quick. it took me about 5 hours just to complete the first mission, but it did not get boring. Buy this game, or better yet, buy the Gold bundle and play both the games. Dont expect this to be a fast paced, or ""graphix"" game. This is not a game you will be able to complete in a weekend.			",252,63,12,34,14,7,35

												In Soviet Russia, Man-Hit you! This is basically WWII Hitman with GLORIOUS MOTHER RUSSIA as your employer. Plot is irrelevant since it's more than likely the kind of WWII ""intrigue"" story you've heard, seen, and had forced down your throat umpteen times.  But really you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger bang for your buck on Steam. The levels are very large and give you lots of options to complete missions within the parameters you need to work with. Nice to play a game that understands how experimentation and problem solving make for a good stealth game, not just being able to set up several ""silent takedowns"" with click of a button.

You start out in the Drop zone and have to work your way past a few Patrols. From there you must work your way to a Mechanic who's Uniform you must take to DRIVE ACROSS THE MAP where the main objectives start. I won't spoil the rest. It's amazing how much you have to do in just the 1st mission. 10/10 for the stealth alone. This is not New school run n gun Stealth.

Posted: October 10, 2014
												I want to make this very clear before I properly start this review: I have put this as ""Not Recommended"" as it is definitely not recommended for the average gamer - for most, it will be too frustrating and infuriating to last much longer than an hour. However, if you are a big stealth fan like myself, then you will get some enjoyment out of this game. That enjoyment is limited though, and I'll explain.If you've played the Hitman series, Death to Spies should instantly remind you of it. You're walking around open areas with multiple paths and disguises are a vital aspect of the gameplay. The difference is that Hitman does it a lot better. The disguise system in this game is a strange beast - you can wear multiple disguises in each level, usually 2 or 3, and usually one will be ""better"" than the other - as in, there will be less ""red"" enemies who are able to see through your disguise. The whole thing doesn't really make sense - some enemies, for whatever unexplained reason, know you're a spy. I've completed the game from start to finish and I still don't really get it.This game is also mercilessly difficult and frustrating. I won't say ""challenging"" - because that implies you have to think deeply and strategically about what you're actually doing. Most of the time, you'll have quick save and quick load at the ready, doing things in hope rather than guile and seeing if they actually work. The game leaves you very little hints or clues about how to achieve your objectives, which I know some will love as they hate the idea of ""hand-holding"", but it isn't a black-and-white concept - there is a middle ground where the game can both help you out and you can think for yourself how to solve situations. Other stealth games like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid get that middle ground, while this unfortunately doesn't. People who dislike stealth games often criticise popular titles in the genre for being trial and error games - and yet, as a stealth fan who's played most games in the genre, I found this overly trial and error based. I don't think I've ever looked at a walkthrough as much as I did on this game as often I was left wondering how I was actually supposed to complete my objectives.Just to add insult to injury, the game is rife with bugs and glitches. You'll find yourself getting stuck in walls and tiny unexitable areas. You might experience a glitch where the camera is in a completely opposite direction to where your character is moving. Oh yeah, and the music in the intros is incredibly loud, so you've got that to enjoy whenever you launch the game.One area where Death to Spies does deserve credit is the map design - these maps are unusually large for stealth games and is a great change from dark, linear areas in many stealth games. However, there's nothing to do in these areas - if you want to complete the missions, there's always some linear path that is by far the simplest way to complete the missions. The game makes it far too difficult for you to actually use these open areas so you can complete a mission a different way from someone else.Despite all these issues, I still had fun with Death to Spies, and other stealth fans will feel the same. Credit has to go to the developers, as you can see they tried - the poor English grammar due to the game being a low-budget Russian title adds to the appeal a little. Unfortunately, the game is just plagued with too many flawed gameplay mechanics to make it enjoyable for the general gaming populace - and it's that which kills it.			",450,81,15,37,19,4,21

												Death to Spies and it's sequel Moment of Truth are both some great stealth/espionage games that I'd never heard of before... and it's greatly worth the money. Imagine if the Hitman series had a baby with Metal Gear Solid 3... in World War II :)Yeah, It's pretty awesome. Also, it's cool to play primarily from the Soviet point of view in the WWII setting... instead of just the same old-same old of the U.S./British troops.Can't recommend these two games enough.

												Just like hitman but instead of the modern time its the WWII time!! You work for a russian agency that normally arrests traitors, deserters, spies and criminal cells but instead of arresting them you must eliminate them. Driveable cars, trucks, and bikes. Ai are really tough. Always in a german base with lieteralyl 60+ enemys. You can take out your targets the loud way or you can kill them in a silent wayIf your a steath person and enjoyed the hitman series, than this is the series for you!			",903,197,17,58,57,3,87

												After completing Death to Spies I am very pleasantly surprised with the game mechanics and shockingly smart enemy A.I. Enemies will respond accordingly to mostly all of your actions on the field but I recommend stealthing this game fully as the A.I. can become brainless when you are caught. They run around aimlessly and constantly chuck grenades at you. The game is definitely meant to be played silently and it is way more rewarding this way.Death to Spies has you tackling Nazi prison camps, bases and even tasks you with destroying an entire bridge to cut of enemy reinforcements to the front lines as well as a few other locations I will leave to you to find out for yourself. Do not expect anything exciting from the story and dialogue as that does not seem to be a huge focus in Death to Spies. Character voice acting and lip to voice synchronization is a mess but I did not let that take away from the stories I created within each individual mission. To say the least, Death to Spies is truly underrated and was lost in the shadows of Hitman. It is a must play for hardcore stealth lovers!Personal Score: 8/10Based on the gameplay, definitely not the story :p			",175,12,3,19,6,0,5

												Agent 47 meets Commandos............ God, this game was hard! 'Death to Spies' puts you in the shoes of Russian counter-intelligence agent Semion Strogov who, whilst under interrogation, re-lives the covert operations he undertook as field agent. Mission objectives range from assassinating high-ranked enemy officers including spies, traitors and deserters, stealing secret documents and missile/weapon plans from scientific facilities, freeing (or assassinating) prisoners from concentration camps/lock-ups and blowing up bridges.The game is divided into ten missions, none of which are inter-linked in any way. Similar to other games of the stealth genre, disguises are an essential part of gameplay. The protagonist can change into any enemy (or civilian) uniform provided the fabric isn't damaged via acts of shooting or stabbing. Enemies, depending upon their ranks, can see through disguises so it is better to don the disguise of a high-rank official to pass unscathed. Gunplay and explosives are barely functional so don't expect to complete missions Rambo-style. Enemies converge from all sides the moment you're spotted and a huge barrage of them bring you down within seconds. A silenced revolver, muffled sniper-rifle, chloroform rag or knife are usually all that is required but useful ammo is scarce so essential targets have to be chosen wisely. Stunning enemies produces noise in a limited area around which could alert nearby adversaries. Knives can be thrown, with their trajectory depending upon the intended target's distance from you.An overhead radar map shows enemy positions with vision cones that exhibit their fields of view, which may either contract or elongate depending upon the protagonists posture. Whistling and smoke bombs are efficient methods to distract enemies, making them leave their positions. Running also produces noise which can result in an enemy sentry come investigating. Discovery of enemy bodies results in the alarm being raised which might fail the mission or consequently increase the number of highly-alert patrols.Environment interaction is extremely restrictive which makes missions all the more harder. I've often looked at windows/ledges and wished they could be opened or accessed in some way. Actions have to be timed perfectly to fulfill objectives. A few vehicles can be driven but they have little use unless driving them is part of the mission objective. Enemy bodies can be picked up and stoved inside boxes or trucks. Drinks can be poisoned on more than a few occasions. And locks can be picked through a fun, yet challenging mini-game.The game is gorgeous, if you don't go over the textures with a magnifying. There are a variety of locales which include wide open camps with buildings that can be entered, academic institutes, bombed-out towns, scientific facilities, hotels and an embassy. And the period attention to detail is flawless and extremely well done. Death to Spies is a deeply flawed game. What makes the game so frustrating at times is its restrictive gameplay elements. I've heard its sequel has improved upon a lot of areas. It requires some time and effort to calculate one's next move and the quicksave/quickload button would be abused mercilessly. But regardless, completing missions is a very rewarding experience.			",74,12,0,3,1,0,3

												Definitely an enjoyable, and more open-ended take on the formula established with IO Interactive's Hitman series.  It can be difficult to gauge how obscured you are, and once the alarms are raised, there's practically no chance of escape or success... Howeverthe levels are large and open, and it's very clear which disguises will work on who.  There are none of the clever machinima interstitials that suggest optimal methods to eliminate targets that Himan relies on; instead you're left to figure out the best course of actions through your wits alone, and this can be no easy task.  The graphics can be convincing at times, and are above average for a small-studio game from 2009, but everything's rough around the edges, from weather effects, to the ambient noise in rooms.  This is definitely a ""great for what it is"" kind of game, so don't expect a triple-A title.			",275,79,5,30,28,4,48

												Plays basically like Hitman with a bit of Commandos. It's pretty difficult and unpolished, so I'd just recommend it for more hardcore stealth fans who can look over a relatively steep learning curve (I didn't have much trouble, but many other people seem to) and an overall lack of polish. If you can get over that, Death to Spies is a really fun game. I especially like the overall atmosphere. My only complaints are that it's relatively short (especially Moment of Truth) and that missions don't seem to have as much replayability as in Hitman. The story is also pretty weak and confusing, but I never cared for that in Hitman either.			",251,25,8,35,37,1,66

Very much an unappreciated game. The levels are huge and well thought out, dispite the WW2 setting you get to sneak around some very nice and often quite exotic places including an old medieval castle straight out of Wolfenstein.Story:The story is about as good as its competitors in the genre. Think of the Hitman series up until Blood Money or Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. It is told through the main character reciting what he was doing behind enemy lines to a member of the KGB.Gameplay and Feel:The mechanics are solid and easy to get used to, levels have no element of randomness, they will behave the same way every time you restart them. While this may hurt replayability, it insures that you will not be screwed out of a successful run of the mission because the game didn't play by its own rules. The game comes with a full inventory management system which is what separates it from the Hitman series, you can only carry so much with so many pockets and things stored in your rucksack aren't immediately availible when you need them.Difficulty:I'm currently playing through the original Hitman: Codename 47 and I've completed Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, I would say that Death to Spies is easier than both of them but for the right reasons. Death to Spies does a great job of making sure you know what you need to be achieveing and even presents you with options for completing it, but the game doesn't play itself, it'll expect that you know how to get to where you need to be and you'll find yourself trying alternatives to the obvious. I found each level needed to be replayed about 2 to 4 times in order to get it right.Screw Stealth what else is there on offer?:The combat is pretty standard for a third person shooter of the day, no cover based shooting, no regenerating health, just you, your ammo, and your guns (think Sniper Elite). Guns sound nice and satisfying, and as you are fighting soldiers there is enough ammo in most levels to blast your way through. However in levels like the Hotel level you will find you are lacking firepower, and as your targets also lack their own personal army they will often run instead of going searching for you.What is the Tutorial like?:If you are new to the stealth/spy genre (not to be confused with pure stealth or stealth action) then I can confidently tell you that this isn't the deep end, but it's no paddling pool either. You'll find the tutorial pretty compresensive, but slow. I don't recommend skipping it even if you are a veteran of the Hitman or Splinter Cell games, as there are differences in mechanics that can open possibilities you wouldn't otherwise know about.

												This isn't for the faint of heart, or those easily frustrated, but if you're persistient enough it's a great stealth game and well worth a buy.The game is set in the context of an interrogation by a Russian intelligence officer of the protagonist, Sermion Strogov, as he recalls several missions he was involved in during WW2, in various different countries and with different goals. That isn't a spoiler, as the story is completely worthless and adds virtually nothing to the experience, it's just there to provide context. Your average Call of Duty game is more story-focused, so don't get this if you're looking for a deep, intriuging narrative experience. The level design and stealth system are both great. Levels are fairly varied, though a few missions are quite similar to one another. Trial and error is crucial - this is a very hard game, and you will die, or be discovered, or fail, a lot. Constantly dropping saves before doing anything risky at all is strongly advised - it is not a pleseant experience to have to reload back 5 minutes because you messed up avoiding a single guard. The health system is BRUTAL - no regenerating health or bullet sponge hero here. Strogov will die extremely quickly under fire, and there is no cover system so being discovered is essentialy a death sentence. Trying to just shoot everyone is pointless - you'll just die over and over again.The graphics still stand up in 2016 - it looks dated, but not awful.The controls are fairly bog-standard, and as someone who is primarily a console gamer I found them surprisingly good. However, you have to constantly correct Strogov's movement - for some reason, he walks diagonally by default. There are a few irritating animation glitches, but nothing gamebreaking and certainly not what other reviewers are sugguesting. Whether or not you get enjoyment out of this is basically down to how much failure you're willing to put up with. Just use your head, think what the logical solution is and you'll fail slightly less.  ",18,1,0,2,5,0,2

												It is true when people compare it to World War 2 Hitman. For example, most dead NPC's uniforms can be stolen and worn. Be warned though: This game is hard! I don't play many stealth games, but even on the lowest difficulty, the enemy's suspicion meter seems to increase very quickly and easily. One thing that makes stealth hard is that silent takedowns are hard to perform. When you crouch run behind the enemy to complete a takedown, their suspicion raises to full almost instantly. If you screw up here, the guard will turn around and quickly unload a mag and kill you. Another thing, which I have yet to see in another stealth game, is that when you are disguised and walk into a guard's ""cone of vision"", their cone of vision will follow you for a time because they are watching you, which could lead to the suspicion meter growing. Also, even when disguised, like in hitman, higher ranked NPC's will get suspicious of you faster.So far, I have not completely finished any level stealthily, as I'm not very patient. Instead, I use more of a run-and-gun playstyle with a small mix of stealth. So far there have not been any stealth requirement levels, but I expect one might come up. One thing to note if you plan on run and gunning is that the guns are realistic in terms of recoil. Holding down the trigger for more than 2 seconds will send your sights flying upwards, so you will find yourself clicking your left mouse button for every shot to be accurate, even on smgs.One con that I have noticed is that on multiple occasions, I would stealth kill one guard, and then the body gets found. Normal, right? Well, if there are five or six guards nearby, and they all see the body, they will run to it and start searching nearby. This system makes it so that at times, one body will make multiple guards clump around it and make easy targets of themselves. A couple of times, I've thrown a grenade at these groups and gotten multiple easy kills.Another problem is that if you camp in a one enterance area and hold your crosshairs on the door, wave after wave of guards will come running through the door idiotically, and run right into your spray. The only way they can prevent this, is if they see you, they will sometimes throw a grenade at you (Instant death, no matter how much health). The problem with this is if you are camping a door, you will most likely spray them down before they have time to throw a grenade. Because of this exploit, after several camping sessions, the door way would literally have a heap of 10 to 15 corpses.Another complaint I have is that when driving cars, going reverse will make the camera akwardly look down, then back. Also if you are reversing, the camera gets locked looking backwards, meaning that you cannot look in fromt of you while reversing, and vice-versa (this mechanic gets really annoying specially when you are trying to escape guards and can't look at them unless you are driving towards them.Also, if you are worried about content, you don't have to. At the time of me typing this, I have run-and-gunned my way through 3 missions in 9 hours (though I did make it my mission to kill all the nazis on all of those maps, even the ones that were out of the way) Plus, these levels are highly replayable, as you can choose your loadout at the start. You can choose any combination of equiptment you want through a weight system. Because of the difficulty in stealth, health system (no regen and only one full health medkit-sometimes none-per level) and shooting mechanics, this game really is hardcore stealth-action.For me, Death to Spies is a steal a $10 for any stealth, action, or WW2 fan!Oh, and also, lots of people say their game is buggy beyond playability, but I haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs yet.

												Very interesting and intense game at times. I personally like stealth and espionage games therefore this game fell right into my domain.Mission design is pretty good and allows for a variety of approaches. Voice acting is a bit off in the intro scenes of each mission in terms of quality. It is not carried out throughout missions which is a good thing.Dynamics are added that will not allow you to wear an enemy's outfit if you put a bullet through it however sometimes it glitches out and won't let you change costumes even with headshots (I tested this out since I saved before trying to obtain an officer's outfit and I was able to get it in my 4th or 5th attempt).Physics seem good and the graphics are not bad for a game that was created in 2007. The graphics are pretty good actually.The AI is okay as well; not dumb but not super alert as well (this may differ on your difficulty settings).The retail price of $4.99 seems to be quite a good price for this game. I got Death to Spies: Moment of Truth but I have yet to play and possibly review that game too so I cannot say if $12.99 is worth the two games or not; if it does go on a sale the 2 game bundle may be worth it.Rating - 8.2/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Death to Spies is a spy infiltration stealth action game, similar to hitman, released in 2007 on steam.It's situated in world war 2, intel gathering, capturing targets, assassinating targets, rescuing targets, destroying targets, etc. Comparing to hitman, it's more punishing leaving no room for error. It's very realistic in terms of reaction of AI etc, delay in shooting etc.There're 2 main issues I find, getting stuck in places but you can still try to squirm out and hard to gauge the grenade throwing. Other than those 2, it's a pretty decent game for a 2007 release.Other than the stated, treat it as a world war 2 hitman game. You will need to run it in windows xp service pack 3 compatibility.It's totally worth the price at the moment, but due to the age, I would recommend getting it during a sale.			",182,57,3,9,24,5,33

												This game will test your patience on a number of levels. On one hand, you will dive into a series of detailed and fairly open maps, stealthily accomplishing complicated tasks. On the other hand, your patience will be tested as you scum saves and restart missions again and again, because the difficulty level is just brutal even on easy.Honestly, although the graphics are dated and the mechanics are clunky, the detection system is one of the most realistic I've found, forcing you to forget your previous notions of darkness=concealment, and sneak based on line of sight and noise. The gameplay is easy to get used to, and after a while may get repetitive, but it is moderately worth buying. Reccommended at sale price, however. ",20,2,0,3,3,0,0

												Have you played Hitman series, specially those games before absolution? And what about old splinter cells? Did you enjoy them? Okey then, you will enjoy this game too. Game and story setting is unique and you probably have'nt seen anything like that before. Levels atmosphere are great and game mechanics will remind you some of the most iconic old school stealth games. Game gives you freedom to choose your approach through levels, you can choose your equipment before starting missions, levels are big enough so you can pick a strategy, there's no ""Mission Failed"" after raising alarm so you can always try ""Plan B"". So what are you waiting for, just buy the game and jump into the missions... NO, wait a second.There's a show-stopper issue which will not let you to proceed into levels. When character enters an ""Indoor"" place, such as rooms, bunkers, etc. two things happen:1st) It reduces character movement speed so much, even when character is in the running state. It feels like character has been stuck between some invisible walls and just keep colliding with them. In this situation when I use jumping button, character just begins to fly in the room and it seems that Gravity Scale has been set so close to zero.2nd) At default condition, when character is faced forward (Local Rotation = 0), camera is just set behind the character. While player is changing camera position in Indoors and also moving the character, the relation between camera position and character rotation gets messy. Some of players have found some solutions to reset camera/player relation (like entering a vehicle) but they aren't some proper way to keep playing the game.As I'm writing this review, this major bug can still be find in game. So I won't recommend this game unless you have a great will to fight issues and bugs.			",254,53,3,16,22,2,18

												I was really hoping to try out this game beings I love stealth games. Unfortunately it seemed to have many bugs. I'm not sure if there was a way to fix it but it only had a certain amount of resolutions to choose from. The game bugged out numerous times and showed large chunks of the map across my screen (artifacts I believe) by just walking to the side of a hill. Wouldn't go away for some odd reason. One more thing was randomly my guy would only go slightly to the left or right when I just pushed the up key. Honesly this would be a really fun game but I guess it didn't turn out well for me to say the least.			",76,9,5,8,6,0,7

												Crazy difficult WW2 stealth game. Plays like a cross between ""Hitman"" and the old ""Commandos"" games, but it also has some unique twists on the genre that make it stand out. The missions are nicely varied, complex, and are refreshingly light on the hand holding. Often times you are dumped in a field outside of a city with nothing but a map, leaving you to tackle objectives as you wish. Likewise, while it's not quite the ultra realistic stealth game I've always been dreaming of, there are some nice nods to reality here and there (for example, you can't wear uniforms if you've bloodied them and guards will sometimes recognize you regardless of your disguise). Of course it does have the silly ""choke dude for 2 seconds, dude sleeps for hours"" mechanic, but there are also dozens of more realistic ways to take people out as well, so it's optional.The writing is dry, production values are low, and it has some bugs, but it's worth a try if you want stealth that's a bit more demanding.

												This game is basically unplayable.  There's a cool idea behind it -- a 'Hitman' game set in World War II -- but the controls are so wonky and the collision detection so &$*#ed up that you can't play for more than a few minutes without the game breaking.  I was unable to complete the tutorial because I kept running into invisible walls.  In the middle of a wide open room, the game suddenly believed I was walking into a wall and wouldn't allow me to move forward, THEN wouldn't allow me to move backward or to the side or any which-way: those cunning Nazis had somehow managed to teleport a mime-esque glass box around me!  Characters have eyes in the backs of their heads -- literally, since they will often be facing in an entirely different direction from their ""view"" as indicated on the map.  Sometimes when you walk forward, the game decides walks you in a cockeyed diagonal direction, just because, I guess.  This lead to an interesting botch of physics in the first mission where I was pointing my gunsight at a German soldier and yet my character actually had his back to the soldier and was visibly pointing his gun back at me, the player.I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I paid even five dollars for this piece of garbage.  Shame on Steam for selling it to me.			",14,4,0,4,6,0,16

												Commandos meets Hitman. Just like Commandos it's almost a puzzle game, working out which guards to take out in which order. Great game if you have the patience - just remember to enable the map overlay which shows enemy fields of view.There are a couple of must-have mods floating around the internet. One restores cut historical symbols, the other replaces the bad American voice acting with the original Russian, with English subtitles. Atmosphere is improved ten-fold.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw the game, it looked so good but fell so short. There seems to be a glitch that causes your character to face a different way then you're looking which is extremely annoying. On top of that the game is filled with ?invisible? barriers I guess that inpede your movement. So much potential, but it is unplayable for me because it is plagued with glitches, and seeing as the release was 7 years ago I don't see any of them being fixed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I first played this game as a kid, coming back to it many years later was  a weird experience. I admit, I really find the game entertaining and challenging, but the game has bugs and a degree of randomness that can be unforgiving at times. It's also so old and primitive that many obvious options that were the stuff of dreams back then, but is quite ordinary in games now, feels like are missing. Over-all, this game is for people who like games like Hidden & Dangerous and other stealth-based games where you have a big map and an assignment to completel. Pretty straight forward. Unlike titles like Hidden & Dangerous, this title doesn't really feature co-op.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just purchased and started play - seriously, no controller support?? These kind of games benefit well from controller access, and i'm disappointed when game developers don't add this as an option. Positively makes no sense whatsoever in terms of general gaming expectations. Good game, but silly, embarassing final execution due to this simple oversight. Come on, guys...

												A solid stealth game and that's pretty much it. Missions are pretty hard but you are given a nice amount of tools to finish them with, throwing knifes, able to lean around corners, etc. Only real complaints with this game would be the lip syncing in the cutscenes and the lack of hand to hand combat you can do but otherwise its a solid game.

A third person stealth shooter game much like Spec Ops on PSX.The open world and visuals are fantastic, with military stealth missions where you can swap clothing and weapons on the spot, but with the worst controls ever made.You're character will do things on his own like walk diagonally, stutter and slow down randomly. My character started got stuck on top a ladder on the training stage and I started crawling on a 45 degree angle.The graphics feels like ArmA 2, with a mix of Hitman and Spec Ops gameplay.It's okay but seems unstable.4/10 ",774,159,33,63,61,3,97

												As excited as I was for a game that didn't project the Soviets as bad guys, that's as disappointed I was by the fact that this game is a BROKEN MESS!I've only managed to play through most of the tutorial and a little bit of the first mission, because my character got stuck constantly when there is even the smallest item around or if you try to go through a door.I didn't even finish the tutorial because it took me about 5 minutes to get down a single staircase and still got stuck at the end.The camera angle somehow changes during playin so most of the time it's at a 45° angle to the character, while he still moves around so you have to press W and A to go in the direction you want to.. sort of.Because I've seen some positive user reviews of this game, I'm wondering if it's the kind of game that needs some sort of fix to work on newer pc's, because my rig's the kind that runs everything on ultra without any problems and shouldn't have any trouble with this.

												I would like this game if it actually worked. I had to figure out how to play the game because the tutorial was so buggy/glitchy that I couldn't finish it. My character would get stuck on invisible objects, run into invisible walls, stay airborne when jumping and plenty of other crap that made it unbearable to play. I managed to complete the first mission which took me about an hour and a half because I kept on restarting it because of the glitches previously stated. In the brief time that it was working, it was fun and reminded me of the hitman series. Luckily I bought this game on sale. Although I am a little annoyed that I paid for a game that should be for free because there are so many problems or that they should not be selling it in the first place. I am not sure how they thought this was playable and released it. Well, enough of my ranting. If it worked properly I would recommend it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a very challenging stealth game, the game is like the hitman series but only based on the stealth. It is one of those games were it could have been better but just doesn't meet the standard. For one I had an issue about the controls where the buttons would change at random (left becomes forward, right becomes backwards, etc,) now I'm not running it game on low spec computer, I have a good gaming PC (can play The Elder Scrolls : Skyrim and Fallout 3 with ever little lag). Another issue is that I keep running into invisible walls that shouldn't be there, like the door ways of the room where the objectives are. I don't know if you guys have the same problem I do or not, but I think the game has a lot of room for improvement and bugs to fix.			",513,109,4,91,57,3,42

												I not only would not recommend this game, I will actively campaign for others to do the same.The controls are terrible and the collision detection is faulty at best and head-scratchingly stupid at worst.  I played 8 minutes (yes, minutes!) before I uninstalled in disgust.  I was on the training mission and my took, for some reason, just kind of started turning so that my forward key made him run to the left ... and there was no way to fix this!This was a gift.  I immediately told the purchaser to get a refund and then avoid this game like the plague.			",57,45,0,32,11,0,20

												Don't botherThis game's difficulty is permanently cranked to 'extreme', no matter what you pick before the level. The enemies seem to have eyes in the back of their heads, even when I'm running through a blizzard in a white outfit and the enemies shouldn't be able to see or hear anything I still get seen instantly. The game also gives you ZERO chance of escape if you get seen.Couple all of that with the NUMEROUS gameplay issues such as crashes, keyboard commands deciding not to work, the game simply not starting on some systems, and to cap it all the cheats don't even work. Yes, I trid to use cheats in order to play the game with a bit more leniency, yet the game wouldn't even let me use them.It's a complete mess, which is a shame because the idea is interesting, taking place in a real historical context.Overall, this game is not recommended. It's beyond difficult even at it's easiest setting.			",149,41,0,15,10,0,3

												The gameplay is quite fun... when it isn't crippled by game-breaking bugs. Prepare to enjoy a 3rd person camera that gets stuck facing the side, forcing you to walk sideways where-ever you go. In addition, going inside any building may cause you to become stuck in an invisible molasas that prevents you from reaching the door. Thirdly, pathfinding is so atrocious that enemies frequently get stuck on each other, doors, bushes, or nothing at all.If there is a fan-patch that fixes these issues, then by all means, purchase this game. And then tell me about it, because it really is quite Hitman-esque.			",210,36,4,52,43,0,91

												It is Hitman in the 1940's but with double the bugs (most of them gamebreaking at times). Something as simple as walking in a straight line seems to be too much for this game to handle, as a common bug forces you to walk at a 45 degree angle until the mission is reset. Indoors is your biggest threat, you will constantly be getting stuck in place by invisable obsticles and doorways.The original release had some pretty decent damage models, blood, and also had swastika instead of blank red armbands and banners.This release however is the good goy censored version of the game. This was done to be released in Europe because Germany thinks the best way to move forward is to deny the past and feed false information.Wonder who thought of that great idea...░░░░░░▄▄▄░▐▄▀▄▀▄▒░░▒▄▄▄▄░▄░░▌░░░░▄▀░▄░▐▐▄▀▄▀▒░░░▀░░░░▀░▄▀▐░░░█░▌░░▌░▐▐▀▄▀▒░░░▒▌██▐░░▌▄▐░░▐░▐░░░▐░▌▐▐░▐░░░░░░▀▀░░░░░▀▌░░▌░▌░░░░▌▐▄▀░▀▄▒░░░░░░░▄▀▄░░▐░▐▐░▌░░░░▐▐░▌▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▄▄▄░░░▌░▌░░▌▌░░░░▌░▐▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▀▄▄▀ ░▐░░▌▌░░░░▐░░▌▀▄▀▄▀█▄█▀█▀█▀ ░▌▌░▌▌░░░░░▌░▐▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄█▄█▄ ▐░░░▐▐░░░░░▐▐░▌▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▀▀▄▀█ ▌▌░░░▌▌░░░░░█▐░▌▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀░▄▐▄Rated 271,504/6 million			",232,22,3,15,23,1,20

												This was played on Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 x64. While the premise sounds interesting, the game is filled with game breaking bugs. Players will often find the camera's direction desynchronizing with the character's direction. It can get so bad that the camera may be 90 degrees away from the character's direction, resulting in the character running to the left of the screen when you press the up arrow key. The other game breaking bug that I encountered was the character getting stuck for no reason within any interior location. You'll also find AI walking into walls(not following their pathing) and moving away from their designated paths, causing missions to be incompletable. I would not recommend this game to anyone.

												Simply put - awful and TEDIOUS!!!  We all like a challenge but this is beyond ridiculous.  You are basically set up to fail.  There are megapatrols everywhere and the indoor sections are packed with more guys trying to take you down than a Tokyo subway car in rush hour.  You can slog through a hundred attempts at a mission if you are a masochist but I can think of more fun ways to waste your time.			",178,10,17,31,25,1,96

												I have played hundreds of games in my life. Death to Spies is, without question, the absolute worst of these games.I say this with no sense of hyperbole. This game fails to implement even the most basic move and shoot gameplay elements competently.I challenge anyone to finish the tutorial without quitting in a fit of range. It's the basic ""shoot these types of weapons and then throw some grenades"" military game tutorial with a few additional quirks. First, the way your avatar is facing and moving has only a tangential relationship to where the mouse is pointing. Second, once you get into the indoor firing range, there are invisible and intermittent impediments to your movement that have you running in place for seconds at a time. Finally, should you manage to actually pick up and fire a gun (no small feat), you can move your cursor over the target, press the fire button, all while your avatar is visibly firiing a gun at a 90 degree angle from said targets.There are other niggling things that I could go on about: there's the fact that Russian characters in a Russian-made game speak in stilted American accents. There's the poor-man's Hitman inventory system, and the way that the whole map is alerted if one lone soldier spots you. But all of this pales in comparison to the fact that the TUTORIAL IS THE SINGLE MOST ONEROUS GAMING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER SUFFERED THROUGH.Nobody ever playtested this game. Nobody should have ever released this game. I would say it is funny, but I paid fractions of a dollar for this game, I invested almost an entire hour of my life into this, so I will just say do not play this game. If you do, please make a video of your tutorial experience and send it to me.			",511,222,20,113,127,6,185

												Life is too precious to waste on this game.  I started the tutorial, tried to maneuver around the ugly little brown world but my horrible soldier kept getting stuck on blades of grass or remained suspended in the air while doing an epileptic faery dance every time I jumped.  When I went to pick up a pistol but became stuck in the table and unable to free myself even by jumping or changing stances, I knew it was time to pull the plug.  I played more of Ghost Sniper than this.  Just awful.			",1406,583,49,149,154,10,226

												If you like Hitman, Splinter cel, Theif, Metal gear or Velvet Assassin, this is a must have game.Unlike most of the games in this genra, you have to really be observent and check out all the options. There are multiple ways to do assassinations. From a simple head-shot, to more complex ways like poisioning their food. You can take clothes if there is no blood on them.There are no funky body-boxes around like Hitman. You have to be creative, and find spots where the guards do not search. This can be a shadow in  hallway, or way out in the woods, or in a car or a truck.You cant just breeze through the missions, They take a lot of observation and planning to get a decent score. Be prepared to spend 1-3 hours on each level.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The obvious comparison to make with Death to Spies is Blood Money.Blood Money was an open sandbox, filled with various approaches and methods of killing that the developers had meticulously thought of and catered to. The player had the choice of experimenting, replaying, experimenting again, and treat it as a puzzle with many solutions. Blood Money and it's players enjoyed the fact that the developers gave it loving attention to detail.16 hours is not enough to fully explore Death to Spies but the initial impression I had of the game was less of an open sandbox to experiment in but a tough, and sometimes very tough, puzzle to crack with one optimal solution. If there's a noticeable difference at first, it's that unlike Blood Money, the missions are not set up at all for you to win through violence easily. In Blood Money, it's quite easy to kill everyone. In Death to Spies, unless you've got a handy doorway or corridor to abuse bot AI, you'll die in combat quite easily. A realistic number of guards patrol overlapping routes, often in groups of three or more. Towers will sometimes overlook these guards and static guards will sometimes place an additional layer of observation over roaming patrols. The guards will number in the dozens, far more than anything Blood Money will throw at you. Your weapons are also far less robust than the ones found in Hitman- there is no dual silenced pistol for you to mow down enemies while laughing- the best you get for handguns is a silenced revolver, and ammo is always scarce. Careful planning, observation, a bucketload of patience and good aiming skills, however, will get you far.The joy then, is to be found in seeing the minimap show a chunk of black dots instead of green ones, showing a successful penetration and exploitation of the whirling tango of green and red triangles. There's satisfaction to be found in finally finding a section of the map where the guards seem to lose sight of each other for just a bit, when you can violently ruin their day to make a gap in their patrol routes which you can use to sneak in further. The rest of the game after this is finding an officer's uniform to blend in and that's still filled with danger and close calls, as some NPCs won't be fooled by the disguise and will happily alert the dozens of armed guards next to you about your Russian heritage.It's worth noting that like Hitman, Death to Spies has also received attention to detail, only if it's been mostly apparent in the 16 hours I've played so far that the devs made a commendable effort to make the game look good even in 2015. Functional mirrors get an honourable mention here, as some modern triple AAA games still fail to have these. Sadly, there are also a few issues and bugs which do sour the experience, like issues with the camera bugging out temporarily, being stuck, bots being stuck and a few oddities like dropping a stunned person from your shoulders killing the person and unfortunately being the last diplomat you were allowed to kill before a diplomatic scandal happened.The audio is ok, although the dubbed translations are horrendous though tolerable (skippable). Expect nothing from ingame conversations or the like either. Level wise, the game does take you to quite a few different places and setpieces, which keeps things fresh enough to stop the 'get officers uniform- avoid red triangle' formula from becoming stale.For a dollar, this game was more than worth it. Gonna say that Death to Spies has less replayability than Hitman but if you want something Hitman like while waiting for the new one to come out, you should have bought it during the stealth sale it was pretty damn cheap.

												I can't help but compare Death to Spies and Hitman: Blood Money as both have a lot of similar mechanics and  gameplay aspects.So for those who've played Hitman: BM, it's the same except:* With Nazis* More confusing* Harder* Way more restrictive (mission failure conditions more cohercitive)* Larger, more open maps in general with more enemies* Yet less ways to complete a missionFor those who haven't played Blood Money (a game I strongly recommend)This game is about completing a mission, using of stealth and disguise, the latter being extensively important as the sheer number of enemies and some mission conditions (as well as the limited ammunition and firepower) make it impractical if not impossible to complete a mission by gunning your way through.So you have to wait for the correct enemy to get in a spot where you can take him down stealthly and steal their uniform to infiltrate enemy zones.If it's great on paper, it doesn't work very well in-game as weapons accuracy, enemies' detection and permitted actions/zones are sources of frustration.Sometimes, you're dead on target and your shot will miss, alerting the enemy that will probably sound the alarm, run away or alert his friends. Some enemies will just simply detect you (or not) depending on how the game feel. An enemy will be deaf and won't hear you breathing down his neck, or won't see you in his peripheral vision depsite you being in plain light, very visible. The very same enemy can detect you someties if you're out of his range (marked on the map), on a different elevation than him (you're uphill, he's downhill) and laying down in the grass with a camouflage suit.And even when you finally get a disguise, you're not out of trouble and will continiously be frustrated by the way the disguise system works.Once again, if it is good in theory, its application ruins it.Basically, when you are disguised you are authorized to be in certain area or perform certain action (an outer patrol isn't authorized in buildings), you won't fool commanding officers that are directly related to the disguise you're wearing (ex: the chief for outer patrols will spot you in an outer patrol uniform but the chief for inner patrols won't) and you need to carry the standard issue guns related to your uniform (while wearing a german guard uniform, wielding a Tokarev will get you spotted but an MP40 won't)I told you, it seems really interesting on paper.But in-game, while the interface will pop a message when equiping a weapon that doesn't fit the uniform, there's little to none indicator to what zones or actions are restricted to the uniform you just stole as most uniforms you can steal are by definition those of soldiers in secluded area and thus were not interacting or meeting other soldiers. How can you know if you can enter a building with your current uniform? The guard will tell you that you can't enter. If there's no guard, you enter and meet someone inside? They'll shoot you, no question asked. Same goes for most interactions. This makes the whole inflitration more based on trial and error rather than on observation.In brief, Death to Spies could have been so good, but ended up falling short on most of features.A waste of potential: 44/100			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
