												DO NOT BUY! YOU PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PLAY IT!I'm asking for a refund right now. The game crashes random and repeatedly, devs don't reply to forums, the email addresses they've provided don't work (my emails returned).It doesn't matter that it's potentially fun. Nothing matters if you can't play it.Rate this up so people don't buy it.			",2597,1148,60,256,279,22,324

												After first few levels you have seen everything this game has to offer. Nothing really changes, the stages just get longer and more frustrating. The gameplay boils down to trial and error. Even one misstep will make reaching the goal impossible and you have to keep starting over until you memorize the path perfectly. Sometimes a failure isn't even your fault as enemies can break the path too, even if you tried to keep them at bay with the otherwise completely useless bird. (Local co-op, yeah right.)If this were just a calm, slow-paced puzzle game, I could have lived with that. But no, there are ""timed"" puzzles as well and they really irk my nerves. For example, there was this one stage in which you have to keep a snowball rolling so it will eventually reach a button which opens the gate to the exit. You have to keep opening gates and eliminating enemies from its path, but over half of the time you can't even see, where the snowball is going, no matter how you try to turn the camera. So besides learning the right path, you have to have almost pixel-perfect timing too.Utterly boring game with unlikable characters and a story that nobody cares for. I paid about 1€ for this and still I think I got ripped off. Not recommended for anyone.			",171,71,0,12,8,2,12

												I'm not sure whether to call this a puzzle game or not. All you have to do is to get to the goal, hitting switches, dodging environmental hazards and the occasional ""enemy"". Once you found the correct path to take, you can finish a level without much trouble. Collecting coins is optional but to unlock more levels you'll need a certain amount.Dont bother with the DLC since all it does is add 3 additional levels which arent too interesting nor challenging and you'll be done with those in no time.I guess this is a good choice when you feel the need to take a break from other games that♥♥♥♥♥♥you off.On a side note: Whenever I start this game and the splash screen ""Plays best on Alienware"" shows up I just cant help myself and I have to laugh.

												This game's installation is bugged. At some point in time Nvidia changed the location where the PhysX dlls get put. This game's installation seems to only be checking the old location, not the new one. It ""fixes"" this problem by going and installing an OLDER version of PhysX. Which still won't work, because it's still probably in the wrong spot? There's a thread in the game's forum where some sharp users discuss a few fixes for the problem.I don't really like either fix, because I'll have to remember to re-copy the DLLs from the new location into the game's own directory. If I get this problem with enough games (haven't yet) I may do what the video a user there shared and drop 'em into the System folder. That's never a great place to♥♥♥♥♥♥around, but it would get the files onto a path that any program anywhere will manage to find.This is stuff we shouldn't need to do to make a game work. Even a game selling for $1. For a $10 game, that's almost beyond forgiving.			",270,314,3,97,46,2,78

This is a rather long review, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend this title just skip to the Results section and read from there.Fatshark created a fantastic little puzzle game which puts you to the test. Hamilton’s Great Adventure pushes out levels that pose mysteries and threats around every turn. Story:Hamilton’s Great Adventure starts you off telling the stories of your great exploits to your granddaughter. You relive Hamilton’s glory days as you try to get the parts for a machine required for a purpose you will learn if you beat the campaign. You and your bird, Sasha, must complete puzzles from Brazil, Egypt, India, and the Secret Islands. As the game progress Hamilton gets further into his tale and new characters are introduced. The game includes hilarious dialogue, with an interesting story that keeps you guessing, and levels that keep posing new challenges. As you progress through the game you obtain answers to the mystery and you learn all about how the story began. Gameplay:Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle solving game which knowing the answer is the key. Unlike some puzzle solving games where you can see the solution but be unable to complete the challenge because of a simple annoyance in clicking a button at exactly the right time. This game puts your mind to the test to solve puzzles by completing challenges by using the correct answer. It’s fun and rather simple, yet some puzzles are a little more difficult than others. The games graphics are not the best, but they are crisp and the story is pleasant. Sasha can be difficult to control and managing two characters is rather difficult if you are not on your toes. Menus:One of my major gripes is that the in game menu is annoying to navigate. They tried to make the menu look like a book, but this is not very useful as you don't actually know what information is on what page. Ultimately you may have to flip through the whole book if you are looking for a simple answer. Hints:The pink vials are used to power up Hamilton’s special abilities. You can play as Sasha at the start of the level before activating the timer, so if you want to you can gather lots of the pink vials before even technically starting a level. You can also scare off the flying blowfish that attack Sasha by using a taunt when they are about to hit Sasha (it causes them to blow up and float away).Result:Hamilton's Great Adventure doesn't pull you in keeping you on your toes from level to level; yet, the game offers fun puzzles which you can solve during your spare time. I would like it if they had checkpoints. I don't play too many puzzle game so maybe they all don't have any checkpoints during levels. If you like to solve puzzles and you're tired of traditional puzzle solving games that challenge a user based on luck or precise click timing then this is for you. Pros:+Simple gameplay without too many commands to learn+Smooth movements+Fun and rather complex puzzles+Fantastic difficulty curve, the puzzles get gradually more difficult rather than exponentially+Nice art style which makes the games simple graphics seem rather elegantCons:-Very difficult menu navigation-Not a very riveting story (though it’s a puzzle game so you're here for the puzzles not for the tale)-Can be infuriating when you have solved the first part of the puzzle, but have to keep resolving to get to the second part of the puzzle			",331,44,5,40,30,0,70

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a game that I can't recommend.  It's not that it's a broken game (though there's reports of computer problems, so buyer be ware).  It's not that it's insanely hard or insanely easy.  It's just not a very good game.   If you have nothing else to play, maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of this, but the problem is I wouldn't spend money on it. The real problem of the game is the puzzles aren't well laid out, you can choose to either fly your bird over the level and understand the layout, or you can choose to run the level a few times and make mistakes.  Both ways take about the same time, and there's not much here that will be difficult, except for a few annoying puzzles. The other issue is this game is overly graphical.  If the game had a great iconic look to it, that would be one thing, but the graphics in this game make it harder to solve the puzzles as the player sometimes isn't clear what a panel or a location really looks like.  Going to 3d isn't as big a problem as the art choices. When you can't tell where the switch is or what is a switch, that's not good. But really the biggest problem on this game is it's just not that much fun.  The feedback loop of trying a level and failing because of X isn't fun. The challenge of ""mastering"" each level is pretty low.  It's more of a game that will be beaten by repetition rather than skill.  Even for a puzzle master, they'll have to waste their time trying to see the level, rather than figuring out the level that's pretty weak. Personally I would recommend playing something else.  Hamilton's great Adventure isn't a good name.  It's not really an adventure, and it's certainly not great.  Honestly I'm starting to question if his name is really Hamilton.I usually end a negative review by recommending other games to play instead of this.  For this game, well there's not many games like this (because there's bad design choices) but Talos Principle will give you far more enjoyment.  Portal 2 is amazing, any of the Cyan Worlds games (Myst, riven) will give you a real adventure, The Witness is fantastic.  And the thing is all those games cost more than this game, but they are worth the extra money.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a great balanced adv/puzzler. You run around with Hamilton, and the bird Sasha helps out with collecting special abilities, reaching levers and acts as a decoy. The quests gets trickier and trickier.

												A superb puzzle platformer game where you collect treasure, map out your steps properly to not become trapped, and evade monsters and other obstacles.  Collect the keys to open up the door to the next levels.  It all sounds familiar and it is, but this is really well done and well paced.  The difficulty level ramps up slowly and introduces new obstacles and new tricks.  Highly recommended.  This is a great balance between platforming and puzzle.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												★★☆☆☆ - ""Average at best, Id give it a miss"" PROS:- Light-hearted and casual.- Flying as the bird is tremendous fun.- I admire the games colourful design.- Stone stepping can be fun, although trial & error.CONS:- Its all just a little childish.- Puzzles are too simplistic, providing no thrill or challenge.- Very little on offer to warrant a playthrough as the game does nothing particulary well.- No checkpointing.- The story, like the rest of the game, is dull.VERDICT? Its a very boring game, although it looks promising its barely even a puzzle game as its basically timings and levers.			",78,19,2,4,3,0,1

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a good, solid puzzle game that's a refreshing midpoint between mindless casual tile-matchers like Bejeweled and antagonistic platform games like Super Meat Boy. Hamilton can hook you, but the routine of dealing with slow restarts and fine-tuning the camera to your liking puts a hamper on your quest for fortune. Then again, what's a great adventure without a few setbacks?It's a pity that Hamilton's Great Adventure never got its 15 minutes of Internet fame, because it has tons of charm and it's very fun to play.Fat Shark's adventure platformer has fascinating level design and admirable cooperation of two main characters.Even though Hamilton's Great Adventure suffers from a story full of cliches and some shortcomings in gameplay, it's also very entertaining. Levels are well designed, and you need to plan ahead, unless you're after winding up stuck on a lonely, wooden platform in the middle of nowhere. This great adventure is entertaining for adults and children alike.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Considering the $1 I paid for it, Hamilton's Great Adventure isn't a bad little puzzle game.  It's charming, it has nice graphics and the puzzles are pretty straight forward.  The gameplay consists of traversing a map from point A to point B, while dealing with things such as switches, converyors, gates, etc. that limit your movement.  Your tools to deal with this are limited to add to the challenge.  That's really all there is to it! So like I said, it's simple but it's not bad for a cheap little time waster.  Especially if you got a 90% off coupon from badge crafting.  The controls can be infuriating at times; Hamilton doesn't turn as responsibly as you'd like him to sometimes which leads to restarts of levels for stupid reasons.  Given time though, you can adjust to these mechanics issues and still make for a nice way to kill 10 minutes at a time. They're attempting some kind of story to go along with Hamilton's little adventure here, but considering he and his grandaughter speak in grunts and coo's, I uh...could care less about that.

												Hamilton's Great Adventure game isn't a super-amazing game that will blow your mind, but it's still a very good game with excellent level design, charming aesthetics, and good music.The levels are expertly-crafted, and never come-off as stupidly easy, nor nonsensically obtuse. The ""aha!"" moments for puzzles that seemed impossible to decipher minutes prior remained a consistent experience throughout my entire play-through, and it was enjoyable from start to finish. Albeit, the game is a bit easy for a little while, but it definitely ramps-up after a while - *especially* if you try to get Gold in each level.So, if you're into the puzzle genre or just feel like jumping into a genre you normally don't like that much (as I did), you can't go wrong with Hamilton.

												HAMILTON'S SQUANDERED POTENTIALI so very much wanted to love this game!  It could have been perfect!When I watched the video trailer I thought, ""Ooooh, cool!  Looks like Zapper or the 3d Frogger games except with an adventurer dude.  Looks fast paced and fun!  I want it!  Now!  Waiting for sale.  Nope.  Sale yet?  Yay! Finally!  Buy buy buy!""First off, Windows 7 here - had to restart computer to get it to run first time, no big deal -just a heads up.Now, we start the game with a big old story sequence.  Fine.  It's skippable but I'm watching it anyway just in case it's interesting.  Ho hum.Now, we begin the first level...Ok how do I collect all these purple things?  Oh, the bird...it collects...use mouse click to..♥♥♥♥♥♥  Really?!  I gotta stop running -grab the mouse and point and click on these things to collect them.This gets tedious real quick -especially if you lose on a level and have to restart.Stop running, reposition camera, point click on purple things, wait for bird to get what you're clicking on.  Resume movement.  Oh, need to hit that switch to get through, stop, point, click, bird, move, continue.You get the idea.  At least you can ignore the purple things and distant treasure chests, but as this is somewhat a collect-a-thon styled game, that can be a difficult compulsion to ignore. But you still have to use the bird to flip switches, which is neither challenging or convoluted -it just hinders the pace.None the less, I still recommend this game -it is decent fun despite these complaints -I  can tell a lot of hard work and polish went into it.But, this game could have been great!  Fantastic!  Super fun!			",359,90,8,26,17,3,37

												Hamilton's Great Adventure might be an okay casual game to waste some time with, but I don't recommend it.The game isn't very challenging.  Trying to figure out the proper paths to finish the levels was somewhat enjoyable, but in the end it came down to trial and error and memorizing the correct steps.  All of the switches that need to be manipulated have markers with symbols/colors that correspond to their counterpart objects, which made their operation trivial.  There are items to be acquired and used, but I had only received one towards the end of when I quit playing and I didn't get chance to use it, so I can't comment on that mechanic.The first ""problem"" I encountered with the game is the fact that the keyboard and gamepad can't be used at the same time.  This isn't really a problem, but when the game loads, there's no way to skip the intro screens with the gamepad.  If any key is pressed on the keyboard, the game disables the gamepad and then it has to be reenabled in the menu.Another annoyance was the game crashing to desktop when killed by an enemy.  I could not reproduce the error by reloading the game and dying to that same enemy, but as soon as I would die to an enemy on a new level the error would reoccur.  And, of course, every time I would reload the game after a crash I would either have to sit through the intros or reenable the gamepad through the menu, adding to my frustration.  Fortunately dying to enemies wasn't a common occurrance.Even if the bugs were fixed, the game just feels too easy and I can't help but feel like I'm wasting time when I could be playing something else.  I don't recommend purchasing this game, not even if it were on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a simple puzzle game. As in, a very simple puzzle game. I wish I could say more about it, but that's the only word I can think of to describe it; simple. The graphics are simple, the sound and music is simple, the controls are simple, the gameplay is simple, and the story is very simple. This would be a good game for a young child, so if you have one (or several), they will likely enjoy it. Adults may quickly find it boring. There is little challenge, and no goal other than to solve the puzzles and obtain all the collectibles. The charm wears off rather quickly. However, this is not why I'm not recommending this game. The reason I'm giving this game a thumbs down is because it doesn't run consistently. The forums are loaded with posts about how the game crashes on startup or at the end of a level, or in the middle of a level. I came back to this game after two years, only to find it was crashing to desktop. I tried multiple fixes, none of them worked. What's worse is that Fatshark, the dev for this game, has apparently lost interest in making sure that Hamilton's Great Adventure can continue to offer its simple pleasures to the gaming community. Until these issues are fixed, the only recommendation I have is that you save your money. Even if you get one of those 90% off coupons for this game, just let it expire, or if you must, buy the game, and if it doesn't work immediately get a refund.			",86,7,1,7,8,0,21

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a big fat ""no"" for 2 main reasons#1: Hamilton's will not install one of its components correctly. Refer to the game's forum and notice how almost every thread is about how the game won't start. Its possible to correct the problem, but the developer hasn't bothered to update, fix, or write a solution, and there's a lot of confusion and misleading answers on the forum on how to get the game to run.#2: some idiot designed the game to be played with a 3 button mouse. Pictured in the game's instructions is a 2 button + scroll wheel mouse. A vital action is tied to the scroll wheel, and I can not for the life of me get the god damned thing to work. There's no way to change key bindings in the game, so I'm stuck. Thankfully I can get around this using a 360 controller, but still there's no excuse for something that stupid.If neither of these two problems turn up for you, you're left with a very simple and boring game that (from what I hear) steadily becomes outrageously frustrating. However, its framed by a charming and compelling story. This is the 2nd Fat Shark game I've purchased. While those dudes posess a great deal of genuine creativity and originality, they can not code nor game design worth a damn and their game support is practically non-existant. Its a real shame.

Hamilton's Great Adventure is bland and uninspired. Once you've played through the first few levels you've seen it all. The following worlds don't change much other than the theme of the environment and its obstacles, which are all basically re-skinned models.Hamilton's avian companion has incredibly poor path-finding when played with mouse and keyboard and the camera's view can become obstructed by scenery. The challenge of later levels doesn't come from their difficulty but from the extended length of the each level and an increase in the number of obstacles. I really pushed myself to complete the first world with all gold medals before calling it quits.			",824,302,26,81,66,10,105

												Hamilton's Great Adventure is a very good puzzle/adventure game, in which you have to find the right path in order to reach the exit of each level. It might look simple at first, but as the game progresses, the complexity increases, with new enemies, traps, and more complex layouts. Getting all the coins, while being an optional challenge, is well worth it to put your skills to the test.As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, the gameplay consists on finding the path to the exit. Of course, you must first get the key (or keys) needed to open the exit door (and other doors which might be in your way). You play as Hamilton (the explorer) and Sasha (the bird). While Hamilton must grab the keys and reach the exit, Sasha can help you by distracting enemies, or using certain switches in order to open some doors or activate elevators. As you progress through each chapter, you'll also get special items that Hamilton can use. The level design is very good; while the earlier levels are easy enough for you to learn the game, the latter levels can become very challenging, especially if you're trying to get gold on them; not to mention the bonus levels available in each chapter.When it comes to story, I must say I found it interesting. It's nothing out of this world, but rather what you'd expect from a movie or book similar to Indiana Jones: an explorer, in this case Hamilton, goes after a valuable archaeological object across the world, and there's other people who are also looking for it. I liked the Lovecraftian references in the story, I found it to be funny given the game's ""innocent"" look. Don't expect existential horror, however, they're mostly funny references for those familiar with Lovecraft's work.As for the soundtrack, well, there's not much to say. Other than the opening theme, which gives that adventure vibe to the game, most of the soundtrack consists of background music which isn't very catchy. Not that it's something bad, as I think that the ""minimal"" soundtrack helps you stay focused on solving the puzzles.Well, I think that's enough for this game. To conclude, I'd say I recommend it, and it's a good puzzle game for people across all ages.			",419,84,9,48,30,5,75

												Well, what can I say about this game... It is great! But there are buts... The game remains mostly the same throughout every level you play. It just gets more frustrating and longer as you progress. The ""punishment"" for missing a single step is also a bit too awful: restart. Imagine a 10-min level and just when you're going to the finish, you fall down thanks to the flowing water or something. Well, restart! That is one of the big bad-bad thingies. Combine it with the levels just getting more frustrating and you have a good game that is bad. You'll be entertained for sure for just a bit, but after that... Nah. At least it looks neat! But graphics aren't everything.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												This game would have been great if the people developing it would have keep rule number one of video game development in mind ""Games are made to have fun"". Sadly they forgot to apply it  The graphics are nice but they look pixelated (not sure if it looks better on Alienware technology but they do state that it works best with that in the intro screen... every time you open the game) and you have some visual elements that seems like they could be interacted with, like flowers for example, but are just there for looks. Sometimes the graphical elements of the game prevents you from seeing the path and force you to rotate the camera but the camera rotation is limited and only let you see sideways partially.The controls are a complete disaster. They could have made you switch controls from your character to the bird giving you full access to Sasha (the bird) thus allowing you to see the whole map from above or to simply toy around like a bird... but instead you just click where you want the bird to go mostly to collect pink fruits that act as bonus for your final score on each level and activate levers and stuff. Hamilton has simple 4 directional controls that allow you to slowly move one tile at the time... thus limiting you in your exploration and adding frustration to the whole experience because you can't fix a mistake in this game.  You moved on that breaking platform by accident because you didn't release the left directional button in time... deal with it, restart the whole level!The music is nice but bland and repetitive. There is no voice acting and the story is told by sliding images that are about as entertaining as reading a very simplistic children's book (Note: Some children's book are fun to read as opposed to their storytelling)It seems like the game was rushed and that the developers wanted to deliver more than what they could and that is why this game gets the ""could have been""stamp of disapproval.3/10(NB: The whole game could easily be fixed and transformed into something that deserve a 7 or even 8 on 10 and I wish Fatshark would revisit this game since it could become a nice videogame franchise.)

												Such a great puzzle game. It has polished written all over it, except for one tiny thing; the bird controls. You use the mouse to guide your bird towards treasures and fruit, as well as triggers. But since you view the game from a fixed perspective (not entirely true as you can rotate and zoom) it's hard to judge if the bird is going to the right place, resulting in clicking the same place more than once, which is a shame, because that really shouldn't be necessary. Other than that, the puzzles are mostly fun to do (prepare to get frustrated), the graphics are cute and the sounds get the job done. Hamilton's Great Adventure is great value for your money.[Rating: 80/100]			",1660,635,69,221,194,16,225

												This is a decent action/puzzle game. You star as Indiana Jones knockoff Hamilton and his bird sidekick Sasha on a quest to find an ancient treasure. The game is broken down into 4 major areas, each consisting of a dozen levels or so. The goal of each level is to find a key, collect treasure, and make it to the exit alive (while avoiding the traps and baddies in your way). You not only have to figure out the proper way to solve each level, but some also require a fair bit of dexterity and timing. The story is told through cute animated cutscenes every few levels or so. Most levels are pretty short and can be completed with a little effort, but there are also a few ""boss"" and optional bonus levels which are much longer and harder. I finished the main game in a few hours, but eventually got frustrated with the bonus levels, as some of them are too long and one simple mistake means starting from the beginning. Due to that one major frustration, my final verdict is: good, but not great.			",828,378,20,113,78,6,151

												This is a fun puzzle game with a good amount of stages and a cheap DLC that adds even more.

The music is also repetitive but it is not that bad.What I like about this game are the levels design and the pretty good graphics.The game is pretty easy to get into, you have tons of tutorials to help you and you can always access them in game in case you forget about something.Overall, since this game always goes on sale, if you're looking for an OK puzzle game you should look into buying it.

												For whatever reason, this game produces no sounds on my computer, and I have no idea why. The SFX and music sliders are set to maximum, and it just... doesn't play any music, any sound whatsoever. A minor problem that likely would've been truly troublesome had I spent any time actually playing the game and not farming it for badges.The game itself is a fairly simple puzzle game, with manipulation of blocks, gates, and pressure plates in one area of the puzzle to unlock / activate something elsewhere. You have a bird that can travel along the Z axis, which opens up new areas of '3D' puzzling, but I didn't spend enough time with the game to see if it ever became anything truly remarkable.

												This game is an absolute nightmare to play. (Providing you get it to work).I consider myself a very technically able person, however this took me 2 hours to get it working, after messing around with various settings and uninstalling the outdated junk that came with this. (I never managed to get the sound working, which was OK for me, I viewed a few video's and the sound was far too repetative).I love puzzles games and I've played a wide variety of them.However this game is just boring, repetative and the timing sections for this game are a nightmare.There's no quick save or check point system, so if you've got to go somewhere or you're busy, that's tough, and some levels do tend to go on for quite a bit.There are 4 stages in the game with about 13 Main story levels and 6-7 bonus levels. So there's about 64 levels. If you manage to find enjoyment in this game, then you'll be sure to spend a long time on the game, which admittidly is good for those that do enjoy the game. However the DLC which is for 3 levels is a joke. Not to mention the game crashed a total of 22 times for me on the DLC levels, the rest of the game never crashed, so not sure what was going on there, Whilst each stage is just a reskinned version of the previous stage, I'm fine with that and I find it understandable.The story is pretty 'meh' but at least they tried.If you love puzzles and have a high tolerance (I thought I did) then this game may be for you, but I'd recommend staying far away from this game.

												Don't waste your time with this turd. What could have been a mediocre game was ruined by terrible game design and controls. First off, the controls. The game does not have free movement, there are tiles and you can only move up/down/left/right on the tiles. This makes control very annoying. Half the time you will run down and hold run and then stop on a tile only to have the game make you keep running because there is an invisible sensory on the tiles that says if you are past a certain point you move down. Also if you are running down and press over if you are not exactly in the center of the tile you will not be able to move over, another stupid problem when there is water pushing you. Free running would have easily fixed these. Then there is the gameplay. Instead of using logic, reflexes, quick thinking, and innovation, you are forced to figure out the exact single path they want you to take, enforced by tiles that break after one use, making you get stuck if you didn't pick the single right path. This leads to trial and error which is the worst kind of puzzle game. Finally there is the level design. For some reason the dip-sh!t developers haven't learned anything from the 1990's where if you died you had to restart the entire level over again. One level had a super annoying part at the end of the level that you have to memorize a certain path of spikes and get through it twice, while sliding down a river which means you have to time getting into the traps. I spent 30 minutes on the level, only because of this part, but 9/10 of the time was redoing the entire level following their exact path, to get to the end and die because of poor level design or control design. If they were to have a checkpoint so I didn't have to keep rebeating the 2 min part that I've beaten 2k times already I would have been actually able to try and beat the part. Very stupid they didn't think of that part. If you are going to put hard parts in, thats fine, but don't make me rebeat the entire level every time to get to the end for this part, just to artificially inflate game length, ala SMB. I finally realized ""life's too short"" to waste replaying the same level to get to a part that they could have easily fixed using their brains, especially for a game that was just ""meh"" to begin with. 4/10.

												I was surprised when I first saw the title of this game, ""Hamilton's Great Adventure"". Why not ""My Great Adventure""? I could instantly tell that this game would be nothing but a rollercoaster ride of emotions for both myself and this ""Hamilton"" person.The game opens up with Hamilton giving a monologue in the back of a truck that's heading towards the middle of a Middle-Eastern fire fight. After the truck grinds to a halt, he gets out and spends twenty minutes explaining the control system, like I'm some sort of three year old who's never held a PlayStation controller before.Anyway, when Hamilton discovers that The Patriots have stolen the Chintamani Stone he rushes straight towards an Uncharted™ temple. After a mind-boggling fight with his own shadow that spoke with a heavy Russian accent (Because all Russians are evil), Hamilton finally saves the day from Captain Hook and his cronies and goes back home to have a nice cup of tea?Should you buy the game? Don't ask me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is really fun. It's not the best game, but the levels keep you going and you get addicted. The levels are short and easy to play quickly, and there's a lot of them. However, if you really want to get a gold ranking like I do on every level, it will take you longer because it's hard to collect some of the treasure. The story's not great, and it's kind of hard to follow. The journal feature is pretty cool, and I like how you need the bird to complete some of the puzzles. A few things are broken. Whenever you try to apply a change in the settings, it stops responding and the change doesn't work.Overall, I'd give this game a 8/10			",117,8,1,6,13,0,7

												Looking for something casual to play while waiting for your turkey to roast? Or maybe you want to put your 4 year old in front of something appropriate. Hamilton's Great Adventure is it! It's a pretty solid puzzle game. Your goal is to collect all the keys and items and exit the area. The puzzles are very good. The graphics are attractive and scream casual gameplay. The story is fine for what it is. It's not incredibly deep, nor is it life-changing. This feels like a well-made mobile game converted to a the PC. I'd love it if this game was on my tablet. I definitely recommend it if you're looking to lay back and take a break from heavier games.			",820,290,19,116,69,6,135

												An interesting and casually paced puzzle game with an Indiana Jones vibe. Also, you can control a bird, and this came out YEARS before GTA V.Want to know more? Check out my Bundle Buys video for gameplay footage and initial impressions!

												A charming little puzzle game that I got for $1.  Definitely worth said dollar.  Lots of fun, great environments(classic treasure hunter locales), and puzzles that make you think.  The camera gets a bit annoying at times, as does trying to control your bird(the two don't help each other either).  It does get super hard later on, to the point of frustration...and that's when you start realize the controls are a bit clunky.  However, it really provides that feeling of accomplishment after you finally nail that timing(despite the stiffness of the controls).  All in all, it's not quite worth $10, but absolutely worth getting on sale for under $5.			",132,64,1,40,32,2,19

												A very good platforming puzzler that will keep you entertained for the whole time. Great visuals and soundtrack make it very relaxing to play. 8/10 the bird mechanics are a bit iffy if you dont constantly teleport it places. Definetly wait for a sale though.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

			Join Hamilton on his greatest adventures and travels taking him to trap/puzzle filled jungles to navigate in search of gold and multiple MacGuffins.		

Join Hamilton on his greatest adventures and travels taking him to trap/puzzle filled jungles to navigate in search of gold and multiple MacGuffins.Accompanying him on this quest is his faithful bird friend who's primary job is to collect mystic dust around the level and occasionally open treasure chests.While the levels do start a little slow they begin to ramp up into rather complex monsters.  This is where the games mechanics start to grind, as the longer the levels get the most tedious it becomes to start over after a slip up.  The resulting play experience becomes playing the first parts of levels multiple times collecting the same coins and dust over and over.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												Amazing and adventurous!I have discovered that computer games, no matter how much you like them, can sometimes be rather stressful. What I mean is in hardcore games, like Dragon Age you are to be in tension every single second and from time to time I feel like playing some relaxing game, without waiting for one more enemy to appear any moment. That’s why I bought several indie games on Steam winter sale, one of them being Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams, which I like greatly. My present day favorite is a small labyrinth game called “Hamilton’s Great Adventure”. Among tons of indie projects it is really hard to find one that is thrilling and addictive indeed. Nevertheless Hamilton’s game is very nice allowing both to get relaxed and amused at the same time. As I have already mentioned it is a labyrinth game in which you must walk through about 60 levels, collecting keys and coins. But it is not so simple as it may sound. Very often the game turns out a pure strategy puzzle and you have to think over what to do, where to go, which method to choose. The puzzles are sometimes rather tough, but the balance is extremely good – you do not have time to get bored, too annoyed or angry at the process, they make you wish to find the solution and beat all the traps and enemies.read more http://www.viewforum.net/gaming-dept-171/hamilton’s-great-adventure-2960/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is terrible. I regret purchasing this game at the sale price of 1 dollar. The puzzles were childishly simple, and the game encourages you to collect treasures with the bird, which is a slow and painstaking process, especially since it has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. The controls on the bird were annoyingly slow and frustrating for something that essentially comes down to mousing around the screen. All I got out of this game was dissapointing wasted time, and carpal tunnel.			",166,42,1,20,12,4,10

												A wonderful puzzle game worth every hour spent. It has unique and challenging levels where solving them is a reward in itself, making you feel like a boss when EXCELSIOR (collecting everything in a level) finally pops out!Its fun to play and redo because it is very easy to understand and the controls are very tight and fluid. This is a game that deserves its spot in the puzzle genre.			",568,261,10,108,49,3,151

												An interesting little puzzler. Pretty brutal if you make one mistake as you have to replay the entire level again. Really would benefit from a rewind mechanism ala Toki Tori.Certainly provides some interesting challenges, more about how you navigate a level (thanks to collapsing tiles). Try the demo first, if you're not sure.			",142,50,9,20,18,0,23
