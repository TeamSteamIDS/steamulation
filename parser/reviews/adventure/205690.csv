""Energy lights it up""In 1000 Amps you are a little roboter. ""Robo"" is searching for power cubes in rooms to gain more energy for his special abilities. In the beginning everthing is hard. You cannot jump high or teleport. But if you never surrender the labrinth of rooms you will find some very useful powerups that give you the possibiliy to complete the map 100%.One central question: Is it joyful, to play an indie platformer game in just black and white color?  Yes it is! The graphic elements are simple and good working. It looks great when elements glow up and backgrounds have organic forms. And the sound effects makes it even more atmospheric. On the other side you ""loose"" some rooms again and again if you drop out of the border or accidently jump too high. It can be annoying during the attemps. But in the end there is a challenging boss which you hopefully can beat.			",1650,667,58,135,165,17,216

												Imagine your world suddenly plunging into darkness; all the illumination stolen in a flash. This was the case for the tiny hero Plug, who found himself lost among the branches the Amp Tree and began the journey to restore the stolen light of his world. By gaining a sense of direction from the hologram consciousness of the Amp-Tree-System, a fusion of natural flora with a computerized light power grid, Plug must repower the Amp Tree and defeat the Intruder virus before the world stays dark forever.1000 Amps is an exciting and intuitive platformer. It challenges the player to use Plug's many special abilities, as well as discovering and adapting to new ones, to solve a number of different puzzles across a vast array of connected rooms. Each room is a piece of an incredibly powerful and awesome system with powered-down blocks hidden in every nook and corner. Every room permanently restored brings the player one step closer to stopping the Intruder Virus and saving the Amp Tree. It's a story of an impossibly small, filament-brained hero set in a world of platforms, gaps, and traps. 1000 Amps is sure to light up your day.			",174,166,1,11,22,0,15

												It's a nice, little, clever game.Not too long, as it took me 9 hours to beat, though I spent some of it trying to get a 100% complete map.My only complaint would be about the map. I wish it was more detailed, so to make it easier to understand where a missing room is located.The art style is really charming and the background music fits really well with the light-based puzzle-solving gameplay.

												If you're a member of the camp of gamers who believe that the answers to puzzles should never be signposted, and that modern games are way too easy, then you're going to like 1000 Amps.You play as a cute lil' icon called Plug who is attempting to repair a set of electrical stations called the Amp- Tree-System. In each room, you can light up a number of squares by touching them, and when you've lit them all, that part of the system is repaired. As you light these squares, you're given more power – enabling you to jump and teleport. Most of the puzzles rely on using that gradual increase in power to enable you to access more and more lightsquares in each room.The art style is minimalist. So minimalist, in fact, that you can't see any of the room you're in until you touch the squares in question. As such, exploration becomes an exercise in feeling around in the dark, unsure if you're about to plunge down a hole into another room entirely, losing all your progress in the current room. That's around the point when 1000 Amps starts getting a little frustrating.It continues to frustrate when you come up against seeminglyimpossible rooms that have conveyor belts that cart you around against your will, rogue baddies who switch off lights that you've switched on, and jumping puzzles that demand pixel-perfect precision.It's a defiantly retro path to take, and one that isn't going to please everyone – especially when failure often means trekking back through several past rooms just to have another go. The map gives you some idea of where you're supposed to be going, but it's utterly uninteractive and therefore mostly useless.The worst moments are when you know exactly what you need to do to solve a room, but can't quite get the timing of the jumps or teleports right, and you find yourself repeating the same move over and over again, hoping that you fluke your way into doing it right. When you do finally manage that, you won't think “Amazing! I am so talented!” – you'll think “Thank God that's over.” Then you realise that you have to start essentially from scratch in the next room.The core idea of powering up your character progressively is a solid one, and there are moments of real beauty in the stark-but-cute art style, but ultimately 1000 Amps fails by simply not giving the player enough information, forcing a trial-and-error, guesswork-oriented approach to problem solving. That's fine when a game gives you another go instantly, but that's often not an option here.There is an audience who'll love 1000 Amps, and the 4,99€ price is excellent value for a puzzle game of this length. But if you prefer your games to be a little more friendly and approachable, then you're going to want to look elsewhere.			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												Hmm. I'm kind of torn here, because even after cursing heavily at them, I would like to think this game's cruder problems aren't that bad.1000A is a grayscale 'metroidvania'. Everyone knows what those are. The world in this case is an ""amp tree"", some abstract stand-in for computer I suppose, and the player is a sort of a repair device. The graphics are a rather exciting case: everything is displayed as simple symbols! This reminds me of old Paradroid!The controls are a little strange. You use the wsad key grid as a typical platformer setup and, surprisingly, the mouse for teleportation: click an empty part of the screen, and there you go! I haven't played an exploration game with combined controls like that before.So, what's wrong with the game? Well, one of its unique points is that for most of the game, you are wading through levels with a very limited line of sight. Only by touching objects will you discover them. This makes for either an interesting, careful sort of gaming or a horrible chore. I thought it was mostly good, but other times when accidentally walking off the screen would reset the view, it felt like a cause for frustration and a glaring problem.Another problem is that you can occasionally get yourself into a cul-de-sac, requiring quitting and reloading. I think the game autosaves every few cleared screens. You can tell 1000A's been designed to minimize the chance of getting stuck, but I messed up about five times during my run.The last issue is the map layout. Sometimes the route from a to b is a ridiculously long detour: Especially for a completionist run, some of the parts of the game map read like a designed♥♥♥♥♥♥move: you essentially have to traverse the entire vertical span of the map once or twice too many times if you're planning to get that 100% completion.Still, 1000A was a very good little exploration puzzler. It took me about 8 hours to beat, but I did check out every screen on the map. It's definitely worth its price if you value the genre and are willing to play by this game's rules.

												This was a surprisingly good game. There is a mild learning curve until you learn the way the game's puzzles work, then once you get a few upgrades the levels get richer and very addictive. In particular the way adjacent rooms interact with one another was very clever, especially once the upgrades start to work together to solve rooms. The difficulty was spot on for my modest platformer skills, slightly above casual only. For achievement hunters, an easy 100% that takes a 5-7 hours maybe. ",1510,575,48,138,138,18,227

												1000 Amps is a greyscale indie puzzle platformer in which you play as Plug, a little dude who lights up whatever he touches. Your goal is to restore power to the Amp-Tree-System, a now-darkened labyrinth of over 150 compartments, and defeat the intruder who caused the outage.Every room contains light nodes and activating them all will illuminate that room permanently. A battery meter, which fills based on the percentage of nodes activated, is also present for each room and determines how high you can jump there. As with a Metroidvania, you will have to work your way to the special power-up and story rooms to progress. Power-ups include click-to-warp, increased touch radius, light node radar, double jump, and the ability to destroy creatures that eat light.The game lacks a proper soundtrack, is Flash-based with slowdowns at high resolutions and, due to the open-world design, can be frustrating if you haven't found the right power-ups yet. Despite these flaws, it's still enjoyable.			",2958,1175,116,358,419,33,494

												1000 Amps is a nice platform puzzle game where you have to light all the area in the room to see all the environment. As you progress you will find some power ups or upgrades that will allow you to clear the levels easier.The gameplay is simple and easy with a nice and effective use of the mouse. The graphics is ok, all the game is black and white and there is nothing else to write about it.The sound is nice but it turns to be a little boring after a while. I turned it off and listen some music or some podcasts while I was playing the game (and it worked great).The levels are cool but sometimes is frustrating to jump just a little high or do one more step forward and lose all the progress made on the level because you enter on another screen. Another problem is to miss one or two entire levels because it wasn't lightened and you didn't reach the floor or anything to stop the fall. You can return to the level you didn't made 100% but there is no easy way to do it and the map isn't helpful, so it is a big deal if you not clear every level as you go on if you intend to get the 100% achievement (which I don't, because I have no idea where is the 5% that I missed and I don't have the patience to go all way back, room by room).Overall it is a ok game, it could be much better. If you like very much platformers and puzzles and don't have anything else on your list, I think you should give it a chance. But I would recommend the Closure game first...			",294,77,6,18,13,2,26

												A nice platformer game with a simplistic design, 1000 Amps is a good game. In it you're controlling a small creature who needs to light up all the rooms of the ""Tree"" it's trapped in, after a mysterious invader took control of it.It's more or less a puzzle game, since each room has several nodes you need to step in in order to light it up, and there may ""enemies"" that turn off the nodes. As you progress, you'll find new abilities to help you in solving the puzzles, and sometimes you'll have to leave rooms unsolved since you lack the abilities to solve it at the time.The game world is quite big, there's plenty of rooms to explore, and sometimes you'll end up lost. Still, it's by no means frustrating, it's simplistic design gives it a quite relaxing nature. Even then, it's not that long, as each room can be solved in a short time once you have the skills to do it.I recommend it.			",419,84,9,48,30,5,75

												Another cool idea with a terrible execution that makes me sigh in disappointment. I really wanted it to be as nice as it was intended to be.* Music is basically simple, annoying, and repetitive piano chords* Resolution is abysmal, so you either play with a tiny window (480p I think), or a very poorly stretched fullscreen, despite the fact that last update mentions ""true fullscreen""* Gameplay could be nice, but it's too cruel for a puzzle game. If you step onto the wrong invisible square, you might fall out of the stage you're in and lose your progress. Not only that, sometimes it's very hard to backtrack to where you were. So it basically becomes a guessing game with some puzzle elements after the guessing is over.* The big map is close to useless, since you can't zoom in and all rooms are very, very small in the mapSo basically this game just has a good idea.

												Charming graphics? Check. Minimal sound? Check! Ok puzzles? Check!So 1000 Amps is a Flash game that looks pretty sweet actually. It's a puzzle platformer by the way. As a little lightbulb you walk around touching invisible panels. The panels will appear when you touch them (jump, bump or walk over them) and some of them will even light up. And that's what you have to do. You have to power up rooms by lighting up all the lightpanels. They can range from a couple to a dozen. It starts off easy, but in a matter of minutes you'll be jumptouching panels as well (meaning you have to jump to the panels without touching the other, normal, panels). It never gets THAT difficult but there might be a couple of moments where you have to think about what you really have to do.It's cute, but in all honesty, I don't think I would really recommend it to anyone (not that it's bad). It's just too simplistic for my taste.[Rating: 68/100]			",1661,635,69,221,194,16,225

TLDR  Enjoyment ★★★☆☆   100% Difficulty ★☆☆☆☆ 21:9 SupportNo (fixed-size window)ExperienceKudos to the developer for maintaining and improving this tiny casual game even after more than 3 years of its original release. Achievements were not working on Mac back when I was first trying this game out - I emailed the developer for help and one week later he got this fixed with a new update. Pure awesomeness.Commentary1000 Amps is not a game with fancy graphics and doesn't scale well with bigger screens, but it's a solid Metroidvania experience. Some people were complaining about the puzzles being too ""cruel"", that a misstep could cause some severe setbacks, etc., but the truth is these people weren't appreciating the game as a Metroidvania, but rather, something that they can and should be able to force their ways through. If you love Metroidvania and know how to do systematic explorations, you'll have a blast like I did.			",93,51,0,7,9,1,18

												Does anyone remember an old parody Flash game called ""Achievement Unlocked"" where you got an achievement by touching all of the wall blocks? Well, apparently someone made an entire game out of that concept and called it 1000 Amps.The gameplay is simple: everything’s invisible until you touch it, and the goal is to explore hundreds of rooms and find the hidden light blocks in each room. Many rooms require some serious out-of-the-box thinking and creative use of your abilities to solve. Though, be warned: the game is nonlinear and exploration-based, meaning lots of backtracking and wandering around. Though I personally liked this game, it might be a bit too unique for some people, and some parts require some serious patience. But if you like indie puzzle platformers, and you’re in the mood for one that’s not afraid to try something extremely new, consider this one.			",311,69,5,34,15,2,47

												I adore this game; 1000 amps is a metroidvania style platformer with the focus being on navigating and illuminating rooms rather than fighting through enemies. Upon entering each room there is total darkness, but as you come in contact with walls they illuminate, allowing you to slowly “feel” your way around. Amongst the plain walls, there are also a handful of light blocks in each room which (if you activate them all) will allow the room to be permanently lit. If you leave a room before touching all the light blocks, all of the revealed surfaces will be erased and you will have to begin again. As the game progresses you will unlock a few powers to help you clear rooms. Each power feels well spaced out and can have a major impact on how you approach each room.It’s difficult to explain all the nuances of the mechanics behind 1000 Amps, but after only a few minutes playing you will understand completely. This game is beautiful, and the only gripe I have is that the map screen (an absolutely vital component of this type of game) is dreadfully vague and takes a while to figure out exactly what you’re looking at. Other than that, it’s wonderful, and everyone should give it a go.			",296,131,12,29,48,4,47

												1000 Amps, if you're not familiar with it, is a short and simple metroidvania game where every room is a puzzle. Your little dude there, Plug, is trying to power this huge amp network back on by touching all the light blocks in every room. You have a power meter in the top right, and every block you light up charges it. This power lets you jump higher and use the abilities you unlock later like teleporting. Rooms can have anywhere from one to dozens of blocks to find, with conveyors and lifts and one-way walls and other obstacles in the way. A major strength of the game is that it is very open; once you descend from the tutorial area to the main hub, there are four paths you can take. While your guide character suggests one as the easiest, you really are free to take whichever you want, which lets you unlock powers in whatever order you want. The puzzles get pretty challenging, the powers are clever, and there's a lot of secret rooms and areas and items to uncover.I only have two real knocks against this game. The first is that the map in this game is terrible, especially when going for 100% completion. Incomplete rooms are gray outlines, complete rooms are lighter gray outlines, and the room you're in is outlined in white, all on a black background. Rooms also share borders, which makes it really tough to find those last few you're missing. My other gripe is that the final boss is a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The concept is good, but you have to fight him in four phases and the last two can be really tough. Of course, if you botch any of the phases you have to do the whole thing over. One other thing worth mentioning, I think I kinda broke the game by finding a ""secret"" power really early on, so the openness of the game can definitely work against the challenge factor.It's cute and its clever and the problems don't really rear their heads until the very end, so I'd say this one is definitely worth a few hours if you have it or a few bucks if you don't.

												The concept is solid. It's nice that every room has a puzzle to solve (whether simple or complex) and it's obvious that a lot of care and thought went into the room layouts.The visuals complement the game's theme excellently...but it runs at a mere 640 × 480, with no upscaling options other than ""fullscreen"". While this is regrettable because the uncomplicated, nearly-monochromatic sprites would—for once—have been well-suited to pretty much any pixel art upscaling algorithm (filter), they don't actually suffer that much. The real casualty of this decision is the map; at such a small scale it's an unintelligible mess.While the idea of tying the music to your progress in the room is a good one, the actual compositions are unfortunately reminiscent of an amateur plonking around on their first electronic keyboard. The final boss isn't particularly difficult, but is a total mismatch for a game that is otherwise leisurely-paced and impossible to fail. Ultimately: it's enjoyable, but definitely flawed.

It's simple but attractive art style makes for a perfect combo with challenging but simplistic gameplayThe difficulty ramp was perfect in the beginning with some areas and object that you get the feeling you'll need to come back to at a later date to access. Puzzles started easy but become harder over time so they require you to think outside of the box you are in.I never played got to play the original flash version which was a let down for a lot of new players as the map was very small and blurry making looking those last few unexplored areas.... troublesome, to say the least. One of the secret areas was VERY hard to get to because I lit the room up before accessing it but I did manage to get in after a few minutes.8/10- Overall a fun game to play on the side, challenging, nice music and a great art style ",588,107,24,58,52,6,99

												It's pretty simple and short, yet beautiful and challenging game. There's a moments which will cause some frustration and that's why I left this game 2 times behind until my 3th attempt. Road to the next location isn't always clear and you'll get lost constantly. However, this is a great brain teaser. Every upgrade you'll collect will ease your journey a little bit... until you reach a part where you need to find another upgrade.It's not perfect, but I liked it. I'd gave 3/5 start for this one if I could. If you are into puzzles and ""open world roaming"", I'd recommend this one. Not a perfect, but excellent brain teaser.			",587,129,16,64,57,6,103

												A simple and beautifully made puzzle-heavy Metroidvania, featuring brilliant design on the room-to-room and game world scale. The progression of skills and complexity makes the whole of the game perfectly digestible right to the end.

												A fun take on the puzzle platformer with the goal to ""light up"" puzzle rooms by bumping, jumping, and teleporting to explore around levels. Puzzle names & solutions were kept my interest and remained challenging, although I feel some puzzles were solved unconventionally by abusing edge-of-vision teleporting or revisiting after receiving a powerup/upgrade.The resolution & world map were difficult to deal with - windowed mode is too small and often had me misclicking outside the game, while full screen ended up a too scaled and stretched. I had to switch between windowed/full to utilize the tiny world map, which added to the frustration of getting to ""that next unsolved room"".			",616,196,24,88,51,11,98

												Quirky indie game where you explore a 2D map and solve some platforming puzzles, lighting up a grid as you go.The central mechanics mesh well together, and each room has a definite idea behind it - reminds me a lot of VVVVVV.The puzzles are well designed and the abilities you gain are satisfying, overall it's quite absorbing as you explore the different rooms and solve them as you go, returning to finish more rooms.Not the prettiest game - and sometimes quite frustrating - but a solid game at its heart. You'll easily while away a few evenings with this, which is damn good value for the asking price.			",231,87,3,27,24,2,28

												No longer runs in Flash, taking out a huge amount of the problems the game had on launch (when I played it). Relevant parts of the now-outdated review reposted below:It's like someone made Metroid into a puzzle game and only twice now have I actually hit a roadblock that I NEEDED new powerups for. Pretty non-linear and the game gives you the occasional ""seeds"" you can spend 5 of to clear a room you're having issue with (SAVE THEM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, the final area is misery incarnate). Fun game! Be warned that the finale is a massive difficulty leap and trying to 100% the game (for its ""true"" ending) is a bit masochistic. Do not leave a room behind unless you are CERTAIN you can't complete it with your current powers, finding those one-offs later to do so is a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥♥			",2447,961,90,309,287,27,386

												The game isn't great but it isn't bad either. It's a highly minimalist metroidvania platformer. Basically you need to find all the lights in a room in order to keep it alight and you need to do this all over the map, you find upgrades which allow you to reach previously unreachable areas and light up those areas. The biggest problem with the game is the low window size and the lack of a proper map. Luckily, there is a java program that solves this problem. Check the forums for more info on this program. I recommend this for any hardcore fans of metroidvania games.			",199,32,4,3,2,0,17

												Probably a good platformer, but mechanics get in the way.There are some ""blocks"" in the game that move you. ""Alright, so what?"" you say.Well, when trying to just go from one room to the next means you have to go through them, so it's a test of skills just to move pretty much.This game also has really bad optimizations.

												I picked this game up on a whim a while back, played about an hour and didn't touch it for a long time. My first impression was that it was mediocre, kind of confusing on how you're supposed to play it and not very fun. I recently came back to it and decided to play it through to the end, and having done so, my opinion of the game has changed considerably.The one big flaw with 1000 Amps is that the basic mechanics and general structure of how the game works and is supposed to be played can be hard to understand at first. I especially found the mechanics of how the Teleport ability exactly works difficult to grasp and had to look it up. I'm pretty sure the game explains it, but obviously not clearly enough for some.However, once you grasp the basics, the game starts to get pretty fun. When you understand Teleport, it gets a lot more interesting. And when you get the Sonar upgrade, the game really takes off. It's very Metroid-vania in that you're given an open world with areas you'll have to return to once you get a new ability.

												I really want to like the game because I like the idea behind it, but playing platformers with the keyboard makes me sad, and there are just too many cases where the level design (which is mostly good) pulls some serious♥♥♥♥♥♥moves. Your progress in each room is only saved when you fully complete it, and it'll do things like put gaps in the floor that drop you to the room below where you're likely to walk across, holes in the ceiling that pass through to the room above where you're likely to jump, and so on, and you can't see them ahead of time because the room doesn't light up until you either explore it manually or find everything in it you need to complete it. Instead of being a game of solving good platforming puzzles, it becomes ""solve good puzzles while trying to anticipate when the guy who made it was feeling like a jerk"", which is not nearly as much fun. Someone with a higher tolerance for that might like it more than I did, and maybe who grew up playing Commander Keen instead of Mario and doesn't cringe every time they play a platformer without a controller.

												1000 Amps is a deceptively challenging platformer; you control Plug who can move and jump with the goal of each room being to touch all the lights. Spread out at the far edges of the ""Light Tree"" are rooms that give you special abilities that make it easier for you to jump, move or turn on lights. Hell technically you don't even have to light every single room up to advance if you can find the exit.There's not much else to really add. Personally I found it really fun: it was the game I would load up when I had less than half an hour to kill and while there are a few rooms that require you to basically smack your head against the wall until you get the perfect jump or teleport it's not particularly frustrating. The biggest negative I can think against it is that backtracking can be extremely tedious and the map was of little use since it just shows you what rooms are lit up and no actual details.Overall the game was extremely well designed and the simplistic aesthetics are a neat touch. It's not a must have game, but if you enjoy open puzzle/platforming games you will get a kick out of it.			",253,86,2,60,7,2,34

												1000 Amps is an exploration game, structured similarly to a metroidvania game but with unique mechanics and no combat except the final boss.  The game world is split up into various rooms which you are tasked with restoring power to by activating all the energy node blocks in each one.  It sounds easy, but your character's jump height is tied to the % of power restored to the current room, and each room resets if you don't complete it before moving to another.As you progress through the game you acquire new new abilities which let you deal with new obstacles the game throws in your way in metroidvania fashion.  Some rooms require quick reflexes and timing, while others just require some thinking.  Overall I found the puzzles well designed, though a few can be frustrating.  The biggest weakness though is that there are quick a few lengthy one-way passages, and if you miss completing a room in those areas, it takes a while to get back there.It's a simple game, but a good one.  The difficulty is higher than the appearance would suggest however.			",862,202,24,72,69,9,114

												1000 Amps is a simple little platformer where you must go through empty levels, lighting the way. Everything you touch becomes a wall, some sort of platforming obstacle, or node. The goal is to light all of the nodes of each room before progressing. Through the game more power ups and obstacles are introduced, making puzzles become appropriately more challenging. Most rooms had multiple exits, allowing the player to solve rooms in different orders.The music is repetitive, but easy to listen to. It never bothered me in my hour with the game, but a little more variety would have been nice. The art is really simple, and easy on the eyes. Every detail of the game is distinct and easy to figure out what it means – even the first time coming across it.Overall 1000 Amps is a well-executed minimalistic non-linear puzzle platformer.

												At its core, 1000 Amps is somewhat similar to VVVVVV - you've got a whole bunch of interconnected rooms to explore, and will spend most of your time figuring out how to get to them all. That said, there are a couple of things going on here to help separate this one from its ""metroidvania"" peers:- Right off the bat, there's the graphical style, which is built almost entirely on sharp, grayscale squares; it might come off as dull at a glance, but for a world built with such limited materials it actually looks pretty nice. The simple black, white, and shades in between are pleasant and clean, not to mention spiced up by the lighting, which I'll get further into in a moment.- While most platformers of this ilk immediately reveal the full layout of each room you enter, in 1000 amps the power has been cut across the entire map, so you have to feel your way around in total darkness and touch various blocks as you go to render them visible. The most important of these are ""light-up"" blocks, since if you find all of them in a single room the power will be permanently switched back on and that room will be ""solved""; moreover, each one you find charges your battery, which enables higher jumps and the use of special abilities, so you'll often need to plan your route to complete the circuit. At this point I'll also note that there's no music to speak of until you solve a room, which prompts some manner of synthesized bell tune to pipe in; I can't say I was humming along to most of the music, but the overall effect suited me fine.- If you're looking for combat you'd best look elsewhere, since there really aren't any ""enemies"" wandering around in the traditional sense; actually, there aren't any dangerous obstacles here either, or any way to ""die"" at all. About the worst that can happen to you is that you unintentionally pass through a non-solid floor or wall into a different room and lose your progress in the one you were working on; this can be frustrating, as there's no way to tell what's where when you first enter a new area (at least until you get the Sonar, one of a few upgrades you'll need to progress past certain points), but it usually doesn't take too terribly long to get back where you were, especially if you've already solved some of the surrounding rooms and can pass through them quickly.So there you have the game's most distinguishing features; now, how do they all fit together? For the most part, pretty well: control-wise all you need are the WASD/arrow keys to move and jump around, plus the mouse cursor to guide the crucial ""teleport"" ability, unlocked early on. There are a handful of technical ""tricks"" to discover as you get more comfortable, which are essential to giving yourself that little extra boost you need to sneak over a wall or graze past a remote light-up block; the game doesn't present too many overt hints to this end, but I'd wager that players familiar with platformers in general should be able to figure them out without too much trouble. On the whole, that's pretty much all there is to know about 1000 Amps, which is fine: you explore, you experiment, you light stuff up and fill in the map a bit at a time.Puzzle-platformer fans should enjoy themselves on the whole, but there are a handful of caveats. First and foremost, the creator's total devotion to the black-and-white art style can sometimes hamstring it: in certain situations you have to look closely to spot a less-than-obvious doorway or other element, and you'll be squinting particularly frequently at the (also grayscale) in-game map as you attempt to visually determine whether or not you missed a particular tiny passageway from way back when...and there's no way to mark or annotate it either. I can understand and appreciate sticking to one's guns artistically, but in this case I'd call it more of a hindrance than it's worth - I managed to get the completion percentage to 99% before finally giving up on figuring out which slightly-darker-than-the-rest speck on the map I'd overlooked.Also be aware that there's no genuine transporter hub or other means of ""fast travel"" here: granted, the map isn't super-huge and can be traversed fairly quickly once you're breezing through solved rooms, but there are more than a few lengthy routes which can only be completed in one direction, so if you need to retrace your steps you've got no choice but to slog your way to the starting point (which can, again, be tougher to determine than it needs to be thanks to the map's deficiencies) and begin from square one. This is compounded by a couple of rooms that are particularly easy to fall out of by accident until you've turned all the lights on, and a few others which require some fairly precise tapping and clicking to clear; most of the time things feel fair and forgiving without being condescending, but there is some grumbling to be had here and there.Hopefully at this point you've got a decent idea of what 1000 Amps has to offer, and what it doesn't: it's only a couple of bucks to acquire, should only take you a few hours total to finish your first time through (though I'd imagine it's ripe for speed-running once you know where you're going), and for the most part delivers on its simple, pleasant concept of a visually-sound, non-violent exploratory puzzle-platformer. If that summary appeals to you, by all means save this one a place in your Library.			",985,213,1,70,15,0,24

Near the beginning in addition to standard 2d WASD controls you also get the ability to teleport to your mouse pointer while conserving momentum, at the cost of darkening nearby blocks, so already the platforming has a pretty novel puzzle element.The game's graphics are minimalist, but that's not a bad thing. What is bad is the minimap. For some stupid reason, it's blurry as drowned newsprint, and that makes it very difficult to hunt down all the areas you need to find and light. So that's an overarching source of irritation. Sometimes the screen will flash due to something that happened in the game, and it won't go away quick enough, and you'll miss something important and have to restart the room. The screen size is tiny and you cannot enlarge it, leading to puzzles that you could solve RIGHT NOW if the camera would just go up HALF A BLOCK, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASKAhem.The platforming takes a little time to get used to, because your jump height depends on the percentage of blocks in a given room you have succesfully lit. But you get a feel for it soon enough, and it's not a problem. What is a problem is how often you just plain fall out of a room, or get swept out of it via 'conveyor' tiles, and have to start all over again. Frustration mounts quickly, and by the time you solve a room it may feel like a hollow victory, with little payoff for the effort you invested.This game is poison if you're a completionist in terms of game content or Achievements. Remember how I said the minimap was blurry? Well, there are two giant secret rooms you couldn't possibly miss... if they were ON the map! Instead, you have to poke at every seemingly solid wall to find them, with no clues to narrow it down. Worse yet, one of them is behind conveyor tiles, and the only way to get to it is to wait for the game to RANDOMLY BUG OUT and FAIL TO LOAD A TILE. That's right, it's a BUG that you can 100% this game. And if you do manage to find those secrets? If you found ""The Tower"" too EARLY in the game, YOU WON'T GET THE ACHIEVEMENT. How do you fix that? By playing the ENTIRE GAME OVER AGAIN.*sigh* In conclusion, there are some neat ideas in this game, and it has potential, but you shouldn't get it unless some things about it really change. The time you spend will leave you feeling drained, not entertained.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personal Rating: 5 of 10Weird little game. In 1000 Amps, you controls a tiny bot with the aim is to illuminate areas/rooms by simply touching or walking over boxes. These boxes are however hidden until you move up closer. There are certain upgrades in which you need to search by following a series of path, rooms to rooms, and certain rooms does require these upgrades in order to proceed. These rooms are actually interconnected to each other forming a huge map.Funny to say that I was actually attracted to this game but it gets rather frustrating after repeating the gameplay because I always come to the same area and got stuck there because I fail to get the upgrade first (teleport I believe).Without proper upgrades, some rooms are not accessible or returnable once you missed it (and my you sure are going to miss lots of these) because you may drop pass them.There are no minimap but there is an indication on which area you are at, but in my humble opinion, this map is rather useless. You need to restart the game once you come to a dead end and memorize the path you've taken and try on new paths. This is where it gets to you unless you have an ample amount of patients to burn. If the above description does pique your interest do look for gameplay videos first since I don't think describe this rather thoroughly.			",1029,415,36,151,105,7,188

												1000 Amps is notable because the stated vision for the game's design is ""to make a game centered around, but not intended to replicate, the feeling that one gets when one accidentally attaches alligator clips, which are hooked up to a car battery, to one's nipples."" Shocking, right?! In any case, to review this game on its own terms, I had to go ahead and do the electro-nipple thing (I had never done it before), but only belatedly did I realize that I was doomed to failure, because the game was designed to replicate the experience of shocking your own nipples accidentally, whereas I had done it on purpose. How ironic!Once I got back from the emergency room and realized my mistake, I couldn't stop laughing at the mixup. My nipples are a wreck now, though. I give this game 3 out of 3 nipples.

												I really like this game. I like the style, I like the platforming, I like the music.Unfortunately, since I run Windows 8.1, I have reached a bug where I am unable to progress past the first 9% of the game, as the game begins to selectively ignore the mouse. As such, I can't continue to play it and can't recommend it to anyone using Win8.1. Which is truly a shame, because I want more games like this.			",127,92,1,25,12,2,27

												1000 Amps is very reminiscent of VVVVVV. You are running around an open-ended structure, solving geometric puzzles in order to activate / save the system. There are no rules about the order of operation, just a bunch of rooms that you have to solve the navigation of to move forward.In any case, lots of simple platforming fun and a great exploration / discovery dynamic.

												1000 ampsHonestly, I think i've played this game enough to write this review.I almost have no words. Why in the world are people recommending this game. It's TERRIBLE.You just jump around, hoping to find blocks, and hoping to find the lights. You have NO idea where they are, you just randomly jump around. And on many maps there are ""exits"" in the corners and at the top, sides and bottom of the square you are in, if you fall out of these, every light you found disappears (unless you've completed it) and there you go! Now you gotta get back there, and activate them all AGAIN. Wow, this is SOOOO fun!...Seriously, don't buy this game, I see NO reason why anybody would enjoy this, use your money somewhere else. I mean, you don't need any experience to make a game like this, I can't believe it's even on Steam O.o			",421,116,13,48,36,2,58

												Seemed cool and controls well for a flash game.  The basic idea is to light up each room by getting all the solid white blocks.  Eventually you get the teleport skill.I would say however that this game is for those that like simple tasks.  There is a lot of rooms.  I can see this being an underground indi-hit game with a fan base...That being said, I did not like it all that much.  I felt like I was wondering around, lighting up rooms, and needed to turn down the volume before I annoyed everyone in the house with it.  After the game glitch-froze on me twice, I decided to write this and move on.It might be for loved by someone who likes this kind of thing.			",269,29,3,16,5,0,14

			Views: 12		

			It's not the voltage that'll kill you it's the '1000 Amps'. Also featuring 'google' as the search engine to find a walkthrough.		

What started with great promise turned out to be muddied by some of the games more restrictive design choices.  Too often I found myself slipping out of a room and losing progress by accident.  Additionally, the simple B&W art has great style but it comes at the cost of readability for gameplay elements.			",1293,574,45,182,174,17,247

												Cute little puzzle game, but it lost its appeal fast.  After not long at all it requires too much having to memorize the layout of the room you're trying to solve (which is visually reset every time you leave, even for a moment), too much having to repeat the puzzles of previous rooms to get back to the puzzle you're trying to solve, and too much being pooped on by minesweeper-esqe trial by error luck.

												Puzzle-platformer that's really frustrating to play because your progress on any given level can be instantly reset by accidentally going too far near the edge of the screen. In a game that requires fast, pixel-perfect jumps, that's asking too much. Cool idea, I guess. I'd probably play it on a phone. As it stands, it's not compelling enough for me to take the ~4 hours I estimate it to beat.			",590,167,10,85,43,4,95

												Task of '1000 Amps' is to light up every room on one gigantic map. Walking over the tiles activates them and gives you the ability to jump higher. Leaving a room unfinished results in getting every already activated light being deactivated again.One problem, that can get quite annoying, is, that many rooms have traps in them, which you can't see because the room is still pitch-black. This is obviously intended to give you some kind of direction but you often get the feeling that avoiding this trap could result in finishing that room. This gigantic map is also pretty maze-like, meaning that getting back to the room isn't always that easy.There is also one big problem: Its a flashgame. Deleting your cookies will also wipe your savegame.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While it is an enjoyable puzzle-platform romp at it's heart, this game suffers from terrible performance and control-responsiveness issues. Even with graphical quality and resolution at the lowest possible settings, there are often second-long delays between when you press a key, and when your character finally reacts to this input. This sort of behaviour in a platformer is truly frustrating, even moreso because of the fact that I am acutely aware that there is a truly enjoyable and unique puzzle-game underneath this mess.EDIT: From my experience, the aforementioned lag seems to ""build up"" as you continue to play through the game for any lengthly period. This buildup is aggrivated by any attempt to play at fullscreen resolution, as well as large rooms with a lot of ""conveyor belt"" type blocks. However, this buildup can be periodically removed by saving and quitting to the main menu. Still somewhat frustrating, but worth it if you enjoy your puzzle-platformer goodness.

												It's an ok game overall but felt tedious when you make the wrong step one too many times to lead to another room inadvertantly or you fall through to the room below losing all progress in your current room.  The puzzles themselves are interesting with varying degrees of difficulty, but the annoyances and tediousness weigh down an otherwise good game.  Perhaps if this game had some sort of room by room navigation similar to Escape Goat to show what you've done, what you haven't and what other rooms are available while allowing you to ""stay"" in a single room and reset it if stuck would resolve these issues.

												A simple, fairly short, indie puzzle-platforming game with some pretty neat mechanics. I played it for about half an hour and thought, ""yeah, I'll probably come back to it later, it's fun enough to keep playing."" and then coming back for my second play, I spent another four hours completing the game 100% and getting all of the achievements. It's a pretty calm and relaxed game, but the audio, while minimal, is pretty intrusive, especially with special blocks being activated.The audio really is the only thing I dislike about 1000 Amps, though, so I would still definitely recommend this game, especially for the pretty low cost.

												In spite of the fact that the smooth, elegant, simplistic monochrome beauty of 1000 Amps is evident from the beginning, if first-minute impressions were more important then they are for me, I wouldn't have liked it as much as I did and might have given up, as you are thrown into its little tile lighting puzzle platformer world with little to no explanation as to what on Earth you should be doing, and the game isn't afraid to throw you around from map to map and inflict a feeling of helplessness, to confuse you right at the stirt. But that, in the end, turned out to be a plus, as it created a genuine feeling of accomplishment as Plug, your little avatar in the game, grew in power, with a genuine feeling of power once he was ""fully powered up"". While the difficulty in the game is pretty uneven, that's more than likely intentional, as you I've appreciated those little breaks in the current, which didn't detract from the game flow itself. Most importantly, if something isn't solvable immediately, the game will hint at that and you can always return to that place. Precision (more), timing (somewhat less), logic and, most importantly, perserverance are rewarded here. And yes, everything IS solvable - 100% finishes with every seed found and none spent are doable even on a mouseless laptop like mine (it got quite tricky at times, mind).

1000 Amps is a great game to have for a slow work week.  At $5, you're getting about 3-4 hours worth of puzzle-platforming gameplay in a calming atmosphere.  Perfect for winding down or starting up your day.The Pros1000 Amps is a simple game.  You maneuver around and simply try to light things up by making physical contact.  That's great, considering the maps are well-established through a Metroid-like interface to keep track of your progress.  You find upgrades as you move along, and though it's easy to take a break, I didn't want to stop playing.  The conclusion feels satisfying as though you accomplished something, but didn't really need to know a lot about why you were doing what you did.  Sound and visuals also demonstrate the simplistic tastes by using shades of grey and soft sounds.The ConsThough it's pretty simple, I wish there was a little bit more.  There's essentially three characters in the game, and though it's more of a puzzle-platformer, there's a very weak story that just leaves me wanting a little bit more.  That's if I were to think of it as an adventure game, which it most certainly is not for 80% of the time.The game's locked at a very small resolution, which makes it feel like a cheaper experience.  It's not the sort of thing I think of streaming, playing on a TV, or impressing friends with.  That being said, the main map can also be rather small.My VerdictIf you like platformers or puzzle games without the attached stress or a fat price tag, go ahead and pick this up when you can.  Though it doesn't do anything particularly phenomenal, I found the experience to be worth my time and money.7.5/10 ",171,65,1,18,21,2,28

												1000 Amps is a puzzle-based Metroidvania. It's a solid game, with good controls, minimalist graphics and sound, and a play time of 8 - 10 hours. If that kind of thing sounds like your jam, I hope you enjoy 1000 Amps as much as I did.			",263,61,0,61,16,2,52

												So I just 100% this game and my thoughts are mostly positive although I have a grip with it. The game was fun albeit not very challengeing puzzle wise but fun. My main gripe with this game is that to get the last semi-optinal powerups requires a 5 minute treck back if you fail, and that the room that has that power up can't be completed in any way shape of form that I know of so I spent a few minutes trying to figure where im supposed to go. (Side note you can complete every puzzle in the game without the use of seeds.)			",57,7,1,10,2,1,1

												This game isn't worth the 5 bucks it's being sold for. Yea it could have been fun if it wasn't run in flash, or at least had music in the background, but unfortunately those are its' two fatal flaws. The game itself is fun and original, there are some hard puzzles to solve, but the game will have you figuring out what to do by yourself soon enogh. Since I only have 4 hours played on it I'm just going to assume it eventually does have music? Especially since the promo video featured an exciting classic peice, but as I said, after 4 hours of gameplay not a single song has been played. This makes it feel like a chore to play it for longer than an hour at a time. The other major problem is that it runs in flash, so it lags constantly and doesn't like to run well at times even on great computers. Little things like this can make or break a game, and this game feels like it should be on a free flash game website, not on steam for 5 dollars.			",91,11,0,19,8,0,6

												While it is an enjoyable puzzle-platform romp at it's heart, this game suffers from terrible performance and control-responsiveness issues. Even with graphical quality and resolution at the lowest possible settings, there are often second-long delays between when you press a key, and when your character finally reacts to this input. This sort of behaviour in a platformer is truly frustrating, even moreso because of the fact that I am acutely aware that there is a truly enjoyable and unique puzzle-game underneath this mess.EDIT: From my experience, the aforementioned lag seems to ""build up"" as you continue to play through the game for any lengthly period. This buildup is aggrivated by any attempt to play at fullscreen resolution, as well as large rooms with a lot of ""conveyor belt"" type blocks. However, this buildup can be periodically removed by saving and quitting to the main menu. Still somewhat frustrating, but worth it if you enjoy your puzzle-platformer goodness.

												1000 Amps has you play a little robot looking for invisible ‘energy’ blocks in small interconnected rooms. Each block lets you jump further allowing you to reach more parts of the room.It’s a fairly simple but interesting mechanic which provides a near instant sense of reward. The room systems reminds me of old 8-bit games with each room being a mini-challenge. The game is largely delightful but a few annoying moments when you accidentally leave a room early causing it to reset, or when you fail to realise a room can’t be completed without completing another room first.

												This game is INCREDIBLE. What would happen if you took Metroid (tight 2D platformer, chamber-based exploration with upgrade collecting and backtracking), removed almost all the enemies and weapons, and made every single room a puzzle? The people that made this game are absolute geniuses. This game is really fun and extremely challenging. Just figuring out how to complete one of the mind-warping puzzles (again, almost every room) isn't good enough -- you've got to actually pull off the platforming to execute it. This involves some crafty timing and order of operations.Example: As you complete a room you get increased jump height, so the solution for a room might involve actually solving a neighboring room so that you can jump with enough momentum from the solved room into another to complete it.As in Metroid, you will find upgrades as you play that let you access new areas that you couldn't get before. Unlike Metroid, you're left to figure out these things on your own.GET THIS!			",569,197,14,68,56,5,90

												Stylishly done puzzle platformer with an old school Metroid exploration feel. Little bit of brain twisting if you're new to the style. You don't get your hand held throughout, which can lead to frustration if you come up against a room that can't be solved yet with your current abilities. Just know there are some spots where you will have to take the long way around or come back to after getting another upgrade. Other spots just need creative platforming skills with your current abilities. Others you really have to figure out where you have to be hitting with a miss or two before you get it right. I do wish the abilities didn't do quite so much to negate what had made previous rooms challenging.A veteran of puzzle platformers may hit 100% in 2 or 4 hours with a ton of luck finding the secret rooms. It's a game that can inspire that zen zone where everything clicks that so few games can reach. 4/5			",2087,884,76,270,298,28,379

												When I first played this game, I found it to be incredibly frustrating and poorly designed, and almost gave up after the first two hours. Then I gave it a second chance, and I loved it. It still has its flaws and frustrations, though, but that just makes beating it all the more satisfying. My advice if you get frustrated (i.e. stuff I wish I knew early on to be more forgiving):*there are powerups in the game, and some levels are impossible to beat without them, so don't go wasting too much time on some levels;*don't take on the final boss until you have all the powerups;*remember to press the down button after a certain powerup to avoid too many leaps of faith.*you may experience lag, which I think was due to Flash. Try pressing H during game, or just restarting it every now and then.Frustrations aside, this is a fun and satisfying little puzzle game with some great ideas and a nice aesthetic.

												1000 amps is worth 1000% of your time. Short, and mindbendingly creative, I haven't felt this driven to finish since the original Portal. Do NOT overlook this game.Made by a single man named Brandon, 1000 amps feels like the unsung indie hero of the platformer world. The jumps are smooth, there are no hitches in the graphics or glitches that ever made themselves apparent in my ample time with the game. Puzzles are smooth and organic, and even when you're stuck in a room and it's clear you can't solve it, you'll always be able to find your way out. There are only 3 major upgrades, and while I'll reserve them for spoilers, each one is a massive boon that feels perfect for the game, without breaking any of the challenge it presents, and echoes a Metroidvania feel that is always welcome in a game. Above all else, the minimalistic monochrome art style is what stands out the most. Aesthetically, I haven't played any game like it before, and the fact that he incorporates the art style into the gameplay mechanics is quite fantastic, especially with how smooth all of it looks. While I respect all the retro 16-bit styles that have been pouring out of the woodwork, it's very refreshing sight to see an indie that has its own identity. There is very little story to speak of, but the final boss is perfect test of your acquired skills and abilities, perfectly implementing a challenging but reasonable fight for the final act.Word of warning: The one major flaw that I came across was the fact that you cannot collect the last upgrade if you use all of your insta-solve tokens on the levels before, so make sure you hold on to at least 5 until you come across the room below the infinite. It took me forever to figure out, so hopefully you won't have to.Finally, the main path is kind of obscure near the end, and while I enjoy the free roaming aspect, I found myself crossing through many of the same areas after making a wrong turn or falling into another room by accident. Other times, routes that seemed like secret paths were the correct passage to important areas, and often times if I screwed up and got lost, finding the correct passages taxed on time, for the minimap can only take you so far. Fast travel of even a limited style would've been most welcome.Regardless of these criticisms, I adore this game, and given how cheap it is just as a base product even without a sale or tied into a bundle, there is no reason for you to not pick this up, and every reason for you to bask in its glory.

												Nice platforming game, tightly designed, doesn't overstay its welcome. Because you play it in a small window, it might be a nice little thing to keep you occupied while you wait for something to happen.			",912,348,21,137,92,9,155

												I started to play this game while trying to pass time at boring lectures, and for that purpose it works great. It's easy to get into but has challenging parts as well where more focus is required (which I saved for breaks so I could rage-click without disturbing others). All in all the game was very enjoyable and satisfying to complete.There are some rooms of the 100% requirment that are hard to find and easy to miss on the in game map, the low native resolution window might be bothersome for some people.

												Hmm, conflicted on this one. On one hand it has mechanics down beautifully and generally good design for each room. On the other hand it revels in the tedium of making the player replay large sections if they make a single mistake, as falling off the bottom of the screen can send you to a room you can't go back up out of. This is especially awful in the map-wide loop to unlock the final (optional) power-up, but generally an issue. The ""resetting once you leave a room"" bit is also mildly infuriating; maybe it factors in to the puzzles at some points, but it really feels more annoying than clever. Some rooms also really, truly rely on random luck, and I never figured out what makes conveyor belts load properly. Small nitpick but the map is kind of too small to be much help, as well, a zoomed-in option would've really been appreciated. The sound design is also cute at first but quickly becomes grating, as you will hear the poor-sounding piano pretty much everywhere.So there's a lot of bad things to say about this game, definitely, but it's generally fun, all things considered. The power-ups are all useful and tend to make navigating earlier parts of the map easier. The map isn't overwhelmingly huge and the game doesn't drag on, but there's still plenty to explore. The puzzles are generally clever though there were a few instances of ""jump and immediately teleport so you don't go off the top of the screen"" that I reeeally did not care for. It's certainly a neat little game and I don't regret playing it, but don't expect to be blown away by it either.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												One of finest puzzle games around, with quite clever and fun way to progress through all the map. If someone remembers SUPAPLEX, then it's like reincarnation of supaplex's gravity levels with a bit different goal - to light all room lights without leaving it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I enjoyed this game, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you love puzzle platformers and can overlook the issues.The puzzle design is clever. Each room is ""completed"" in isolation, but sometimes the way rooms are connected, and the ordered in which they're solved, matters.There are definite frustrations. It's extremely difficult to work out how to get from A to B on the world map, even with the help of the (mostly useless) minimap. This gets worse as you progress through the game.The art style is nice and clean, though with the exception of one late-game forest area it's not particularly charming. The black-and-white style can also be wearing on the eyes - rooms constantly fade in and out as you move between them, sometimes very rapidly.One of the bigger letdowns was the technical implementation. Being locked by 640x480 made for an uncomfortable playing experience, and I couldn't try the bundled Flash version (which I understand is plagued by its own technical challenges) because the save games are incompatible.

												An adorable puzzle game of excellent polish. While it suffers from the rare memory leak, its an engaging experience throughout the several hours of play as you are constantly upgrading your avatar with new capabilities, rendering previously intractable problems assailable from a new direction. Definitely a solid piece of the Humble Indie Bundle 5.			",142,44,0,43,20,1,35

												A great platformer with a very simple and artistic style, and now that the game isn't written in Flash anymore it's considerably more stable and fun to play (I actually played it again once they un-flashed it to get all the achievements, and it was still fun)			",326,85,12,17,26,2,41

												1000 Amps is a neat little puzzle metroidvania. There are about 150 rooms in the game, each one has a variable amount of light nodes that you activate by touching. Each lit light node upgrades your jump height a bit, and if you manage to touch all of them in the room without leaving, they stay lit forever. After a few rooms you find your first power up, Teleport, which changes the game (and puzzle) mechanics quite significantly. You see, while you can teleport freely, you require at least one lit light node to do so, and teleporting clears a 3x3 grid around you - so if you were standing on a light node, it will deactivate. The game keeps adding game and puzzle elements constantly, and barring one or two times I was stuck in a room (sadly, the game will not tell you outright if you have all the needed power ups to clear a room), it's been a joy to play so far.

												A cute little puzzler that is heavy on exploration.It lacks the atmosphere and ambiance of the Nifflas titles, but it is still excellent in its own right.The switch to C++ from Flash has improved the game drastically.Well worth the price, and you'll love the gameplay & story.
