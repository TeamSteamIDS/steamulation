												Great game to waste time on from driving around, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and collecting things. Though extremely repetitive, this has kept me entertained for 90+ hours. (and over 150+ hours on the free multiplayer mod)PROS+ HUGE world map; we're talking 400 sq. miles (20 miles x 20 miles)


JC2 World Map IRL 
Community Created Artwork for Just Cause 2
By: Dr.Evil

			This is the exact size of the Just Cause 2 world. 400km sq if I recall (20 km / miles squared)		


+ Great graphics (esp for 2010) that still hold up a half-decade later+ Most PC's can easily handle this; a $100 GPU will max it out at 60 fps+ Lots of mods available + JC2MP, which adds much more things to do (and is free / 30mb)+ Blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥is fun+ Lots of vehicles to utilize + Perfect Draw Distance; you will always see the entire world! + Nice weather system+ One of the best Sandbox games out there+ Affordable; 15$ normally; 2~5$ on saleCONS- Extremely repetitive; you're basically just blowing up stuff for most of the game- Dialogue / Missions are cheesy / bad- World is far from ugly / barren, but there's few secrets / interesting points of interest- Driving isn't the best- Combat can get out of hand fast- Little to do outside chaotic actsThis game will run very well on most computers as long as they have some power. If you can play CSGO at all you can play this. I have a lower mid-range PC (GTX 750 Ti / crappy old 3.0 Quad core AMD) and I have this maxed out at 60 fps at 1080pIf you love sandbox games this is a must-have, especially if it goes on sale. Overall, a B+ ~ A- game; it's a must-have for any sandbox fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For those looking for a very wide open area to able to wreak havoc via a variety of different weapons and vehicles, this game is great.  It does have some drawbacks, the AI enemies are pretty easy to beat and some of the controls are a little off.  But overall I highly recommend JC2, especially if you can pick it up on a deal!

												The very definition of sandbox action. Sure, you can play it for the story, which is as trashy as it is charming, but where this game truly shines is in its free-roam action. There's so much to blow up, so many vehicles to drive and fly and so much crazy fun to be had. Oh, and you have a grappling hook. That thing alone can be used in such ridiculously fun ways, you will ask yourself where the time went!			",604,218,11,74,44,9,80

												months of mindless, fast-paced, explosive fun. The map is enormous, beautiful, and diverse. There is a multitude of weapons even without the DLC. The combination of the grappling hook and parachute is the best duo since peanut butter and jelly. If you think it gets gimmicky, it doesn't. It makes you wish more games had such inventive ways to move around. The people who made this game are geniuses from the streets of the cities all the way to the Mile High Club. Seriously get it.

												Open-world action game as it should be. Just Cause 2 has that great feeling of absolute freedom - go anywhere, drive anywhere, fly anywhere! You can get to any place on the huge map in just few seconds, you can be defeated without any penalties - this game is here to entertain you, not to blow your mind or make you angry at your keyboard.Two unique devices underlying the awesomeness of Just Cause 2 are grappling hook and infinitely respawning parachute (infinitely resp...? aw, forget it). Tons of fun guaranteed! Every action game should have it - I really missed them in Far Cry 3. ;-) It brings so much variety and joy in moving and fighting that you'll be travelling for hours here and there just to use them again and again.The world is really good. Yes, most of the cities and villages are copy-pasted, but there are so many different regions on the map with different climate, weather and views that you'll never get bored. Graphics is on the level too, especially fire and explosions - you'll get addicted to blowing things up! Story and quests are not the strongest part of the game, but they do their job. Another feature worth mentioning is the hidden items' search radar - in my opinion, really great idea. It is finally interesting to find stuff by yourself without spending hours in vain or using guide from the Internet.There are some cons, of course. Enemies respawning out of nowhere behind your back can be really annoying sometimes. Weapon arsenal is not so big, besides, the lack of ammunition for some weapons leaves you with even less choices. Main story is very short and optional quest lines are not so long either. But there are many things to do on the map - different challenges, races, liquidation contracts... Finally, there's still (and I guess it will be there forever) a bug that prevents you from getting the cherished 100% completion of the game (by the game's internal statistics, not the Steam's one). Thankfully there's only achievement for 75% completion, so no worries, achievement hunters - you'll get your perfect Steam game. ;-)If you like free roaming in beautiful open-world game, spending time in parachute challenges, races and outpost fightings, searching for hundreds of collectibles and upgrades, spreading chaos by blowing stuff up or just flying around and enjoing you freedom - you'll definitely love Just Cause 2.------------------------------Экшн с открытым миром - такой, каким он должен быть. Just Cause 2 дарит чувство абсолютной свободы - иди куда хочешь, рули куда хочешь, лети куда заблагорассудится. В любую точку огромной карты можно добраться за секунды, никаких штрафов за гибель героя - эта игра призвана развлекать вас, а не взрывать мозг или доводить до бешенства.Два уникальных девайса, делающих игру такой шикарной - гарпун и бесконечно восстанавливающийся парашют (бесконечно восстан...? а, неважно). Веселье гарантировано! Эти штуки должны быть в каждом экшене - как мне не доставало их в Far Cry 3!.. ;-) Простое перемещение по миру и заурядные перестрелки становятся настолько разнообразней и веселей, что вы будете путешествовать туда-сюда только для того, чтобы снова воспользоваться ими.Мир игры по-настоящему хорош. Да, большая часть городков и деревень сделана копи-пастом. Но на карте столько разных мест со своим климатом, погодой, видами вокруг, что скучно не будет. Графика тоже на уровне, особенно огонь и взрывы - вы полюбите разносить всё в щепки! Сюжет и побочные квесты не сильная сторона игры, но своё дело они делают. Отдельного упоминания стоит система поиска скрытых предметов с помощью радара - на мой взгляд, отличное решение! В кои-то веки интересно искать ценные предметы самому, а не бегать часами там, где ничего нет, или сверяться с готовой картой из Инета.Конечно, есть некоторые минусы. Враги, респавнящиеся из ниоткуда прямо за спиной, порой жутко раздражают. Арсенал не так уж велик, а нехватка патронов для некоторых пушек ещё сильнее ограничивает в выборе. Основная сюжетная линия очень коротка, да и дополнительные квесты проходятся быстро. Тем не менее, заняться есть чем - всяких испытаний, гонок и контрактов на устранение на карте хватает. Наконец, достичь заветного 100%-го прохождения игры (игра ведёт свою внутреннюю статистику, не связаную со Steam) не получится из-за бага, который, очевидно, никто уже не исправит. К счастью, Steam-достижение есть только за 75%-ое прохождение, так что будьте спокойны, охотники за ачивами - вы сможете получить в коллекцию ещё одну ""идеальную"" игру. ;-)Если вам нравится рассекать по открытому красивому миру, проводить время за парашютными испытаниями, гонками и сражениями за военные базы, искать сотни спрятанных предметов и апгрейдов, сеять хаос, взрывая всё вокруг, или просто летать, наслаждаясь видом и собственной свободой, вам определённо понравится Just Cause 2.

												Just Cause 2 is ridiculous in the best possible way. In the space of a few moments, you can grapple to a hovering helicopter; beat up the pilot and hijack the chopper; blow up a cluster of fuel tanks; put the chopper on a collision course with an enormous antenna; jump out at the last moment; and watch the resulting explosion as you parachute down to the saddle of a moving motorcycle below. But in the life of Rico Rodriguez, such events are just another day at the office, though in this case, the office is the gigantic island nation of Panau, where three gangs vie to wrest control from a corrupt government. This is a big game that gives you a lot to do and a lot of crazy ways to do it. When Just Cause 2 gives you the freedom to do the things you want in the way you want, it shines in all its preposterousness and good humor. When missions and challenges shoehorn you into specific actions, however, the same loose mechanics that make the open-world exploration such a joy become a frustrating burden.

												FREEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMSizeThis game feels huge in scale! There is tons of cities, factories, bases and even references here and there in the game. Despite the size of the terrain  you can navigate it fairly quickly due to having the awesome grapple hook and parachute mechanics. The movement from how you can move from one vehicles to other vehicles and the way you can use hooks in a variety of ways to mess with your enemies makes the game really fun and dynamic.StoryThough lets be clear the story is not great at all, its just there to justify you exploding everything possible on the island and accumulating as much chaos as possible. The story is so wacky that its fun putting you in crazy situations Black MarketCalling the black market kind of gets annoying however because you constantly have to watch the cinematic for the intro of it and outro depending on what options you picked. So everytime you want weapons,vehicles or just using it for fast travel you will be watching the short clips. Every. Single. Time. (Hey you can skip it at least)MultiplayerMultiplayer is what you think it is, going around and playing with 100’s of people that are blowing up stuff and doing races and other activities together.

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Just Cause 2""The same way I found out about a lot of games, from YouTube. I randomly came across a video that was showing someone driving a vehicle off of a tall snowy mountain. The crash and destruction effects made me fall in love. See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game. Unfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better. Second, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good. Third, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away. Review Of ""Just Cause 2""Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them. The world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places. You can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds. You can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.This isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion. As for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said. Don't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for. Content In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside ""side missions"". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types. Other then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc. To gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau. Pro's:+Massive open world.+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.+Fun destruction system.+Addicting ""I must find everything"" style.+DLC is not required to play.+Nice variety of vehicles.Con's:-Mod needed for full completion.-Enemy will spam helicopters.-Mostly boring empty world. -Strange vehicle mechanics.-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.Overall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			",293,34,10,30,34,0,47

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Just Cause 2 Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; RPG; Third-Person; Open World   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-50 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary (Standalone) Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Sandbox gamersREVIEWBlow up a small fishing village's water tower in order to save their country. Why? Just 'cause.Just Cause 2 is one of the best games around for exciting open-world mayhem. Nice graphics and animations, a diverse gameworld, and an interesting atmosphere establish an enjoyable explorative experience. The world is loaded with collectibles to find, vehicles to commandeer, and things to blow up. And it is headlined with exciting, distinctive gameplay chock-full of mayhem and destruction. If you are into sandbox mayhem, this should be a sure thing for you; and even more casual fans of the genre should easily enjoy this game too, because it is just so outright fun.Now Just Cause 2, as is apparent by the title, is the sequel to the first Just Cause game. The first game was decent, and I had some fun playing it. But to be honest: anything it can do, this can do better. Both games use the same core concepts for gameplay, except the ideas were certainly executed better in Just Cause 2. So you really don’t have to worry too much about missing anything worthwhile if you would prefer skipping over the first game entirely. Even the narrative of Just Cause 2 is almost entirely unconnected to the first game’s story, so reading a brief synopsis should be more than sufficient for you to fully enjoy the experience. Having said all of that, though, if you really enjoy the genre, then you may want to check out the first game too. Anyway, the strongest attribute of Just Cause 2 has to be the riotous gameplay. You move around in an over-the-shoulder view while on foot, with various firearms at your disposal for taking out militants. And the patented grappling-hook mechanic allows some innovative ways to take down foes, bringing a distinctive novelty to the combat. Furthermore, shortly into the campaign, a wide variety of vehicles (cars, boats, helicopters, planes, and more) becomes available. These are great not only for your basic traveling needs, but also to perform ridiculous and hilarious stunts. And of course, the grappling-hook and parachute combination can be used to explore the gameworld in the signature Just Cause fashion that affords the franchise its unique identity. And with the myriad of collectibles to find, structures to destroy, statistics to record, and achievements to unlock: there is no shortage of things to do.And I suppose if the gameplay is the best attribute of the game, then the gameworld presentation is a very close second. The graphics are pristine and the landscape is packed with diverse sceneries and environments. From mountain peaks to desert valleys, it has it all. The animations and effects are also mostly well designed, which enhances the gratification of bringing a wake of destruction through every last place you visit. And the world is humongous. Even with a jet it can take a while to cross the map. Luckily there is a fast travel system that allows you to begin a sky-dive from above any location you have visited. It integrates perfectly with the game, taking what would be tedious and flipping it into one of the most enjoyable things to do. Just Cause 2 easily has one of the most entertaining gameworlds to explore.But even with all of this going on, the game starts off with a very focused and linear mission that allows you to be introduced to the main narrative elements of the campaign. You will come to find, however, that the story aspects of Just Cause 2 are minimal, and mostly mediocre. So you definitely shouldn’t go into it expecting to be told an elaborate story. But despite that, the narrative flows and the various missions are certainly enjoyable. The missions are purposeful and focused, which can be a refreshingly stark contrast to the mindless mayhem side of the game. But while there is a decent amount of total missions including the extras, there are very few main storyline missions, which does hold the overall experience back a bit. So there is some room for improvement.Ultimately, Just Cause 2 is a good example of what can be done in video games when great concepts meet great execution. It is such an all-around fun and distinctive experience that I would recommend everyone give it some consideration; and if you are a fan of the genre, then it should be a no-brainer.And as an addendum: there is now a free multiplayer mod DLC. With the mod, the opportunity for hilarious stunts and mayhem is increased exponentially as numerous players can all play in the same sandbox at once. As a free bonus, it is a pretty sweet addition and can be a lot of fun if you like that kind of thing. Luckily, if it doesn’t sound like your thing, it is also easy to completely ignore since the mod installs as a separate “app” on Steam with separate statistics and achievements tracking.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Do you like making things explode? Yes? Then buy this game.It's the most ridiculous, action-packed, explosion-filled blockbuster of a game I've ever played and since it's several years old at this point you should be able to pick it up for beans. If you're an action game fan at all, there's no reason not to own this.			",177,47,1,38,16,3,44

												Just Cause 2 gives you a massive island nation to freely explore, wreaking havok as you slowly discover hundreds of locations and find over a thousand items. JC2 is so insanely fun because it completely indulges the player while minimizing the tedious elements of open world games.Other open world games require slow walking, but JC2 gives you over 50 vehicles (cars, tanks, fighter jets, and more) plus your essential grappling hook and parachute. If you’re hoofing it, you’re doing it wrong. Rather, open up the anywhere-accessible black market and buy a helicopter with dual-machine guns.JC2’s biggest achievement is how it makes you feel totally in control, able to go anywhere and do anything. There are no invisible walls or disconnected “levels”. And visually, JC2 is really, really attractive. The weather and water are standouts still looking good years after release. The artwork is all very well-crafted, with amazing attention to detail.The story is fun, too, with a very B-movie feel, intentionally hokey, but it works very well because of very solid voice work. The game also has a great self-awareness, featuring a hilarious dictator who will make you chuckle as he spouts his pontifications from loud speakers.Are there downsides? A few. You run out of ammo often, but after 5 hours or so you learn to simply order new guns. There’s no stealth elements but that’s ok. Very few buildings have accessible interiors but no biggie. Overall, the large scope, consistent quality, and accessible controls of JC2 make it one of the purest video games ever created. When you’re tired of “serious” games let JC2 cleanse your gaming palette.			",322,70,5,41,12,3,36

												Just Cause 2 is a legendary over the shoulder sandbox shooter along the lines of Grand Theft Auto without the charm. The game focuses on destruction, deep controls and doing whatever craziness you'd like to do. You play as Rico Rodriguez and you've been sent in by the government to mess things up like a kitten in tissue paper on an island nation that seems giant by gaming standards. You have the option work for different factions / gangs that have their own agendas. The gangs are a nice touch and you'll see them battle each other on the island while civilians run and hide. Its a nice AI dichotomy.Since the game is set on a bunch of giant islands, the terrain is gorgeous and diverse. You'll see lush green jungles beneath icy mountains, then go into those icy mountains and down into sandy deserts. After that, you can take a boat for a ride across beautiful blue waters, then hijack a jet and surf on top of it into a golden sunset while dodging missiles. Everywhere in this game is a gorgeous place and there are tons of places to visit and blow up. There doesn't seem to be any interiors, but that is fitting for a game so beautiful with good traversal diversity.The controls are deep, but they allow you to do a lot more than your average over the shoulder sandbox shooter. You have your standard, run, jump, gunfire, reload, grenade, toggle guns, toggle grenades buttons, but you also have the infamous grapple hook. This hook is what the Bionic Commando reboot was missing. Double pressing it will send you instantly zipping to wherever it latched onto. Traversal is made super easy, climbing up buildings with the hook, but not just that, but you have a parachute that is used to glide around. Simply hit the jump button while in the air to deploy the chute. Pressing and holding the grappling hook will grapple something, but then when you hold it, aim at something else and release the button, you've now tethered two things together, which results in hilarity. Tether a moving car to the ground, to watch the car flip over. Tether a NPC to a rocketing propane tank and watch them blast off. Not just that, but there is plenty of car combat. Normal games would have you just get in a car, not this game, you can get on top of the car to shoot things, or you can slip down in front or behind the car to shoot things using the car for cover as its moving. You can take over moving vehicles, with easy quick time events that show a struggle instead of just kicking a person out from behind the wheel.Combat is pretty easy, you just aim the cursor and fire. There is no aim button, if your cursor is remotely near anyone or anything, you will see a red highlight around the logical target. So if you the player have terrible aim, Rico Rodriguez will still shoot the target. In terms of holding guns, you can hold one two handed gun and two one handed guns. There are throwable explosives and you can toggle between two types. You can also melee enemies with the grappling hook.With so much control freedom, you can tackle missions any way that you want. Such as a car chase mission where you need to escort the driver, do you grappling hook vehicle to vehicle, taking out enemies and struggling to knock out the driver? Do you tether the other vehicles to the ground and watch them crash, or do you use your parachute to hover over the action and blow up the other vehicles? The choice is yours. It is an excellent game to do what you want.Missions themselves give you easy to follow objectives as if they were steps to follow. Open the gate, take out that rocket launcher, take out those snipers, pick up that item, grapple onto that helicopter, and so on. The objectives are marked with red and easily found with how far away they are. If you try to deviate too far from a mission location, the game will warn you and start a 10 second counter. This keeps the intensity on and prevents people like me from exploiting things.Outside of missions, there are plenty of things to do and they're all marked on your map. Well you need to visit the location marked on your map before you find what it is there to do. Things such as races, time trials, destroy bases and loot villages. Destroying locations and looting villages each has a percentage attached to it. To loot a village, you need to find 100% of things hidden there. Things like vehicle parts, weapon parts, cash boxes and even liberate the village from propaganda buses. Thankfully when you get near something findable, it will show up pointing out where you are, but you need to be very near it. This saves you from detailed searching. It is the same for ammo boxes and health cabinets.As for the bases, you need to find things and blow up things such as towers, generators, gas tanks, communication towers and surface-to-air missile launchers, each will make up 100%. It is fun for explorers to seek out every nook and cranny, but I can understand if getting 100% would feel like a chore.When you create chaos or break any sort of law, the local military will be sent after you. At first it'll be simple things hunting you down, but if you keep creating chaos, your 'heat' level will go up and more soldiers will come after you. How do you reduce your heat level? Hide. Yep hide in the jungle and after time your red heat will go to orange heat and start dropping down. This is good for keeping the focus on what you were doing before you created heat. With plenty of jungle in the game, it is pretty easy to ditch any heat you might have.Sadly the enemies feel pretty dumb. No one takes cover when you're putting bullets into them, even if enemies are next to cover, but I guess people play for the fun of doing what they want, not the challenge. In car chases enemy vehicles will just ram other objects. It leads to some laughable moment. They'll just drive off cliffs when you hit the brakes. I can understand scripted events like running into a gas station, but otherwise it is hilariously bad.The game is pretty easy even on normal with regenerating health. Not just that, but health pickups from cabinets seem well placed. If you die, you go to the last checkpoint. Sometimes the checkpoints are further back than you think, but that's the only thing that really presents a punishment in the game.The real downside to the game is that it seems to crash once every few hours back to the desktop. Luckily the game has an autosave feature.To top all of that off, there is a free Multiplayer MOD that allows every player into one world together for chaos to ensue. Is it worth $15? Sure.... but it has been on sale before at $2.50. Keep that in mind.			",1126,324,51,104,96,15,167

												Y'know, Just Cause 3 (Yes, I'm talking about 3 really quick, hear me out) had a much more refined game experience: the shooting controls were tighter, the grapple was far more versatile and useful, the parachute was easier to control, and the wingsuit was a blast to use and was a great addition to the game. The explosions were bigger, the voice acting was more tolerable, the weapons were crazier, and so on. I could list many more things that JC3 does better than JC2.But you know what? Despite ALL of that, Just Cause 2 has a certain charm to it that 3 doesn't. JC2 is honestly just...I dunno. It's so much more fun to play. Maybe it's because it feels less generic and AAA-ish. Maybe it's because you didn't have to do little challenges and destroy the same boring props in every town to progress. Maybe it's because the world was more varied and interesting, and towns and bases felt like actual places instead of bullet points on a list of things to blow up. Just Cause 2, as unpolished as it is, ends up being the more enjoyable game in my opinion. And this is just vanilla; JC2 is stupidly easy to mod, and there's tons of crazy mods out there to really crank up the insanity. Naturally, it's also far easier to run than JC3. Even the craptop I keep in my room can handle this game at 30fps on low settings.The current price of $15 is well worth it imo. If that still too much for you, you're in luck because this game goes on sale frequently and it's dirt cheap at that point. You could be standing in line at Target and pick up 3 Snickers bars and Just Cause 2 on sale would be cheaper. And the Snickers would be gone after a minute or two. You get to keep Just Cause 2 forever until Steam explodes.♥♥♥♥ Snickers.Buy Just Cause 2. For seriously.			",110,8,17,3,3,0,0

												I skydived from a helicopter into a banana republic to rescue memory cards and blew up 99.99% of a military base before grappling onto a helicopter which took me to a casino where I rescued an alcoholic black market weapon and vehicle dealer from the government, before I pulled his wrecked car out of a junk pile and he drove it while I was on top, shooting soldiers the whole time, before we arrived at his mansion and he gave me a beacon to call a helicopter that would airdrop me weapons and vehicles.THIS ALL HAPPENED WITHIN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES""GTA on enough crack to kill a whale"" 110/10 -IGN			",113,14,2,11,3,0,15

												HUGE world with tons to do, some of the missions are annoying, but most are pretty good. The environment is really freeking big and you can spend hours looking for water towers to blow up, or statues to pull down. Maybe you want to blow up a gas station.  Out of ammo, need a bigger better gun? Call the black market dealer and have him drop something off for you.  I've played for 11 hours and only scratched the tip of the surface of the upper crust of how much there is to offer.  One of my go to games when I want to blow stuff up.The game can get a bit repetitive, but come on who doesn't have fun crawling into an attack helicopter and laying waste to the world. Maybe you just want to carry a mounted machine gun around and blow everything up for an hour, go to town.This game is constantly on sale for $2, and DLC is on sale in a bundle. If you hate fun stay away, maybe my little ponies or something is more your speed.			",81,11,25,3,40,2,11

It has a huge open world which you can't explore even in a million years (Not really). JC2 doesn't have much of a story or missions. Its just a game where you explore and collect stuff and do all crazy stuff you can think of. Like punching someone in the balls.....NO....nothing like that. Chaos is what this game is about. Go and destroy and blow up anything you see. Do crazy stunts with planes and cars and bikes. Do races and jump off a building and........DIE. A LOT of side missions to do. I have more than 100 hours in this game and I'm not even 50% done in this game. You will never get bored of this game at all. You will keep playing and doing stuff. If you add mods then that will make the game even more fun. Now that its multiplayer mod is coming so you all must have this game so we can do crazy stuff together and punch people in balls together. 9/10. Get it!!			",81,4,5,4,3,0,2

												Got to be one of the best games I've ever played. You will waste hours and hours of your life on the Island of Panau killing people, and you will probably be able to run it on most modern PC's. Everything is an improvement over Just Cause, and it's definitely worth the 15 bucks. Buy it now!			",80,3,1,12,2,0,5

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing insanity. From the ridiculous story, to the mechanics, to the all-out action, to the cheesy characterisations, this game is 100% ludicrous good fun. It's at its best when you're in the middle of the action with explosives and vehicles erupting left right and  centre - there is certainly no shortage or vehicles, weapons, explosive tanks, and enemies to engage with. Do you want to surf a 747? You can. Do you want to fly as high as possible and then just skydive for a nice 5 or 6 minutes? You can. Do you want to hijack a chopper mid-air and use it to destroy an oil refinery just for the thrill of it? You can. This is up there as one of the most fun sandbox games to date. Unfortunately, however, the world is pretty shallow, and for all the locations and collectibles, the breadth of the gameplay is fairly limited. It's not a living, breathing world like the GTA worlds - the environment (which looks wonderful and varied enough in terms of climate and locations) is inhabited by people without personalities, and who exist only to be shot at, blown up, or otherwise maimed. The missions are compelling to a degree, although there is a degree of repetition in the faction missions that would become grating if the action wasn't so fun. However, I didn't at any point on XBOX or PC find myself compelled to 100% the game, as this involves hours of repetition with little tangible reward. This is felt the most when the end-game is at hand, and there's not a lot to motivate you to play beyond the completion of the missions. The story isn't very compelling or coherent, but it is bad to the point of *almost* coming around to good again, of which credit should be given to the writers for just going with it (a climactic battle that happens while clinging to a ballistic missile in flight?!). However, the dialogue itself is pretty bland and boring, and the sense of humour that they're going for doesn't always hit the mark.In summary, the JC2 is huge and stunningly beautiful, and the action is ever-present and very fun, which makes this a vast improvement over its predecessor, and lets it stand apart from the other open-world games of its time. In saying that, it lacks the personality of the world that GTA nailed, and the sense of humour that Saints Row did so well, which leaves it feeling comparatively empty at its core. However, if you're looking for spectacle, the game is well-priced and looks amazing, and there's a lot you can do and see in this game that can't be found elsewhere. For the price, I highly recommend it.			",286,54,2,37,37,0,28

												For the longest time Just 'Cause 2 was T.H.E. game on my 'good game' list. It was what I understood as a quality game experience, as early as the first announcements for JC3 were announced I would be scanning Steam store for a possible entry, without success. Now, easily 3 years since those announcements; I receive the SQUARE ENIX e-mail declaring the new Just 'Cause 3 is coming soon.I am excited; Just 'Cause 2 was to me in ""shootemup"" terms what Assassin's Creed is for ""hack'n'slash"". I found it awesome,very playable [in-fact some of the first DLC I ever purchased online was from Just 'Cause 2]. I also recall my reaction seeing this could not be played on XP operating systems. It would be unfair ignoring Just 'Cause 1 , like with Witcher 1, I was largely impressed with Just 'Cause 1; not as much THOUGH. I prefer Just 'Cause 2 more than 1, and I prefer Witcher 1 more than Witcher 2 [Just 'Cause 1 & Witcher 1 feel the same in game-play although the one is medieval and the other more modern-day].  The quality of Just 'Cause 2 was high, or HD [high definition], like AC1 and onward. That's WHAT caught my attention with Just 'Cause 2! The qaulity today of this game is very high. This game got me excited about ALAN WAKE games (they look alike).Then gratefully, square enix integrated our hero [Rico Rodriguez] into other games like Sleeping Dogs, his clothing and handgun, like Adam Jensen of Deus Ex into Hitman Absolution and Tomb Raider.At the time of release, I understand THIS game to be one of the Pioneers of HD 3rd person gaming.Thankfully,these days we are now receiving feeds from XBOX,like Ryse:Son of Rome.So this sort of thing is more common.Highlights-DLC jetpack parachute, (great toy)-Grapple hook abilities,-Open World with lot's to discover-check out the little scorpions running around Panau -in anticipation of Just 'Cause 3Game on  :-)			",906,268,12,52,34,7,57

Even if you never touch the story past the opening levels, there are hours upon hours of things to do. The graphics are beautifully and wonderfully optimised that I sometimes forget this was a 2010 title. Flying, driving, just messing around is all great.			",173,51,2,25,15,0,32

												Just another top class game, the graphics are really really nice. This is truly a sandbox openworld game with a gigantic map and over 100 vehicles to fly and drive with awesome scenery at every turn. So much fun is to be had with this game but it can get repetitive if you stick to one thing for too long but make sure you shake it up with the challenges and faction missions. Destruction in this game is brilliant and wont let you down in that department with lots of stuff to blow up. Buy this game when its on offer for even better enjoyment! This game is like mercenaries crossed with GTA crossed with Far cry 2.There are some bugs in this game that comes with the 3rd person view and sometimes you can fall funny and get stuck for a few seconds before your guy will get up but you can overlook these.

												This is THE definitive Just Cause experience. While Just Cause 3 has better textures, explosions, friendly NPCs, and a wingsuit, Just Cause 2 is definitely the better game. The island of Just Cause 2, Panau, is incredibly memorable; grapple around the streets of Panau City, drive a motorbike across the deserts of ""Lautan Lama,"" or do some temple sightseeing in the ""Berawan Besar"" mountains, and then do it all again. This game never gets old. You can ride on top of cars while they fly down the highway, or jump off a casino and plummet down a waterfall into the jungles below. Stop an evil Asian dictator from taking over the world, attach an explosive barrel to a guy on a scooter, race at the race track, or hijack a Colonel's plane in his backyard and fly it into a mountain. You can get crazy in this game! The music is fantastic, the mechanics are good, the graphics still hold up, and there is about 150 hours of content. Play it!			",53,10,0,6,8,0,3

												""Just Cause 2"" reminds me a bit of a GTA clone but on tropical island. Personally I didn't really care for the whole storyline, as my main goal in the game was to cause mayhem and destruction to military forces in game. It reminds me a bit of over-the-top Hollywood action film, but that is, without a doubt, the best part of this little wonder. Massive explosions, body count, that would make Arnie and Sly blush, grappling onto buildings, vehicles and even helicopters or air planes will make you love this game. I will recommend this production to everyone, that wants to have a little fun, blow something up or just simply drive around the island in one of many vehicles available in game.

Plus, there is now a multiplayer mod officially supported by steam, with a stronger community than Call fo Duty Ghosts (You'll guaranteed find a populated server).Awesome multiplayer, hilarious speed boost. Just plain awesome, especially if you like open world free roaming games of this genre.That not enough for you? Well... there are hundreds of mods such as an infinite amount of money, indestructible or fast vehicles, and the best of them all... the CRAZY CIVILIANS MOD! The crazy civilians mod basically messes with their steering AI or something, making all the citizens drive crazily, and drive (crash) planes. TOTAL MAYHEM!Definitely a good game.

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video game developed by Avalanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactive and distributed by Square Enix. It is the sequel to the 2006 video game Just Cause.The player is free to roam the game's open world, not having to focus on the game's storyline. Progress in the game is measured with Chaos, which is earned by completing missions, destroying government property, collecting items for the factions and reaching 100% completion in settlements and military bases. Chaos unlocks new agency missions and stronghold takeovers. Chaos and stronghold takeovers expand the factions' area of influence, which unlocks faction missions and race challenges.Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, the player encounters a black market supplier, from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased, with an option to have them delivered to the player's location via helicopter. As more Chaos is gained, additional weapons, vehicles, and the extraction option become available on the black market. All weapons and vehicles on the black market have parameters that can be upgraded in several steps, by building upgrades with weapon and vehicle components found within the game world. There are over 2,000 parts that the player can acquire.Overall by my experience, this Game is a Must-Have so I would Rate it:Rate 11/10			",195,20,9,16,14,0,10

												It's a strange game, really. To me, it collides beatifulness of sights, marvels of almost supernatural flights, and uglyness of c.i.a. operative agenda. For sandbox game, it looks almost perfect.But I'll start from bad side.Story are weak, alike with any subsequent missions of ""Just cause"", and it's because of game pattern - CIA operative wreaking havoc and destruction on peaceful countryside for USA profit and domination. That's a little more complicated than muscling drug deals, car thefts and bank robbing, like usual gta-like stuff, don't you think? Ok, there was ""Mercenaries"" and brilliant ""the Saboteur"", and I liked them! But in those games you were aiming primarily to military objects, and were penalized for civilian casulties. Conscience sleeps well on that. But as for ""just case"", you blowing power and water supplies in cities and villages. You are coherently destroing all of life-suppoting communications in country for such irrelevant aim as ""chaos"". Oh, and for drug deals - which CIA operative ever don't get envolved in that? Worse than that is only agenda of ""Prototype"" game, where civilians are just food, and only thing protagonist cares about is himself. But enough of that.Question is - is it playable?No doubt! There are so many strong points by those this game, shipped 5 years ago, are still no.1!Game process itself feels very, very exciting, especially if you like big size deals in sandboxes. Landscapes looks great, greater than in recent Far Cry 3. And you can fly it over and over, by rotary planes, jets, helicopters and on your own by magic ""always ready"" parachute combined with grappling hook (powered with same magic of everediness). Array of climat zones, from tropican seasides to the coldest highs of mountains, jungles, skyscraper cities, farms and villages, monasteries, industrial zones, even ""mile-high"" floating casino. Variety of cars, boats, guns... and plenty of space and challenges to enjoy it.Generally, its a top-high gta-like sandbox game, made for freeriding. And you know many people who likes GTA definetly that way - way of freeride skirmish. Buy it on occasion and have fun with it, when you feel rush for flying or blowing things.Overall 7.5/10 (only for lack of good story and abomination of CIA agenda)Plus 10/10 chaos points for multiplayer! Definitely try it, right on!			",725,239,45,156,102,5,232

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video Game developed by Avlanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactiveand distributed by Square Enix. The GameplayIs split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement. The Story Revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.From me 9/10 Sweep  ",122,14,2,7,7,0,7

Product received for free
												I feel like it's still one of the best open world action games available on Steam. The map is very close in size to Just Cause 3, however, due to the elevation and more diverse landscape (plus less water), the JC2 map feels MUCH larger.When I play it, I feel like I'm on the set of a Mission Impossible movie. Optimization is great and although it's graphics are a dated, the control feels so  natural that it's easy to lose yourself in the game.Play as the real Rico (before they changed him in Just Cause 3). It makes a huge difference, the mission design seems more dynamic as well.You can get it super cheap on a sale if you wait and it's very much worth it!			",180,28,2,22,2,0,2

												Just Cause 2 is no doubt my favorite game of all time, i have 77 hours on pc and most likely more to come just playing around with mods but even without mods it's amazing, I have over 300 hours on PS3 with this game.     The ammount of action in this game is a huge ammount and you can be as creative as possible with however you do things, the way you can kill your foes varies around shooting them in the head or attaching them to a car and driving them off a cliff. If you finished everything, just spend your time driving around the massive map, finding all the eastereggs like Pie Island, The Bubble Gun, or the Hot Air Balloon. The possibilities in this game is damn near endless. The story was great, wasn't too long and wasn't too short, was definitely worth doing regardless of people not even doing the story in the first place.I cannot recommend this game enough and can be toyed with for hours.I am so very hyped about Just Cause 3 which is coming out in 2015. If you do not have this game already, it is usually on sale for less then $6 USD and rarely stays $15.If you want a game to mess around with when you have no internet. This is the one.

												Just Cause 2... Chaos, chaos and one more time CHAOS! Playing this game is so much fun...The grappling hook, all the explosions and the car chases. Hooking a police car chasing you to a wall and watching it getting totaly destroyed and killing tons of people is so satisfying. Flying planes is a little cumbersome and voice acting is not that good as i thought, but still this game is EPIC. Missions are quite interesting(but about half of them are the same) and each character has its own role in this game. Fighting is pretty decent in this game.The multiplayer is just boring, unless you have friends to play with.And there's one thing that bothers me, there's no indicator if someone gets killed by you.Overall a great, funny game with some issues but they are meaningless, fantastic usage of the grappling hook and a lot of fun playing it. I highly recommend buying this game if you are looking for some total destruction and well spent hours of playing games.

												This game is---- AWESOMEBefore I start babbling about this awesome♥♥♥♥♥♥ I want to clarify that I've neither played GTA nor have I enjoyed playing Far Cry so far. This is the first ""Open World"" game with guns I've really liked and therefore, I can't understand some of the negative reviews here. However, if you know more about sandbox games than me, you should probably not read on (or leave a negative comment).what's this crap all about?Well, the game doesn't really have much of a story line. You play as Rico Rodriguez and go on an undercover mission to find out the truth about your corrupt island. While you're doing the short 7 missions, you might as well just end up destroying your entire world. ...just 'cause.playingAfter having completed the basics, you can embrace the awesome scenery of the island (my GTX 660 can run it on ultra). Although the game is older than 6 years now, the graphics look great and some of today's games should really be jealous. The screenshots on steam ain't lying! And now, your adventure is only just beginning. While doing the obligatory running job for your mafia bosses, you can wreak havoc in every city and village, destroy statues and blow up gas stations, win car races and do awesome stunts on your bike. You can climb the highest mountain or fly there, because you've got a friend working for the black market who'll supply you with anything your heart desires... if you've got the necessary cash, of course. come on, nothing is free in this world, dude.The map consist of several interlinked locations and you'll need to discover them before you can fast travel. In every city, village, whatever it may be, you can find parts for the market which can then be bought, i.e. you may want to get that fighter jet one day. Keep looking, babe. You just need to open more boxes. If you have a look at the steam achievements, you can already get a good overview over what the game has to offer. Destroying objects with whatever you've got, killing the military in countless ways, and driving your♥♥♥♥♥sore. Let's get to this new location! Flying? No, I'd rather use my hook like Tarzan and walk on foot. why you should buy this gameif you've ended up here, you probably have your reasons. maybe you've heard about the fps drops with the latest Just Cause (3), or maybe you just want to feel nostalgic (like I did), you're probably right here. if you're looking for a sandbox game with little story and the opportunity to do just whatever the hell you want to do, this is the right thing. it will run smoothly on anything similar to GTX 660, and if you're fan of blowing up stuff, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind that the choices lie with you. if you get bored playing this game, you may not be used to the freedom this game provides you with. This is not Skyrim and the game is not about the story. I recommend playing 30min every day and keep enjoying the game, because, certainly, not everybody will enjoy playing this for 10 hours straight. Know what you're getting into, man (girl?). I play it for the sexy butts.			",189,120,2,35,26,1,17

IntroductionJust Cause 2 is an amazing, open-world sandbox-esque game with breathtaking visuals and massive explosions to boot. This game takes a lot of what makes a game like Grand Theft Auto good, adds a grappling hook, and puts in much more destruction into the world. If for some reason you're getting this game instead of Just Cause 3, then you're still going to have an awesome time.Please note that I have played this game for quite a long time before I owned it on Steam so my hours do not match up with my actual game time.GameplayStoryYou are Rico Rodriguez, your typical badass gun with a gun (and a grappling hook). Set after the events of the first game, you're essentially trying to overthrow this evil dictator and confront your old mentor. I'll state right off the bat, that the first game sucks, and the story in the first and second games sucks as well. Where the GTA series has had a pretty good storyline, Just Cause didn't get that bit right yet. You are likely not going to be very interested in the story if at all, and it's fairly tedious to do the missions for reasons I'll explain later on. On the off chance you do like the story, there are some interesting missions and places you have to go, which are honestly pretty fun. But just know, the story isn't the selling point of this game.Combat & ExplorationWhat you will most likely play Just Cause 2 for, is the insanely explosive combat, and the highly immersive, open world that it provides. From the open seas, to densely populated towns. From the cold mountain peaks, to the warm valleys below; this game has it all. I've played countless times just simply free-roaming and admiring the beauty of every environment. But what's a beautiful environment without some kick♥♥♥♥♥explosions am I right? Just Cause 2 features a variety of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. Simply order a drop from your handy black market supplier, or raid a base and steal all their weapons and grab your favourite car from anyone you see. The choice is yours. Combine all this with your multi-use grappling hook, and you can quickly imagine all the possibilities in game. Don't like a soldier looking at you funny? Hook him to your car and take him for a ride. Need a lift? Hook your car to an airplane before it takes off. Two guys, one gun? Hook them together and let the magic happen itself. :^)My only concern with the weapon/vehicle system was that it felt a bit difficult to acquire the exact weapon/vehicle you wanted. The drop system was very expensive and income was very slow. For a sandbox style game, it felt very anti-sandbox to have those limits in the game. Just Cause 3 has fixed this issue. But don't let that deter you, there is a lot of raw fun to be had in this game, and you'll spend hours in it just trying out everything your mind can imagine.MultiplayerMost people play the multiplayer mode, which is a free DLC to obtain on Steam. If you thought single-player was fun, you're definitely going to love multiplayer. It's everything in single-player multiplied by the number of players in the game. VisualsFor a game released in 2010, Just Cause 2 is beautiful. The graphics hold up extremely well and even surpass a lot of games that are out right now. It's very well optimized and will run on almost anything that isn't over 2 years old at this point. Explosions are stunning, while skydiving gives you the sense of speed that it should as you plummet into the earth/sea at super high speeds, only to pull your parachute at the last second and admire the spot where you would have died instead.AudioMusic is okay, sound effects are pretty great, voice-overs suck. Much of the audio isn't really the selling point of Just Cause 2. I feel like there could have been more here, but at least the sound-effects carry it most of the time. You'll be entertained quite a bit, but you may notice that there is definite room for improvement.SummaryJust Cause 2 is one of the best games of its time, and is still insanely fun even now. Its graphics hold up extremely well and has one of the largest game maps in existence. Whenever you tire of playing alone, the free multiplayer dlc will add countless hours of fun once again, and will lead to some of the best moments in gaming. Despite a few sub-par aspects of the game (story, voice-acting, etc), this is a game you will have endless hours of fun in, and you'll barely remember anything negative about the game.If you like a really good open-world game with super-fun gameplay, look no further than Just Cause 2.9/10 - Must buy.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Just Cause 2 takes place in South East Asia on the Panau islands. You play the role of a man named Rico Rodriguez sent to track down a dangerous American. However, in order to get the information you need you work with the 3 rebel/criminal factions, the Reapers, the Roaches and the Ular boys against the country's oppressive government.Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game, sure, but looking back I honestly would want to take the over 100 hours I spent on completing this game to 100% back. It's a grind fest, all Just Cause 2 consists of is collecting weapon parts, vehicle parts and destroying a number of things to reach 100% completion in any given settlement. There isn't very much replayability once you've completed every settlement to 100%.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Praising● Destructive environments. The majority of trees and shacks in the environment will come tumbling down if you use explosives or crash into them with a vehicle.● Creative transportation. The idea of using a parachute while using your grappling hook to slingshot your way across the landscape it quite creative and exclusive to Just Cause 2. I often find this method of transportation superior to using conventional land vehicles.● Plenty of vehicles to drive! Cars, bikes, atvs, boats, helicopters and planes are all in this game.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Criticizing● No licensed music. You often take licensed music in other open world games for granted but after playing through Just Cause 2 for over 105 hours, it makes you realize that it's the only thing keeping you sane. It couldn't have cost that much to license music from obscure artists or at least implement a feature where you can manually install music tracks and listen to them through your PDA while you're zipping around Panau, could it?● Horrid voice acting. It's debatable but it can only be seen clearly if you have experienced a multitude of other products to compare. Personally, I see it better than Ride to Hell Retribution although Bolo Santosi and the npcs you have to escort through stronghold take overs are the cringe worthy.			",68,11,0,9,2,2,2

												While the game lacks true depth, it's still incredibly fun to just boot the game up after a long and tiring day, and just make everything explode while you get chased down by half the Panau millitary. The main goal is to destroy everything, and this game does it pretty ♥♥♥♥ing well. If you're into open-world collecting stuff and explosions, this is your game. Definitely worth picking up during the sale!			",153,31,8,20,16,0,16

 My Just Cause 2 Review:  Quick Summary You are a Mexican badass blowing stuff up on an island called PanauPanau is governed by a little asshat called Pandak ""baby"" PanayYour goal is to make Panau ascend into chaos by blowing stuff upGame made by Micheal Bay and James BondAfter 200 hours of gameplay I'm still at 35% completion. The storyline is quite bad but you don't buy JC2 for its plot. The explosions are rather good for 2010. The graphics are utterly spectacular for its age. The game runs really well, at 100+ fps at the highest settings with my GTX980ti, and around 40 with my old laptop at medium-low quality. Barely encountered any game breaking bugs, expect for the time I became part of the mile high club by merging into it. Other than that nothing worthwile. I will update this guide when I either get to 300 hours or get to 50% completion.  Is this game new? >No Is the storyline good? >No Is it better than JC3? >No Was it worth 200 hours? >Abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutelyEnd of Review			",48,7,0,6,9,0,6

												You play the role of a terrorist spider-man dictator liberator? whatever.., To help liberate the population you end up destroying their water, fuel and electrical grid (and space program)... When the army tries to defend their little island against you, you simply blow them up too.But seriously..  Its a great game, it plays out like a bad cheap b-movie / Stallone action movie (which is awesome in this game). and the scenery and immersion is amazing (and the ridiculous stunts and crashes too).

												---NOTE: I HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS ON THE PS3 VERSION OF THIS GAME, AND 60 ON THE MP MOD. I'M NOT REVIEWING IT WITH ONLY 4 HOURS OF PLAYTIME---Just Cause 2... where to start? This is arguably, for me, the ultimate sandbox game. Perhaps trumped only by Just Cause 3, which I am yet to purchase, however, have played. The game sees you attempt to overthrow the corrupt government of Panau. How do you do this, exactly? By blowing stuff up. That is your main objective in this game. Cause chaos. For me, the campaign was not too important. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? Perhaps not. However, the campaign seems to just be a passing fad, and, although the dialog is well written, it is not memorable. Just Cause 2, however, offers an expansive open world, full of immense posibilities, from military bases and airports, from the smallest of villages to the huge capital city, and don\'t even get me started on the graphics. Even now, this game, from 2010, trumps many games released today, and the fact that even fairly low end (by today\'s standards) PCs can run it, makes it a viable alternative to the likes of GTA V, which requires a relatively demanding PC to run. My advice to you: Buy this game, now. At just £9.99, it is an ABSOLUTE STEAL! This game is great for people who don\'t have a great PC, or are just looking to try the series, not wanting to spend large amounts of money on Just Cause 3, or even those of you who just love blowing things up. FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC. Oh, and, while you\'re at it, get the multiplayer mod. You can do all the same explosion-y things, but with your friends.			",84,5,4,10,5,0,11

												One big sandbox of destruction and mayhem. Many many many hours will be required to complete everything. Perhaps to a fault, it does at times feel a little overstuffed with grindy content and gets a bit repetitive endlessly clearing the same clones of bases just to bring the percentages up to clinch an acheivement.However, its cheap, its fun, its  sharp enough looking for its age and if you do stick with it to 100% you will definitely get value for money.

Product received for free
PRESENTATION 7/10-The story isn't to be taken too seriously but it's good enough to move the action along. The cutscenes, however, are very weak in comparison to the game's excellent action.GRAPHICS Rating: 9/10-Rico's character model looks very good, but the absolute best-looking thing in Just Cause 2 is the island of Panau itself.SOUND Rating: 7/10-The voice acting in Just Cause 2 is hit or miss, but the music is always entertainingGAMEPLAY Rating: 9/10-Despite a few problems with checkpoints and on-foot combat, Just Cause 2 is an absolutely thrilling third-person shooter with a massive open world and some amazing action set piecesLASTING APPEAL Rating: 10/10I spent about 7 hours beating Just Cause 2. And that was roughly 30 percent of what the entire game has to offer. This game will keep you busy for a long time.			",77,10,2,6,3,0,6

Just (Be)CauseReview after completing all achievementsStoryIf there is one place where this game falls flat on its face, it's the story.  The plot is one we have all seen before.  Government/Dictator/Angry mam gets too much power so we have to take him (and the entirety of his county) down.There are 3 different factions that you'll work for during the plot of JC2, not including your own faction, where they will send you off to do small (5-10 minute) tasks, while sometimes sending you out to help them capture a new stronghold and gain more territory for them.  However there is no choice involved in these missions, for you cannot give the faction that you like the most more territory (they all have preset missions).The main story line is fed through agency missions that pop up occasionally after enough faction missions and/or destruction has been done, these missions are a bit more enjoyable, but drag on a bit to long. Throughout this story the plot takes some turns, but none are too interesting or memorable.  Half the time after viewing a cutscene I was left scratching my head at what just happened.  Even after all this I would say that the story-line is still worth playing through if not just for the ending battle.GameplayJC2 plays like most 3rd person shooters on the market, but with a grappling hook and parachute.  The movement supplied by these two mechanics in sync made the shooting much more enjoyable that what it would be without being able to constantly fling yourself across the map.  The shooting itself is fairly bare-bones, and the aim assist is a bit too kind (even on the hardest difficuly I could just spray and take out a group), but large groups of enemies can still be a problem if you don't stay on the move.There are a few cheap enemies that stack unfairly with the glitches that this game has, such as the rocket launcher soldiers.  These guys are rare, but I found that, once I was shot, I would be flung somewhere and be stuck on the floor untill another rocket arrived to put me out of my misery.  There are quite a few of situations that you can get yourself into where you'll get stuck and soldiers will swarm your defenceless body and proceed to shoot you full of bullets.And that leads me into the glitches... there are a few annoying ones but only a few that are game breaking.  The only game breaking bug I found was, after a finished a side mission, I was without a parachute.  I looked up the problem and it turns out that after this mission a glitch cause the parachute to dissapear unless you do another mission after (without a chute).  Luckily I hadn't done that one yet so I went about doing it without a chute, and that was the most miserable I had been playing this game... but it did fix the issue.  (Just leave that quest to the end if you can)GraphicsIt's an older game at this point, but still looks good.  The water looks especially good, which is a big boon since you'll be seeing alot of it.  The island itself suffers from a bit of texture stretching and tearing at certain points, but you never really notice them as they're in areas that you'd be flying over.MultiplayerThere is a FREE yes FREE mod for this game that adds in multiplayer. Adding greatly to the experience of this game by playing it with friends. You can check that out  Here	Verdict8/10 ",403,137,19,36,40,2,39

-Quick Review-Just Cause 2 was my first experience with a  ""third-person action shooter"". I enjoyed the quality, the way I describe the game is with the following formula: Skyrim plus Grand Theft Auto multiplied by Explosions/Torgue minus any type of interesting story whatsoever, and let's throw in terrible airplane controls on a keyboard to boot! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome to Panau, you are Rico Rodriguez, a spy in the service of the United states. Or as I like to call him ""the stereo typical action hero"". Playing through this game I didn't look at most of the explosions so I did a good job being a badass. As you progress through the story you end up helping three factions lead an uprising in Panau against the current dictator ""Baby"".As far as ""Just Causes"" go, I wouldn't call this game anywhere near a just cause, the only time that I was impressed with the game was at the end of the main story where the hero does something that I could actually respect and gave a pretty good reason for it. Other then that I heard enough ""Merica!"" ""Because Freedom!"" ""Because secret agents!"" ""Rico do this action hero thing"" ""Uncle Sam"" lines to make me want to eat the American Flag. Because Patriotism! If I haven't made it clear, I found the story very dull and boring, I was looking forward to finishing the story because then I can free roam all around this massive map and blow stuff up. More on free roaming in the Game Play section!Game Play: First a few notes about the controls. They are a little tricky to get used to, I found myself struggling to figure out what cover I can hide behind, and I would accidently jump out of vehicles or off objects trying to find the right move. This could be mostly to blame for being a Keyboard and mouse gamer.The strongest controls for the game is the combination of the parachute and grappling hook. There were numerous times that I would shout to my siblings in the other room ""I'm spider man with a hang-glider!"" because that's just how the controls felt, but it was very fun and never gets dull soaring around in the sky with the occasional shot to pull me forward.Please pause for a moment in loving memory of ""Atratzu who tried to fly a plane... and crashed, like several hundred times...""    Mmmmkay, the controls for the planes are terrible, I crash like it's my job too.Okay now for the quality that made this game shine: Free roaming. I have always loved freedom in a game to do pretty much whatever I want, the story doesn't last very long on this game you can wrap stuff up in a day and have the main story done. to get 100% in the world... I cannot imagine doing it, there's just so much to explore and blow up.The OCD 100% completionist part of my brain is exploding while I play this game because there's so much to explore, collect, and blow up. I really do love that type of quality in a game, I loved it in skyrim, I love it in Just Cause 2. Achievements: The achievements in this game often times require you to do things you wouldn't usually think to do. I never tired to drag someone behind my car with my grapple hook...  or string someone up against a wall and then shoot him to death. So the achievements are dynamic and interesting. But of course there are the standard achievements too: beat the game on this difficulty, do all these quests, complete the story, get 75% completion, etc.Price: Just Cause 2 is $14.99, I've played a total of 38 hours (as of 09/05/14) that is a very good price, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I bought this game in a humblebundle, the quality is outstanding for the amount I paid. And there's no way I'm close to finished with this game. I imagine the game will rack up near to 50+ hours. I intend to come back to it to keep playing over time. Conclusion: I felt like I was in a terrible action movie where everything is over the top, which at first I wanted to call out on the game... but it was doing it on purpose. So why insult something that's trying to be over the top? In the end I fell in love with the game.Regardless of the terrible annoying story (in my opinion, it was terrible and annoying, some people probably loved it and thought it was deep with metaphoric meaning.), sometimes clunky keyboard controls... all the terrible fireball-plane crashes I had... I still will keep coming back for more. I think this game is worth a buy and playing at least for a little bit.This game is probably best suited for people who like action games of any kind, the 3rd person perspective might catch you by surprise, so don't expect sniping or any scopes: all you have are cross hairs. If you know you like action games, and like free roaming with a parachute and grappling hook, this game is right up your alleyway.Edit/Update 11/12/14 - All achievements earned after playing for about 90 hours.

												Just Cause 2Story - Good god, what a rush. Take Grand Theft Auto, take Michael Bay and just. Mash them together. Probably one of the best games I've ever played being completely honest (Then again I say that about every cool game I play) 10/10Storyline Length - A couple days, it won't get boring, trust me.AI - Ice-cold killers. Grenades, snipers, revolvers, they'll use everything. They will find you. And they will kill you. Beware. Many different types of enemies too. Watch for ninjas Cx 10/10Experience - Ok, imagine a game where instead of driving cars, you use a zipline that's attached to your hand and infinite parachutes (not joking) to get around, where you can cause mayhem wherever you go. Tbh the only downside to this is that you run out of ammo way too quickly. 10/10Graphics - It's.... Ok, could be a bit better, but it's still great. 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Gun sounds, explosions and all sounds great. But the voice acting is just. Terrible. It doesn't ruin the game though, but it's just... Uncomfortable. 5/10Controls - Just straight-up easiest action game to play with a keyboard, Idk why ""C"" is aim weapon though :/ 9/10Overall - 8.5/10Just. Amazingness. If you haven't played or bought it yet, buy it and play it. Just. Please. This is quite literally Michael Bay's wet dream. ALSO, the Multiplayer Mod is free on Steam, so get that too for additional mayhem >:3THIS IS JUST. AWESOME. BUY IT NOW. YOU KNOW YOU WANNA!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just Cause 2 is a third-person wide-open sandbox game with the main mechanic being making chaos by for example blowing up stuff. It's very entertaining, and you get to blow up a lot of stuff. Plus, it has a (obviously free) Multiplayer Mod on Steam, which is kinda great too.			",235,43,2,35,46,2,73

												I never got around to play the original Just Cause. Mainly because my computer has always had issues with it, and Just Cause 2 pretty much improves the first game in all levels. Just Cause 2 is a third-person action game, and when I say action game I mean crazy jumping-from-airplanes-and-blowing-up-cities - sort of an action game. Rico, the protagonist, is like James Bond on steroids. You can pretty much do whatever you want, in a world at least twenty times (!) bigger than San Andreas, and five times bigger than World of Warcraft. Pick your vehicle; helicopter, airplane, sports car, moped, tuk tuk etc. and pick a random location; beach, jungle, city, highway, mountain etc. to ram, stunt, blow up, crash, projectile etc. with it. Or just hook yourself to someones boat and enjoy the eyecandies of this tropical paradise. Or hook the same guy's boat into an airplane, and see him take off. Or hook the airplane to a skyscraper and see it torpedo into a ball of flames. Your choice.The grappling hook, amongst other things, is what lift this game up from the pleasant, boring and realistic open-world games. You can use this Godly thing to pretty much survive any situation. Are you falling from insane height? No problem, just hook towards the ground and survive - Or just precipitate your parachute, that works too. It lacks actually physics though, you can't use your hook to decapitate moped drivers for example, a feature that I would want for Just Cause 3!Sure the game is far from being realistic and serious, but with great looks, insanely huge map and more vehicles and weapons than you can count - who cares if it's unrealistic? You can stand on a plane while towing another one mid-air, for God's sake! I completely recommend this title if you are even remotely intersted in action, open-world and/or just plain time-consuming roaming and freedom. There is currently a third-party mod in the works, adding Multiplayer. It adds a whole new meaning to the already balls-chaotic world, and makes it go beyond the edge.Pick this game up, if you have not already! It's been on a billion sales.

*WARNING: The following review contains plot spoilers to a 5-year-old game.*One of the most fun sandbox shooters of our time. Ridiculous action sequences, over-the-top explosions, and lots of angry Pinoy infantry.The Gameplay is split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement.The Story revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.In ConclusionPlay this game:* If you're looking for a fun, light, free-form experience* For the flying mechanics* Because explosions.* For the graphics. Visually, this game is a marvel. Prettiest environments and ambient effects in any game of its generation!Don't play this game:* For the story. So asinine, so childish, so ripped from better sources* For the voice acting. Egregious examples: Bolo Santosi, Tom Sheldon and military radio ops.* If you like a challenge. As a long-time ""casual"" player, I find most missions a breeze right up until the end* For the missions. Where the game really shines is freeform exploration and combat. Clear out a base, will ya!

												Just Cause 2 is one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played, with nearly every piece of this game resonating with me on some level. From the narmy, b-movie aesthetic with stereotypical characters who love nothing more than to chew the scenery and a plot that seems like it was lifted directly out of a James Bond rip-off; to a stunningly beautiful, gargantuan tropical paradise to explore and destroy at my own pace; and finally to the ludicrous over-the-top action that unfolds at every single skirmish, this game left an indelible mark on me that few games have come close to matching.While the game’s story is about as shallow as it comes and lasts for only a handful of hours if you really wanted to push through the story, that’s not where the game’s fun lies; exploring, experimenting, and eradicating all that stands in your way at your own pace is the true joy. The game is absolutely massive; it will be dozens of hours before you even came close to completing a mere half of the map. Unfortunately, you may find this tedious after a while as many of the bases and villages are duplicates of each other. Thankfully, each quadrant of the island has a different aesthetic to it, from the sweltering, arid deserts to the bustling metropolitan areas to the snow-capped mountains to the tropical shores, the nation of Panau seems to have a little bit of everything. This will help to take the tedium out of the game.You will be wanting to spend time on this island, too. I cannot stress how wonderful and truly massive it feels; clocking it at roughly four hundred square miles, Panau is easily the largest world I’ve ever seen in an action video game. And while the visual style is not photorealistic, it does an absurdly exceptional job at creating a sense of scale. When skydiving for the first time, I was breathtaken at how small I felt in relation to the rest of the world.This feeling will never quite go away, even after hundreds of skydives. You will be doing a lot of skydiving; the parachute and grappling hook was my de-facto method of map traversal. It is a ludicrous way to travel in a ludicrous game; the larger-than-life action will be sure to excite. You can creatively destroy all that stands in your way through a combination of traditional weapons and vehicles to some non-traditional gadgets, such as the aforementioned grappling hook and some special secret agent toys to pilot and shoot. Shooting out tires, tethering enemies to moving cars and rockets, C4 detonations, and high-speed car chases where you rapidly negotiate your way around several still moving cars will become the commonplace.While the paper-thin excuse plot and repetitive nature of the game may leave a bad taste in many players’ mouths, I believe that the gorgeous environment and exciting action as well as the ability to set your own pace means that this game has definitely become one of my favorite games of all time.

YouTube™ Video: Just Cause 2 [Game Review] 

			Views: 108		

			My review of the 2010 action open world game ""Just Cause 2"", published by Square Enix and developed by Avalanche Studios.		

Game: Just Cause 2Genre: Open World Third-person ShooterDeveloper: Avalanche StudiosPublisher: Square EnixCopy supplied by SteamJust Cause 2 is an open world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix in 2010. This is the first of many reviews to come about the latest installments of franchises that are coming back in the near future.STORYYou play as Rico Rodriguez, one of the Agency's main operatives, as he is sent to the island of Panau to oust Panay from office, as well as track down and assassinate his old mentor, Tom Sheldon, who the Agency fears has gone rogue after disappearing during the regime change. In order to find Sheldon, Rico allies himself with the three dominant criminal gangs on the island: the Roaches, an organized crime syndicate, the Reapers, an insurgent Socialist militia and the Ular Boys, an ultranationalist rebel group that espouses traditionalism and opposes foreign influence.The story is over-the-top and the dialogue is really cheesy. The story serves only to justify you being a terrorist who destroys power plants, ventilation systems, dams, military bases and many more objects. Save for a few moments in the 7 Story Missions, it is not memorable.GRAPHICSEven though it has been 5 years since the game was first released, it still looks damn great on PC: the island is colourful, the explosions are vibrant, the draw distance is long and the water feels realistic. The only things that have always been the problem with the game are the facial textures and animations. Other than that, you will have a gorgeous experience that will run at 60fps even on a toaster.GAMEPLAYThe goal is to cause as much chaos as you can by destroying military facilities and everything related to that. Right from the get-go you can explore the 400 square miles of Panau, discovering the 368 locations, engaging in high-speed chases by water, plane or car, hijacking enemy vehicles to crash into oil rigs... There is a lot of variety in what you can do and how.The big game changer is the grappling hook, which can be used to gain speed while using your unlimited parachutes, to pull enemies from ledges, to attach a speeding vehicle to the ground so that it flies in the air, to attach an enemy to the ceiling and turning him into a human piñata, and so on. You can also carry three weapons (two sidearms, one big gun) and both grenades and sticky bombs.There is the black market, which can be used to order and upgrade weapons and vehicles, or as a way to fast travel. But I strongly recommend that, because each time that you go from one place to the other, you are bound to find an hidden collectible, a new location, or a new badass vehicle that you hadn't tried already. The side activities that you complete for the gangs are very similar to one another, and usually consist of escorting someone, finding an object in a base or destroying a base or two. There are also races that are varied and very fun to play. The game is a ton of fun, and you won't regret the time you'll spend with it.CHALLENGEThe game tends to be very challenging even on the easiest settings, thanks to strong and numerous enemies that will pursue you, as well as an unforgiving checkpoint system in the missions.SOUNDThe soundtrack is hugely underrated, but really strong and energizing, while the voice acting is one of the cheesiest since the original Resident Evil. But since it seems like they made that on purpose, I'll let it slide.The sound effects are great, with clear distinctions from one gun to the other, and with some hugely satisfying explosions.REPLAYABILITYA huge map, tons of collectibles, multiple missions and 50 Steam achievements are bound to make you play this game for a long time to come, especially if you are waiting for Just Cause 3's release.Overall, this is a phenomenal game to play, with an amazing open world, fluid and varied combat, multiple collectibles, strong soundtrack and beautiful vistas. This is a game that I love, and I strongly recommend buying to everyone who loves action games.

												""It was worth every minute!"" - Rico RodriguezThis open-world game has one simple primary objective: blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. No really it's just blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up topped with the occasional assassinations and fetch quests while 75% of the game really is just blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up in a beautiful coastal environment HOWEWER partially thanks to the unique gameplay gimmick that this game has blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up has never been so fun for me before.(And I also like blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up by default which makes me a maaaaaniac maaaaaniac I♥♥♥♥♥ume.)Add this the fact that this game is really well optimized (hence I can play it on mah potato with even 40 fps) and you've got yourself an explosive experience.P.S.: I can safely say that this is my favorite open-world game as of now.

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the best games I've played this year. It's got tons of action, tons of content, and an excellent (and huge) map to explore. And there's always something to do, be it completing missions for the different factions, doing some challenges, finding collectibles, or simply blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Oh, and it's got a storyline too.It improves a lot from the original game; for starters, the grappling hook is now more versatile, not to mention it's no longer counted as an extra weapon (although it's more effective as one than in the first game!). You can also combine it with the parachute, which gives a new way to move across the map; it might be tricky at first, but once you get to know the hook/parachute combo, you'll be using it a lot. The gunplay feels good as well, and while the driving is tricky at first (especially in cars), once you get used to it, it's very good as well.As for the environment, it's gorgeous. The Panau Islands are pretty varied; from dense jungles, to snowy mountains, river deltas, and even a huge desert! And they all look pretty good; the day and night cycle makes them even more beautiful, as it can create some fantastic  sunsets for you to enjoy. One of my favourite parts of the game was simply flying around in a helicopter doing some sightseeing. Another thing, the map itself is huge. Not only is there variety in environments, as I said, but there's many secrets to find as well, from collectibles, to some pretty cool easter eggs.When it comes to story, well, just like the first game, it's something that you'd expect from a cheesy action movie. Nothing bad, mind you, simply lots of action all over the place. And it's great! Explosions everywhere, gunfights on top of moving cars; it's got everything. And the last mission, in particular, is probably the most over the top action sequence I've ever seen, and it's the best part of the game. Really, you must get there and see it, as I don't want to spoil the fun.The game also has a cool soundtrack. Now, it's not like most open world games where you can listen to a radio station while driving; the soundtrack actually shows up during certain portions of the game, for example, when the military is chasing you, there's a pretty tense soundtrack playing. And the faction themes that play out after taking over a stronghold are also very good. The voice acting, well, it's interesting, for lack of a better word. I'm not sure if that's how accents from South East Asia are supposed to sound or not, but they did feel somewhat unique. And the dialogues from the main characters were also filled with cheesy one liners and such.As I already mentioned earlier, it also offers lots of stuff to do. Besides the main storyline (which is actually somewhat short, if you focus entirely on it), there's settlements to complete by finding collectibles and destroying stuff; there's three factions you can help out, doing missions for them and taking over strongholds; there's different challenges to complete; and, as I said, you can simply take your time and fly around creating some chaos, which, by the way, is essential to unlock storyline missions.Well, I don't know what more to write. All I can say is that I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that, if you get it, you enjoy it as much as I did.			",419,84,9,48,30,5,75

												Ok I've only played 2 hours of this when writing this review, but played 100+ hours of JC2 on ps3 before. This is by far the BEST of all the Just Cause games. It's miles better than JC3 in terms of gameplay, mainly because, unlike in JC3, there is no compulsion to ""do everything"" to complete the story. Simply blowing stuff up and exploring at your own pace gives you so much more freedom than JC3 where it feels a lot more mechanical, with its ""do mission, liberate settlements, do another mission, rinse and repeat ad nauseum."" Yes, the voice acting and story in JC2 is utter tripe, but you don't get this game for that. You get JC2 because it is, frankly, an absolute joy to play.My only real problem is the confusing layout for controls, especially for flying vehicles like helicopters and planes, but apart from that this game is awesome.It runs on windows 10, and if it crashes at all for you, disable decals on the advanced display settings and that should fix it!

												Just Cause 2 is published in the year 2010 by the Eidos Interactive and it's the direct Sequel to Just Cause.Like it's Prequel,Just Cause 2 is an Open-World 3rd-Person-Shooter/Action Game.This is going to be a List of Pro's and Contra's about the second Game.Before i start,i highly recommend an XBOX-Controller! It fixes all Stearing Issues,even planes are awesome to play with it!!!Pro:-The Game has a HUGE(1000 square kilometres),beautiful and open Map.-The Story isn't innovative,but pretty funny and well made.-The Main Character is a cool,badass Agent who's always up for a Joke(ALWAYS!)!-There are tons of different Vehicles,from boats to cars,from helicopters to airplanes!-The controls are really easy to learn,after 10 minutes everybody should be able to play like an expert!-You can have it for 15€(About 20 Dollars!),and EVERYBODY has do admit that this is a hell of a low price!-You can waste hours just by running over the map and don't even start the Story(except for the first 2 Missions)-The Plane/Helicopter controls are awesome(except for the Si-47 Leopard Fighter Jet!)Contra:-The car/bycicle controls are not really good,only a few vehicles have good controls!-The Missions get boring after a while because they are always the same.So these were all the Points i had to say about the Game,and in my Opinion,it is definitely a Game everybody should own or at least had played it once!It is really fun,and it doesnt gets boring even after reaching 100% because of the huge Mod Community!I hope i could help you Guys with this Review!

												The voice acting is terrible and there is barely any story to it. But that is not why this game got a high rating and why it's highly recommended. The highlight of this game is the gameplay obviously. Your grapple hook and parachute get you anywhere at high speeds; you got an entire island to explore and the main goal of this game is to blow things up and cause chaos. As you progress you earn parts and money which you can use to upgrade weapons and grenades which really help you since they don't do much in the beginning. I haven't finished the story but that's my view so far...they explain...diddly squat. But it's still worth every penny since it really is one of the best games. Buy it!			",161,10,5,12,4,0,5

												From the first mission I fell in love with Just Cause 2. I didnt play the first game and did expect a solid GTA clone in a Jungle/Tropical enviroment. The grappling hook however gives this game a rather unique gameplay. You can do a lot of crazy completly unrealistic stunts on land, sea and midair. After a while you realize that the missions are rather generic and one mission plays very much like the previous missions. However there is so much to explore, so many stunts to pull off and so many ways of killing the bad guys that you canget many hours of fun for small money. A definitve must buy if you can forgive the sometimes repetitive gameplay.			",142,45,8,13,11,4,22

												The story and voice acting is tripe, but answer me this ... what other free roaming sandbox game allows you to skyjack a military jet and surf on the nose cone?  Just Cause 2 is a beautiful, fun and surprisingly well optimized rampage through a massive world that easily puts even MMORPGs to shame.  You can go anywhere, steal anything and the destruction of both property and watching a car you just tethered to a windmill as it tumbles through the air is beefy and satisfying.  The grappling hook in the game is easily the best tool in gaming since HL2's Gravity Gun, if not better.  It aids in traversing terrain easily, providing a ride when combined with your unlimited stunt parachute, or in combat with clever, hilarious ways using classic grappling, or tethering two things together, including people.  I highly recommend this game for its fun and destructive escapism, but if you're the type of person who can't enjoy a game without realism, you'd better just continue being boring.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 IT'S GOOD You, agent Rico Rodriguez, have the task to find and kill your old friend and mentor. He's missing in the island paradise Panau. To find him, destroy as much as you can. (Don't as me why. I understand it neighter)Just Cause 2 you're a nice open world game with awesome action, sounds and visual effects - but you are not a story game!++ BIG OPEN WORLD (more than 300 places to discover)++ fast travel++ nice vehicle variation (cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, jets...)++ very good sound++ the explosions are really breathtaking+ many challenges, group missions or objects to find+ lots of funny moments+ no hard achievements+ MULTIPLAYER - could be funny with friends (didn't played it yet)+ Just Cause+ You are like Spiderman with your hook+ It will take some time to complete all achievements (~ 40-50 hours)- 7 main missions? C'mon! That's nothing!- you don't play this game for the story, don't forget it!- short playtime for the main missions - 8 to 10 hours if you rush- AI enemies are easy to beat- some of the controls are...sh*t- I don't like Spiderman If you look for a very wide open world with a huge variety of weapons and vehicles - This is your game! You don't play Just Cause 2 for the story - you play it for the explosions and the really big world. If you can get it in a sale you can't make something wrong!I like you, Just Cause 2 - 8/10 ",134,14,3,25,19,0,28

												SO much fun. Just Cause 2 is the definitive throw-things-down-a-mountain simulator.I originally bought JC2 at full retail price on Xbox 360 after playing the demo for around 4 hours. It is one of the few games from recent memory that left me with no regrets of paying full price. The open world sandbox is mind blowingly massive and the amount of things to blow up is just mental. Combine that with the crazy gravity defying grappling hook+parachute traveling mechanics and not only is it a vast world but it’s enjoyable to traverse.I purchased the PC version solely for mods (infinite grappling hooks, multiplayer, etc.) and while I certainly wouldn’t drop another 60 bucks on it, the upgrade in hardware plus the ability to mod the game made the purchase well worth while.

												Just Cause 2 is like an exciting trip to a foreign country. You never know what to expect from the locales , or if the stuff you are currently eating includes 1 or more domestic animals inside it. Story:The Game has you starring as Rico, formerly known as ""Scorpio"", an buff, stereotypical white latino.Your job is being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the self aclaimed new president ""Panay"", which is trying to distance panau, the island you play on, from the western world. He's doing that by the obvious way. Establishing his own dominance via painting every single combustable/explosive in his signature colours. Red and white. Why that is important ? You wont ask me again when you have already read this review further. Your Job is trying to ""Liberate"" Panau for 'murica'.Doing that is quite easy. Blowning up gas containers, facilities, military bases, all nice stuff.Gameplay:As you can guess, the game doesnt take itself too serious, however, this might not be as much of an flaw, as you might imagine in the first place. Did I mention that Rico has a Grappling hook ? No ? Well, in the context of the ""serious"" plot, Scorpio has this weird♥♥♥♥♥thingy, that allows him to do ridiculous stuff, like attaching two enemies onto each other , and giggle at their frustration, as they get smashed against each other, trying to get the hook loose, that is piercing through their flesh. Sounds like fun, now doesnt it, you jerk ? Well, to be honest, it is. It's a blast. Using the grapling hook to pull yourself onto vehicles, get around, or just do the before mentioned with cars, planes, boats..you get the Idea. On top of it all, you get  the most reliable parachute in the world. Using it in combination with your personal zipping device, you can fly through the air to get to new places, extent your life by a few more seconds, or dodge great threats all together.  As for the goal of the game, your job is to cause chaos. You do that via the before mentioned blowing up of important infrastructures, that are all conveniently marked by Panays Signature colours. By doing that, you will unlock more Items for the so called Black market. A mysterious delivery service, that is run by the "" Sloth demon"", and delivers everything you could ask for in a game like this, like cars, weapons,planes  aswell as extracting you too any previously discovered location. With the right amount of chaos, you will constantly unlock new stuff to buy there, and  if you're lucky enough to dfin new vehicle/ weapon parts on your journey, you can even go as far as upgrading the Items you buy from him. Havent I told you, how much this abscense of a real story brightens up the game ? See ? Awesome.I sincerely wish that there were more games like this.Graphics and PC performance, mods, and tweaking:Just cause 2 is an relatively old game, as you might have guessed already.That however doesnt keep it from having a solid technical build quality. The environment look nice, especially in places with a lot of fauna, Ricos clothing is very detailed, and nothing clips through him (*Cough* Assassins Creed*Cough*) , and the draw distance is very nice.Surprisingly enough, the water is looking awesome, if you have an corresponding Nvidia Card. I sugest atleast having an GTX 280, because it´s rendered via cuda cores, but it runs just as well on AMd cards of the same quality. For a DirectX 10 Game, the lighting is very beatiful, and eyecandy such as Godrays enhances the overall experience.Panau is very detailed, and optic fidelity can be found everywhere. from the harsh mountain tops, that are covered in snow, to the green jungle,small villages, and deserts, the game looks absolutely gorgeous.It´s colourful, cramped with detail, and fun to play in.As for the mod side of things, you can find a lot of interesting stuff besides all the cheats, vehicle, and weapon mods. Guessing that your PC is fast enough, I would sugest to Use Sweet FX, if I were you. Sweet Fx is a mod, which allows modern Anti Aliasing technologies, such as FXAA, and SGSSAA, to be forced into a game, which doesnt natively support said options. It also can be tweaked to your liking , and there are many user created presets for it, which enhance saturation, contrast, and overall optical Fidelity a lot.Speaking of optical enhancers, how well does the game actually run ? To be honest, it runs like a charm. my GTX470 always can keep up smooth 60 Frames per second, while having sweet FX, and the ingame MSAA to work with.there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t frame cap, no forced Vsync, a nice Field of view, and advanced graphical options, to tweak the game to your liking.Conclusion:Just Cause 2 delivers what it promises. Action without any compromises. It isnt held back by its serious plot, social commentary, or anything similar to those dfancy♥♥♥♥♥triple A Titles you always hear about. It´s just pure fun with an Story construct build beneath it. Did I even mention the multiplayer mod ? So far, all i can say is that I am really enjoying this game.It was definitely worth every cent I spend on it, and I can only give my recommendation for it to you. If you enjoy mindless action, hilarious situations, and all out rampages, then this game is for you. buy it.9.5/10 for racist Asian accents.			",64,1,1,3,2,1,0

												Have played the game for all 4 years of its release across 3 platforms. I've never gotten 100% save. Says pretty much all you need to know. This game is a masterpiece, a masterpiece that takes more time to complete than the Mona Lisa took to paint. Collectibles are harder to find than an athiest in Saudi Arabia and Fuel Tanks are about as scarce as Conservative media outlets on the internet. 12/Bolo Santosi, Leader of the Revolutionary Army known as the Reapers would complete Oil Rigs again.

												One of my favourite free roaming sandbox games.If Far Cry 2 and GTA IV had a baby with glorious five-o-clock shadow it would be this game.So much to do, hundereds of locations to discover and conquer, thousands of things to blow up with your extensive arsenal of weapons and vehicles (Land, Water, Air, but no Fire 0/10 would not bend)Multiplayer is pretty fun, but I honestly have put around 45 minutes into it.Controls can be a little wonky if you're used to third-person games on console (like me)Overall I'd give it 9/10 because the voice acting isn't really my cup of tea and some things can get a little repetitive.

												I just finished playing Just Cause 3 and realized that I never wrote a review for this awesome game.Even though this game is 6 years old now, it has held up incredibly well. The graphics, while not anything special by modern standards, are still decent and the draw distances is still much better than 99% of the other games out there. The gameplay is still solid and plenty of fun.What really keeps drawing me back to this game time and again is the world. The map is absolutely gigantic by the standards of any game not using procedural map generation, and because it was hand built it is chock full of interesting content just inviting you to get out and explore (and cause random chaos while you're at it).Sure this game isn't perfect, the vehicle handling is pretty poor, the AI isn't anything special, the black market system has some issues (finite resources in game being the biggest one), chaos objects aren't shown on that map which makes finding the last one or two chaos objects extremely frustrating at times, and the story is barely passable (although it has some pretty epic set pieces), but these issues are forgivable since this game is simply so much fun to play, especially with the free multiplayer mod.Given how cheap this game is now and how much fun it still is (I consider it to be superior to JC3 in that regard), it is extremely easy to recommend.

												I love this game with a passion. Ignore the hours on my record, I played this game for hundreds more on the PS3.Why do I love it you may ask? Let me tell you a story of something that happened completely dynamically, as well as a pros and cons review of Michael Bay's Wet Dream: The Video Game~~~I had just purchased a rocket launcher that could fire four rockets at once from the black market. With this i decided to have a bit of fun. I was parachuting along when i saw a gas station, which i promptly blew up. The military then sent two squad cars and a man on a mortorcylce. I hopped on top of one care where a man was hanging out of the side shooting at me. I shot a grappling hook into his chest and tethered him to the other car where he was dragged along and ran over by a taxi cab. I rode on top of this car, shooting at the other car when i leaped onto the miltary motorcylce that was following us, tossing the soldier onto the ground so he could get run over by one of his fellow soldiers. I rode this away until i reached a four way intersection where i set several cars around, making my base. Everytime a car drove towards me i'd blow it up with the rocket launcher. This went on until I heard a radio signal saying ""We are dropping like flies! Send air support!"",  which is when I knew that the fun was only beginning. I grappled onto the first helicopter i saw, with a man hanging off of the side and shooting at me. I shot him in the face then threw the driver out onto the ground. I then began attacking their other helicopters with my own. This was only the beginning.Another two helicopters showed up, these ones with heat seaking missiles. I was shot down and parachuted into a nearby jungle. A couple men on motorcycles chased me into the forest where i was riding a bike of my own, zig-zagging through the trees. This chase continued until we reached a cliff. I drove off the cliff and gracefully leaped off of the flaming bike and soared through the air. I landed on a nearby highway where some rebels were attacking more miltary. I ran up to join in the fight when i got shot with a shotgun once, killing me and ending my run. tl;dr I was badass.~~~PROS: +Beautiful asthetically speaking.+COLOSSAL map.+Fun, action packed gameplay. +Cheesy and hilarious(ly bad) dialogue (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Cheesy story (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Lots of easter eggs.  (Including the entire island from ""LOST"") CONS:-Short Campaign.-""AH HE GOT ME WITH HIS WIRE TING!""			",54,11,0,11,13,1,6

Product received for free
												IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Just Cause 2""The same way I found out about a lot of games, from YouTube. I randomly came across a video that was showing someone driving a vehicle off of a tall snowy mountain. The crash and destruction effects made me fall in love. See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game. Unfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better. Second, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good. Third, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away. Review Of ""Just Cause 2""Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them. The world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places. You can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds. You can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.This isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion. As for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said. Don't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for.Content In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside ""side missions"". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types. Other then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc. To gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau. Pro's:+Massive open world.+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.+Fun destruction system.+Addicting ""I must find everything"" style.+DLC is not required to play.+Nice variety of vehicles.Con's:-Mod needed for full completion.-Enemy will spam helicopters.-Mostly boring empty world. -Strange vehicle mechanics.-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.Overall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			",90,4,2,2,8,0,3

												I've played Just Cause 2 originally on xbox 360 and put more than 20+ hours into it. Panau is a big beautiful island with lots to see and as Rico AKA The Scorpio as your tour guide. Rico is a mercenary looking for someone on the island and is drafted to help local gangs reign chaos in an attempt to complete his own personal mission.Just Cause 2 follows somewhat of a GTA game play scheme. Notable differences include driving and the obvious attachment of a hook shot / grapple. This grapple is what makes Just Cause, Just Cause. This thing can literally attach to anything within a certain distance. This includes automobiles, helicopters, buildings, boats, trees, mountains and literally anything you can think of. Upon grappling onto a car, Rico can perform ""stunt jumps"" in which he is able to maneuver himself on and around the car. This comes handy in case you are being fired at and need some extra cover. When attaching oneself to a helicopter, Rico can chill underneath or just like a car, attempt to hijack it. There are a few QTE (quick time events) that need to be performed in order to successfully high jack any moving vehicle. You can also grapple enemies if you're really feeling it. Alternatively, Rico can attach his grapple to two objects. Say you want to shoot at an explode-able object but it's not quite close enough to the enemies. Rico can shoot his grapple at the barrel and then attach it nearby or on the enemy. Once the barrel is shot and starts flying, the grapple will pull it towards the enemy. It's an extremely cool feature but with a few flaws. If you're trying to get cars that pass by to run into it, it doesn't really work. For one reason or another the game made it so you cannot simply have people running into the grapple. What you may do though is use it against cars or helicopters. Being chased? Not a problem. Attach to the car then attach to the road or any tree that's nearby and watch them flip. Driving is sort of it's own unique thing in the game. When the car is flipping over multiple times I like how they did that effect, but I do not like how they made the driving scheme. It seems a little stiff and controls sometimes don't react as you want them to. Shooting is quite basic in the game and auto-targeting seems welcomed.You may zoom in while shooting and even dual wield certain weapons. Weapons can be swapped for different weapons and three slots are available to fill up. Smaller automatics and pistols can swapped out for one another (one slot). Bigger shotguns or automatics can be switched (second slot). The third slot consists of grenades or C4 (both which can be carried at the same time). Shooting is decently fun but can get old. You can crouch and roll to evade fire from enemies but there is no real cover system. It would have been nice if they added something like Gears of Wars has in regards to taking cover. What is notable in this game is that lots can be blown up. Sadly, it's not on a Mercenaries 2 : world in flames sort of demolition (which I think to this date is still the best) but JC2 still has it's moments. There is fun in mindless violence of blowing entire enemy bases up (from radio towers, electrical stations, gas tanks, enemy vehicles and towers). What you can do damage to is sort of limited. In Mercenaries 2 you could blow up an entire oil rig. In JC2, that oil rig has only certain aspects you can take out. Whether this is good or bad is determined by you. By pressing down on the D-pad you may call up ""the sloth demon"" aka your personal distributor of weapons, vehicles and extraction if needed. They really gave the player a chance to enjoy a wide variety on their menu but most unlock only after a certain amount of progress has been made (be it collecting crates, completing missions or blowing government equipment up). Anything here also costs a pretty penny!The game is known for it's beautiful graphics especially demonstrating the beauty of being able to encapsulate the entire island in the background. Even though it's not the next gen sort of graphics, it still provides for an enjoyable sight to see. The display for the weapon meters are excellently done. Even though you may run out of ammo a lot, you'll know exactly how much you have left.  Sounds are varied (explosions are finally sounding different) and comments are made by either Rico, enemies and even civilians. They organized the map in a way that is extremely easy to figure out where you are and where you want to go. They were even kind enough to indicate where potential hidden locations could be. Overall, a fantastic game. Even with a few minor flaws the gamer is sure to enjoy Just Cause 2.RATING : 7.9/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BWould have been 8 if they fixed a few grappling issues. Not only that, if you hit a civilian full throttle in a truck they won't fall off their bike. They just bounce away in the air. Kinda weird ain't it?ScreenShots Do you like helicopters Be quick on your toes when the QTE's turn up Do you like fighter planes This is actually a lot funner than it looks Do you like commercial airliners that is on fire ",195,9,17,10,23,2,18

												Just Cause 2 is an incredibly big open world game, where you try to help the American government to change the dictator from having all the power and to stop opressing his people. To do that, you are helped by the ""agency"", the secret service you belong to and three different rebellion factions. They all give you missions that consist most of the times in destroying huge military facilities. You can drive every single vehicle in the game and shoot pretty much every imaginable weapon. You also have a complete freedom on how to do the missions, although I don't think you can do them stealthy, I never tried, but if you buy this game you won't want to sneak around anyways.The huge island the game takes place on is called Panau and you have every imaginable landscape on it. There is a desert, mountains, woods etc... All of these landscapes are accessable with the unique gadjet given to you: the graplehook. It allows you to climb and get wherever you want and is a great solution for such a complete game.The best feature of the game however, is the multiplayer. It is completely free and you can do tons of cool stuff with your friends in there. Did I mention that it is free?So if you like open world games, explosions, great open world multiplayer explosions and tanks and jets and explosions...BUY THE GAME!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is best at what it does not point you to, sure there will be some marker to a miscellaneous copy and paste faction mission, promising you black market items and another mission but what makes this game shine is it's ludicrously glorious destruction that it allows you to partake in, this game will leave you to hours of falling, driving and shooting to such a level of freedom and accessability that it is a no brainer to buy this. seriously, buy it you sadist. As mentined before the missions themselves are very rarely enjoyable and fall flat half of the time, however the main storyline agency missions do have their moments.			",90,2,1,5,6,0,7

												Nice alternative to GTA IV and its more realistic approach. This is B-movie over the top action and plot. Story is awful, but the grappling hook is one of the most fun weapons there is in a sandbox game. Highly recommend buying the aerial pack as well with the parachute thrusters. Must have tool for the game IMO. PC version is way better of course due to mods and the ability to use many more grappling lines unlike the consoles which only allow one.This game is a blast and you will be very happy you bought it as a sandbox fan. I have owned this on both PS3 and the PC and love it to death. Anytime you want some mindless destruction, or to fly around without the use of a vehicle, just a parchute and a grappling hook this game will deliver.			",554,280,18,56,35,8,38

												A nice little timewaster for a couple of hours and then you'll never pick it up again.I'm not very familiar with this series but as a fan of the sandbox genre I was immediately hooked by the fun gameplay and appealing graphics. It's incredibly appealing to just mess around, cause havoc and experiment with the various gameplay mechanics but the initial enjoyment doesn't last long. As you start to discover the impressively sized island with various vehicles and gadgets it quickly dawns on you that the developers went for quantity over quality here. Every design element and situation is repeated ad nauseam and there is no variety to the environments which is of course due to the nature of the game world being set in a fictional asian setting (that admittedly made me want to go on vacation in thailand and cambodia again) but I have to ask myself the question why the developers didn't choose a more intriguing setting with variety. Perhaps the idea was to get away from the genre-defining GTA series; but nowadays sandbox games have generally gone far beyond GTA clones and are rightfully recognized as a genre of its own, so much so even GTA-clones as the first Saints Row develop a completely unique identity as they progress.The main problem with all the gadgets and functions in Just Cause 2 is that they are all introduced at the beginning of the game and while they are a lot of fun and give the game a unique flavour there isn't anything left to discover after the first hour or two. Surprised enjoyment followed by sobering grinding.The storyline department is also severely lacking, not that these games are usually poetic masterpieces but I can't even remember a single character, as in what is their name and character. I have no investment in short-haired action man with hookshot and thus didn't continue playing once the novelty wore off. The game is too self-aware for its own good ( not self-aware funny like Saints Row alas): nameless person in nameless setting against nameless antagonists. They have names but it never matters for a second; despite the beautiful visuals you never feel like you are traversing a real world, and even a cartoonishly over the top world can feel credible/plausible if it's internally consistent and has proper world building to draw you in. This felt more like a licensed game of one of those god-awful expendables movies.In that sense Just Cause is the epitome of a sandbox, you get nothing out of it that you don't bring yourself and you have to figure out your own way to have fun, namely smashing things together. Which is fine I guess but it comes off more like the developers couldn't be asked to do that themselves. They clearly have the skills to make all the mechanics of a sandbox game work but they don't add anything to it.If you can get this one on sale, you're gonna have fun for a little while but don't expect a memorable experience, Just Cause 2 is a distraction more than an experience.

												Lately I really like open world games, aswell as this one. You're free to do whatever you want, and this is all about causing chaos ! What do you want more ? I'm going for 100 % in this game and maybe all the achievements - but yeah; this game is pure fun, cause chaos, kill those damn cops - seriously, I've never hated cops so much like in this game. Don't forget the grapple is the funniest thing: have a wrecking ball, play piñata, go/fly anywhere you want, attach someone to your car/helicopter and fly/drive around with someone and much, much, much more !Next to that you have unlimited parachutes and last but not least the map is f*cking huge = more fun !The main story is a bit short and if you complete it you have around 25 % game completion but ... enough time to do more stuff and to reach that 100 % game completion !PS: I want a grapple hook in real life.

												A just cause of 'just because'.One of the classical overly-explosive action games, this game is a great throwback to the old 80's Rambo-esque movies and mixes traditional third person destruction derby with open world (group of islands) adventure. A tropical GTA of sorts. The basic gameplay consists of destroying evil goverment's property, i.e. water and fuel supplies in random villages, races with every medium possible and both storyline and faction quests. As mentioned earlier, this game embraces the goofy righteousness and lets you wreak havoc upon both the goverment and its civilians with little difference.Technically this game is a port from original PS3 game, but from my experience it runs great. Even on my laptop I had stable performance on lower graphical settings and the game looks still fantastic for a game of its age (in my mind that's yesterday). The positive points of this game lie in it's great map design, freedom of gameplay done right (main story is there to create atmosphere and not to restrict features) and a certain kind of 'comfyness' if you're weird enough to get nostalgic about games of this era. (I could also talk about personal experiences I have when this game came out and I played a ton of it w/ my friend but buzzwords are way cooler.) I think Just Cause 2 does what it does so well that I'm probably never going to buy another game that tries to accomplish the same. (For me this is a big deal, especially since the third part of the series just came out)There aren't much negative stuff for me to say. The game has it's bugs and flaws, but for me it would be such a nitpick on stuff that didn't affect my experience. The world is so huge and detailed that finding incomplete pieces feels more like an easter egg than letdown. It does what it promises well, but for people who want a more sensible plot and structural gameplay this might be a short experience.			",76,12,2,5,4,1,8

												a very well thought out game. what surprised me the most is that the graphics for such an old game are absolutely stunning. physics are good, car controls are amazing, plane controls are pretty good when get used to. everything about this game is awesome. tons of things to do. so far my favorite singleplayer game. not much bugs. the game did start to crash on me after 10hrs but i fixed it by turning off ""decals"" in the settings and havent got crashes ever since. overall i recommend. got the game for 3$ during a sale and is worth every penny.

For new buyers, the game is bugged and you cant actually get 100% without a mod.  Overall fun game, good missions, but terrible driving physics.  Flying on the other hand is a blast.

												First of all, this game is my favorite of all time and I've played about over 250 hours of it and I still play it. This is a very good game, definitely worth it price. You have complete freedom over what you want to do, when you want to. The story was too short, the plot was terrible, and the voice acting was atrocious. You must also know that THIS IS A SANDBOX GAME. You make your own fun, and if you're creative enough, you'll love this game. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Fun factor: 10/10 Badassness: 10/10. Overall: 100000/10. I mean 10/10.[UPDATE]Yeah... This was the first review I wrote, and I've noticed how it lacks a few details.So here I go.The story in this game is short, and not too entertaining. Most gamers will tell you that the story is terrible, but it's actually not too bad, even if it IS very repetitive.The thing with this game is the free roam open world gameplay. It has a feel of freedom like no other games ever. The ""grappling hook+parachute"" combo is terrific if you want to move quickly and easily. You can drive cars, boats, planes, helicopter, jets. You can grapple a statue head to an attack chopper, pilot the chopper, blow up a few fuel shafts on the run, drop the statue head on a car, aim the chopper to a tower, eject from the chopper, watch it blow the crap up, parachute down to the ground, pick up a RPG, blow the crap out of every car, plane, chopper, whatever, grapple to a car, go full speed on the highway until you reach a ramp, jump up to the sky, eject from the car, grapple to a plane, get the pilot out of his seat, take over with a grand ending with a beautiful sunset over Panau Island.

												Ever wanted to play a game simulating the day to day life of Michael Bay? You've come to the right place.Positive Explosions. A lot of explosions. Huge open world, filled with stuff to collect and things to do. Perfectionists will have a field day trying to 100% it. There's an officially supported multiplayer mod available for this game, with an ample amount of daily players. Give it a try; it's absolute chaos, especailly in the airports. Satisfying gunplay with a decent selection of weapons and tools at your disposal. The grappling hook is the best thing ever. You'll never want to even drive a car because it's so fun to traverse using it, especially when combined with the parachute. Great graphics, especially for 2010. You get to be a badass action hero, jumping across cars and hanging off the edge of jets a few thousand feet up in the air.Negative Can be buggy and unstable at times. Car handling could be improved. Could experience some mild FPS drops if a lot of stuff is happening.This game is well worth a purchase.			",214,28,3,13,17,4,15

												A fun game that is worth getting while on-sale. It kinda is like the GTA series, but the world isn't exactly as big as in the Grand Theft Auto games. The car movement can be a bit weird in the beginning, if you are used to games like GTA. The missions are okay, and so is the gameplay. You can get creative and do a lot of fun stuff with the 'wire thing' that you have . Then there comes the multiplayer. You can have a great time if you have some friends to play this with.  The game requirements aren't really that big, but the graphics aren't bad.All in all, this is a game that is totally worth picking up on sale, and if you'll also get some of your friends to get it, you're gonna have some fun!

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the most eye catching action sandboxes going; thrust into the large sandbox of Panau by parachute you are the stereotypical CIA one man wonder weapon which will tame the hostile regieme for good old uncle sam. But in honesty you do not buy Just Cause 2 for its depth, but rather for the action, the carnage, the pretty explosions, and the pleasant vistas of Panau itself. In many respects Just Cause 2 builds on the premise of Mercenaries and Mercenaries 2; joinable factions, main story missions, side missions, supply drops, vehicle drops, weapon upgrades and the ever present regieme installations, bases, airfields and towns that can be taken one at a time. Either going in solo or working for the various opposition factions does make you feel like you are toppling the regieme one satisfying step at a time. Also be pleasantly surprised by excellent frames per second on the highest of graphics settings; one of the most visually stunning yet stable platforms made for the PC.			",160,6,2,17,23,1,55

												One of my favorite games! I have finished that game like 5 times but never had a change to get original, now I finally got it and I feel like I'm the happiest guy in Steam :DAlso Just Cause 2 Multiplayer is awesome, it feels like playing a GTA Online! If you like action then it's a must have game, highly recommend :)			",99,11,5,3,7,2,5

												I almost didn't play Just Cause 2. Twice. The first time was before buying it. I hesitated because of how huge everyone made the game world seem. The impression I got was that there was more to do here than every Elder Scrolls combined. And I didn't want to make that kind of a time commitment. But when it went on sale it was too cheap to pass up.After intsalling and trying to start the game is when I almost gave up a second time. I couldn't get the game to run for more than about 5 mintues without crashing. That meant I would race desperately to get to the next checkpoint before the game crashed. I couldn't pause or explore or do anything but rush blindly ahead. Even on normal you can't do that without dying though. So I gave up for a while and played some other games, hoping for a patch or some explanation.Eventually, months later I tried again, but the game hadn't been patched and probably wasn't ever going to be. So I researched some fixes. Nothing seemed to work. The two biggest recommendations were to run in Windows 7 compatability mode and to turn off decals. Neither worked. BUT I got lucky and just decided on a whim to do both at the same time. The first time the game ran for 15 minutes without crashing I almost cried. Then I made it to an hour. More. So luckily, that combination fixed it for me. But the real shame of this game is that I almost missed it entirely because of such a horrible beginning experience and having to manually change things to get it to even run.Once it did run though, it was an awesom experience. In a word: fun. And really just plain, simple, fun. The first two tutorial-heavy story missions are actually a bad opening to the game, even though they introduce all the necessary concepts. They're too linear. Too narrow. The best part about Just Cause is how open and free and spontaneous the world is. The story missions largely lack all of that. The controls also took some getting used to. Having dodge be tab - an awkward button to hit repeatedly - and aim be C - something I've never encountered before - threw me for a while. Eventually I did get used to the controls though and I couldn't find a mapping I liked more than the default one. There's just a learning curve and you have to power through it.In the open world and used to the controls, the game shines. Largely because there is a lot to do, but you don't even have to do any of it. I spent my first 10 hours or so just exploring and causing chaos and searching for items. And it was addictive. And fun!Then I moved on to the races. I didn't expect them to be good, but with only a few exceptions (i.e. plane flights through cities and driving on snow) I found the racing to be insanely well executed. I looked forward to completing all of them and beat all 75 even though I didn't have to.The faction missions are also fun, although I realized that the shorter they were, generally the better. Just Cause seems to be meant for bite-sized play, with a short rise and fall of action. The longer missions, whether story related or not, were where the game suffered.And the story itself is terrible. The writing, voice acting, all horendous. There are as many accents as there are voice actors, and most of them don't sound like any kind of real accent at all. It's quite jarring until you get used to it. But in some ways this actually works in the game's favor, because it reminds you not to take it seriously.So if you want a third person action game akin to GTA but even bigger and less serious (though maybe a bit less absurd than something like Saints Row) Just Cause is the place to get it.

Granted it's certainly a lot of mindless fun, but the exploration and upgrades add just enough substance to keep you playing. And besides, sometimes mindless fun is just what you need.

												Graphics are impressive for how well the game runs, as it can easily run on mid-tier systems.The gameplay is very fluid, featuring a run-and-gun system like Saint's Row, but with a lot of freedom for movement with the almighty grapple (and accompanying parachute). The map at times feels almost TOO big for the amount of content availible on it. Driving cars, just like Saint's Row 4, is horrible in terms of feel, but thankfully there's almost no reason to have to drive a car. Voice-acting is really horrible in terms of believability but is alright in terms of fidelity. The story is pretty empty and gives you no incentive to really play it for the sake of the storyline. The value of this game has greatly increased since the multiplayer mod is availible on Steam.TLDR; Good gameplay, Bad storyline/VA.The DLC is garbage and I wouldn't recommend that anyone gets it.The base game is like $2.99 when it goes on sale, so it's definitely worth it then.

												Just Cause 2 may not be my favorite out of the games that reside in my library, that title is reserved for The Binding of Isaac. However, I can say with 100% confidence that it is the most fun open-world game I have ever played in my entire life. Just Cause 2 holds this high honor on my personal favorites list for a number of reasons:1. Just Cause 2's world is breathtakingly beautiful. In my opinion, this makes it superior to any of the Grand Theft Auto game worlds, as they are gritty and urban, while the fictional Asian island of Panau is filled with lush tropical landscapes, barren deserts, and even snow-covered mountains.2. Just Cause 2's selection of vehicles is extremely eclectic, and all of the cars, boats, planes, motorcycles and helicopters are insanely fun to use. My personal favorite is the DLC addon ""Tuk-Tuk Boom-Boom."" 3. Just Cause 2's selection of weapons is also extremely eclectic and each weapon is fun to use. Tearing apart the Panauan military (and helpless civilians) is ceaselessly satisfying and feels like playing a zany action movie akin to Machete or even Tropic Thunder.4. Just Cause 2's missions are reliably fun. Some of them may be somewhat generic, but each one is worth playing in its own right. On top of the main story missions, there are three criminal factions to do dirty work for in the form of ""Faction Missions.""5. Just Cause 2 has extreme replayability, as it's fun to hop into just to cause destruction and have fun, with the varying map locations to tear apart (over 300 scattered across the massive map).6. Just Cause 2's modding community is absolutely amazing, offering new character skins, extra weapons and vehicles, and fun cheats. My personal favorite mods are the Extreme Heat mod, which makes the military much more formidible and erratic, and the Insane Civilian Mod, which causes the civillian NPCs to mimic the actions of the military, creating widespread chaos.My personal score for Just Cause 2 is 9.75/10. It's a fantastic gaming experience for even more reasons than I've listed, and I strongly encourage everyone with access to M-rated games to play it.Posted: April 23.			",167,25,5,11,8,2,8

												I kind of hated  and found the game frustrating at first, especially the annoying 2nd mission with the car surfing, but once you get past that it starts to get a little better and becomes quite fun and addicitive, can't stop playing even though it gets  repetitive and sometimes feels tedious with terrible voice acting, terrible story, no depth. Game would crash often until I turned off decals and blur. But still game crashes at least once or twice a play session.Sure you can purchase vehicles, but it seems like a waste of money, I bought a plane having never flown one yet and not even being sure of the controls, ended up crashing it into the ocean, so goodbye to 60k and  if you die you lose them as well, if they blow up they are gone for good. I hate how you can't store purchased vehicles anywhere. I've played other games where you can save your vehicles in a garage even if they blow up. I just don't bother buying vehicles.The environment is beautiful and detailed, I love exploring it and diving underwater just because the water looks so nice.I like creating chaos and trying to complete all achievements.I'd rate it 7/10. Worth getting on special like I did.			",74,18,0,13,12,1,2

												There really isn't much I need to say about this game. I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting. No restrictions, no linear story crap (unless you REALLY want to, and even then it's pretty damn open), just good old fashioned fun.			",280,35,7,24,85,3,94

												Imagine an open world bigger than GTA V's Los Santos. Then picture a man grappling to every building in sight and swooping above people's heads with his parachute, shooting them from above and just generally causing a whole lot of paperwork for the government. That's the basic premise of this game.The goal of Just Cause 2 is to basically cause as much chaos as you can in order to overthrow the government of a small island called Panau. The game has a main story and a whole lot of side missions, but it takes so long to get from one story mission to the next you basically forget what the story's about. But who cares when you can obliterate everything in sight? Certainly not me.If you like large open worlds and Michael Bay-style action, this game is for you.			",51,2,0,3,4,0,1

												Just Cause 2 is all you could want in an open world island adventure. You star as Rico Rodriguez, a man with the task of assassinating his former mentor who has turned crazy. Along the way you will meet several groups of revolutionary armies, such as the Reapers and the Ular Boys, who will send you on missions to hack military bases, takeover strongholds or assassinate colonels. The game is fast-paced and action packed. The main highlights of the game I found were the grappling hook and parachute. Rico is equipped with these from the get-go, and aiming at a certain spot on the ground with the grapple will send you flying off into that direction. Together with the easily deployable parachute, you hardly need cars to travel around the island of Panau.A minor downside to this game is the loading times. You will be left waiting awhile before entering the world, but is all worth it once in. One feature that is very helpful is the addition of the Black Market. Call for a chopper if you need weapons, vehicles or need to be flown to any previously discovered location (very helpful for Stronghold Takeovers). There are not an excessive amount of weapons in the game, ranging from the light and common pistol and submachine gun, to more powerful guns like shotguns and detached mounted guns (with insanely helpful infinite ammunition).There are also a large array of vehicles available to steal and hijack, from the cheap rusty Tuk-Tuk all the way up to the Chevalier 999. You can also find tanks, fully loaded with unlimited ammo of guns and autocannons, as well as helicopters and planes with the like.Overall, Just Cause 2 is an aesthetically astounding, open world adventure, and Avalanche Studios has done an amazing effort at pulling off a gaming spectacle. If you like a game where one minute you are parachuting out of the sky and next minute you are speeding down the deserted Panauan highway with the cops on your tail, this game is for you. The amount of things to do and see are amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will be playing it for a lot more hours to come.			",117,14,8,9,8,1,22

												This game pushes the limits of open world sandbox games. The map is absolutely enormous and beautiful. Each terrain (dense jungle, desert, frozen mountains, ocean, urban) are expansive and fun to explore.The missions in the game are fairly brief, and can be beaten in a day. Despite this, you can still put hours into this game with just exploration. There is also a multiplayer mod in development that adds a whole other level of fun.This game is exceptionally well optimized as well. It runs on almost any machine with a decent frame rate, and adapts to any resolution flawlessly.My only gripes are that the gameplay gets a bit repetitive after finishing the main story, but if you are good at making your own fun and are willing to download a few mods, you can enjoy this game for a long, long time.8/10			",67,5,3,9,11,1,1

The story is a bit short but there is many things you can do around the island. races. collecting items. missions. and destroyinh stuff. my only complaint is that the sports cars have extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ handling.

												An absolute blast of a game, in more ways than one. Comes highly recommended by me and the new multiplayer is the best free roaming multiplayer I have ever played in a game. But if you don't want to play that, there's literally hours upon hours of content in this game, I DARE YOU to 100% it.			",510,87,9,35,15,4,22

												Cons:-the story is nothing special (but seriously, who needs stories when you have explosions?)-the characters are pretty stereotypical. (but seriously, who needs deep characters WHEN YOU HAVE EXPLOSIONS)pros:+You can fly through a bridge while standing on top of a jet plane dual wielding machine guns pointed at helicopters shooting rockets at you.+You can literally steal and stand on top of any vehicle in the game at any point, blowing up almost everything and everyone.+The player character speaks fluent american, spreading bullets and freedom to any and all equally.+grappling hook. Need I say more?10/10 would be a helcopter hood ornament before providing improvised demolition services and freedom agan.			",66,9,0,8,1,0,3

												10/10 - The most content a game could have.I'm a bargain shopper but this is a game I would litterally pay $60 for. So much content. Never ending missions, 360 vehicles to drive and more. After 36 hours I am only 32% to completion! Amazing. Tons of mods to spice up  the game as well. FANTASTIC!  10/10 Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Do not be fooled: this is a modern collect-a-thon with plot, characters and dialogue straight from a B movie, but make no mistake, that's not a bad thing here. The game doesn't take itself seriously and, given the crazy physics concerning the dual hook, there's no reason you should either.Also, this game looks way too good and runs way too smooth for its own good, even on low end PCs. I do not know what sorcery is involved but it certainly is impressive.			",128,15,1,22,6,0,11

												Oft rumoured but they say that if you look up the dictionary definitions for ""ridiculous"", ""marvellous"", or ""sheer unbridled insanity"", you'll find that Just Cause 2 is a suggested alternative. With a more than generous helping of hopefully intentional B-movie voice acting, JC2 (also know as EXPLOSIONS!: The game) is a vast physics-defying experience with a throwaway plot, fun-for-the-hell-of-it missions (a remarkable finale not to be missed) and a huge open world to satisfy your destructive needs.

""DON'T BLAME ME, IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW""What would you like me to say on this intouchable completition of 100%? Jaws down.If I say it's huge, it actually is. You cannot even imagine how huge it is. I've never ever played at a BIGGER game world than Panau is yet. It's so big that Panau contains desert, jungle and snowy mountains. It'll take you at least 10 minutes to jet it over and over 5 hours to walk across the map. While GTA takes you like 2 mins to jet it through, and 2,5 hours to walk it across. Both is confirmed guys, not just random number.Complexity of things you can do here? GTA Series are nothing in comparision with this. There is over 350 towns and villages to explore and liberate, more than 120 military bases to liberate, explore and destroy, those contains big airports, harbors, radar stations and so on. More than 100 cars and planes to drive. More than 2000 items to collect. If you want to reach 100% completition it is almost impossible. You gotta work your♥♥♥♥♥off and you still won't reach that without modding the game because 6 items out of 2000 are missing. I am not blaming devs. You cannot blame them for it.Yes, there is only 7 main missions without relevant story, but 49 faction missions, 50 challenges, 30 bridge limbing and another stuff that will do it. I said that there is no relevant story, because I really feel like it is not. This game is more about destruction of the Panau that those 7 story missions. If you like cruising around with jet, I recommend you to buy Black Aerial DLC for that certain jet, otherwise rest is garbage for me. Multiplayer element has been added recently, I just tried it briefly, but will put out standalone review on it sooner or later.To make it shorter than the game is, you will definitely not make any mistake buying this and certainly not spending week or more inside the game.Bonus Point: Country TransitionRating: 9/10 ",105,13,6,7,13,1,6

												Just Cause 2 brings much needed improvement upon the first game's format. Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare. Besides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses. Avalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.			",810,236,5,120,92,7,118

It's often on sales.Basicaly, it is worth your money if you love TPS games in opened world. And at the time im writing the multiplayer mod is finaly available for everyone, for free.It's so fun to be able to play on a large scale area with up to 1000 players ! Many vehicles, cars, trucks, boats, planes and choppers :) Several weapons and explosives.And the main ingredient of this game : a grappling hook and a parachute to move everywhere you want !

												Just Cause 2 brings much needed improvement upon the first game's format. Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare. Besides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses. Avalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.			",810,236,5,120,92,7,118

												Just Cause 2 was one of the first games I got on Steam and it was a game I could sit down and play for hours on end. What I love most about this game is the fact of showing both how corrupt some goverments are and the great storyline and the games large arsenal of weapons. What I think should be improved however is the prices of weapons, that is should be harder to find collectibles and maybe a few more secret weapons and Easter Eggs. All in all I rate Just Cause 2 a 9/10. I would highly recommend anybody who loves a free roam, third person shooter and loves to blow things up to play this game.			",35,3,0,13,5,0,2

Gameplay is fun, map is huge, lots to do. The Multiplayer mod downloadable for free on Steam is a blast, almost feels like it was part of the original game.			",588,119,12,59,39,4,56

Bush, and moreStick it to the man (and kick Panau back into the stone age) by destroying all communications, fuel distribution and power generationyou can buy a helicopter and they deliver it to you in a bigger helicopterHave you ever wanted an entire nation to play with? The playable area in JC2 is seriously astounding, and yet you can cover it in no time at all. Grappling hooks are honestly one of the best things to ever be added to video games, and JC2 executes it perfectly. I once heard this game described in 3 words: Grand Theft Spiderman. There's so much to do; the quest for 100% can keep the game going for 10x the duration of a typical playthrough. (Good luck getting it though; apparently like 3 collectibles spawn outside the map and are unobtainable. Sigh.)Overall, the movement in this game is extremely tight and powerful. The combination of grappling hook, parachute and dodge roll gives many options in combat or transport. In fact, I often find myself eschewing a vehicle in favor of the good old parachute slingshot. If you like GTA, but wish it had more of America ♥♥♥♥ing with third world countries, this game is for you.			",74,11,1,15,6,0,5

												Let me think about how to put how awesome and fun this game is. You can drive any vehicle you see, pilot any ship, fly any plane (civilian or military), and steer any helicopter you can grapple onto. Guns range from simple pistos you can dual wield to sawed off shotguns and rocket launchers, machine guns and sniper rifles. The fighting is fun enough, i can spend tons of hours just killing off the military bases and achieving 100% of government property destroyed and upgrades collected. There are thousands of collectables than can improve your character, vehicles and weapons. What makes the game unbelievable is how beautiful the scenery is while youre zipping along with your unlimited parachutes as you grapple onto the ground or a passing car or a tree with your grappling hook (that has some serious range on it) to maintain your velocity. The map is huge, seriously huge, and it covers everything you would find on a modern island with resources and tourists. Deserts, mountains, swamps, villages, city capitals with lots of skyscrapers, plains, jungles, resorts, refineries, even a frozen lake at the top of a volcano's caldera. There is always something to find and each location is unique. I love this game so much that I purchase multiple copies to give away so that other people that have no idea what Just Cause 2 is like, can experience for themselves. Once you beat the game, get some of the DLC for even more fun. The DLC i use the most is the rockets that strap onto your parachute to help get you where you're going even faster, or to jet out of the line of fire and then climb a skycraper with ease.

												This game is a little old but that doesn't change the experience at all. The game is about a man named Rico trying to save the nation of Panau from a bad leader. It has very fun gameplay where you get to drive and fly around in free-roam. The map is quite large with many places to go to. You get to cause destruction by exploding and destroying fuel tanks, radio control towers ETC. There are 3 different factions and you may choose which of the three you can work with: Reapers, Ular Boys & Roaches. This game is quite fun and I definitely reccomend it for what it is.

												Just Cause 2 is a 3rd person shooter that looks and feels a lot like GTA and Saints Row. It's main trademark is the grappling hook, that can be used to pull yourself to objects far away or pull objects towards you.Pros:+ Vast environment with distances that feel realistic. Driving 10 kilometers feels like driving 10 kilometers in real life. Downside of this is that the world feels a little empty and repetative at times.+ All the major weapon classes are represented and you can upgrade your gear.+ Pretty good story. + Memorable character build and rich dialogues.+ The local propaganda radio reflects on your latest actions, trying to cover everything up.+ Playing a villain was served in a satisfactory, humorous manner, that suited the whole story.Cons:- Missions start to feel repetative very quickly, falling roughly into 3 categories:	1. Go kill everyone and blow everything up in a particular place.	2. Help some gangsters get to a fortified camp and protect them until they take it over.	3. Destroy something/someone in a limited timeframe.- A few bugs like falling through a bridge or not being able to get out of a turned over car.VerdictIt's not amongst my favorite games, far from it. Travelling the distances was a pain and the repetative missions got tiresome quickly. On the other hand, unleashing havok has a quality of it's own and the game surely has a ton of content to keep your hands tied for some 20+ hours.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just Cause 2 pumps you into action the moment the game starts and barely is there time to catch your breath as you go from one area to the next, one plane to the other, one seaboat to another and one parachute to the other. With new enemies, weapons, and vehicles, the game gives you an array of items at your disposal... yeah, well, good or no?The guns are pretty weak as the realism doesn't set in in this game at all, which is expected considering that's just how the game is meant to be, which is pretty great at times. The game does get repetitive somewhat quickly after about a day's worth of gaming. Only 'specialty' areas are unique, though not in large numbers. Enemies remain the same, without much difference in them and aren't memorable. Same characters as in Just Cause but with, of course, Baby Panay and his men and a few others. Vehicles are nice, nothing special (probably intentional), and easter eggs are plenty, though a rather obvious one is one a lot of people know about whether they've played the game or not or have seen what the egg is referencing.So, yeah, weapons are meh-y, vehicles uneventful, enemies boring, and locations repetitive.But does that make it a bad game? NOPE. It's fun, yes, but as the review states here and there, it does get repetitive, but the non-stop action and hilarious ways to kill enemies makes the game quite addictive. Overall, gameplay to 100% completion takes about... well, maybe 80 hours if you play it casually but non-stop probably less. Is it worth doing new games on it? Maybe more-so after a long time of not playing just to be nostalgic.What this game offers over other games of similar style is... well, the style. Infinite parachutes, grappling hook for every occasion, and a kickass Rico makes the game all the more fun. So go ahead and get it, it's fun and addictive but you shouldn't be expecting to want to play it every waking moment after the first few hours.7.5/10			",57,3,0,11,2,0,0

Atmosphere effects, lens flaring, realistic water and waves.* Physics are good, but my friend argues not believable enough. Umm... but very fun.* Grappling hook is back! If you're an older hardcore gamer, remember KQP mod for Quake 1?* Dual wield weapons.* Excellent NPC interactions* Stunningly beautiful world with a lot of area to explore by foot, boot, car, truck, jetplane, helicopter.* MMO feature! Join or host an MMO! Lots of mods available!It ran silky smooth with my AMD 6-core Zambezi + Nvidia 550 1Gb.  Buy it and get ready for Just Cause 3, if it comes out.

												Wanna blow lots of stuff up? Like Asian (or Latino) accents? Then this is a game for you. Just Cause 2 is a TPS (third-person shooter) set on the beautiful tropical island of Panau where you assume the role of agent Rico Rodriguez. Your goal is to liberate the people of Panau from the reign of a dictator, who goes by the name of Pandak Panay. Throughout the course of the story you will become allies with criminal gangs on the island who send you out on missions in exchange for information (and cash). Some of these missions include assassinating colonels and driving a pink limousine! Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to casual shooter players or people who just want to blow stuff up!

It is a fantastic open world game that is a combination of grand theft auto, a flight simulator, and a sort of Tom Clancy installment.  You can drive, float, or fly pretty much anything in the game.  Also, anything that you can fall off of, you can BASE jump, so that is a little added fun as well.  I would highly recommend this game.			",128,20,4,6,7,0,1

Some of these missions include assassinating colonels and driving a pink limousine! Overall, I'd highly recommend this game to casual shooter players or people who just want to blow stuff up!

												Bought this game on sale, and it was the best $4.99 I have ever spent.  I have tons of play time into this game, and it gets better and better.  It is a fantastic open world game that is a combination of grand theft auto, a flight simulator, and a sort of Tom Clancy installment.  You can drive, float, or fly pretty much anything in the game.  Also, anything that you can fall off of, you can BASE jump, so that is a little added fun as well.  I would highly recommend this game.			",128,20,4,6,7,0,1

												This game is, in my opinion, the best one available for PC, although I have a limited frame of reference. It's not overly violent - or at least if you choose for it to not be. You are rarely outright forced to kill anyone, although it is sometimes the easiest route. However, lots of the missions are very repetitive, but the best one is stealing an armored car and pretty much destroying a highway with it before giving it to the gang who sent you. This could be my definition of a perfect game, if a few things were changed. First off, my definition of a perfect game would be an open world parkour-integrated stealth game with many options for how to go about things, with an engrossing but quick-moving story line (and an epic soundtrack). This game is obviously open world, and it's got very good combat mechanics, even though I generally don't like TPS games. It can be played with a stealth style, but the extremely OP minigun can be fun if you feel like taking the direct route. I almost always take a stealth route because it makes the game more fun. There are some parkour elements, but really not enough to satisfy what I like. Vehicles are very fun to drive, it's one of my favorite things to do. The story could be better, but I'm easily entertained by game's stories, so I find it good. It is, however, a very, very slow game. You have to blow a lot of stuff up to progress, and if you're like me and you want to explore everywhere, it can take you a while to do anything. For example, right now I have 20 hours logged and 11% progress. (In game, not achievements.) Moving on, the map is wonderful. The only thing that really bothers me is the inability to go in any large buildings. That's the only way this game could really improve a lot. The graphics are beautiful, especially for a game that's (I think) 3 years old. Often when I'm playing I'll take a screenshot of Rico floating over a mountain range at sunset, because the game really is that beautiful. Honestly this game is very good looking, and performance is suprisingly good. On my laptop (Basic stats: Intel Core i5, Intel Integrated Graphics, 6GB RAM, and 7200 RPM hard drive) the game runs around 30 fps, although battery life is pretty much instant death. 30 fps may not sound that great, but really I don't even notice it. It doesn't affect how well I play the game, so I don't bother with it. The only time I've ever noticed lag is during cutscenes, when the audio and video get seriously out of sync. Oh well. Soundtrack is well done too.--Summary--Pretty freaking amazing. 10/10.99/100 for not having enough parkour and no going inside buildings.			",80,8,3,8,8,0,2

												Average story, decent voice acting, repetitive and uninteresting missions and yet I can't not recommend this game.Why? Two words: Grappling hook.The fun in this game, primarily, comes from the grappling hook. The grappling hook allows you to quickly traverse terrain, hook on to a vehicle to then hijack it or even use it to tow a vehicle around. You can even jump from vehicle to vehicle and add parachutes to the combo so that you can either hook on to another vehicle or use the momentum from your grappling to parachute higher and further.The open world of this game is set in the fictional island paradise of Panau and a very large paradise at that. The graphics are quite impressive, particularly in the large mountainous areas or high above the world in an aircraft the view really is great. The range of vehicles is large from cars, motorcycles to various aircraft and boats; using these vehicles to explore the world and wreak havoc is incredibly satisfying.That brings me to my next point. The destruction. The explosions. The weaponry. Whether it be a handheld gun or one attached to a vehicle, you're going to be causing a lot of damage to Panau. Causing a lot of explosions is satisfying and (other than grappling hooks) is what this game is all about.I am yet to play the multiplayer mod that was recently released on Steam but multiplayer in a game such as this will only add to the fun and chaos.Just Cause 2 is a game that frequently goes on sale so it wont be hard to find it for a very reasonable price and it's a small fee for hours and hours of fun.

												Really good fun open world exploring game.The Sandbox type moments are top fun, using your crappling hook to attack to an explosive barrel, then attach to enemy and shoot barrel and watch it take off dragging the man.. Good fun.The gameplay becomes the same after a few hours and a little boring, and someone has actually made a Multiplayer mod, allowing 5000 players online all to run around and explore together and that for me kick starts the game back in.Graphics are decent and the gameplay is top fun for a few hours.  Currently on sale for £3 and worth every penny, (While writing this short review)Gameplay lasts a decent while before coming the same and booring.Worth a buy and play, top fun.

												Where should i start ? Hm, right - how could i miss on this title so long ...Can be compared to Mercenaries 2 World in Flames, GTA and other open world games.Controls are ok you want however adjust key settings, You will be able to hijack everything moving. The grapple is your signature tool of choice and you can do funny stuff with it. AI is a no brainer but clever enough to try to flank, at times very erratic, especially when you draw a lot ""Heat"". It does not dampen the fun.Just Cause 2 could be Skyrim for action fans. IF the community gets more tools for this game running including modelling, animation, campaign creation, character customization etc ( stores like in Saints Row would be great to change your outfit ) Has already community made multiplayer.However, crazy game to waste time in. Just enjoy the ride.Belongs into every game collection.You like open world games ? - well, what you waiting - get it. That simple.Rico is cool. Nothing can go wrong.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
												This game is by far the most fun I have ever experienced with any game, ever. It's ostentatious and over-the-top story always gives you something interesting to do during main missions whilst side missions give you objectives to complete in any way you want with any equipment you want. Can't be bothered driving this car through enemy defenders, fine, just tether it to a heli and drop it at its check point. Honestly the times it gets boring are the ones that it tries to be a normal game. No matter what price I'll always suggest this game, but it gets really cheap on sale			",75,3,0,4,3,0,6

												I played this game on console when it came out. It was and it's still excellent. It never gets old. It's often on sales.Basicaly, it is worth your money if you love TPS games in opened world. And at the time im writing the multiplayer mod is finaly available for everyone, for free.It's so fun to be able to play on a large scale area with up to 1000 players ! Many vehicles, cars, trucks, boats, planes and choppers :) Several weapons and explosives.And the main ingredient of this game : a grappling hook and a parachute to move everywhere you want !

												Just Cause 2 is awesome. It's chock-full of explosions, and its giant, open world is great for exploring or just screwing around. There are lots of vehicles you can hijack, missions you can complete, weapons you can acquire and upgrade, and stuff you can blow up. Plus, there is a free mod you can download so that you can play with friends. Overall, I highly recommend this game.			",119,4,2,26,19,0,23

												Just Cause 2 is all about running around and having fun with loads of toys and things that go boom. If you go into this game thinking you're going to get some seminal epic, you're in for a surprise. Just Cause 2 is a tongue-in-cheek look at espionage video games. This guerilla simulator lets players raise hell in an immense open-world practically any way they want, and the results are sure to bring a smile to your face.Wherever you go, you'll find all sorts of things and people to destroy. Whether spitting death by launching rockets from a helicopter or grapple hooking a hapless enemy to a moving vehicle, you'll want to get creative in the ways you dispatch your foes. As such, this game is filled with hilarious combat most action gamers will really enjoy. Unfortunately, it also comes with its fair share of unpolished bits that the abundant humor simply can't cover up completely.The first 15-30 minutes of Just Cause 2 is a clear example of how not to make a video game. The introduction is filled with lots of things that plague the title throughout. For starters, this is where you'll be introduced to the cliché characters and lowbrow plot; I don't think I've ever cared less about a game's story - something about 'The Agency' hunting down a dangerous American in a nationalistic tropical island rife with pretenders to the throne. Making matters worse, the poor narrative is exacerbated by the loathsome dialogue and painful delivery. Some may argue that the developers tried to make the game cheesy in these regards in order to accentuate the humoristic approach the gameplay takes, but I'm here to squash those claims - the story, characters, and voice acting utterly fail.Thankfully, the run-and-gun action is often exceptionally fun. There are lots of different weapons to use, and delivering death in cruel and unusual ways soon becomes second nature. Perhaps the biggest reason for the off-the-wall combat is the dual grapple hook in Just Cause 2. Imagine romping through 3-D environments with Bionic Commando-like abilities. Now imagine pulling off grapple swings, hitching to vehicles, and zipping to locations that are over a hundred yards away! Moreover, pulling enemies out from behind turrets and immediately riddling them with bullets will not only net you special kills, but is ever so satisfying.The dual grapple hook is also an excellent way to get around combat zones. Rather than simply running from place to place, you'll be better served by zipping from building to building like some kind of mutant monkey. You'll be able to get in and out of combat in a flash, and get yourself into advantageous positions simply by aiming for the building tops. Of course, the grapple hook is only one way to get around. You'll also have access to a parachute that can be engaged on the fly at almost any moment.As good and as game-changing as these gameplay workings are, combat is held back significantly by the poor shooting and cover mechanics. This game essentially does away with any of the technical shooting skills gamers have developed in FPS and TPS titles over the years in favor of a user-friendly, cinematic approach. As long as your gun is pointed in the vicinity of an enemy, you'll turn him into Swiss cheese. While this forgiving tact makes pulling off aerial kills and other stunts a breeze, it also dumbs down the encounters.Another of the game's foibles is the difficulty in getting around the expansive world. As good as zipping around the combat zones can be, getting from one point of an island to another is extremely slow. This is due to a number of factors. First, the vehicles are cumbersome. Driving, flying, and boating around the hilly, overgrown, and obstacle-laden land, seas, and skies of Panau is painful. Second, the world is so big, you'll sometimes go nearly 10 kilometers (6 miles) to get to your next objective. Even in a chopper, this can take upwards of five minutes - in a quad, car, or rickshaw/golf cart you're looking at 20 minutes, minimum!In an attempt to ameliorate this, you can call up a black market dealer and get extracted from your current position to your desired location. While they let you call upon this glorified shuttle service as much as you want (and for free), it only really works if you've already been to the location.Despite the inefficiencies inherent to negotiating a massive open-world, Panau is a great place to get your guerilla on. I liked the varied terrain : encompassing beaches, urban zones, factories, villages, refineries, fortresses, jungles, air strips, mountains, etc. Panau is essentially a warrior's playground. There are literally thousands of nooks and crannies to discover. By exploring the world in detail, you'll get access to weapon and vehicle parts as well as get nifty health boosts.In addition to upgrade chests, you'll also find cash stashes that can be used to purchase new equipment. Cold, hard cash isn't the only form of currency in the game, however; Chaos is every bit as valuable. By taking out government vehicles and emplacements (radio towers, gas tanks, satellite arrays, holding tanks, transformers, etc.) you'll be awarded with ever-increasing Chaos totals. The more Chaos you unleash on Panau, the more faction and agency missions as well as back market items become available.Whether you're playing the game on PC, Xbox 360, or PS3, you'll be treated to a beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic, time. The Southeast Asian archipelago of Panau isn't exactly as lived in or as sensible as I would have liked, but it is a great place to play, nonetheless. If there was one word I had to use to describe Just Cause 2, it would be 'ridiculous'. The game never takes itself seriously, which, for the most part, is a good thing. However, sometimes this lackadaisical approach extends into areas where it shouldn't, resulting in an often unpolished, even amateurish experience. Still, the game has fun in spades, so all who pick it up are likely to have a total blast!			",2266,868,87,236,310,22,349

												The isle of Panau offers much to the adventurer at heart. For you it offers a purity of form with regard to Just Cause 2's gameplay.The first thing you'll notice with Just Cause 2 is how flowy everything is. From stealing cars to grappling on airplanes, to stealing an airplane while jumping from another airplane. All this is at the heart of Just Cause 2, and it really illistrates itself as ""Why did I just do that? Just cause..."".Action, destruction, chaos are at the heart of this game. Almost to it's detrement since the story tries to portray you as a liberator when you play as almost a conquerer. Your objectives are to destroy vital infastructure and you regularly bathe the island in lethal radiation just to complete a mission. Indeed you're more of a bad guy than the antagonist is, but that's okay. Because you did it... just cause.			",338,42,5,36,12,5,30

												Now that I've finally gotten around to finishing the main quest of this game, I feel I have enough information to write a review. It is a phenomenal game.While the story is nothing to write home about and the controls can feel a bit wonky at times, the gratification that comes from grappling a jeep to the road and causing it to flip into the air or decimating harbors and army bases with a minigun are simply unmatched among games I've played. This game's main ""gimmick"" is your grappling hook that spits in the face of physics and basic logic. This 1 inch cord has enough power to hold a car to a helicopter without breaking and defies the concept of momentum, letting you jump off a skyscraper and grapple onto the road below without being harmed. The game also features a respectable arsenal of upgradable weapons and vehicles to terrorize the island nation of Panau with.There are few negatives that I can come up with for this game, but there are some minor issues:When you fall from a tall place, you transition into ""falling mode"" and controls shift accordingly. The distance it takes to transition seems inconsistent and can result in cheap damage.The DLC seems a bit overdone. I'm not a huge fan of DLC in the first place, and I bought the full version that includes the DLC, but I didn't feel like it added much to the game.The game is actually incomplete. The developers accidentally left out a few of the collectables, making it impossible to 100% the game ingame, you can still get all the Steam achievements though. I'm honestly puzzled as to why the devs haven't fixed this issue, since it should be a really easy fix.Lastly, and this may not be a bad thing for some people, Panau is big. Too big. Allow me to elaborate, I have played this game for 131 hours and I'm only about 75% of the way done. The conquering of towns and military bases is a blast at first and retains its enjoyability well, but I don't see myself 100%ing the game any time soon.Despite these complaints, I've gotten 131 hours of solid enjoyment out of this title and will definitely be playing it more. If this game looks like fun to you and you won't be too bothered by its problems, then this is easily worth its asking price.			",159,41,2,15,6,0,4

												The Just Cause franchise was the reason for my entrance into the gaming world. When I first bought my Xbox 360, I saw that Just Cause 2 came with it; I was intrigued. So, little AraChN1DZzz Unsp0K3N decided to get that, and boy, did he love it to death! He spent over 2 years completing that game on every difficutly. Once he was done, he thought, ""Wow, I should get JC1!""But we will talk about JC1 in another review,  thank you summer sale. The actual game Just Cause 2 was a follow-up from the initial development of the character ""Rico Rodriguez"" from Just Cause 1, voice acting by  Robin Atkin Downes .  In fact, the two games have very similar endings. Baby Panay is supposed to be portrayed as some grotesque man who would kill his own father just to get the ""Presidential"" role of Panau (This isn't a spoiler, you are told this during the opening scene of JC2).  The graphics/physics In JC2, the graphics are a really big letdown. The scenery of the game is heavily painted, but that may be because of the huge map size, but if you are to compare the graphics to Battlefield, you will see that JC2 didn't really try hard enough in terms of the Graphical side of the battle. Also, you see that the creators basically copied and pasted the ""spinny trees"" and even buildings just to make the game look big, which really shouldn't be an option. However, I must say that looking out into the distance at some opposite islands really calms the feeling of the game. The physics of JC2 always keep you on the edge of your seat. The unrealistic yet amusing stunt jump always adds the feeling to the game that you are, in fact, playing a destructive game rather than one where you ""look...out into the distance"" and enjoy the view, you can do that when you complete the game, [reach 100% completion, impossible, right?] The grapple hook in JC2 was majorly upgraded from the usless grapple gun given to you in JC1, which is what the game is all about, the evolution of the grapple hook, as we see in JC3,  with the infinite tethering and the wingsuit.  The AI Being a very experienced player, I know what it is like to have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥  AI in a game, especially in JC2. At times, the AI is completely messed up - if you were to drive on the road in Panau City, the civillian AI would run away screaming ""Hey, he got a gun!"", which really doesn't make sense. Also, when I decide to inspect a Wilforce Trekstar [Panau Police] I see the passenger soldier standing up, waving his damn hands in the air like his favourite song has come on, on the propaganda news channel! One more criticism is that the usage of the military plane was never really implemented. I get Level 6 Heats, but only UH-33 Chippewas come, rather than a SI-47 Lepoard, which would really spice things up.To summarise, I would say that this game has its ups and downs. To be honest though, the map size was waaay out of its time, but that is what you can expect from pure perfection, except the copying and pasting. But really, this game is magnificent and if you can look past the Graphical exterior, then I know that you will have fun with this game.			",14,2,0,1,4,0,5

												Outstanding game with decent graphics (for its age) and a stunning open world.The story is acceptable for a game focused on free roam gameplay, but not bothering to complete it won't really affect the rest of the game.The side missions' objectives can get quite repetitive but because of the nature of Just Cause 2, you can complete these missions with whichever vehicle or weapon you want.The game isn't too taxing on most systems of the last 7/8 years, a more recent machine should be able to max out all graphic settings.Highly recommended if you're into open world shooters or if your system isn't capable of playing Just Cause 3.

												A completionists nightmare, or dream if you're a completionist/masochist. It's an extremely fun game, with an alright story. The most fun is driving around, blowing things up, and searching for hidden items. With 68 hours in, I am only at 54% completion, even with the story being over.This game is well worth trying out, why? Just Cause.			",760,198,28,77,82,8,146

												Just Cause 2 is the closes thing to a Michael Bay simulator. The story is irrelvent as its about you trying to overthrow a dictator and somthing about oil. The point of the game is just to blow things up while given a prappling hook and unlimited parachutes, aka a Commando Spiderman. You will have hours of fun and the enviorment is awe inspring too.

												If you have a good imagination, you are very self-sufficient and is able to entertain yourselves, there is no game better for you.Just a great firing field for all kinds of entertainment: you can fly in one minute at a military base on the roof of a burning car, tear off guard tower machine gun to lay a few dozen soldiers, a couple armored cars and shoot down a general's helicopter, grab the tank, to break through the impenetrable jungle to the air base, steal a jet fighter , soar into the sky, smash to pieces by cruise missiles couple windmills and oil plant, to step foot into the clouds, fly like a bird in the sun, at the last moment opened parachute gently to dive into the warm tropical water as unknown hero and sail away on a yacht at sunset.Score: 8/10. Just 'couse the story is not so great as the game itself.			",324,99,14,29,42,4,75

												Шпионский клон GTA. Расказывающий о приключениях супер-агента ЦРУ Рико Родригеза, на огромном райском острове (около 1000 кв. км.). Перестрелки, погони, прыжки с парашютом, угон автомобилей и военной техники. Можно выполнить самые разные трюки, вплоть до захвата летящего вертолета. Мир в Just Cause 2 — просто огромен, достаточно густо усыпан разными деревеньками, городами, военными базами, а так же просто красивыми и интересными местами. Динамика игры напоминает чем-то стелс игру, очень хорошо сбалансированную с экшеном. Оценка: Отлично 9/10			",118,9,8,7,4,2,8

												I have spent alot of hours on this game on the consoles, and just a few on this but they are growing. This is a special game. This is one of the only games which you are completely free in. You can suicide bomb, grapplehook cars to roads and, of course, blow stuff up. The multiplayer mod which comes with the game, Is also amazing. I am glad that the guys who made the mod, made it. There is a wide range of guns featuring from pistols to crazy rocket launchers. There is also a wide range of vehicles, featuring from motorbikes to military rocket-launching bullet-shooting helicopters. Although there isn't quite alot of replayability, You cannot tell anyone it isn't fun grappling on to helicopters and blowing s#*t up. You'd be lying. This game also features a pretty awesome black market system where you get your guns, vehicles and you can catch a ride on a helicopter there too.			",94,10,0,8,2,0,14

												I remember playing this on a friends account multiple years ago. It was fun, we were blowing things up, hijacking vehicles, fighting the police / mafia - a truely good game.However, when i bought the game for myself years later, it just didn't live up to the memories anymore. The game turned out to be repetetive, with a boring storyline and little to no actual content - most of the game just relies on the player deciding to do things (blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, mostly) instead of offering it to him. Beeing able to decide what to do is nice, but this feels like Skyrim without Quests. You can clear dungeons, but its no fun if you don't have to kill that pesky giant spider, since it didn't eat anyones brother. Graphics are nice, music is okay, the controls are adjustable - it's not bad. It's just... boring. Sadly.			",561,189,17,68,47,2,97

												This game contains the most fun I have ever had on Steam.The amount of hours I have enjoyed parachuting around exploring the game world, using my grappling hook in inventive ways and just mindlessly blowing things up in this beautiful game is astounding.Its the only game that doesn't seem to get boring.Now with the added multiplayer I can safely say this is one of the best games ever made.The community is great, and its awesome to see what people are doing with the mod.Some are zipping around at high speed, others just enjoying a paraglide, others still violently defending the airbases so their mates can play this game as a flight sim without fear of attack.You can join a faction, lone wolf combat or just do whatever you want.  The freedom of single player is still there.It often appears on sale for under $4, but even at full price it is money well spent.  If you see it on sale I highly recommend making sure a mate buys a copy too.Just awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A brilliant version of GTA, huge variaty of vehicles, ranging from air to sea to land. Really good and realistic graphics, best particle system I ever saw. Physics are appaling. Ragdolls are stiff, flop around when dead and fly back when shot by a machine gun. Vehicle wreckage is alright, but dissapears very quickly making it unrealistic. The police AI are more dumb than in GTA. They give up easily and send helicopters even to attack you when you hijack a jet fighter. The map is big, full of secret bases.Unlike other games, you have a parachute and grappling hook feature. If you're in a plane and you're high up you can jump out and skydive. And using the hook you can grapple onto different surfaces, enemies and vehicles.Brilliant game, good graphics, bad physics and a unique grappling hook feature9/10			",106,13,2,14,19,0,23

												Like over the top 80's action movies? Massive, beautiful open worlds with varied biomes and tons of stuff to do? EXPLOSIONS!? If any of those apply to you, I highly supect that you might like this game. Personally, I love this game. From the vibrant, lush world to the zipping around on a grappling hook onto helicopters. There is just something about this game that I find incredibly fun, no matter how long I play it. It might be because the game is a far departure from the constant grim-dark that seems to be constatnly spewed out in the games indsutry these days, and goes in a route that is just about having fun in a brightly coloured and enjoyable world.

												This game contains the most fun I have ever had on Steam.The amount of hours I have enjoyed parachuting around exploring the game world, using my grappling hook in inventive ways and just mindlessly blowing things up in this beautiful game is astounding.Its the only game that doesn't seem to get boring.Now with the added multiplayer I can safely say this is one of the best games ever made.The community is great, and its awesome to see what people are doing with the mod.Some are zipping around at high speed, others just enjoying a paraglide, others still violently defending the airbases so their mates can play this game as a flight sim without fear of attack.You can join a faction, lone wolf combat or just do whatever you want.  The freedom of single player is still there.It often appears on sale for under $4, but even at full price it is money well spent.  If you see it on sale I highly recommend making sure a mate buys a copy too.Just awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hands down the best open world game I've ever played. There's also a 3rd party multiplayer mod in development www.jc-mp.com......I'm a huge fan of open world games, from the original GTA way back in the 90's right up to it's latest incarnation GTAIV. I've also enjoyed Shenmue, Dragon Quest, Bully, Fallout, Farcry, Spiderman, Burnout, Arkham City..... any genre, any platform- it's easily my favourite type of gameworld. But the mechanics make a game and Just Cause 2 has the most fun mechanics I've ever played with. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination....... and skill.......Wanna steal a fighterjet? Cool, Rico can do that. Wanna fly that plane toward a bridge, jump on top and surf the jet under the bridge? Fine, Rico can do that. Wanna jump from a building flying through death defying gaps and before hitting the ground, release your parachute and walk away unharmed? Rico can do that one too. Really, once you get the hang of the controls the game comes to life in a way I've experienced in no other.......That would be my recommendation over if it wasn't for one final thing. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It's exactly what it sounds like and so much more. This is a mod that allows over 2000 players to join a single server, playing together on the same map. Nobody should allow themselves to ignore the fact that this really is a landmark in gaming. Never has a game of action orientated 3rd person shooting/jumping/driving been played on this scale. The closest would be something like GTAIV multiplayer on PC with up to 32 players. 2000+ Players is a whole new league above and beyond what I ever thought possible. You should try it > www.jc-mp.com ",157,24,7,15,14,2,29

												Just Cause 2 is a fun game to mess around in.JC2 was meant to be cheesy, with one-liners and plenty of explosions. Explosions, cars, guns, more explosions, cars, and guns. There are alot of explosions in this game. Another thing which makes this game is a multiplayer mod avaliable on Steam, for free. If you ever get bored of regular JC2 you could always go there. JC2 also has a good modding community, with a good number of mods to choose from and play around with. The game is in Third Person, although there are First Person mods out there.In general, I would recommend JC2 to anyone who likes to have fun in their games and not take anything too seriously. And also to anyone who likes guns, cars, and/or explosions. Because there are alot of explosions.			",131,17,2,13,23,2,6

The game is better than what the trailer looks like and if the discription gives you a serious thought for the game, it actually rediculusly hallarious. I have truley had more fun with this game than any of the Grand Theft Auto games and i deffinatly recomend this game to anyone as there is not any very violent scenes or anything that would put the game of anyhigher than PG-13. If you are deciding to buy this game or GTA5, I will 100% reccomend you this game its cheaper and if you are looking to have a hallarious and fun time, pick this game up NOW! Its only 15 bucks(instead of 60 for GTA5) and it goes on sale all the time from 9.99 to 2.99.			",45,1,3,2,1,0,0

												Awesome game, everything just seems spot on. I do hope JC3 can live up to JC2. The DLC doesn't do much to enhance your adventure but the vehicles may be fun for you, the cheap helicopter certainly was a 'go to' for me for a while when funds were low. I don't recall any flaws or bugs but the game has been out for a few years! I'd say it's definately worth picking up If you like the 3rd person perspective game genre, the gameplay is fun, the graphics still look good and the recent-ish multi player mod should add even more value.I think I paid €5 for it in a sale, in retrospect i'd be happy paying €15 (I am hard to please though).....go get it !

Great gameplay overall, and a wide variety of ways you can kill and have fun with your enemies using your grappling hook, this game is a solid 8.5/10. I recommend anyone who loves stunts and insane battles to buy this game. After you've finished the agency missions it's also recommended to download Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod. Do not play the multiplayer before you've finished the original game or it will lose it's fun.			",116,14,0,17,15,0,5

												Just Cause 2 is a fun game to mess around in.JC2 was meant to be cheesy, with one-liners and plenty of explosions. Explosions, cars, guns, more explosions, cars, and guns. There are alot of explosions in this game. Another thing which makes this game is a multiplayer mod avaliable on Steam, for free. If you ever get bored of regular JC2 you could always go there. JC2 also has a good modding community, with a good number of mods to choose from and play around with. The game is in Third Person, although there are First Person mods out there.In general, I would recommend JC2 to anyone who likes to have fun in their games and not take anything too seriously. And also to anyone who likes guns, cars, and/or explosions. Because there are alot of explosions.			",131,17,2,13,23,2,6

												Awh man. Just Cause 2. This will be my favorite free-roam game for a looong time. The map is huge. Seriously. There's so many biomes, ranging from ocean to mountains to desert to forest and many more. This game has a ton of vehicles. Planes, helicopters, boats, cars, you name it. What Just Cause 2 lacks in gun variety, it makes up in explosions. This was the best 3 bucks I have ever spent. There's no other game like it.			",124,11,3,8,7,0,11

												Imagine if Michael Bay made a video game. That would be this game.To elaborate, this game tries way too hard to make you care about the story, but you really just want to watch the havoc evolve around you. This game is over the top. There's a tornado gun, a hovercraft, and did I mention that there are ♥♥♥♥ING EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE?!?! Does that make this game unplayable? No, not at all. Unlike a Michael Bay film, this game is very fun. The open world will consume hours of your life, the grappling hook is insanley fun to use, and the fact that just about everyone wants to kill you and/or can be killed makes this great for any lover of the GTA-style-kill-any-man-woman-or-creature-that-looks-at-you-funny method of gameplay style. So if you like over the top, open world, psychopath simulators; why are you still reading this? Go buy this game!			",61,8,0,9,5,1,3

												The game is short if you make it short. Sadly, I did this, but I still love it to death.Throughout the game, you're pretty freaking overpowered, but you're still weak enough at the beginning for you to feel that growing power as you progress. You cause chaos in Panau Just Cause you can. The government is a corrupt totalitarian superpower that needs to be stopped, and you do that in the most fun way possible. You assassinate colonels, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, and in general cause total societal collapse.The fun is just so much more with the number of vehicles you can drive, including many different airplanes and helicopters. The Black Market is your way of buying weapons and vehicles or hitching a ride across the MASSIVE game-world you're playing in. You can explore this freaking huge world if you'd like, but not all of it is all that interesting, even if it's all beautiful.This game is definitely worth the money.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A brilliant version of GTA, huge variaty of vehicles, ranging from air to sea to land. Really good and realistic graphics, best particle system I ever saw. Physics are appaling. Ragdolls are stiff, flop around when dead and fly back when shot by a machine gun. Vehicle wreckage is alright, but dissapears very quickly making it unrealistic. The police AI are more dumb than in GTA. They give up easily and send helicopters even to attack you when you hijack a jet fighter. The map is big, full of secret bases.Unlike other games, you have a parachute and grappling hook feature. If you're in a plane and you're high up you can jump out and skydive. And using the hook you can grapple onto different surfaces, enemies and vehicles.Brilliant game, good graphics, bad physics and a unique grappling hook feature9/10			",106,13,2,14,19,0,23

												Buy this game and play it.  That's pretty well all that needs to be said but I'll say a bit more.The grappling hook in this game may be one of the single best/fun mechanics I've ever played with in a game.  Hooking vehicles, boats, planes and more together is just plain fun.  Using it while also shooting down some rag tag militia might be even more fun.  You get a fair share of vehicles and weapons to wreck mayhem everywhere.  There's also a lot of missions and story that keep you interested in causing more mayhem.  As well you get a gigantic island with lots of variety to the terrian and good deal of towns/cities to play in and cause further mayhem.With all that mayhem you cause you may generate a fair amount of attention from the local authorities, but thats okay, cause using your grappling hook to get out of those situations is just as fun as when you used your grappling hook to get into the situation.Get this game and enjoy the hell out of it like everyone else has.

												This game contains the most fun I have ever had on Steam.The amount of hours I have enjoyed parachuting around exploring the game world, using my grappling hook in inventive ways and just mindlessly blowing things up in this beautiful game is astounding.Its the only game that doesn't seem to get boring.Now with the added multiplayer I can safely say this is one of the best games ever made.The community is great, and its awesome to see what people are doing with the mod.Some are zipping around at high speed, others just enjoying a paraglide, others still violently defending the airbases so their mates can play this game as a flight sim without fear of attack.You can join a faction, lone wolf combat or just do whatever you want.  The freedom of single player is still there.It often appears on sale for under $4, but even at full price it is money well spent.  If you see it on sale I highly recommend making sure a mate buys a copy too.Just awesome.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just Cause 2 is simply stunning! This is by far one of the best free roam games I have ever played! JC2 is filled with seemingly endless things to discover and to destroy! The way this game allows you to travel around it's giant map, makes you feel truly free. It also offers TONS of replayability. Although I'm not a big fan of the story and the voice acting, this is still one of my favorite video games! I guarantee that while playing this game you will feel SUPER awesome the entire time! I give Just Cause 2 a 9/10!			",159,17,0,8,6,1,5

												Just Cause 2 is a must have for people who like open world games and/or explosions.The gameplay is VERY loose, meaning you can go basically anywhere with your grappling hook/parachute combo. There are missions, so you do have a reason to keep playing after you attempt several landings of fighter jets on dirt 'runways'.I consider this game to be a top classic, unbeaten by almost all the games in its genre. Get it ASAP. Blow up everything.			",158,20,1,14,15,2,2

												Chaos, chaos, and more chaos. This is what the game is about. With Rico Rodriguez you have the power to do awesome stuff that looks way to cool to be realistic (infinite parachutes). The game doesn't take it self seriously and that is why is so great, you know it isn't gonna be realistic or have a dark storyline. It all about the gameplay. I finished almost the entire videogame but not on steam, the main missions, the gangs mission. The only thing that I didnt complete were the collectibles, those pesky little items like drug drops or those funny skulls. Didn't care for those anybay. Still, all those hours were not wasted.With the inclussion of multiplayer, everything is on a whole different scale. Playing with friends while on voice chat is very fun, except when there are people on the servers that start to annoy us by killing us with a helicoopter.Worth it? Definitely			",98,7,5,17,5,0,14

												Awh man. Just Cause 2. This will be my favorite free-roam game for a looong time. The map is huge. Seriously. There's so many biomes, ranging from ocean to mountains to desert to forest and many more. This game has a ton of vehicles. Planes, helicopters, boats, cars, you name it. What Just Cause 2 lacks in gun variety, it makes up in explosions. This was the best 3 bucks I have ever spent. There's no other game like it.			",124,11,3,8,7,0,11

												Just Cause 2 is a killer sandbox title with a great campaign - better than any Grand Theft Auto title for freedom, scale, graphics, and pure fun. The only issue is that after exploring the whole map (which is huge), new areas feel somewhat repetitive. Bad marks also for the publisher who is kinda dóuchey with the DLC. With a real modding community this game could have been huge. 9/10 for the best single-player sandbox game in my collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Multiplayer is fun, you should experience it... If you havent been following the development of jc2 mp, it can house up to 9000 players on a single server.. granted the hardware and bandwidth is there.I have been playing on a single server with around 1000 active players at once. Interaction with other players with a 1000 connected has some noticable lag, but not horrible. I should also note that the server I was on is located in the UK, while im based in the US, distance is one of the biggest factors determining lag.its a ton of fun.Although there are no real objectives in mp, you can figure out how to have a blast in very little time.The mod also features Race and Demolition Derby modes that you can hop into at anytime. Race is a lot of fun, you will find yourself racing dogged old busses, or super fast performance cars, 4 wheeler atvs, even base jump racing !Go to one of the local attractions like /tp airport ... and watch the utter chaos as a few hundred people spawn vehicles and weapons and have an all out free for all.I should note that the Multiplayer mod is still in beta, so there are occasional crashes, but nothing to get squeemish about, the game itself is really well optimized for PC, and holds up well... until you start doing crazy physics stuff like flying a boat thats spinning at 100rpm :D ( Yep I said Flying a boat ! )Its madness, its halarious, its goofy, and its fun.Single player is sandbox action and comedy wrapped into a nice package.Not as in depth storyline as GTA4, basically go here destroy that, go there rescue him type of idiom.

												One of the most underrated and funny games I've ever played. Gorgeous graphics and non-stop action!The story of the game is intentionally stupid, a homage to 80's action movies, full of one-liners and evil guys with awful aiming. Don't take it seriously because it's not what makes this game great. What makes it amazing is that the main objective of this game is to cause CHAOS, and there's a lot of ways to do it, which gives you a lot of place to improvise and have fun. Missions are OK, some are better than others, some are just a copy-paste of previous ones, but doesn't matter, all are fun. Even if you are not interested in completing you can have fun because there's a lot of other things to do like racing (air, road and even on water), find collectibles, destroy enemy bases, etc. The map is HUGE and very detailed, you can play hundreds of hours and you will still find interesting places to visit.  Don't hesitate to buy it if you like sandbox games! is a MUST!			",327,48,10,22,19,2,33

I'm not saying they're entitled to their opinion, I'm calling them flatout wrong.This game is on sale so much there's no reason not to own it, especially with the multi-player mod made by www.jc-mp.com, check my videos for a 9minute video showcasing it.Explode stuff, grapple a helicopter and throw the guy out of it, there's everything to love about this over the top, massive (and I mean MASSIVE) open world.

												That game holds old games' soul inside!Gameplay is really fun, open-world implementation and details are awesome, graphics are also impressive. Generally i don't like purposeless games like this but even JC2's story and faction missions seems same and simple; they are also fun. Shooting government soldiers, blasting their bases and searching for hidden upgrade boxes are fun somehow. Also all places has their unique allocation.Vehicles mechanics are also really great, you can feel which one is van or racing car or you can feel differences between planes and helicopters.If you're not after realism, buy it. You'll probably like to play Just Cause 2.			",760,134,28,65,41,11,74

												It's like living in an action movie. It's over-the-top, the dialog and characters are atrocious, and everything blows up. Oh, and it's also absolutely beautiful. It's not a 'game-of-the-year' contender, but it's a whole lotta fun!			",129,20,9,8,4,1,8

												Link grew up started talking and started using gunsHe went to Gerudo valley but it's overrun by the bad GerudosHe uses his hookshot to get around  The voice acting is not so goodThere are explosions everywhere The black guy in the helicopter died in the beginning and I had to pause the game and cry for a few minutes because I was emotionally attached to himThis game is an experience for all ages and demographics- It's fun for the whole family. It's amazing experience. My favorite part of the game was where he killed the group of Neo-Nazis with the makeshift pivoting machine gun that he installed into the trunk of his car.

												I haven't reached a 100% on mercenary mode but i have passed the whole story and most of the faction missions so i think its safe to say that the game is good but the faction missions are a bit repetetive.I did not like the chacing someone kind of missions, and that is because its very hard to aim while you are driving maybe I'm just a noob but thats what i think.The story wasn't too captivating and could have been better, also while the cutscenes were playing the image and the sound someties didnt adjust.If you buy this game you will enjoy causing chaos rather than doing the story, and that's also the main objetive so that's good!!

												In this action packed game, you are in an agency to find Baby Panay. He is the president of the island, Panau, on which you play on. Do mini quests for people and build up heat by destroying Panau army supplies and whatnot. Even gas stations! Download mods at justcause2modding.com and play to your hearts content with that new tank you've been wanting! After you complete the game, you go into mercenary mode which you can go freestyle and have fun. Plus, the percentages in mercenary mode tell you how complete you are from pretty much doing everything. Use your grappling hook, parachute, shotgun, or even rocketlauncher, to earn chaos. This is the game (from what I've heard that it's much like Grand Theft Auto) that you would not want to miss out on the sales for!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In this action packed game, you are in an agency to find Baby Panay. He is the president of the island, Panau, on which you play on. Do mini quests for people and build up heat by destroying Panau army supplies and whatnot. Even gas stations! Download mods at justcause2modding.com and play to your hearts content with that new tank you've been wanting! After you complete the game, you go into mercenary mode which you can go freestyle and have fun. Plus, the percentages in mercenary mode tell you how complete you are from pretty much doing everything. Use your grappling hook, parachute, shotgun, or even rocketlauncher, to earn chaos. This is the game (from what I've heard that it's much like Grand Theft Auto) that you would not want to miss out on the sales for!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												FUN TO PLAYThis Game is too awesome to play, some time becomes Boring when you don't know what to do. IMO this beats most of the GTA Games. Graphics is awesome, the water, sky and all. Good Gameplay and stuff, pretty much liked it, the World is too much Big compared to any GTA, because GTA worlds are made manually, while in this Game, most of the places are copy pasted. Grappel is more fun, pulling back enemies, hijacking cars and Aero Planes, going from places to places. Beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Enemies with that. Weapons are Fun too. Story is typically meh, did not like it, but seeing the price tag of this game then this is really a Bang for Buck. 8/10			",72,6,2,10,2,0,1

												This is just one very great game. The controls are fluent and feel really nice. The missions are a bit repetitive apart from the story missions, which make up less than 20% of the game. You have to complete minor missions before you can progress in the story line. However, you only need a handful of minor missions to unlock all the story missions. That's the one major flaw in this game, it doesn't push you to do a lot of minor missions, you can rush through the story line is less than 15 hours. After that, there is a HUGE amount of sidemissions and collectibles to keep you busy. Not as much fun as the story but still well worth your time. The graphics are very nice, especially considering this game is a couple of years old already. Goes around on steam for less than 10 bucks, this one is a no-brainer for anyone loving shooting, action and an open world to explore.			",101,12,10,11,17,1,12

												Just Cause 2 is an open - world game. There are 3 factions, which gives you different missions and dialogue. The 3 factions are: The Reapers, The Ular Boys, and The Roaches. You also have your main missions, which lead you to the ending (if it wasn't self - explanitory). But that isn't what makes the game super fun. You have a huge country to explore: Panau. After quite awhile, you unlock a bunch of badass equipment, vehicles, and even have an extraction helicopter that can bring you to places you already discovered. You can fly a plane from one corner of the world, to the opposite end of the world. There are boats, helicopters, ATV's, motorcycles, etc. And, how could I forget, the grappling hook. The grappling hook is used to do all kinds of things. When you skydive, if you plan your grappling hook properly, you can break your fall! You can latch on the enemies and pull them to you! Anyways, that's all I can explain. But this game's a blast. You should buy it; full price or not! JUST BUY IT! Final Verdict: 9.5/10.			",100,5,0,11,4,0,4

You also have your main missions, which lead you to the ending (if it wasn't self - explanitory). But that isn't what makes the game super fun. You have a huge country to explore: Panau. After quite awhile, you unlock a bunch of badass equipment, vehicles, and even have an extraction helicopter that can bring you to places you already discovered. You can fly a plane from one corner of the world, to the opposite end of the world. There are boats, helicopters, ATV's, motorcycles, etc. And, how could I forget, the grappling hook. The grappling hook is used to do all kinds of things. When you skydive, if you plan your grappling hook properly, you can break your fall! You can latch on the enemies and pull them to you! Anyways, that's all I can explain. But this game's a blast. You should buy it; full price or not! JUST BUY IT! Final Verdict: 9.5/10.			",100,5,0,11,4,0,4

												I played this game extensively on PS3, the aiming is fairly difficult, but the open world gameplay is amazing. I rarely stuck to the missions as stealing helicopters to crash into other helicopters and grapple or parachute to safety is just too damn fun!playing on computer is much easier to headshot and gives you access to the multiplayer, which whilst not perfect, is still enjoyable.

												Just Cause 2 is a must buy, especially if it is on discount. IT'S A MUST.Yoou just need to know that you are creating chaos just to overthrow an evil government here as the story progresses and this is the best part: THIS GAME ACTUALLY ENCOURAGES YOU TO CREATE CHAOS BY DESTROYING GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AS WELL AS COLLECT STUFF.The gameplay revolves around the grappling hook and it is the most fun mechanic to play with. It has so many purposes in this game by either dragging people off buildings, evasion as you go from building to building etc. It is extremely fun to play with the grappling hook. Comparing with Just Cause, this game has significant improvements. Let's exclude the graphics. You can call the black market to buy weapons, vehicles or even just bring you from one area to another and mind you, despite the fact that Just Cause has that, it is extremely limited unlike Just Cause 2. In the game, there is quite a variety of things to do. Kill colonels, destroy property, do missions for factions or just race. Hell, this map is extremely big I had a time where I got bored of drivinig from one end of the map to another end of it (It writes 18km in total). You can have so much fun in this game that I cannot believe that I am hooked to this.The best part is that only 20% (Approximately) is dedicated to the story. THE REMAINDER IS FOR DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS AND WHATEVER IT IS. 80% OF THE PROGRESS.			",109,33,1,7,5,0,6

												Just Cause 2 is a unique game which implements many features that no other game - at the time of release or now - has ever implemented. Somewhat enjoyable, gameplay offers an extensive amount of amusement, when you get the hang of it that is. Jumping around with your grappling hook and parachuting from tree to tree to avoid gunfire is just one of the many aspects of this game that makes it notable. Storyline is thin and will be finished quite promptly and unfortunately, once you've gotten to that point, it just loses its fun-valueThe repetitiveness of the missions, atrocious voice acting, and overall lack of effort that seems to have been put into just about everything except fun game mechanics can leave a stale taste in one’s mouth. Flying around causing aimless chaos is fun for a few hours, but when you realize that's the only entertaining element the game has to offer you get bored quickly. ",306,103,32,44,40,2,54

You can detonate C4 attatched to a person that's riding on a car, hanging from a helicopter while crashing onto a building over a cliff.The story is basic, but lets the player use his/her imagination to complete most of the missions the craziest way possible, so it basically serves as a means to discover and enjoy the gameplay.

All the mayhem and absurdity you'd expect from the good old days of Grand Theft Auto, with a huge map, tons of vehicles and lots of stuff to blow up, As I said, it's not realistic and its writing doesn't give Shakespeare a run for his money, but if you have a few bucks and want something fun to play for about 20 hours or so(a lot more if you go for higher completion), you can't go wrong with Just Cause 2.

												It has an infinitely usable zipline.Other than that, it's an action movie in game form. Filled with gunfights and explosions, you play as an American secret agent/black ops who goes and tears up a Southeast Asian dictatorship.This comes in the form of an open-world(the map is huge) 3rd person shooter with: campaign missions; mini-missions done for revolutionary groups and mafias with simple escort, collect, hijack, destroy, and kill objects; races; military bases and cities with infastructure to destroy, leaders to kill, and upgrades to collect; sprinkled around the map.Combat isn't too challenging, as you soak up any damage you can get. You can either: zip, roll, and jump around, whacking people, throwing around with your zipline, and shooting people; or do it the boring way.You also got your cars, your boats, your helicopters, your planes, and your military veichles to use in it too.You can also just raise some havoc, as in most open world games.Voice acting is pretty bad, and the very large map isn't too exciting to explore.

												Very fun game. If you dont want to be pushed into a story line, but want plot and action, along with guns, cars, planes, boats etc, this is your game.Think GTA5. Three potential storylines (all playable simultaneously), can buy weapons and vehicles, lots of destruction, and cop chases. The map is MASSIVE, i flew for 5 real time minutes, and i had barely crossed a quarter of the map. The game is truly Open World, where you can assualt military bases and complete sections of the map at your own speed. Weaknesses? Yeah, there are a few. AI is limited. Grappling hook has unrealistic reach, and some physics that are questionable.Overall, a great game that doesnt take itself seriously, but presents a good, time consuming, action-filled third person shooter. Can attach people to Oxygen tanks and shoot the tanks into the air. 10/10			",60,4,2,8,8,0,10

												I haven't reached a 100% on mercenary mode but i have passed the whole story and most of the faction missions so i think its safe to say that the game is good but the faction missions are a bit repetetive.I did not like the chacing someone kind of missions, and that is because its very hard to aim while you are driving maybe I'm just a noob but thats what i think.The story wasn't too captivating and could have been better, also while the cutscenes were playing the image and the sound someties didnt adjust.If you buy this game you will enjoy causing chaos rather than doing the story, and that's also the main objetive so that's good!!

												A very fun game, one of my favourite games i have. It has a massive open world with cities, jungles and beachs it even has a desert. you have a grappling hook and a parachute so you can easily get around the world, or if you want just steal a car, boat or plane. One problem i have with this game is the police are very easy to kill and shake off which can be anoying although it's nothing a bit of modding cant fix. There is also a multiplayer mod which is pretty fun it's avalable here on steam so i would recommend that. Overall just cause 2 is a great game worth its price and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good action game. I give it a solid 8/10.			",147,13,10,12,12,1,5

												This isn't a game; this is more of an ""interesting out-of-context things generator"" in the sense that Just Cause 2 is pretty much a wreck-it-up where you play as secret agent and gravity fugitive Rico Rodriguez who has to do things on the island of Panau. What, exactly, do you do on Panau?Destroy stuff.That's literally the goal of the game; you destroy stuff and it advances the plot. The game gives quite a few creative ways to do it; you can take a motorbike, drive fast, and parachute off of it as it goes flying into a gas station, causing everything to explode as the cops are suddenly after you. The cops seem rather intelligent... somewhat. Gameplay's pretty solid, and in general the entire game feels like an open-world action movie. Panau is colossal and has a ton of things to do and destroy. This game does have a few bugs and glitches, however, but it doesn't take too much away from the game.			",106,8,0,17,11,1,6

While song plays, I want to fly more and more, until the end of the world. Just seeing the ocean was even enough to make me happy. I cant describe my feelings for this game, but maybe I just can make you think about your life that you spend years on those dump cities. World still has wonders. just go outside and see it.

												The Just Cause 2 story is that of one in a porno. It is necessary to have a story, but it doesn't mean it is a good one. Quite frankly this is one of the worst stories I have ever had the enjoyment of playing. BUT story doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game and you can tell. This game is about doing whatever you want because JUST CAUSE. Wanna strap a vehicle to a Passenger plane and watch physics break down? Do you want to give the middle finger to physics and logic? Do you wish to play a sandbox with a little more? Well I sure as hell do. My word is this game something special. Without the Grapple Hook this game would be nothing special. But hey you have a Grapple Hook which kicks the Hook Shot's♥♥♥♥♥ With this ungodly tool you become the most versatile being in the game. Think of this like Spiderman, but you don't cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. You can cling to walls and shoot ""webs"" and swing around not giving a single ♥♥♥♥. On a more serious note I love driving around the map taking in the magnificence of Panau Island and it is easily one of the more rewarding factors in the game. You'll discover over 350+ locations in which you can watch burn as you cause untolds amount of choas and havoc. Something else worth metioning is the mods. The mods are easy to work and are all hilarious. Some make you a god other add to the games graphics. Needless to say without mods the game is still fine on its own. Mods only exist to ""spice"" things up in the Just Cause Universe. Oh yeah there's multiplayer. I would wait on the Multiplayer until you have played around in Singleplayer. Multiplayer is Singleplayer but with way more players (No♥♥♥♥♥♥:\). In conclusion this game is the near perfection of large scale sandbox with plenty of hilarious moments and some seriously addicting gmaeplay. Remember each timke you play will never ever be like your last session.			",109,12,1,4,8,1,7

												When picking up this game, I didn't expect to sink so many hours into it. Essentially, the game is a summer blockbuster movie with more explosions than a Micheal Bay film after he drank a nitroglycerin cocktail with a dash of oil for flavour. Although the story, dialogue and voice acting are entirely terrible, I feel that this is a deliberate move by the developers in order to create the impression that it is your everyday blockbuster action movie with atrocious story in video game form. However, I think you could probably tell that part from the fact you sent a 4 by 4 truck covered in C4 explosives hurtling into a military base that seems to have a particular need for massive tankers filled with petrol in highly exposed and vulnerable areas and leap out, materializing yet another one of Rico Rodriguez's seemly endless parachutes from what appears to be the aether, and glide over as tanks of petrol, oil pipelines, telecommunication dishs, radars and towers made from corrugated iron all explode in a massive fireball about as bright as the sun whilst you pick off any remaining survivors with a gatling gun that you ripped off a turret point, as well as annihilate an attack helicopter piloted by a particularly angry government soldier. So yes, I recommend Just Cause 2.			",65,12,0,3,7,0,2

												Just cause 2 is a fun game – but its hard to quantify exactly why.Just cause 2 is kind of like a ridiculous made-for-TV action movie.  The acting (or voice acting) is terrible.  The graphics are quite dated.  You can blow up a building with a couple of shots from your desert eagle.  You can basically fly using your tractor cable.But the game is simply fun!  I don't usually like games that are too unrealistic.  But in this case I think the game works because the developers understood that it was meant to be an unrealistic and crazy action game.Unfortunately, the game crashes frequently.  In 87 minutes of game play it has crashed on me 3 times with a “just cause 2 has stopped working” message.  I'm not sure if it's because the game wasn't made for Windows 8 and is having compatibility issues or if it's just buggy.  However, the latter seems most likely as a quick Google search reveals a long list of bug complaints that have gone unfixed for years.  So for that reason I put the game at 3/5 stars.Link to bugs http://justcause.wikia.com/wiki/Just_Cause_2_Bugs_and_glitches ",242,61,10,29,32,0,23

												I've never had so much fun in ages as i now get playing Just Cause 2! It's really crazy and stupid at some points, and that's what makes it so addicting and fun to play! The graphics are outstanding, huge open world sandbox game, TONS of stuff to do!Some annoying things would be not-so-good controls, really annoying voice-actors, dumb plot in the campaign and other minor things, BUT compared to everything else, those are small things, and you WILL enjoy JC2 - must buy!

												Just Cause 2 is immense.  The gameplay of GTA but with a combat oriented missions.  If you love a secret agent themed story, the ability to use a myriad of weapons, boats, cars, bikes and places to cause untold destruction and havoc, this is the game for you.  One of the few games Ive spend 250+ hours playing, despite the repetitive gameplay, the action rarely gets boring.  The mission goals are coupled well achievements and together just keep you playing for one more mission longer.  Everything about the game screams quality, from the chessy voice-acting, the lush enviroment and settings, to the wonderfully rendered vehicles and characters.This is not a serious game but, its full-bodied serious action is unique in the 200+ games Ive played.  An inperfect game, but definitely my favourite one of all time.Unmissable!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A really love this game. It's kind of like GTA, if GTA had three times as many explosions. It has a gigantic map, and beautiful landscapes. You will spend hours trying to find every last collectable and destructable item, and it's very fun. At the time of this review, I had 17 hours in the game, but I was only about 40% through the game. This game is one of my all-time favorite games, and I cannot recommend it enough. To make this game even better, the free multiplayer DLC is amazing too.			",113,10,0,3,14,1,5

												A beautiful sandbox game about overthrowing the Government of Panau on a quest to find out the true reason and purpose of why you were sent to assassinate the man who thought you everything you know (Being a badass wize)Gameplay:Your given all you’ll need (not as 1st but as you progress) to start enjoying yourself as you rip about Military establishments and resources in efforts to gain “Chaos points” that contribute to progressing the story (It’s to simulated how far you throw the Island in anarchy [but sadly the islands citizens are to poor/lazy to even show their world is going to hell no matter how far you progress)]Driving in this game feels great except for the few situations where you’re driving a vehicle on a terrain is shouldn’t be driving on but don’t worry, the game gives you a set of “Agency Vehicles” that should be able to hand the rough island of Panau better than the citizens “budget cars”Flying is a little less great compare to driving mostly due to the lack of speed control and your plane relationship to water. Helicopters on the other hand is almost the polar opposite of the problem, since you their control way of taking off and landing and having the ability to take your time dealing damage with them instead of worrying of crashing when swopping. Ground controls may be tedious at times (when dealing with climbing mountains) but the grappling hook ability combined with the parachute makes it fairly easy to get where you want after taking some times to keen your skills on the controlsVisuals: In my opinion even in today time, this game is one of the best looking games on PC. The world is set on a tropically island and during the day you get the full range of vivid colors of the jungle of Panau while during the night you get a overtone of blue with the specs of light in the world shinning over the water. There also rain weather that happens randomly throughout the game but I’m not sure if there is a “Blizzard” variant. The games looks its best at the twilight and dawn hours of the day where you can see the sunset in all its glory attempting to reach over the horizon as it slowly descents into night .Story: The mainstory line is ok (nothing to special about it) but the Factions missions are pretty much a ongoing joke compare to it. Mostly the missions are used to make you participate in events full of all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥shit the devs thought of for you. Sometimes the mission isn’t that interesting along the faction timeline but there are a few jems that makes it worth it to play through all the factions missions regardless of how you feel about the morality of each of them.DLC: Some of the DLC in the game is truly unnecessary, I’m just going to give you a list of what not to get and you can determine wheatear or you want the restDO NOT GET: Bull Eye’s Sniper (Less damage Sniper riffle with the return of faster firing and more ammo, it takes 2 heashots to kill the Commando type enemies)Rico Signature gun (Pretty much a fully upgrade revolver fun at 1st, useless latter when you realized what I did)Maybe: Black market Boom pack (Never found myself to have much used for these weapons ingame but if you’re planning for online multiplayer I think these weapons will serve you much better there)What made me loss my motive to complete the game to 75% (for achivement purposes) is not the time I had on me in this moment of time, its that I just lost intrest after I finish all the faction missions + Agency missions were complete and the game turn into bassically into a Find n' seek blow them up.

												This game is fun when played in short bursts...its fun to just run around blowing stuff up, but it gets really annoying if you play for an extended period. It crashes a lot, the controls for flying planes are incredibly awkward, enemy AI is obnoxious, story missions (both main mission and side missions) are really contrived and boring, and the physics for driving cars almost kills any fun you can have from then, which is too bad, considering how massive the map is, and how much fun it is to drive across. When you start going fast in pretty much any car, if you spin or drift just a little bit, you flip all over and fly a few hundred feet. When you hit any little bump, you get hurtled into the air and it happens again. So, basically, you can manage to ignore all these stupid things if you play for short periods of time...and it is worth playing...so much stuff to blow up, and a huge, diverse map...its just too bad it has so many obnoxious and frustrating problems.

												Filled with explosions, collectibles, and achievements.... what more could you possibly want?! o.OOn a more serious note - the only issue with this game is the frame-rate. Most of thecomps that run it seem to experience lag, even budget ""gaming"" computers. You can play around it, but it can make your character a little hard to control...			",354,134,6,48,32,4,62

												This game is all about fun. total nonsense physics and nearly no story. Avoid this game if you require an in depth story.  If you want some mindless over the top absurd fun and dont care about the story then I highly reccommend this one.  on sale for just 4.72for everything but the guide. wtch has some kinda of stupid DRM to it i bought it and can NOT reccomend it to any one. Game 2 thumbs WAY up guide ill stick with 2 thumbs down only because i have only 2.			",402,99,17,80,24,7,77

Just Cause it’s fun TL;DR Just cause 2 is a fantastic open world game with so much content to explore. Blow your way through Panau using enemies and objects as weapons. The grappling hook in this game is your best friend , it can be a great way to move around or a fun tool for attaching enemies to moving vehicles. With many secrets to find this game will have you playing for days. The only downside being is that the story is just thrown in and you wont remember it.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Huge explorable mapsSatisfying explosionsHuge variety in vehiclesFilled with entertaining events Cons Very weak storyPoor quality cutscenes---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayWith just the grappling hook there are so many ways that you can cause chaos all over Panau. The game world is your playground with a near endless amount of destruction to be caused, there is no real punishment for attacking anyone but attacking the military is a better idea because the send reinforcements to be played with. Even though driving is slower than just grappling around all vehicles control so well and can be used in interesting ways to destroy the environment. StoryThe story is the weakest part of just cause because of how little it matters, While having some amusing references to real world politics. Characters The character in just cause are just stereotypical of certain culture and none of them seem to care about the destruction you bring with you. Every single time you interact with an npc to start a mission they basically always ask you to blow everything up till you win. Art/Graphics The massive map gives a plethora of beautiful environments, everything you can see on the map you can explore and there are many secrets to find. The world feels very natural as they mix purely natural areas and a few miles away there are military districts and towns. The games color pallet is never dull even in rain storms there are bright mixes of colors that look amazing.Bonus Notes The games DLCs are just things that max the game more silly and would agree getting them if they are in a bundle. Just cause 2 is one of the best open world games and will give hours of entertainment.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												Had to get to the other side of the island and my stolen helicopter was too slow...so I hijacked a 747  that happened to cross my flight path.  Half-way to my destination I spotted a military base that looked like it needed blowing up so I ditched the 747 (I'm sure the passengers were fine) and parachuted down to the base, stole an attack helicopter, and laid waste to the base. Just another day working for the agency.			",164,21,0,20,6,0,16

												If you like open-world chaos-causing action games this one is definitely worth the few dollars you can buy it for.  It features an absolutely huge open world (GTA, Far Cry, etc have nothing on this map size).There is a lot of variety in missions, side quests, vehicles, collectibles, etc.You have a hook that fires off of a device on your arm which you can use for climbing mountains, buildings - or just open your parachute and use the hook to keep pulling yourself forward to fly around!You can fly jets, get out, stand on top of them and shoot things.  I mean, it's rediculous.There's also a free multiplayer mod now that is kind of fun.My only complaint is that vehicles handle a bit odd, but you get used to it.			",66,0,1,1,3,0,8

People compare it to GTA and they really shouldn't, both are sandboxes but in my opionion GTA takes its story a bit more seriously and the mutiplayer is a different beast.

												Just Cause 2 remains to be one of my favorite games even though it's 5 years old. Just Cause 2 managed to give me around ~500 hours of gameplay on Steam and X360 combined. Even though the story is short and bland, the gameplay managed to keep going back to it.GameplayThe gameplay might seem repetitive to some, but usually is blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥while preventing yourself from being killed by Baby Panay's military forces. On freemode, you mainly go around the vast amount of cities in the game and destroying objects that help you ""capture"" a town so you can get 100%. The game mainly tries to attract people who like explosions and creative ways to kill people to try to detract from its repetitive feel.			",73,2,1,5,7,0,6

												To get this out of the way, this is not a game which will impress you with a great storyline. The voice acting is pretty terrible, a lot of the missions are pretty cliche etc. But that's all the negatives I can think of. The gameplay itself is where Just Cause 2 shines. A lot of epic, fast-paced action, Hollywood explosion escapes, loads of baddies to slaughter, a ridiculously large, beautiful world to explore with the help of your hookshot and parachute - there's just so much to do in Panau!

												My favorite video game ever. I think this game is HIGHLY underrated and is amazing. The world size and graphics are outstanding. I find it unbelievable that this game came out four years ago and still looks better than many games today *Cough* Watch Dogs *Cough* Call of Duty *Cough* Also the stunting iin this game is fantastic. The endless possibilities with stunt jumping, surfing on planes, grappling from car to car, the amazing combination of the stunt parachute and grapple makes travelling a ton of fun.Whilst the story is not amazing, the pacing of the game is great, always putting you in great action setpieces. The missions are all incredibly fun, whilst the takeovers may be a bit repetitive they are still great fun to do.So yeah PLAY THIS GAME!!!!			",105,9,3,8,8,0,6

												After playing the game for 2 hours (approx.), I find it sufficient to review the game. + The story seems pretty good.+ The graphics are very good for a game which was ""made"" in 2010.+ The stunts are brilliant.+ Black market stuff and all the other things within the game are good.The only thing which is annoying about the game is that crashes every now and then (though I have experienced it twice only).

												There are a lot of improvements from his antecesor.The driving it's stable, but you still can't shoot your weapons from any vehicle while the others still can. It's true that the police it's able to shoot you from their cars because it's the passenger that does it. But the ones that drives the motorcycle doesn't have passengers and they still can shoot you while driving. But now you don't drive very often since you have a better way of transportation: Your grappling hook and parachute. They have created the best way to travel around the island. By just grappling something and opening your parachute you can go faster than a car and you don't need to worry about what is ahead of you. The only thing that is better than this it's just the helicopters and jets. The helicopters because you can attack your enemies more efficiently and the jets because you can travel the island faster. You can also climb with it and it makes running and walking very obsolete. It's like the whip in Super Castlevania IV. You can do everything with it and it makes everything more easy for you to do.The shooting system has been improved too. The ability of using 2 single handled weapons can make you clean an area very fast. Rocket launchers are useful now that you can have more ammo with it.Enemy helicopters are more forgiving now that they don't spam you with rockets every time you are on a vehicle. They are still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's a balanced pain.The missions are entertaining and if you fail it's because it was your fault, not theirs. But I hate that sometimes they tell you what you have to do after wandering in circles while everyone shoots you.The multiplayer mod it's just that. You and a bunch of players in one big island as a playground. Some servers let you join a team, play custom missions, or just be a free for all where you all fight in the rave club because why not.I recommend buying it with the Just Cause Collection. It comes with the DLC and the first Just Cause. So you can also experience how bad it's the prequel by itself and in comparison with this one.			",414,109,15,30,28,9,40

												I first played the demo and then got the game. The controls are a bit different than what I'm used to in games but, they will come to me soon enough. It seems to be pretty fun and different. There's no real direction other than the bit of story that come with it. I think I'll like it and it's worth trying out for everyone. There's a lot to do and master as well. Definetly a plus game for fun and excitement. Now, if they can get to work on making MP work and have Dedicated Servers for all to enjoy and not just one that is crowded. Something lie SEV2 has.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game that will knock you're socks off, constantly. The graphics are breathtaking even in 2014 (arguably better than some other games currently out on the market.) The game play is good, consistant, although, the driving feels like the roads are ice instead of asphalt, the bikes are my favorite mode of transportation. This goes on sale, OFTEN. If you feel like you don't want to shell out 3 dosh for this, you are missing out on a great opportunity to experience to explore one of the more expansive and beautiful open world games in the early dawn of this century. For those of you just buying it for the multiplayer mod, thats fine too. It's a must to get that mod with it, but you would be just scratching the surface. The modding community for just cause 2 is expansive. i reccomend that you take some time to check out www.justcause2mods.com. The mods are free and so is sign up. The campaign isn't really anything to write home about, same blockbuster action with some cheap thrills mixed in there.If you are looking for an expansive open world game look no farther. Decent gameplay, amazing graphics and an all inclusive modding community make this one of the best games i have had the privileged experience of owning twice and spent countless hours on. Bottom line: ITS WORTH IT. GET IT!			",156,12,1,7,20,0,25

												Just Cause 2 isn't your average Third-Person Shooter game, it's a completely unique twist.  This game is all about HOOKS, GUNS, DIVES and DESTRUCTION.+ Satisfying Action.+ Plenty of variety among vehicles; - A little less in guns though.+ Controls are easy to learn and use.+ Grappling hook mechanism is really fun to use and very well implemented.+ Even though the game was released in 2010, the Graphics are pretty darn good.+ The MAP is HUGE and takes a lot of time to explore. It has lots of scenery, moutains, water bodies, objects, building and much more.+ Game provides a lot of freedom, which is hard to find by in recent titles.+ Game has full 360 Controller Support, but I prefer KB/M because of the precision aim required to land hooks in extremely bizzare ways :)- Story sucks. (This was a huge turnoff for me atleast.)- Most of the missions are exactly the same damn thing again and again. You will do the exact same thing just at a different place with different clothed allies.- Unless you like to destroy everything, attach objects with hook for no-reason and do crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥. you'll get bored easily.- Game has some stability issues and crashed 3 times on my PC in 3 hours of gameplay. - The saving feature sucks, sometimes it over-writes your manual save with auto-saves. It auto-saves when you die, so the last checkpoint during a long mission is usually somewhere near the start of the mission.A lot of my friends just absolutely adored this game because of the freedom, flexibility it provides. The game will also tolerate any crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥you want to do and you will have an amazing blast if you are that kind of a person.  But for me, I look more in a game. I look for immersiveness and the ability of the game to keep me interested in it at all times.Final Thoughts:I got the game for about $3-4 and it was well worth the price.  I'm going to 'RECOMMEND' this game if you can get it within $7.5 which really ins't hard since the game is 4 years old and goes on sale pretty often.			",22,6,0,2,6,0,2

												This should have been the gamers' game of the year. will start off from the very thing that got me hooked to this game.It's the map. This game has the second biggest game map ever created to date (I was told that FUEL has the biggest map which is 5,560 square miles)Just cause 2 map is 37 by 37 kilometers. A couple of kilometers on each side of the square map is water, so let's go by 35 by 35 kilometers. Multiply 35 by 35 and there you go - you have 1,225 square kilometers of map to explore, give or take 100 square kilometers.For the comparison, let's take the Fallout 3 map. That map is about 35 square kilometers.The Oblivion 4 map is roughly the same size.GTA 3 is 35-36 square kilometersGTA 4 is 15 square kilometersAnd I thought the Far Cry 2 map was huge. It's 50 square kilometers.The ARMA 2 map was definitely the biggest one before Just Cause 2 stepped in. The most important reason why i bought the disappointingly unoptimized ARMA 2 is to simply explore the roughly 400 square kilometers map.I remember wondering when I was younger if they would ever make a big enough map for a game which I could explore for days and days and days. I thought they finally did that with Arma 2, and despite the fact that I still could not play the game on maximum settings even when my rig should have easily taken on almost 2 ARMA 2's (According to the ""recommended settings""), I still loved the fact that I could enjoy the country-side that I haven't been to in years.The second thing is that we ACTUALLY have directx 10 in this game. FINALLY, how many more directx 9 games are we going to have? We have directx 11 already, so what's the deal? The directx 10 pretty much seals the deal and completes the game map that I still cannot believe they made. I also cannot believe that the entire game fits on a DVD, how the HELL do they pull that off? shouldn't the map this size be at least 30 GB? I mean Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventure is like a 30-35 GB game.Well, the third thing is... Ah what the hell, you know the rest. Complete freedom of action, unrealistic stunts, the temporary to permanent abandonment of the laws of physics, infinite parachute, a hundred of drivable vehicles, a cute Easter egg, the Hatch from the first and second seasons of LOST, the pleasure of having to spend 20 minutes just to fly from one end of the map to another on a stolen government jet, the joy of swimming in the sea (wish they had sharks though), the eye candy explosions that you never get tired off, the realistic driving of the vehicles (aside from the way they rotate in mid air sometimes), the realistic damage to the PARTS OF THE VEHICLES THAT WERE ACTUALLY DAMAGED IN THE IMPACT, I could go on and on about this gameIm also playing this game on IMPOSSIBLE and find it quite easy to beat. You just move constantly, shoot (There is sadly a default auto-aim option enabled that you cannot disable) and press ""tab"" or whatever you have to evade bullets. HOWEVER, a nearby grenade explosion is almost guaranteed to kill you, so for MAXIMUM realism, I recommend playing this game on IMPOSSIBLEIm not gonna complain about the check point system, I love the checkpoint system. it makes games more challenging. Plus there still is a SAVE option, although it doesnt work in its original meaningThe story is blah. Who cares? Some of the missions that they give you though are somewhat original and a breath of fresh air from some of the repetitive GTA missions. However, most of those missions are, attack, kill, destroy, blow up, move on. It would have been nice if they added an element of stealth to the game though. It would feel great if could actually play as a somewhat silent or stealthy lethal saboteur. I would also like it if they imposed a penalty for killing civilians both on purpose and incidentally.I know this game won't win the game of the year award since there is no real substance I guess, but unofficially, this will probably be the gamer's choice No 1 game of 2010. (I hope Metro 2033 wins the game of the year though, which I rationally know it won't)This game is a pinnacle of guilty pleasure if I can say that. It absorbs so much of my time that I barely have enough time for myself, and its only my second-third day of playing the game. For the third day in the row I come to work late with blood-shot eyes. I actually prefer to staying home and playing this game all weekend and after that, instead of going out with my gf. That's how much impact this game had on me.If you are an extremely busy person with a busy schedule, i do not recommend playing this game until you find some time to kill, otherwise you'd get the plants vs zombies syndrome, where you cannot stop playing the game and start missing out on life. But I guess, now it's gonna be the Just cause 2 syndromeI don't want to get emo about this but I'll say honestly that it's actually games like these that make me sorta happy that I was born with enough luck and resources to actually play them, but I'm only speaking for myself here.Until then, the most rational case for you is to buy this game, support the developers and enjoy it fully until your eyes bleed and your brain melts, since forgetting about reality as much as possible should be the just cause of all gamers.

												Well if you're into action packed game that has nothing else to offer but action , then this game is good for you.Basically i didn't have fun playing this game as its just stupidly repetitive , there's almost no story or something interactive to do than just killing people , blowing up some building and using every vehicle you could possibly think of.-Gameplay: there're lots of notes about it positive and negative: 1 ) character control is pretty much smooth and easy to use 2 ) vehicles controls are pretty much the best thing about this game 3 ) some missions can be glitched or bugged (which can ruin ur whole game completion)-Story: trash , short , stupid and pointless sort of.-Graphics: are fairly decent for the year of release and price.6/10 not worth full price at all , i'd recommend getting it at 85% discount or something.

Steal a car, loose control, crash it into a gas station, this starts a 20 minute firefight with the military which ends with you hijacking a helicopter (in mid-air, mind you), flying off into the mountains, ditching it in a forest, and laying low until they back off.  Something this ridiculous will happen each and every time you play.  And it never gets old.			",116,13,0,10,13,0,9

												Just Cause 2 is the sandbox genre DONE RIGHT. It's not subtle or entirely realistic, and it knows it. Some of the combinations you can pull off are hilarious and amazing. The controls feel fantastic, and vehicles have a wide range of feel to them. The dialogue is horrible. Horribly AWESOME. The graphics are top-notch, every few seconds is a perfect screenshot waiting to happen. Lots of destruction, lots of options, and the grapple/hookshot is a solid gameplay design desicion, not just a gimmick. It doesn't have a terribly deep story or characters like GTA, but it makes up for it just by being ridiculously fun.I'm starting to think Squeenix should just make these games instead of FF from now on. I can't remember the last time I cared about a FF game. 9/10			",257,74,5,20,26,3,26

												Really good open world game with lots of destruction and an interesting gameplay mechanic that hooks you into the game. With the grapple hook and parachute you can go anywhere quickly and efficiently (No walking for minutes on end). The graphics are also quite nice and it runs well even if you don't have a gming PC (40 fps on high settings on my laptop). The setting of the game also differs from the usual city you usually see in open world games, and is a beautiful island with many settlements, mountains, military bases, and destructable objects. My only complaints with the game is that the isn't really a big enough variety of Cars and there is virtually no cunstomization for your character. Other than that its definetly a must buy at $15 and can easly provide over a hundred hours of gameplay (I played 30 hours and im only 40% done the game, even though I finished the story).

												Just Cause2 is an action adventure style game with an amazing open world experience. Everything in the game is drivable ranging from cars and tanks to military grade jets or civilian air craft.Your a agent with an amazing set of skills setting out on a mission to stop the islands dictator. You'll blast your way through armies and ravange through hundreads of towns, bases, cfities, and harbors to see to his end.It has several dlc that will add in things that you can purchase from the store as you wrack up money blowing things up. Things like guns, ammo, planes, tanks and cars.This is an amazing game though the downside being its very repetetive once you beat the game leaving you to complete side missions and liberate all the towns. But if you enjoy a free roam game that has amazing scenory and a large map to explore this is deffintly a game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is amazing. It brilliantly mixes a gorgeous, tropical open world, full of lush vegetation and towering mountains, with a fast pace, high octane action that looks like it just came out of an action movie. The campaign seems generic at first, all about the political issues of the island of Panau, but when coupled with the slightly strange protagonist, Rico, it creates a humorous adventure. I highly recomend this game, because, as well as all the features described in this ""review"", its only £9.99!			",139,20,2,8,12,1,6

												Just Cause 2 is the single best open world action title released to date. There is no other game that allows you to do anywhere near as much as this game does, no other title gives you such an enormous sense of freedom and satisfaction. The game is visually stunning and contains some of the most exciting and beautiful moments I have ever witnessed whilst playing.The gameplay system gives players a variety of ways in which to move around their world and explore the beautiful tropical island of Panau, starting the player of immediately with a grappling hook-parachute combo that is a fantastic innovation by square enix. You are able to slingshot yourself using your grapple hook and parachute in unision, paraglide of the back of a boat, or -if you purchase the DLC- you can fly around using your parachute thrusters which are fantastic. The hook is fast and precise and very fun once you learn to use it effectively; it also allows you to 'Dual hook' objects and entities together for some entertaining results.The story isn't great and the voice acting is horrible, but I almost wonder whether this is the game poking fun at action movies that often suffer these tropes, however this dosn't detract from the experience much as the missions themselves are greatly varied and interesting.The DLC is reasonably priced and well worth shelling out a few dollars for as they add some great new weapons and wehicles. I particularly favour the parachute thrusters and the Air Gun that fires compressed air to blast enemies and vehicles high into the sky!If you like open world games then this is definitely one to look at, I have played for over 100 hours and I'm ready for the next  100 (: so go on, buy the game!

												Who knew grappling hooks could be so much fun, one thing I like to do, is stand on the roof of a car and when I see a dude coming from the opposite direction on a motorbike I quickly attach the hook to him and the road then watch him get yanked off of his bike :D this can also be used against cars chasing, much more hilarious on bridge rods though.Also, attach a car to a helicopter and you have your own personal wrecking ball.

												Just Cause 2 is an amazing sandbox game. After the first two cheesily bad missions, you're dropped right smack in the center of Panau, a small totalitarian country of islands, with few guns or grenades and all cities occupied by the government. As you gain in strength, upgrading weapons, vehicles, and your health, you become stronger.      As you work with 3 different criminal factions, the government loses territory. There are 3 factions: The Roaches, a mafia of sorts with a leader who speaks in medical terms; the Reapers, Panau's own branch of the Communist Party; and the Ular Boys, strong traditionalists opposed to all foreign customs.           There are vehicles galore (though too many Tuk-Tuks and motor scooters) and lots of collectibles and destructibles. Much of the world is empty, but when you steal a tank and go on an explosive rampage, you tend not to notice these things. Overall, worth the price whether it's on sale or not.			",115,8,1,4,11,1,3

												Really good open world game with lots of destruction and an interesting gameplay mechanic that hooks you into the game. With the grapple hook and parachute you can go anywhere quickly and efficiently (No walking for minutes on end). The graphics are also quite nice and it runs well even if you don't have a gming PC (40 fps on high settings on my laptop). The setting of the game also differs from the usual city you usually see in open world games, and is a beautiful island with many settlements, mountains, military bases, and destructable objects. My only complaints with the game is that the isn't really a big enough variety of Cars and there is virtually no cunstomization for your character. Other than that its definetly a must buy at $15 and can easly provide over a hundred hours of gameplay (I played 30 hours and im only 40% done the game, even though I finished the story).

There so many things you can do: Distorying anything you see, Race with Jats, coppers, race cards more, Explore this amazing island and just so much more.Now when the price for it is only freaking 3 dollars with the online mod there is no reason you shouldn't buy this.

												  Just Cause 2 is an open world/sandbox action game that highly encourages Exploration. In this game you play as a man named ""Rico Rodriguez"" who is air dropped onto the fictional ""Island of Panau"" in order to find an Agency operative (the same Agency Rico is in) who has defected and gone rogue. You are freely allowed and encouraged to cause as much chaos and destruction on the fictional Island as possible, in order to spark a civilian resistance against the Island's ruthless Dictator, a man nick-named ""Baby Panay"".  In JC2, you earn ""Chaos points"" for causing Chaos (destroying buildings, killing enemies, sabotaging pipelines, assassinating military targets, or in general destroying anything that belongs to the Panuan government), which you can then use to unlock Main Story missions. Most of the Gameplay revolves around either exploring the Massive 400 Sq Mi island, doing missions, or in general causing chaos and/or destruction. You are given a small variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, machine guns and sniper rifles. You are also given a grappling hook that you can use to hook on to things, tether things together, or for use as a melee weapon.  The game has a faction system; there are three different factions you are allowed to join and become a member of. You can partake in Faction missions (which usually involve doing miscallenous tasks, such as hijacking a truck for example). The first Faction, named the ""Ular Boys"", have the eventual goal of turning Panau into an isolated nation, free of any and all government oppression/influence. The second Faction, named ""The Reapers"", believe Panau should be a controlled, communist nation. The third and final Faction, named ""The Roaches"", are a criminal syndicate and consequentially the most crime-oriented faction of the trio.  The game's graphics are very eye-catching and still hold up today. You can see the sun's light rays shine through the trees, every tire track on the highly detailed textures of the dirt roads, and every individual ripple in the very aesthetically-appealing water. With the game set to max, you wouldn't be able to guess this game was released in 2010. Gaming standards have really come a long way. Long gone are the days of ""Half-Life"" and ""Rainbow Six"", when the graphics were blocky and slightly unbelievable (but still great for their time). Game developers now focus on the graphical qualities/abilties of their video games, and it really pays off in the long run. However, I still believe the Gameplay aspect of any video game should be its primary focus, because thats where most of the heart and soul should go into.  Just Cause 2 is a very detailed and rich video game, that is not only very attractive, but also significant in the amount of general things to do. Some could argue that the game can get repetitive after the Main Story has been beaten and most of the Side Missions as well. This can hold true for some, however (even though I still have yet to beat the Main Story), I strongly believe this game can stil stay as fresh and vibrant as your first playthrough, solely due to the fact that the game is a giant, living Toybox just waiting for you to come and play. I find it immensely satsifying to use the grappling hook to board a plane mid-air, or tether an Enemy to the back of your car as you go for a ride, or even just in general exploring parts of the Island you either haven't seen before or haven't seen in a while (which will most likely be common, as the Map is really huge, it's hard not to miss things). In general, I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of Open-World Sandbox videogames.  My Final Rating: 8.5/10  ",88,6,1,6,6,0,7

												Just Cause 2 was a game I've looked into for a while, but never really thought about getting. Once it was sold for under $4 during a sale I had to give it a shot. This game was worth it, and I've sunk many hours into it quickly.Just Cause 2 really sticks next to it's name. Why? Just cause! Why else would you go into a millitary base, bombard it with a jet, dive bomb the plane into the raido tower and then drive a car off a cliff to give a horrific flash back when you rolled your car that one day.It really is a interesting experience, but the campains, either the main one or sides missions, are very repetative. The storyline is quite weak and is easily forgotten during the gameplay as you blow up more oil rigs.But the gameplay is what makes it worth purchasing. It's got an odd Grand Theft Auto: San Adreas feel to it. You know? The day you only have a half hour to kill beofre going to do something, so you load up the game to cause mass chaos and fear until you have to go. It's one of those games, and it does it quite well.Pros:Good gameplayDecent mechanicsNice graphics and aestheticMap size bigger than anything I've seen, even bigger than GTA VInteresting ways to use your grappling hookCons:Little money rewards and expensive weapons and vehiclesThe large map means that most places look the sameThe AI isn't very smartPlanes will explode when touching anything, even at speeds that you can out runMy rating 8/10, worth the purchase, at retail or sale price.

												Back when i was a kid, GTA Vice City was ""the sh!t"". Everybody played it, loved it, and so was I. Ever since then, free-roaming games have earned it's spot in my heart, and i always thrive to play a good one. Just Cause 2 doesn't only prove to me that it's a great game, this thing also brought back some great excitement like Vice City did to me in the past.Quick, short review on pros and cons :+ Good combat system with various weapons+ Decent story+ Many vehicles to toy with+ A lot of achievements and stuffs that requires many hours of play time, you won't complete the game 100% anytime soon- Controlling planes is really hard- The strory are filled with small missions, can be really messy sometimes- AI is not really smart, both allies and enemies- Scorpio fails as a characterOverall score : 7.5/10Should get it if u like free-roaming games AND the game is on sale for around 75-80%			",48,3,0,6,0,0,3

												First of all, I've purchased this game on sale, and it was worth every single cent. Currently I'm playing through the campaign - and one of the first things that immediately strike me is the HUGE size of the map! Wow, driving from one end to the other takes forever. Overall physics and game mechanics are very well written and fluid. The signature grappling hook defines the entire game, and makes it unique. Jumping, firing weapons and moving around is a pleasure.Although the storyline is good so far, I find it slightly corny, although it doesn't bug me too much - the gameplay takes your mind off that. The language seems to be a butchered mix of Malay, Indonesian and some Tagalog, and the writing and the script seems to be written in Thai? Hmm.In a nutshell: BUY THE GAME. You won't regret it.

												Simply no reason not to have played this game if you have the hardware for it.  Outstanding visuals that are very well optimized.  Most of the missions in the game will leave you patting yourself on the back for being such a badass, and turn you into a condescending PC elitist when you see what your rig is capable of.  While there is a slight learning curve on the controls, halfway through the game youll be able to do things with precision unrivaled by many games.Some complaints:  I've found little use for land vehicles considering how many are available.  What I mean by this is that once you figure out the tricks of the parachute, you'll realize that with some skill, you can achieve a very respectable speed without the limitation of terrain.  Also some of the locations not attached to a mission feel copied and pasted, but are still fun to navigate, and possibly the cost of having such a large sandbox to play with your toys in.  More missions would've probably fixed this.  DLC?			",271,32,2,32,8,1,14

												Don't look at the Steam stats, I've played this game for many hours on the PS3...and that was just a demo. It's good enough to keep me replaying the same 15 minutes over and over again because it's just that fun. Blowing up broadcast towers with a pistol, swinging through the air on a grappling hook hanging from a statue and then landing on the ground perfectly fine, to proceed to kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of enemies and come out without a scratch. PROS:+ Excellent visuals for a 2010 game+ Endless hours of explosions and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that+ Can slingshot through the air+ Explosions+ Able to leap from a plane and deploy your parachute 3 feet from the ground and land perfectly safe+ Explosions+ Great controls on PC, despite being made on console+ ExplosionsCONS:- Runs a little dodgy on PC, working components way harder than necessary- Difficulty spikes are terrible: can go from taking down thirty weak enemies and blowing up a silo without needing a health pack to dying twenty times over and over because there's a wave of fifteen heavily-armoured enemies coming straight for you			",145,16,0,15,9,1,4

												A superb game with a riveting plot and fantastic character development!...Is not how this game should be described.It actually is an open world where you can roam around and blow stuff up. There is a story line, but it is so ridiculous that you should only go into it with the expectation of laughing /at/ the story rather than with it.An excellent place to explore and destroy, and one of my favorite games. The physics has plenty of moments that will leave you scratching your head (Like riding on top of a fighter jet, and shooting a grappling hook at the ground and pulling yourself towards it to avoid fall damage), but all in all it is a great game if you just want to drive around and make things explode.

												With South American flare and cheesy over-the-top puns, Just Cause 2 bursts onto the screen with all the James Bond-esque action and explosions imaginable. Playing as rogue assassin Rico Rodriguez, you fight your way across the fictional country of Panau, trying to take down an evil despot with the help of some of the most memorable characters to graze the screen. While ridiculously over the top, Just Cause 2 enhances virtually everything that made the first installment so much fun, with an amazing spectacle of explosions, beautiful vistas and ridiculously ludicrous stunts. Definitely bang for your buck.VERDICT: 9/10			",218,45,16,15,21,0,21

												Quite simply the most fun I have ever had playing a computer game.  I originally tried the demo and that alone was so good that I was hooked to see what crazy things you can get Rico to do.  The demo was limited in area as to where you could go, so I had to have the full game.  As you can see I've played it quite a bit over the years.  The storyline isn't the best out there, but I don't think the developers had the story as their main priority when they were making it.  This game is all about the free to explore open world and Ricos grappling hook & parachute which you can deploy in various different ways.  I do have other FPS in my collection, which are considered good games, but I just keep on coming back to Just Cause 2, simply because It's just such fun!  I definetly think the tropical island paradise thing helps games like this, and This game will probably only be trumped in my eyes by Just Cause 3.			",13,0,1,1,2,0,0

In Just Cause 2, you could do that, OR you could tether a bad guy to a propane tank and shoot that instead.There are millions of cool and silly things to do in Panau, and most of them will end up with you having a goofy grin on your face, saying ""I can't believe I just did that.""

The story is stupid, the voice acting is awful, the enemy AI is a nuissance.  However, the dicking around part is fun.  You fart infinite parachutes & can Spiderman your way around.  There is no stealth option, but you can always escape.  Its a GTA ripoff, but it has some unique parts to it and the silliness of spiderman parachuting around the island is fun.  The achievements literally encourage you to find creative ways to kill people while you're dicking around.$2-3 game at most, don't buy any of the DLC.			",191,19,8,12,10,1,9

Wikipedia says he's from Montana.I don't think Panau is in Montana. I don't see it on the map anywhere.Maybe one his parents was some kinda immigrant or something? He looks pretty white to me in his pictures. And another thing, the guy you play as in the game looks NOTHING like him.This game is a nightmare when it comes to historical accuracy.

												Pretty good game, with a ridiculous amount of area to explore, but the best thing is it runs on my sh*tty laptop at 50 fps on medium settings, the only downside is some of the DLC like the parachutes they reset when u die, restart a checkpoint or leave the game, and since they are not cheap (50000 $) its kinda badly designed, but overall its a very good game.

												Over the top, ridiculously fun.  Like Saint's Row 2, it takes all the fun parts of the GTA series and none of the ""serious bits"" and lets the player romp across a MASSIVE island filled with loads of toys (helicopters, boats, motorcycles, rocket launchers, etc) to wreck havoc.  The hookshot and parachute mechanics are excellent and add a whole dimension to transportation.  Highly recommended.			",294,111,4,36,19,3,37

												With South American flare and cheesy over-the-top puns, Just Cause 2 bursts onto the screen with all the James Bond-esque action and explosions imaginable. Playing as rogue assassin Rico Rodriguez, you fight your way across the fictional country of Panau, trying to take down an evil despot with the help of some of the most memorable characters to graze the screen. While ridiculously over the top, Just Cause 2 enhances virtually everything that made the first installment so much fun, with an amazing spectacle of explosions, beautiful vistas and ridiculously ludicrous stunts. Definitely bang for your buck.VERDICT: 9/10			",218,45,16,15,21,0,21

												Just Cause 2 sports more style than substance.  But, that doesn't take away from the breathtaking open world of Panau.  Story wise is pretty much like the last game and is very forgettable, ""Overthrow a corrupt Government by causing chaos in the region"".  The main character ""Rico"" is a very generic action hero badass who is pretty much the equivilance of every 1980s action hero that creates the character.  I felt like the lack of character development and story is done on purpose because really, it's not all that important.  The reason however why most of the substance flaws are made up is because of how much effort Avalance Studious took their time to make the beautiful world as well as the masterfully executed gameplay mechanics this game has to offer including the infamous ""grappling hook"".  Overall, the story is not important but I recommend this game for the open world exploration, action, and many features of mass chaos.By the way if you don't already know, there is a bug that if you complete the full game of Just Cause 2, it will say 99.99%.  If this happens don't worry because this is only a minor bug and the developers are not supporting the game anymore because of Just Cause 3. Also, this game doesn't have mulitplayer, but there's a mod that someone created and is avalible on steam right now.			",91,0,0,3,4,0,1

												Not a bad game, kind of like GTA on meth. Pretty amazing graphics given it's age too. Can be a bit repetitive though, and it has utterly terrible AI and more than a few bugs, with the absolute worst cut-scenes I've ever seen. It also has a terrible save system which inexplicably deleted about two hours of my progress so out of frustration I don't expect to finish the game.But, it was very cheap when I bought it along with JC1 (which was just plain bad, even for its time and price) so I can't seriously say that its not worth considering.

												Just Cause 2 is a game that plays like an over-the-top action movie. It has a massive open world that you can traverse using cars, botas, and planes, or just a parachute and a grappling hook. Blow up vehicles, gas stations and water towers. Survive falls by grappling onto the ground. Looks great, but due to crazy optimization it plays well even on a craptop.At some point you might ask yourself why you're tying cars to jetfighters and driving into the sky. There's only one answer.

												This game makes Michael Bay look like a gardner. The best chaos creating, ''explosions everywhere'', ''I feel like a badass'' game I have played. Plus it is beautiful as hell - the huge diverse environment, the explosion and weather effects, the gorgeous water reflections makes it a truly massive experience. If you are looking for an impressive storyline, look elsewhere - this game just creates chaos, explode stuff and does it amazingly well. It will get bland after a while, but you will have had a lot of fun with it until then and hell - after some time you'll come back to it...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game on the PC just as a frustration killer. I already have played it a lot on the 360 and it was selling for 5 bucks during the Black Friday sale and I thought, why not? Blow stuff up. That's literally what the game is about. Create as much chaos as possible and the game will reward you for it. To add to the fun, theres the grappling gun, inifinite parachutes, some interesting ways to control vehicles and HUGE open map to go crazy in. Its a formula that works flawlessly. This game is meant as a pressure valve;♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at something or want to chill after a long day? Few things will help as much as this game; wanton destruction seems to appeal to just about anyone. Be warned though, it does have its flaws - the story and characters are a joke (though I sense the developers use it ironically, and taken in that context, they work pretty well!), the AI is thicker than an obese cinder block house and there are some minor control issues.Dont expect anything mind-blowing and/or contemplative in the story/character department - they are as bad as it gets - instead, play it for what it was made for - silly, mindless fun.

												This game is most notably VERY buggy. The number of glitch fixes, workarounds and overall amount of irritation the multitude of bugs in this game forces you to endure just to complete the story is pretty absurd. The story is ok but lacks any character development or plot and reaches it's climax with a cheesy pun that isnt even funny as much as it is a political statement. That being said it does provide a good long time of fun but the hours of frustration are sprinkled in with the hours of enjoyment.If I had paid full price in a retail store for this however I would be returning it though because the number of bugs is unacceptable and the story seems like it was slapped together at the last minute. I feel like this game was rushed out the door by a cash strapped development team. 6.5/10, get it on sale or in a bundle as full price is for finished games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dont play this game for the combat mechanics. there are entirely too many ways to accidentally die, the AI is weird, and is overall a pretty generic third person shooter.What you should play this game for is the exploration of one of the largest sandbox environments yet. And for the physics. The most basic mechanic you have, the grappling hook, is amazing. and pick up some mods to increase the distance, and the bolopatch program to turn this fun game up to 11.just make sure to buy it on sale.

												I don't know how the game brakes almost every laws of physics in each minute but I do like it. The game is a sequel to Just Cause (1) the story takes place in Island of Panau. You are a Agency cooperetive Rico Rodriges that does all the dirty work and caos. The Ruler of the government is torturing people, running infinite propaganda and running a dictatorship. You are equip'ed with a grappling hook that is attached on your left arm. This is a fun weapon and a transport to use against enemy infantry or vehicles. What can I say the game is fun in extreme amount and if you like action,blowing things up, Breaking the laws of physics, Flying with a self reloading parachute with a grappling hook that is non-realistic as hell but everyone goes with it.

												Now with the multiplayer mod out, there is no reason not to play this completely awesome game.""Cause maximum chaos"" is the goal of this game, and you have as many tools/scenarios available to you as your mind can think up.Use your grappling hook for both movement and being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the populace and soldiers of this island.  You'll find out you can attach motorcycles to airplanes, you can attach that vehicle chasing you to the ground next to it, you can attach yourself to the top of that building over there and pull yourself up and away from danger.Goal of the game is to rescue your buddy who something something who gives a crap your real goal is to take over the island and rid it of all influence of the current dictator and his soldiers by any means necessary.By any means necessary is intentionally a very broad brush to paint this game with.There's a huge amount of vehicles (land/air/sea) available to you around the island that you can steal at any time, and a bunch more you can unlock, mod in, or get via DLC.   If there is anything you don't like about the game, you can either find a mod or if you are knowledgable you could modify it yourself.It's a really really fun game to play, tons of things to destroy even after you beat the game.  I've played for like 70 hours and have beaten the game but only 'defeated' 48% of the island.  It is a quite large place ingame.Most games little things here and there bug me but I cannot find any complaints about Just Cause 2, honestly.  Get it!			",243,70,10,59,23,5,25

												First of all. This game is awesome ♥♥♥♥. It's an open world game when you have a BIG map to explore and challenge your enemies. The graphics are amazing even tho the game was published at 2010. It was big cars,fast cars, you can have yoiur own airplanes,weapons,cars. It has many objectives and missions to do. IT IS JUST AMAZING!!			",36,6,0,0,1,0,0

												I dont really know what to say about this game other than the fact that this is on my top 3 or 4 best games ever. It is so stupidly   fun that you're to busy blowing everything up to realize the fact that even in a million years, not even 5% of this game would be able to ever happen. If i had to rate this game, it would be 10.1 out of 10. Best $3.74 ever spent. (It was on sale at 75% off)			",79,3,0,6,4,0,2

												Really good open world game with lots of destruction and an interesting gameplay mechanic that hooks you into the game. With the grapple hook and parachute you can go anywhere quickly and efficiently (No walking for minutes on end). The graphics are also quite nice and it runs well even if you don't have a gming PC (40 fps on high settings on my laptop). The setting of the game also differs from the usual city you usually see in open world games, and is a beautiful island with many settlements, mountains, military bases, and destructable objects. My only complaints with the game is that the isn't really a big enough variety of Cars and there is virtually no cunstomization for your character. Other than that its definetly a must buy at $15 and can easly provide over a hundred hours of gameplay (I played 30 hours and im only 40% done the game, even though I finished the story).

												One of the manliest games ever released, Just Cause 2 is a playablesummer blockbuster by Michael Bay, but without the ""being an insult to the medium"" part.This is the only game where ""listen here, jackass, if you want the story to progress, go blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up."" is the modus operandi. But the story isn't this game's best feature, despite every single story mission trying to one-up the previous one.This game is a sandbox gift to mankind. You can drive any vehicle you run across, shoot any gun you run across and blow up anything that's remotely combustible. And you can go ANYWHERE.Alongside mostly believable physics (grappling hook not included in that regard) and gorgeous graphics, you get a package made with love and delivered by helicopter.Try playing other games now, you pipeline jerks!

												Ever wanted to play an action movie? Look no further; this game has GTA-style free roaming, a ridiculous plot worthy of Mission: Impossible, and endless squads of incompetent mooks to gun down. Or hapless civilians, if that's your thing.Just Cause 2 is by no means a difficult game or a fantastic story, but that's hardly going to cross your mind as you cruise through gorgeous scenery and cause more explosions than a Michael Bay movie.It DOES get a bit repetitive by the end, but still loads and loads of fun, and at a great price too. Especially RIGHT NOW AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING due to the Steam summer sale; at 80% off, you can grab it AND all the DLC for just under 5 dollars (US).			",66,1,0,4,4,0,0

												This game is reccomended for anyone that loves to blow sh*t up. Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game and has such precise weapons and vehicles to get the job DONE! The voice acting is simply remarkable and the graphics of the game is just breath taking! The glitches have hilarious outcomes and in Just Cause 2, you can make your dreams of defying gravity, come true! The grappeling hook has been attached to Rico's arm so you can shoot your gun and grappel onto people and surfaces (at the same time.) You can now do something called ""dual hooking."" Dual Hooking is where you take your grappeling hook and tether one thing to another, so I can take a Titus ZJ (a sports car) and tether that to a Pandak ""Baby"" Panay statue (statue of Panau's current dictator) and drive off in the Titus ZJ and the statue that I tetherd would fall down. Anyways, like I saud, I would reccomend this game to anyone that loves to play video games and to anyone that loves to blow sh*t up.Infinite / 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game but, it really ticks me off. Reasons I like it 1. Very open world/big world2. Rico's Humor (Rico is The Main Character) 3. Amazingly Pretty. There is a TON more stuff I like about the game but now to the bad stuffWelcome to the bad stuff this is why I do think someone may want to steer away from this purchase.1.You're a 5 year old this game is very much more teen/adult kind of game.2. This is the all time worst part about the game. Ok so I play on Super High everything on this game and I get 60-70 fps and it crashes like crazy. In my computer I Run a Nvidia 760 gpu, 16gb of ram, i5 4670k basecloked, Seagate Barracuda 1tb, WIndows 8.1 and the psu case and optical drive do not matter but the monitor is an Asus Vn248h-p. So the issue there is it crashes like crazy.3. Final Problem somtimes when I kill an officer and the sun is setting (beautifully may I say) the officer lets out a burst of red light and it is very distracing from the immersion. ",54,8,1,2,11,0,1

												Open world game, very repetitive but very fun. The world is massive and you job is to destroy anything that is destroyable. Gameplay is like GTA but with a hookshot and an infinite number of parashoots in one backback. Your grappling hook is centric to gameplay. You can use it with the parashoot to fly (glide with parashoot and grapple the ground far away to gain momentum), you can grapple objects together including vehicles, you can hijack planes by grappeling or you can simply use it to climb objects. Weapons, vehicles, and health can all be upgraded by destroying objects to get money and ""chaos"" or collecting various hidden items. When you get bored of that, look up the multiplayer mod. It allows servers to host games with several hundred people playing all at once!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That is why it is an awesome game. And if you want to have a good game for not much money you got to buy this.			",64,3,1,6,2,0,1

												An open world game like Mercenaries or GTA. While the story is fairly good, in a hilariously bad acting sort of way, the gameplay is VERY fun. You have a grapple hook that lets you fly around like crazy, and it is all very over the top. However it's quite easy to get killed, so while you feel powerful it doesn't feel invicnible. If this game only had the weapons/vehicles/artillery of Mercenaries this would be the perfect open world 3rd person shoot em up. That being said, it's still my favorite.			",272,68,5,96,42,1,102

												First the problems...  The main character struggles to look up. The default key bindings are stupid. Some things just dont make sense.Now thats out of the way. I would just like to say this is possibly the best game i have ever played in my 29 years of life. The story is good but the levels are fantastic, the free-roam is a brilliant take on the gta sandbox format (usually disappointing in other games). And is constantly entertaining with many things to explore... I will be playing this for a looong time.Games like this are so worth any money the developers place on it. i cant beleive i got this on a special... I would happily pay $120 for it.Best graphics ive seen so bring ure best hardware :)			",206,4,19,19,9,0,25

												Don't look at the Steam stats, I've played this game for many hours on the PS3...and that was just a demo. It's good enough to keep me replaying the same 15 minutes over and over again because it's just that fun. Blowing up broadcast towers with a pistol, swinging through the air on a grappling hook hanging from a statue and then landing on the ground perfectly fine, to proceed to kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of enemies and come out without a scratch. PROS:+ Excellent visuals for a 2010 game+ Endless hours of explosions and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that+ Can slingshot through the air+ Explosions+ Able to leap from a plane and deploy your parachute 3 feet from the ground and land perfectly safe+ Explosions+ Great controls on PC, despite being made on console+ ExplosionsCONS:- Runs a little dodgy on PC, working components way harder than necessary- Difficulty spikes are terrible: can go from taking down thirty weak enemies and blowing up a silo without needing a health pack to dying twenty times over and over because there's a wave of fifteen heavily-armoured enemies coming straight for you			",145,16,0,15,9,1,4

												JC2 is what i like to call a first person looker. You play as Tom Ka-lancy, who is known as the sedadu/scorpion, and you get to go around looking at stuff. The game has really cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ like hot air baloons, and rope. The main objective of the game is to use your hardcore grappling hook, and tie the bad guys togeather. Although i find this kind of lame because youre not getting any headshots.As for the story, you are basically an average american citizen, but then you decide to move to the bahamas, but instead you end up on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island, you have no money to get back to the US, so you decide to become a criminal. You have 3 choices, you can join the cockroaches, the Ular boys, or the reapers. Since the reapers own everything, you join them, and basically tear♥♥♥♥♥♥up All in all, JC2 falls short of its predecessor, DeUs ex: human delusion, but if you're in the mood for some nice visuals, and dont really care much about sick as hell headshots, then this game is up your alley.

												Chances are you have seen this in a sale for about £3 and probably went ""Too cheap to be true"". Lies. For sheer hilarity alone this game is good, never mind its variety of vehicles, enviroments and things to do. All this before the scale, a map big enough to lose the entirety of the GTA franchise in. With its multiplayer mod in a playable state with lots of new additions the experience has only improved over time. Sure its buggy and cheesy as hell but at the end of the day you'll never shoot a dictator on a nuclear missile heading straight to Washington anywhere else, except maybe Saints Row, only exception			",243,24,6,17,25,2,24

												Absolutely amazing. A lot of problems from Just Cause were addressed, the gameplay is very smooth. I love the new opportunities, like dropping explosive charges from a parachute on the unsuspecting enemies, then watching the whole base explode... like Worms crossed with some shooter game. The only thing that is a little disturbing is that it taxes heavily on the hardware, so it's not really playable well on laptops.			",114,11,2,13,27,0,18

												Just Cause 2 was a game I've looked into for a while, but never really thought about getting. Once it was sold for under $4 during a sale I had to give it a shot. This game was worth it, and I've sunk many hours into it quickly.Just Cause 2 really sticks next to it's name. Why? Just cause! Why else would you go into a millitary base, bombard it with a jet, dive bomb the plane into the raido tower and then drive a car off a cliff to give a horrific flash back when you rolled your car that one day.It really is a interesting experience, but the campains, either the main one or sides missions, are very repetative. The storyline is quite weak and is easily forgotten during the gameplay as you blow up more oil rigs.But the gameplay is what makes it worth purchasing. It's got an odd Grand Theft Auto: San Adreas feel to it. You know? The day you only have a half hour to kill beofre going to do something, so you load up the game to cause mass chaos and fear until you have to go. It's one of those games, and it does it quite well.Pros:Good gameplayDecent mechanicsNice graphics and aestheticMap size bigger than anything I've seen, even bigger than GTA VInteresting ways to use your grappling hookCons:Little money rewards and expensive weapons and vehiclesThe large map means that most places look the sameThe AI isn't very smartPlanes will explode when touching anything, even at speeds that you can out runMy rating 8/10, worth the purchase, at retail or sale price.

												The second i bought this game i knew i was getting a great deal. The game is huge for exploring, and it just beatiful with the graphics. I mean, the sun rise is literally just as beatiful in real life. i also admired the many weapons the game had to offer, because i love weapons and killing NPCs. This was a great game and it is worth your money			",99,9,0,7,11,1,11

												A Mexican Power Fantasy: The Time I played as DeadpoolI jumped off a mountain, it was tall, full of snow. I was so high up, a plane was nearby. I pulled him out and threw him to his death, another life claimed by the hands of Deadpool. Since my ability to fly is horrible, I was about to crash into the ground. Right before that, I jumped onto the front of the plane, and grappled a nearby tree, the plane exploding behind me. I was in the middle of a military base, surrounded by military. I pulled out two sawed offs hot guns and took them all down, one by one. Soon, I stole a helicopter and flew into the sunsetJust another day in the life of Deadpool.			",87,7,0,8,3,0,2

												This game is one of the best open world, shoot kill and steal (and blow up) anything games around. If you can stomach slaughtering thousands of southeast asian people essentially ""because 'merica"" then nothing should stop you from enjoying this.The main character is a combination of every action hero you can imagine, Spider Man(stanks to the magic grappling hook/human harpoon), and maybe a little bit of a 40K Space Marine. The morality is  greyblack, and civilians are fair game if you so desireas  slaughtering innocents only garners attention from the villainous military police force that supposedly cares nothing for the people of the nation. It's essentially GTA turned up to 11 and given a more militant vibe. The story is less amusing than the GTA series, though not totally dry. But seriously, who cares about story when you can be a violent terrorist and mass murderer?Also worth noting is the multiplayer mod, which strips many assets and all NPCs off the map and allows you to go on a killing spree against friends and well wishers. Just beware that the chat channels are essentially Anon centric as far as I've seen.			",438,99,3,80,73,3,124

												Please, mind my playtime on the game. I have countless hours on Xbox and offline of Steam.Just Cause 2 is the only game I know of that doesn't have limits, in games like GTA you can dress up funny and rob banks, but there's something about JC2. On my Xbox, I was addicted to the game. The graphics are great for it's time, and the gameplay is very open to how you want to play, weather that is blowing up buildings or hanging pedestrians from ropes on the top of a skyscraper while beating the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of a helicopter, or follow the story, and still beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people. The map is brilliantly huge, you can visit mountains, deserts, cities, or even military bases. All in all, I would rate this game 8.5/10, the only reason for that is because on my Windows 8.1 machine the game crashes every 40 minutes or so, but works just fine on my Windows 7 PC.

The fun sandbox type, if you like GTA, saints row, or the red faction destruction-aspect style, get this, it has a really BIG map, with a lot of cool locations to explore or cause mayhem in. Funny voice acting, horrendous grain on the cutscenes (don't know what they were thinking on that, it looks♥♥♥♥♥♥. Good visuals, great to skydive in. Also, you don't have to buy the DLC, it's really not necessary, buy the vehicles if you like them. Runs great on any pc, overall really fun game even if you don't like many games of this type.

												What do you get when crossing a huge island, an agent, and a grappling hook? Just Cause 2, and it's really worth its money. Go right ahead to explore the island of Panau (have I said too much?) and wreak havoc on said cluster of islands. I know I haven't played the core game alot, but I've spent lots of time on the ridiculously fun multiplayer mod.PROS:-Great game-Ridiculously large island-lots of exploration to do-Great graphics (even at low)-Ridiculously fun multiplayer modOf course, this game is not without its cons...-You hear the same 4 or so lines all the time-Gets a bit boring by yourself after a whileIn general, buy this game.

It is so stupidly   fun that you're to busy blowing everything up to realize the fact that even in a million years, not even 5% of this game would be able to ever happen.

												Just Cause 2 is an action-packed game that puts the player into the role of  an expert at overthrowing rogue governments. The missions offer a solid experience that should expect from an action game of its kind; tasks such as overtaking bases, assassination, terrorism, and finding contacts within the tropical land of Panau where the game makes the most out of its key feature; the grape hook-- a weapon that allows the player in all three dimensions, whether to jump ahead, or up, or down, the player has complete freedom of movement thanks to the open world and the grape hook's design. A multiplayer mod developed by fans is also available where the players can all play within Panau online.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't know how the game brakes almost every laws of physics in each minute but I do like it. The game is a sequel to Just Cause (1) the story takes place in Island of Panau. You are a Agency cooperetive Rico Rodriges that does all the dirty work and caos. The Ruler of the government is torturing people, running infinite propaganda and running a dictatorship. You are equip'ed with a grappling hook that is attached on your left arm. This is a fun weapon and a transport to use against enemy infantry or vehicles. What can I say the game is fun in extreme amount and if you like action,blowing things up, Breaking the laws of physics, Flying with a self reloading parachute with a grappling hook that is non-realistic as hell but everyone goes with it. I DO recommend this. Hope this helped, See you in the sky!			",66,1,3,3,8,2,11

												Just cause 2 is one of those games that doesn't need any recommendation, or word of mouth to tell the world how great a game it is!This sequel is the follow up to the 'Chaotic' open-world sandbox game - just cause, which was released back in 2006 for the Ps2, Xbox, and PC. What I love about just cause 2 is the fact you can free-roam an entire paradise island, with your main aim to cause as much chaos as possible to the open-world, so you can eventually topple the dictatorship in government.You can cause chaos by destroying military targets in much of the towns, cities, military bases, ports, and many more areas as possible. Because you play a mercenary named 'Rico', you get to play around with many cool 'boys toys' in just cause 2. The selection of helicopters, tanks, and guns to play around with in the game is immense.There's many fun easter eggs and secrets to find scattered around, with an island with much to do. So put down your current game, and join Rico on panau island.			",177,29,5,20,20,5,29

												Quite simply the most fun I have ever had playing a computer game.  I originally tried the demo and that alone was so good that I was hooked to see what crazy things you can get Rico to do.  The demo was limited in area as to where you could go, so I had to have the full game.  As you can see I've played it quite a bit over the years.  The storyline isn't the best out there, but I don't think the developers had the story as their main priority when they were making it.  This game is all about the free to explore open world and Ricos grappling hook & parachute which you can deploy in various different ways.  I do have other FPS in my collection, which are considered good games, but I just keep on coming back to Just Cause 2, simply because It's just such fun!  I definetly think the tropical island paradise thing helps games like this, and This game will probably only be trumped in my eyes by Just Cause 3.			",13,0,1,1,2,0,0

												Just Cause 2 is obviously the sequel to Just Cause released in 2006. You're playing a skilled acrobatic operative named: Rico Rodriguez. I won't spoil the story, but his main objective is to cause mayhem on a fictional island Panau in Malay Archipelago of Southeast Asia. You can fly jets, drive cars, trucks, bikes and even disarm a rocket while it's in midair.Panau is not a monolithic island, there are deserts, cities and lush forests to explore by foot or vehicle. Just Cause 2 is powered by Avalanche Engine 2.0 that simply makes brings Panau paradise feeling into life.Peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Personal rating: 9/10Bought on: Discount (75%)DLC: Questionable. Adds a bunch of new toys to play with, but besides the Air Gun it's nothing you can't find and do the same. The DLC equipment if fairly powerful, but just as expensive.Before we start...Do you smirk when you cause a big explosion? Do you smile when you cause a soldier to die in a most creative way? Do you enjoy hijacking cars at high speed?Then welcome to Just Cause 2, where you can do this and much more.Just Chaos(e)Just Cause 2 has a unique way to make you proceed in the story line: by causing immeasurable amounts of chaos and wreck havoc in Panau, the country where the game takes place. That's right, where in games you want to avoid doing this because you don't want the pesky military on your back, here the game says: ""Here, have some guns and go blow stuff around! We'll even pay you for this!""Causing chaos is the only way to open new Story Missions and Black Market items, so in short, you must do it.To do your job you are given tools like Pistols, Grenades, Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, Shotguns and Machine Guns, you know, the usual. But then you have a Tuk-tuk with a cannon, and the DLC offers you a godd*mn Monster Truck with Grenade Launcher and Machine Gun attached to it.Why stick to the ground anyway? You can also destroy stuff by using battle helicopters or even jet fighters if you have the skill to use them.GameplayJust Cause 2 is fantastic, the controls are mostly responsive and rarely fails or does something you didn't mean to, at least when playing on ground, where about 90% of the game takes place.However there are some problems here: sprinting barely increases Rico's speed and you'll almost always look for at least a car to travel around, and sport cars (the fastest of the game) are nigh impossible to control with the keyboard. Using jet fighters to cause destruction is also difficult since it goes VERY fast, if you are intending to do a precision shot, then forget it.Hook, grapple, killOne of the most interesting features in this game is Rico's grappling hook. That thing allows you to do all sort of crazy stunts, the ones that would put make Hollywood's cheesiest movies to go sulk in a corner, full of envy. Did you miss that car you wanted to hijack? Grapple on is and take it!Is a soldier in a vantage point thinking he's safe? Make your grappling hook introduce him to lady gravity.Is a soldier in a mounted gun pestering you? Pull him for a closer combat.Is a military chopper on your case? Grapple on it and take the chopper for you, then kill everything on land.You can even tether one thing to another, like a soldier to a car for example. Or a soldier to a lamp post. Or a soldier to the helicopter and take him for a ""ride"".Panauan landscapesTired of wandering in jungles or tropical scenery? Don't worry, Panau has an immense diversity of all kinds of terrains for you to explore: snowy mountains, deserts and cities which all have many places to go and cause more destruction.Missions and challengesIf you grow tired of pointless destruction there are always missions which gives you directions to cause more, destruction and help you speed up the story line. Racing challenges are also available to test your driving skills, however most of them can be quite difficult thanks to the finicky car/plane controls.			",222,43,3,24,9,0,13

With amzing movie-style explosions this game is certaintly an action packed joy ride!! highly recommended, and at 2.49 for just cause 1&2 and all dlc's in the sale, its a steal!!

												I finished the main campaign just now (at 93 hours of playing) and I would continue playing this game if it wern't for Just Cause 3.The destruction is really fun, the missions are fun, the story is good, the free roam is amazing and really big. You cannot run out of things to do in this game. The wanted system is good and driving is fun. You can stand on top of vehicles and shoot, or jump to other vehicles while they are moving. If you are driving and you eject out of a car and the car hits something it will explode, which is amazingly fun.The grappling hook is an amazing tool that makes you feel so awesome. You can use the grappling hook to steal vehicles, move around, tie things (or people) together, and generally cause chaos.You carry to secondary guns and one primary. You can dual-wield secondaries, use one of them, or use your primary. You also carry C4 and grenades with you. Main weapons include: Machine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher. Secondary weapons include: sawed-off shotgun, pistol, revolver, and submachine gun. There are TONS of collectibles and give you either money, higher max health, weapon parts (used for upgrading weapons), vehicle parts (used for upgrading vehicles), or armor parts (which give you a tiny amont of health). You can call in vehicles and weapons for a small amount of ingame money, pretty much whenever. You can also fast travel to a discovered location for free but it is really fun to travel there by driving, grappling, or flying.To sum it up, the map is massive (I still haven't discovered every location), the game is an action movie or cool cutscene that you are playing, the tra			",97,5,1,8,10,1,18

												First of all, I've purchased this game on sale, and it was worth every single cent. Currently I'm playing through the campaign - and one of the first things that immediately strike me is the HUGE size of the map! Wow, driving from one end to the other takes forever. Overall physics and game mechanics are very well written and fluid. The signature grappling hook defines the entire game, and makes it unique. Jumping, firing weapons and moving around is a pleasure.Although the storyline is good so far, I find it slightly corny, although it doesn't bug me too much - the gameplay takes your mind off that. The language seems to be a butchered mix of Malay, Indonesian and some Tagalog, and the writing and the script seems to be written in Thai? Hmm.In a nutshell: BUY THE GAME. You won't regret it.

												Simply no reason not to have played this game if you have the hardware for it.  Outstanding visuals that are very well optimized.  Most of the missions in the game will leave you patting yourself on the back for being such a badass, and turn you into a condescending PC elitist when you see what your rig is capable of.  While there is a slight learning curve on the controls, halfway through the game youll be able to do things with precision unrivaled by many games.Some complaints:  I've found little use for land vehicles considering how many are available.  What I mean by this is that once you figure out the tricks of the parachute, you'll realize that with some skill, you can achieve a very respectable speed without the limitation of terrain.  Also some of the locations not attached to a mission feel copied and pasted, but are still fun to navigate, and possibly the cost of having such a large sandbox to play with your toys in.  More missions would've probably fixed this.  DLC?			",271,32,2,32,8,1,14

												Back when i was a kid, GTA Vice City was ""the sh!t"". Everybody played it, loved it, and so was I. Ever since then, free-roaming games have earned it's spot in my heart, and i always thrive to play a good one. Just Cause 2 doesn't only prove to me that it's a great game, this thing also brought back some great excitement like Vice City did to me in the past.Quick, short review on pros and cons :+ Good combat system with various weapons+ Decent story+ Many vehicles to toy with+ A lot of achievements and stuffs that requires many hours of play time, you won't complete the game 100% anytime soon- Controlling planes is really hard- The strory are filled with small missions, can be really messy sometimes- AI is not really smart, both allies and enemies- Scorpio fails as a characterOverall score : 7.5/10Should get it if u like free-roaming games AND the game is on sale for around 75-80%			",48,3,0,6,0,0,3

												The point of this game is to blow stuff up. You follow the story and blow stuff up... You can alternatively not follow the story and blow stuff up. It is fun either way. When you get bored of blowing stuff up alone, get the free mod and blow stuff up with friends. This game wrecks. Best 3 bucks I ever spent.			",69,8,0,13,19,0,10

												If you're looking for a good story and great plot, this is not the place to look. However, if you want an over the top action game with little things making sense and an enormous world with great graphics, buy Just Cause 2. This game is very vehicle driven - if you want to hijack a plane in mid air you can. If you want to have dogfights with jets this is your game. However, the truest mode of transportation you'll find is Rico's grappling hook. This thing is like spiderman and his web; It'll take you everywhere and anywhere across miles. TL:DR: GTA without a plot meets metal slug.			",115,11,1,15,16,3,28

												Just cause 2 is a Free-roaming Hookshot-em-up that takes the very idea of a freeroamer, builds a game out from that idea, and then multiplies it by a factor of 10^100. It is absolutely brilliant. But if I had to describe the game in 3 words, it would have to be Fun, Amazing and Silly. And anyone who has played a freeroamer knows that a silly game is great. Face up, it seems like your standard freeroamer based around side missions with a main story mixed in. But once you start digging, you never want to stop. The game has 3 main ideas that the game is buildt upon. Number one: The black market. The black maket is like a vehicle store, a gun shop and a transport system all in one. Here you can buy ammo, if you run out and you're not in a mission, where ammo is free, but you can also buy some vehicles for a bigger price. These are generally one time use only, when you want a fast car, or when an airport is not close enough. It also features a transport system, where it transports you to wherever toy've been before, for free. ""Gimmick"" number two: The grappling hook. Oh boy, is this thing fun. It seems like your normal grappling hook, only useful to get you from point A to point B, but this thing is so much more useful. Yes, it can just get you from A to B if thats what you want, but it can also drag you to vehicles, such as Helicopters and Cars that are usually really hard to hijack when they are moving, plus that it has the ability to drag people too you, if that is an enemy or just a random NPC that you met on the street. ""Gimmick"" number three: Chaos. Instead of your usual points system, Just Cause 2 features a Chaos system, that you get my doing missions, destroying enemy property, blowing stuff up, or getting Heat. Heat is a system that shows how agressive the military is against you. If it is at 0, then they wont attack you. At max however, they want you dead at all costs. Instead of a 5 star meter like in GTA, it is a bar, that progressively fills, so you exactly know how much they're after you. When your Chaos meter eventually drops to 0, you get some chaos and some money. Chaos unlocks missions, items in the blakc market, but most importantly, it unlocks story missions. Which is important, since it encourages you to jerk around and have a blast, which is what this game does best. With an absolutely HUGE map, breathtaking visuals, great vehicles and stunning gameplay, this is a game worth buying. At only 15€, it's definately worth picking up. I give Just Cause 2 a 10/10.

												Beautiful open world tropical island with alpine environments in the mountains. The story and acting are honestly rubbish, but this is one of the most fun games ever. Blow up fuel tanks, military installations, government agents, palm trees, whatever, just 'cuz. Drive cars, trucks, cycles, helicopters, planes, hovercraft, etc. on and off road.

												I don't agree with any of the bad reviews since most of them aren't true and don't take into consideration the WHOLE game. Yes it is mostly about blowing things up. that's the point. Yes the grappling hook and parachute is unrealistic. It would be pretty boring and impossible to play if it was realistic. The whole purpose was to create a game like a big action movie where you could go anywhere blow anything up and drive anything, so really I don't understand what you can say that's bad with Just cause 210/10 Still playing even now after owning it on ps3 for 5 years.

												Stupid fun. Goes extremely cheap during the steam sales and at that point you 100% should buy it.The story and voice acting isn't the best, but if anything that just adds to the enjoyment to the game. It perfectly compliments the silly fun you can have in this game.The police are crazy and it is really fun to try and survive for as long as possible while being attacked by the police. You can also exploit their AI and make them drive off bridges, which is both hilarious and a good way to get rid of them.The game is beautiful and still lives up to todays standards, without needing a beefy computer to run it. (Just don't look at the leaves on the trees when you go past them).You get given a grapple hook (that can also attatch two objects together), infinite parachutes, and 400 square miles to play with. You can have hours of fun just messing about with attatching cars, planes, and people together.Mods are incredible in this game, and can make the game loads more fun if you are willing to install them (although it does take away from playing the story missions).

I must have clocked around 2-300 hours? XD  if this says anything i've owned it on PS3 for around 5 years, almost as long as i've owned Star Wars Empire at War.Square Enix dropped a bombshell of a game with this one.. It is honestly (I feel a flame war'er shouting as i say this) more of a Open World game then GTA, and i've owned GTA 4 and 5, none of them compare to the size and gameplay that Just Cause 2 offers.There is almost no end to what you can and can't do, from dogfights with helicopters to being chased by the military for stealing their bike XD oh and did i mention you can ram people with an ice cream truck while playing a catchy theme? :P Hands down this is worth a try, i would even pay $60 it has so much replay value, also... you think you'll hit 100% easy?  HAHA  meanwhile i'm at 40% on PS3 after said 5 years. 10/10 A MUST buy, the price is a steal!!! >.>			",82,12,0,15,20,0,24

												What can you say about this action filled, mass destroying, awesome rocking, derping game? - It rocks.Ok, You're a guy and the goal is to create chaos on a HUGE map.You can run, walk and even swim if you to get somewhere!Or if you're lazy, just step out from the shadows  and take a car / plane / boat or whatever you will find.You also has a parachute and a grappling hook.With the grappling hook you can connect two things with each other, drag something to you, hit someone with it or just do the fun stuff like connecting a human to a plane and see him fly awaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.Ok.Pros: - A great and fun game- Alot to blow up and destory- Many places to see-Great environment.Cons: - This game only works with Windows Vista / 7 and the graphic card must support Directx 10- No multiplayer feature (But I can understand that, kind of)- Kinda Easy4.0 BOINKS... sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes but it's 05.30 am here...Good Night			",597,227,30,61,97,5,78

I mean, the sun rise is literally just as beatiful in real life. i also admired the many weapons the game had to offer, because i love weapons and killing NPCs.

												This game is one of the best open world, shoot kill and steal (and blow up) anything games around. If you can stomach slaughtering thousands of southeast asian people essentially ""because 'merica"" then nothing should stop you from enjoying this.The main character is a combination of every action hero you can imagine, Spider Man(stanks to the magic grappling hook/human harpoon), and maybe a little bit of a 40K Space Marine. The morality is  greyblack, and civilians are fair game if you so desireas  slaughtering innocents only garners attention from the villainous military police force that supposedly cares nothing for the people of the nation. It's essentially GTA turned up to 11 and given a more militant vibe. The story is less amusing than the GTA series, though not totally dry. But seriously, who cares about story when you can be a violent terrorist and mass murderer?Also worth noting is the multiplayer mod, which strips many assets and all NPCs off the map and allows you to go on a killing spree against friends and well wishers. Just beware that the chat channels are essentially Anon centric as far as I've seen.			",438,99,3,80,73,3,124

												What can you say about this action filled, mass destroying, awesome rocking, derping game? - It rocks.Ok, You're a guy and the goal is to create chaos on a HUGE map.You can run, walk and even swim if you to get somewhere!Or if you're lazy, just step out from the shadows  and take a car / plane / boat or whatever you will find.You also has a parachute and a grappling hook.With the grappling hook you can connect two things with each other, drag something to you, hit someone with it or just do the fun stuff like connecting a human to a plane and see him fly awaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.Ok.Pros: - A great and fun game- Alot to blow up and destory- Many places to see-Great environment.Cons: - This game only works with Windows Vista / 7 and the graphic card must support Directx 10- No multiplayer feature (But I can understand that, kind of)- Kinda Easy4.0 BOINKS... sorry for my spelling and grammar mistakes but it's 05.30 am here...Good Night			",597,227,30,61,97,5,78

												Just Cause 2 is one of my favorite games of all time.  The gunplay and methods of movement (vehicle, running, jumping, rolling, hang gliding, and the AMAZING way in which your near-superpower of a grappling hook) are wonderful.The grappling hook is also a fun weapon that you can tie things to each other or things to the ground.  The world is beautiful and massive.The community is writing a multiplayer mod which will only make a great game better.I challenge you to respond with a better value on Steam than Just Cause 2.Update: 9/5/2015 I just fired this up on my stream and I'm enjoying it so much I'm going to do a full lets playthrough.  I strongly recommend that you purchase this title (at least when it goes on sale) it should be in your Steam library.			",535,131,21,81,71,4,88

												Just Cause 2- the Boredom-KillerJust Cause 2 is a pure destruction orgy. It has nice graphics, a good gameplay and a huge world. The grapple gives the game another dimension, it is also an alternative for cars or bikes.A big disadvantage is the poor variety of the vehicles. All in All, its a pretty nice game, and i like it a lot. You should definitive buy it, Just Cause 2 is much better than the first part. ",100,12,21,6,17,0,18

												This game is reccomended for anyone that loves to blow sh*t up. Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game and has such precise weapons and vehicles to get the job DONE! The voice acting is simply remarkable and the graphics of the game is just breath taking! The glitches have hilarious outcomes and in Just Cause 2, you can make your dreams of defying gravity, come true! The grappeling hook has been attached to Rico's arm so you can shoot your gun and grappel onto people and surfaces (at the same time.) You can now do something called ""dual hooking."" Dual Hooking is where you take your grappeling hook and tether one thing to another, so I can take a Titus ZJ (a sports car) and tether that to a Pandak ""Baby"" Panay statue (statue of Panau's current dictator) and drive off in the Titus ZJ and the statue that I tetherd would fall down. Anyways, like I saud, I would reccomend this game to anyone that loves to play video games and to anyone that loves to blow sh*t up.Infinite / 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
