												DESCRIPTIONFlotilla is a short to medium length space strategy game. In comparison to similar games, it was made before FTL (and served as minor inspiration for FTL) and after the first two Weird Worlds games (not cited as an inspiration for Flotilla).You are the captain of two identical small ships to begin with, always the same two ships. You have been told you have seven months to live. You jump around a procedurally generated starmap just like FTL and Weird Worlds, at each jump you encounter a random event. It can be a multiple choice question, a free item or ship to add to your flotilla and of course it can be a fight.You'll enter a fight with your full flotilla, which will be every ship you managed to get during that run. You will fight the opposing team in 30 second bursts until one team is completely annihilated. Back on the map, after a certain amount of time has passed, the game ends and you get your final score.PROSThe combat: Every time someone makes me play a game and says ""it's art"" they're not always wrong but they usually are. Well I'm putting my nuts on the chopping block, this is art. You point out where on the X, Y and Z axis you want your ship to travel too, you decide if they'll be firing and who they'll be firing at. Then you press play and it plays out for 30 seconds, everyone floats in their allotted directions firing at what you wanted them to. In the background plays classical piano pieces, Prelude in D-Flat Major by Chopin etc. as this is going on. Then when the 30 seconds are up, silence.... and you plot the next moves and press play again. Shielding is actually proper shielding, you hit the light coloured areas you're hitting a shield, chances of scoring an actual HP lowering hit are slim when you do that, you hit a non-shielded area such as the rear or underside then you'll likely cause damage. I play out these battles in the background all evening while I'm working on other things, it's a relaxing experience and it's very difficult to get flustered. To me this is the best part of the game it does what FTL and Weird Worlds couldn't do for me, fit into the background rather than command my undivided attention.The characters and setting: Rastafarian Cats, Bandit Penguins it's got an interesting mix of anthropomorphised characters, humans too. Each character is offset against a very fitting musical theme. After every jump in the star system you find yourself asking ""what the hell was that about?"" which definitely seems to be the developer's intention and I think they pulled it off. I find it even more interesting than the lore in FTL.The Mystery: Outside of the ships and ship upgrades, nothing is explained. Every decision can come back to haunt to you in a branched off event, this was done to excellent effect in FTL two years later as well, Flotilla's handling of events is terser and shorter but far more representative of the whole game story. For example each jump you make and what happened gets written down in a Captain's log which reflects your ending score.CONSReduced content: The game is small. It's a real shame that it likely won't see the updates and DLC that it so richly deserves. From a standpoint of pure common sense it's just not viable for Blendo Games to return to the development of a 4 year old game, especially when it's a one man team and the popularity of this title pales in comparison to their other titles, such as Thirty Flights of Loving. As opposed to other games where the community would like to see PvP/Co-op multiplayer, updated art assets, expanded story or even a sequel just for the purpose of milking their favourite game dry even when it's not the best decision, that is definitely not the case with Flotilla. This game gets the green light on PvP multiplayer, especially online, the mechanics are screaming out for this addition to the game it would work incredibly well, online co-op fits in just as well (note: Local co-op is already available). Another well-fitting feature would be modding, Flotilla is built from a small pool of ""what is fun"", to pull this off the developer reduced the graphics to very simple geometric shapes and made the game all about travelling to the location, then fighting in the location. As for the fighting itself, you move, you roll, you fire, you turn your shields in the direction of oncoming fire, you direct your fire towards the non-shielded areas of the opponent. A modding community could work with the whole game, even if it was just pure XML (similar to Dungeons of Dredmor) after only experiencing 5 hours of the game you could extend it straight away.Un-pruned areas: The developer has been very honest about the state of his code on Flotilla, undoubtedly being his first commercial game it's likely that large swathes of the code didn't lend itself to decent re-use and as a result it would seem that a few screw ups here and there that detract from the overall enjoyment of the game can't be as easily fixed as you would think. Certainly not as easy as if he wrote the game today with his current experience. An example is controller support, this game has it but in a very old-fashioned way, you can't use the gamepad in single player, but a second player can use a gamepad in addition to the first player using keyboard and mouse in local co-op. The Beam Frigate's AI can get stuck quite a lot and just not move, making them sitting ducks, it typically happens when there's too much going on in the frigate's vicinity. You start with two of what is arguably the best ship in the game, it's so fast it can take on almost anyone, my opinion may change after a few more games in hardcore mode but for now I would say that other starting configurations and balancing things more favourably for the opponent would have been a great improvement also.SUMMARYThis is space opera the game basically. A twenty minute let's play video would not contain any spoilers as far as I can tell so go and watch one if you're interested in purchasing the game because so much of this game's charm is in what is indescribable, it's definitely a game most would describe as ""crafted"".Using the Horseblair rating system I would give it 8 Tiger Hats out of 10. Or a thumbs up on the Steam rating system.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Really nice little game.  Inoffensive and accessible, Flotilla lends itself well to both pick-up-and-play gaming, or more extended sessions with the hardcore mode.  The gameplay is quick to learn, and surprisingly deep once you get a decent lineup of ships.  You can get some pretty impressive all-out battles underway, especially if you use the custom skirmish mode.  The main story is extremely basic, but as you move through the universe you'll meet crazy characters, creatures, make friends, and make enemies.  Every play will be different.Flotilla has a unique and striking presentation that works quite well, and gives the game a special flair you won't find anywhere else.			",802,239,27,63,64,8,118

												I had way too much fun with this game. It has a combat system similar to Frozen Synapse and a choose your own adventure game feel too it that was a nice touch. I think some of the people that reviewed this game didn't really give it the chance that it needed. Of course it has its flaws, but the tactical potential of this game is huge. When you use your badass space captain tactics to take down one of the huge battleships and some Beam Frigates with just a couple of Destroyers it makes you feel like the baddest mother ♥♥♥♥er around. I never really review games, but when I realized this was my second most played game and that I'd put almost 170 hours into it I felt that it was necessary.			",227,57,5,29,11,3,21

												So you have been diagnosed with Space-Typhus, Space-Cholera or other Space-Disease-that-one-is-allowed-to-make-fun about. The best course of action is ofcourse to buy 2 space ships, venture into the random-generated depths of space and meet various men, women and beasts. Exactly. It's one of the best games ever.Ships look simple but incredibly cool. Events are fun, even after many times of playing. The best thing to do is to get a friend and play local co-op in hard mode.That's the sad thing: The game is short, and you can't save. But in hard mode you get some more time..and more cool events! There is pigs, deers, hitchhikers, cats, octopus, swans, metal bands, scientists, spiders and more! There is also Versus Mode that I don't care about, but it's just as the normal battles, so I think it can become pretty cool when you play against a human.I rate this game..oh boy...a 95 outa 100			",148,17,3,11,7,1,34

												The fact that steam even had the guts to ask me if I wanted to reccomend this game offended me greatly. WHY WOULD I NOT RECOMMEND IT?!?!?! It has taken me years to build up the courage to play this game and boldly go where no man that is myself has gone before! First of all, the game is simple. It's easy to learn, the tutorial takes like 45 seconds and you feel lke a Flotilla master! At first glance, I was confused. I asked myself what is it's purpose? Whats the story? How do I quickscope? And all these questions were answered well along the way within the first few minutes. The purpose is to not die, build the most greatest Flotilla in the galaxy along the greatest, wacky, fun-for-the-whole-family, space adventure! The story is built along the way, each planet you travel to has a new encounter which ranges from going to a party with your harty crew and becoming THE FREAKING KAREOKE MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE, or to meeting the all Might Godess Afrodita riding a god damn unicorn, ripping your eye out and giving you a bad♥♥♥♥♥gauntlet! The possibilities are truly endless and no adventure s the same. It's addicting, and encourages you to throw your life away and become the FLOTILLA MASTER RACE! All in all please buy this game, buy it again and again until you have no money, no job, no love life, no house, no life, just... Flotilla...12/10 - Would become a scorcerer, find a spell to turn this game into a human being, and marry.P.S. - You cannot quickscope ;)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Once you finish giving your ships their instructions for the turn, they proceed to duke it out for thirty seconds before you can give new orders.

												Okay, let's get one thing straight. This is NOT homeworld. I know it looks like a simplistic indie version of it, but it ain't.  This is one of those ""Choose-your-own-adventure"" books from the 80s. but with a massively-simplified 3d game built in. You start off at the beginning with a fixed amount of 'moves' (14), which equate to picking 14 planets out of 20 or so, and have to make the best choices in each situation.    Similar to 'deal-or-no-deal', there's no actual strategy to your next choice of 'planet', you just have to pick planets one after the other until you run out of them.  At each planet, something happens, (the box is opened, if you like).  You have to make a choice, and you either come off better, worse, or unchanged.I quite enjoyed those ""choose your own adventure"" books, so this game kinda grows on me.  Each time you play, you get a slightly different set of choices, and therefore outcomes.   I've tried a few different options, and the results are pleasing, and sometimes marginally funny.  Mostly. however, you're left wondering WTF that was all about.  If you do remember those books, you'll remember they were designed to be played during a lunch hour, or  break time. You could rip through an 'adventure' in about 15 to 20 minutes, and once you knew the book, you could scan the text, note where you were and move on, doing each page in a few seconds.  With some of the two-person book sets, where someone was 'chasing' you (Dual-master series, for example), you could very quickly have a chase through the landscape.  That's exactly how this feels.  You play a 'game' for no more than about 20 minutes, maybe 30 if you take your time in the battles.  Each 'game' is wholly self-contained, and when you start the next one, everything is reset, and you play over.   Many of the situations repeat verbatim, so when you're playing you see a picture, pick out a word, like ""pirate"" or ""slaver"", and immediately pick the outcome you want, without reading the rest of the text, note the outcome, and move on.By and large, the game is completely random: There's no ramp-up or anything. When you arrive at a 'planet', and are told to fight, you may be up against easy, medium, or hard at any stage. So, a lot of the negative reviews talk about how hard the game is because you can meet more powerful enemies right at the start.  Well, yes, that's true, in the same way that if you're playing any game, it's only challenging if there's a bigger monster to fight.   However, flotilla has one pro and con in the same 'feature':  There's one strategy that works really well.  It's pretty obvious when you think about it, but I won't spoil it.    There are lots of other strategies as well, but as with most space games, like Homeworld, there's not a whole heap of stuff you can do in open space warfare.  To counter this weakness in the genre, Flotilla has an overlaid 2d-ism on the 3d: Ships have 'tops' and 'bottoms', which means that there's an asymmetry in the usual turning battle you get.   The only thing I'll say is that as long as you have two ships, you should have no problem with battles in this game, more and you're sorted, fewer (i.e. 1 ship), and you have a long fight ahead, which is probably only going to end one way, death.The game feels like a first project:  Very simplistic art, simplistic models, sound clips taken from other games or stock sources, one or perhaps two music tracks.  However, it's been nicely polished, and you don't get a sense that it's 'raw' or anything.  The bizarre animal images, like deer wearing uniforms, is just absurd, but ultimately ignorable.  In the same way that you ignore the features of the face cards in a card game: It's what the image and its text represent as a positive or negative to your 'game' that matters.Some of the 'positive' effects allow you to upgrade your ships. Some of the upgrades appear marginally useless, whereas some really affect your life expectancy in the skirmishes.  You get to realise which pretty quickly.I'd recommend this game if it was on sale for less than (say) £3 or £4.  It suits people who like quick skirmishes of space ships, and have an absurdist sense of humour.  Don't get it if you're expecting a serious story, or subtle combat like Homeworld.

												SPACE PENGUINS! Quite possibly the fifth or sixth most dangerous thing that exists in space. I have no idea what foul misfortunes must have befallen that proud race, for them to find themselves playing hitmen for the casino I just robbed, but space is a weird place meant for weird individuals. For intergalactic casino robbers, and the mercenary penguins who hunt them for currency. Looking to maximize the weirdness, we decide to put on Chopins Raindrop. Prelude, because we can't handle the postlude. No one can handle the postlude.My proud blue destroyer, the Three Jog Lightning starts to dance around his space penguin adversary, destroyer Five Pride Crocodile. To the notes of a dead Polish man quietly playing the piano, we join in combat. Rockets fly. Engines blare. Profanity is spouted. Shots bouncing, warheads exploding. Hit. Bottom hit. Profanity increases.I see now that I should have known better than to mess with space penguins. Really, no one ever gets away with robbing a casino. Alas, these realizations arrive too late. Everyone's dead, and the Three Jog Lightning will be remembered by no one. And there is no save function so that I can cheat. The space penguins have won and Captain Meles Meles has been vanquished.You win this round, space penguins, but there will be many more.. Because Flotilla, a game that riffs on Homeworld and Combat Mission, and tops it all off with space penguins and talking cats.. is just too ♥♥♥♥ing awesome to walk away from.

												Quite an interesting game. At a quick glance it might just seem an FTL-like space ""roguelike"" (well, technically it came out way before FTL), but once you get into it is impossible not to notice a really distinct style and tone that make the game unique. Flotilla pairs its rts and roguelike mechanics with a weird mixture of surreal humor and melancholic themes (we actually play as a terminal ill character) topping it all off with a beautiful yet simple art style.Less avant-garde than Gravity Bone (Brandon Chung's previous game) but equally as smart in its execution.7/10			",342,145,19,67,42,4,90

												This is a turned based space armada game in all 3 dimensions.It has an unique style. Space-gators, toucan-smugglers.It's very tactical as you can only be hit on the bottom and rear of the ship.There are upgrades you can get from missions or by trading at the Flamingo outpost.Better rear armor, faster movement, etcEach game is different because you start with two basic ships on a world map and may pick to which planet you go (in a certain range). All planets will be different each game.So you might end up with an armada of ships pretty early in game or be utterly destroyed on the first planet  you set foot on.The games are pretty short (unless you go hardcore).

												I fell in love with Flotilla the instant I saw space ships fighting to simple classical music, which reminded me of 2001: A Space Odessy.  It's the kind of game that doesn't let you retry a battle if you lose, instead you have to start your whole campaign over again.  Despite this, there is a certain  randomness to it that keep anyone from playing the same game twice.  I think this and the games quirky sense of humor make for a more interesting and engaging experience.  I highly recommend it and I'm very interested to see what Blendo games comes out with in the future.			",210,48,0,17,23,2,23

												This game came sooo close to being the perfect title for me, but unfortunately fell far short of that. I blame the developers apparent lack of scope for this. Many of the developer's titles spruce really neat ideas and interesting environments, yet are merely bashed out into small-package ‘concept games’... It's an awesome game, and I recommend you consider getting it when it’s on sale, but the game itself (with such amazing foundations) is designed for small intervals of casual gaming, is shallow in depth and plot, and begs an update with much more sophisticated gameplay mechanics and a persistent universe.

												Really a joy. Not a fancy game by any stretch, seeming almost a little bit incompleted. My understanding after many hours of play is that there is in fact no way to win. It seems to me that it was on the leading edge of the rogue like trend. Unfortunately that makes it feel a little dated. However, the game mechanics are the best space combat strategy I have ever seen (reminds me of the book Ender's Game a little). So I recommend Flotilla for anyone. Just don't spend much on it, or expect an expansive game.			",74,24,1,4,26,0,25

												I found the demo for Flotilla to be aggravating, uninteresting, limited, and in general a great example of what happens when a game fails to live up to its potential. Why I subsequently purchased the game is beyond me, but I'm glad I did, and not just because in the future, status in society will be determined by the number of games we own on Steam. Flotilla at some point came together for me. Some heady mix of Rastafarian cats, complex simultaenous turn based pirouettes through all of the good dimensions, an aesthetic that knows what it needs to give you what you want, and a tone that encompasses all of this (which can be summed up in the subtitle of the game: Orbital Battleship Maneuvers) leads, circuitously but inevitably, to bliss. This is at once a pocket sized Homeworld and, like BLENDO Games' other work, an experience waiting to happen to you for as long as you wish your attention to be held by it.			",218,98,3,24,13,1,35

												Flotilla is feng shui in space; it's Ender's Game adapted by Lawrence Lllewellyn-Bowen. The enemy sofa is down. You take turns moving boxes, your boxes shoot at other boxes with missiles and lasers, and you can position your boxes to absorb or deflect incoming shots. This continues until you've decorated a weirdly orange spacescape with the hollowed out box corpses of your enemiesIt also has a few ha-ha-so-quirky random events you cycle through by clicking on planets, King of Dragon Pass style. Who cares though you're here to move bigger boxes into smaller boxes so they explode			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Flotilla is a turn-based highly tactical space fleet simulator with a simultaneous turn resolution. I wrote the word ""simulator"" intentionally because this game allows to move ships in full 3D just like in the real Space.  It has been 6 years since the release, and the game pretty much represents what indie games were felt like back then. Visuals are very minimalistic but have a certain style and looks fine even today. Low-poly ships, asteroids and debris are complemented with comics and choose-your-own-adventure segments to narrate an action between tactical fights. The game is light-hearted with cheeky humor, maybe sometimes over the top. Classical piano music and game sounds won’t immerse you into a grimdark space battle, but serve their purpose.Yet all this is an addition to the key game element – tactical space combat. The game disrupts the flow of a space fight every 30 seconds and allows a player to plan her actions ahead. Each ship can receive one of four possible orders and move in a straight line along any of six axis. While a ship can take a lot of damage in the front amour, the other parts are much weaker. This makes Flanking a priority tactic, which very fun to execute in a three-dimensional space. There are also various upgrades for ships to create a progression throughout the plot. Even today, when the space theme blooms and shines, it’s hard to find many space opera games with same level of simple controls and freedom of movement.As I said, the game represent what the indie games looked like back than. A charming and small product is built around single idea, which it delivers rather well and satisfying. Of course, by the modern standards the game is too short and too unpolished and should have a multiplayer and… But hey, six years have passed. And the demo is still available.			",158,50,1,7,10,1,40

												Minimalistic graphics, mildly amusing intermissions and general concept made me interested, so I tried the demo. I liked it, so I added the game to the wishlist. Unfortunately, this game has a completely unnecessary restriction on how long you can play it, which isn't much longer. Maybe the intention was to make something for playing in short bursts, but I don't think it fits this one.If you liked the demo, you'll be better off just playing it over and over again and spend your money on something else.

												This game is the epitome of simple and completely random. Though its one main music track is pretty, it can quickly become grinding, especially when your fleet of (maybe) three destroyers wanders into a fight with two battleships or three beam frigates because that's what the dice rolled.I made a comparison between this and FTL in another place; where FTL at least balances itself to be easier in earlier sectors while still being randomized, this does not.

												Bought the game on a whim as I thought it looked like it could be fun.I suggest you don't do the same thing.The game is .. just .. I don't know.  It's hard to sum up.  It's not terrible, it's just bland.  The alien factions are all dogs, cat, deer, penguins, making it feel child-like, and the weird graphics on the space battles somewhat add to that.  At first I guess you could say it's 'arty' but to me it just feels lazy - as if you were practicing building a strategy game and planned to add the REAL graphics layer later.It isn't awful.  If you're curious, you might as well buy it .. but I struggle to find the interest to have even another short play, the game just didn't grab me at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an average game in every possible sense of the word. It isn't that its graphics are so-called ""low quality"" since geometric primitives are a really cool style when done right. It's not a matter of visuals that make the game average. It's that it is something that would be more suited as an early release prototype for a gamedev project. Not something shipped on Steam. There's a lack of content or novel gameplay that sets it apart from other space battle/strategy games. I was a little disappointed by the steam page implying that the combat was something innovative. It's something that is commonly seen (and rather better implemented) in many other space games. It's literally 3D combat, as in an explicit point of origin and sharp angles  of movement. As a result there is a well-defined ""up"" direction. If this review wasn't thorough enough or you're interested I did a playthrough here.			",212,50,0,19,13,1,17

												Flotilla is a very fascinating take on space exploration. There is no saving, you are the captain, and you are stuck with a fatal disease that will take your life in a predetermine amount of turns. Flotilla offers a lot of real time choices that directly affects your fleet of ships. Some scenarios include saving a group of space-llamas and adding them to your fleet, or destroy them for ship upgrades.  The combat is turn based and takes place on a 3D plane; you can command your ship to fly in any direction and fire at enemy ships. With tons of combat choices and flanking decisions your head might explode from strategizing, as a result I can’t recommend this game to strategy noobs. However, if you use to fight alongside Napoleon and George Washington back in the day, I highly recommend this game. Oh ya just play hardcore mode, in normal mode you just end up dead faster from your “disease”. There is virtually no difference in gameplay difficulty by playing in hardcore over normal.

												So, I bet you're here because this game is on sale for basically dirt cheap.I can tell you with total confidence that this game is worth every penny of the full price.If you like strategy games and roguelikes, this is for you. It's short and sweet, with unbelievable replayability, and quirky humor splashed over what would most likely otherwise be a somewhat depressing and gritty world. Think if Star Trek went on a bender, and every episode featured Q. That is this game in a nutshell.On the gameplay side of things, it works like nothing else I have ever seen. The game map is sort of like in FTL, where you move from system to system on linear but branching paths. However, the battles are where things get a little crazy, with a turn-based combat system on a full 3D plane of movement. The depth of planning and strategy you need to put into every move is unbelievable, because if you forget to move a part of a ship in a particular way, that could easily be the end of you, or if you don't check your movement from other angles and directions. The combat is immensely difficult and complex, but so satisfying once you get it down.Also, something I normally don't appreciate in games but has to be mentioned here because of the complexities, the tutorial in this game is nice and straightforward. It teaches you the ins and outs of combat quickly and in good detail.			",143,23,2,18,13,1,26

												I have to admit that I appreciate and revere the concept of this game more than my hours played suggest.  Truth is that I am not especially good at this game.  Also, it is not designed for multiplayer accomodating large groups.  That is a hindrance to its popularity amongst my group-minded-play friends.  This is a unique game that really pits success and failure against each other in a manner in which permanence is the focus.  Mistakes are brutal and disappointing.  Success is arduously won and celebrated with a vigor befitting such a victory.  This is a great strategy game that is underrated at best, forgotten at worst.			",155,32,1,15,18,3,25

												Flotilla is a game about blowing up spaceships with the power of vectors. Magnitude & direction, ♥♥♥♥♥es.The game is primarily a turn-based strategy set in a fully three dimensional battlefield. Every turn you plot a course telling your ships where & how far to fly, where to shoot, and where to shield themselves. The enemy does the same. Then press play and watch♥♥♥♥♥♥fly everywhere. It's simple in concept yet brilliant in execution - and extremely satisfying to watch your battleships scrape by careening torpedos and slide beneath the belly of a battleship, pumping missles into its weakest flank.You know that part in Ender's Game where they win all those no-grav games by thinking three-dimensionally and popping up in places the opponent never expected them to be? Flotilla is pretty much that, with missles and lasers.			",226,86,0,38,22,1,35

												A lovely little game that combines space battleship tactics ... with Chopin music. You have a short amount of time left to explore some of the wackiest scenarios this universe has to offer, such as Gangster Goldfish, Stowaway Toucans and cosmic anomalies that steal your trousers. And perhaps you can build up a formidable armada of starships along the way!Great little random adventure to dive into if you’ve got 20 minutes or so to kill. Flotilla gets 3/5 from me.

												I'll always see this game as a pleasant underdog of sorts. It's a tactical simulator that bears a likeness to Homeworld - except without the resource gathering and potentially massive, complicated fleet battles. What pleasantly surprised me was the developers' choice of opening music, which played throughout each tactical turn executed. Watching frigates and destroyers close in on each other with missile salvos cutting through the space between them while listening to Chopin kind of did it for me. And it's a lovely low-key, quick dose of fun if you ever consider logging into your Steam account from your work station. Kind of like a 21st century minesweeper.			",16,2,0,3,1,0,10

												A lovely Roguelike/Space Sim mashup, with iconic yet minimalistic graphics. This little gem certainly won't make your computer sweat, but it might make you sweat when the battles start growing larger. While not the most accesible game ever, given an hour or two anyone should be able to enjoy at least one full campaign. With solid campaigns lasting from 30 to 60 minutes, this is a great pickup and play game.			",108,16,3,41,34,1,30

												One of those games that is great to pick up and play. Game sessions only last about half an hour at the most, and the sandbox isn't a bad place to spend some time, either. A unique system for hybrid real time/turn based combat gives this game some thinking time, but also lets you watch an epic (if not rather abstract) battle unfold.			",56,16,0,12,12,0,16

Slow paced, tactical space battles with relaxing music and some basic yet still entertaining binary decisions as you reach each planet, which will sometimes end up effecting your battles with rewards and punishments based on your decisions, or starting fights with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ deer. The game has a Rastafarian Cat group, so what's NOT to like? Well, I'll tell what's not to like. Lasers. They're OP as ♥♥♥♥ and a laser vs laser fight is nothing but luck.

												A truly strange game. You set the course of your (modestly sized) flotilla of space vessels in a turn-based face-off with the enemy. Graphics are barely above wireframe level, but this matters little. Short, hilarious text+picture screens apparently tell the story. I have not seen much yet, as my first adventure only lasted one mission. My flotilla encountered ""vicious space chickens"", who blasted my ships with a death laser - game over. Certainly not overly easy or accessible, that one. But I smell great potential, and those story screens are comedy gold. Fowl space pirates... seriously?			",180,23,4,34,12,1,71

												Flotilla is a funny, charming game with a unique art style that has endeared itself to me. It's never going to get uninstalled.The premise of the game is you, the player, are a Spaceship Captain who's just found out he's got a few months left to live. It doesn't go into detail as to the how's and why's because that's unimportant.What is important is that you've set out on one last adventure, and you're gonna have as much fun, and kick as much♥♥♥♥♥ as you can!The gameplay is great, ""encounters"" are laid out across a Star Map, which you click on and are transported to. Once your ship marker arrives you have an Encounter- a picture of the individual or group you've encountered and a text box detailing what's happened, along with your multiple actions/answers.Sometimes you will have to fight! This is done in a Mode which puts you in command of your ship(s), in a turn based, Three dimensional battlefield. You can move in all 3 dimensions and some strategy regarding your positioning is necessary, as shots often move slow enough that several turns pass before it reaches the enemy.The characters you meet along the way are imaginative, charming, and hilarious. There's always some new thing that makes you chuckle, or curse, happening to you, and you have multiple choices as to how you'd like to deal with it.There's a cool Upgrades system, and you gain XP through battles that allows you to explode an enemy vessel for free (which sounds cheap, but ♥♥♥♥ me, it is VERY necessary when you've got 2 battleships up against your tiny ship).I really like the fact that it's got a two player mode, too. It just adds another factor to this incredible game for me to love.Play this ♥♥♥♥ing game, I dare you. You'll enjoy it, and you'll feel guilty that you're not in bed with CoD.
