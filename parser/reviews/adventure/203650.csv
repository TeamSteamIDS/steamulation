												For those that missed the first episode of Sonic 4, this is a 2D platforming game staring everyone's favorite blue hedgehog. The plot is the same as its always been, but with a twist. Dr. Robotnik, the evil antagonist of most every Sonic game has now teamed up with Metal Sonic! The dude with 90s attitude isn't alone though, he now has Tails to go with him. With Tails, come new mechanics, such as jumping into the air, and calling Tails to lift Sonic like a helicopter. If you're on the ground and use the tag button, it summons Tails to combine the two for a super fast attack. If you need to use the helicopter ability, the game will have a little billboard to tell you. This game feels more a kin to the Game Boy Advance games than the original Genesis games which the first episode clearly drew inspiration from.In Episode 2, you have four zones with three acts each followed by a boss fight as a fourth act. Not just that, but later into the four hour game, you unlock a playable Metal Sonic with four zones and one act each. These zones use assets from the first episode. So in all, there are 16+ levels for you to master. These levels feel a lot longer than the first episode and the Genesis games as a whole. Some levels feel like six minute marathons with no end in sight.The levels are big and offer many paths to the exit. You'll have to avoid an array of enemies, spikes, and even death traps. You'll collect rings everywhere and these rings aren't just because dullards love shinny things, but as long as Sonic has at least one ring, he can take another hit. Even if you have 100 rings and get hit, only 30 will spray out of Sonic. When you get hit with no rings, it means death for the fuzzy blue guy. There are plenty of check points in each level if you die. A game over simply means that you'll need to start the level again. If you collect 100 rings in a level, you get an extra life. If you have 50+ rings at the end of the level, a giant ring will appear that will take you to a special bonus stage.These bonus stages are updated versions of the old Sonic 2 bonus stages. You'll follow Sonic running down a 3D half pipe. You can boost and jump. There are a few check points that need X amount of rings to get past. So as Sonic, you'll solemn down the tube moving left and right, collecting rings and dodging obstacles that will lose you rings. At the end you'll find a chaos emerald.... that somehow isn't green. Whatever. Collect all seven to unlock a yellow Super Sonic.New to the Sonic 4 series is local co-op and even online co-op, but since the game came out in 2011, good luck trying to find a partner. There are online leader boards for time attacks. It adds to the replayability I guess, but more than that, the game has a red star ring on each level to collect. These rings are either tough to find or tough to get. Its an extra challenge for veterans.Sonic and Metal Sonic play the same. Left and right to move, with a single button to jump. Hold down to duck and hit the jump button to start a spin dash to get momentum to go up slopes. You still need to charge it which takes time. That's why the airborne dart attack is not only a much better way to gain speed instantly, but you can also lock in on targets accurately hit them no matter what the angle. Episode 2 didn't make as much use of the homing attack as the first episode, but it does make travel easier, darting for an enemy or a springboard. The only difference between Metal Sonic and the ordinary version is lack of an ally. No helicoptering around or bowling through enemies.Calling Tails just feels slow. Tails automatically zips right back to Sonic wherever he is, unless he just died, but it just halts the game to wait. The Sky Fortress kicks off with an airplane mission that has Sonic atop Tail's plane that gives you full control to move the plane left, right, up and down. Complete with Sonic able to jump and attack. Under normal circumstances, I'd think it diversifies gameplay having a plane dodge enemies and twirl through barricades to destroy them. This felt like a slow auto scrolling level (act). There was still a part where the 2D platforming returned, but then it was just back to being on top of a plane. It felt dull, slow and boring. Then having to fight the boss on the plane was unfun.The real snag that I have for this game is how long and dull the boss battles are. They take traditional, classic boss battles and completely twist them around into mega bosses. See I like the twists and fighting giant bosses, I just don't like how tedious every boss was. Having to damage each boss for three minutes before the final phase of the boss fight left me clueless and dead ate up most of my 4 hours in the game. These 3 minutes on each attempt felt like 10 and I was never in any real danger. It wasn't a challenge surviving the 3 minutes, it was just a delay for the real challenge. At least the game takes full advantage of having Metal Sonic as an enemy. You get three boss fights against him.The game has other down sides too, like a timed race against sand flooding an area. Sonic needs to go up, breaking through barriers, then down. This would separate the casual players from the hardcore. It ate up two dozen lives and was quite the difficulty spike. Then on the final two levels, when Sonic went down hill or uphill, the entire screen would shift so Sonic wasn't running downhill, he was on a horizontal plane. It was disorienting, and might cause someone motion sickness.Water areas feel better in this game than they have in the past. Sonic jumps higher and Tails can carry him, so you have more maneuverability. Under water still slows down Sonic and he can't swim. If you're underwater too long, Sonic will need to get oxygen from big air bubbles that drift their way up.The soundtrack feels Genesis in a good way. Percussion and synth horns. Its all upbeat happy game music. The graphics are bright and vibrant. There is a good color pallet here. A dusty yellow castle with an aquatic greenish blue moat. A winter wonderland theme park, lit up for a holiday with blue ice water. A metallic sandy red oil rig in a yellow desert. A yellow sky fortress with fans to propel Sonic into the air. Dr. Robotnik's gray and purple metal lair. As each zone progressed, the acts would change their color pallets so you'll see day turn to dusk. It all adds to making each of the three acts feel different. Having Metal Sonic's 4 different zones with 1 act each adds a lot of diversity, even if 3 acts each would have been nicer.Even with all the bad, its still a good game. Better than most other 2D platforms out there for $15. I enjoyed the first episode better, but it felt like they took the gameplay a step in the right direction. If its on sale, take a risk.

												I want to get this out of the way before starting this review, why was this episodic? This easily could've been the next main series Sonic game as Episode 2 looks WAY different than Episode 1. But was it for the best? Yes. The engine has been updated for full 3D graphics like in Sonic Generations and the physics have been fixed, which was a major problem in Episode 1. Another problem in Episode 1 was unoriginality, which Episode 2 changes around (apart from Not Wing Fortress Zone). The bosses are now not complete jokes but I found the Eggman bosses annoying and enduring complete with a 17 second loop boss theme. I have much more enjoyment with the Metal Sonic fight in White Park before Sky Fortress ruined his reputation. The music is still Mega Drive samples but I found more catchy tunes in this game than Episode 1. Also, this game has Tails who follows Sonic like in Sonic 2 and you can perform tag actions with him, like flying, swimming underwater and 69. So is this an improvement over Episode 1? In my opinion, yes. Still not worthy of the name Sonic 4 but it's a decent improvement. 8/10			",34,3,2,2,1,0,0

												This game has online co-op! And it works well. It's not like the Sonic 2 co-op, where Tails will just get left behind. You just have to tap a button to reunite Tails and Sonic. The online seems to be sturdy. I had a little bit of lag during the final Acts, but it never became unplayable. But don't expect to just find some rando online, because I don't think many people even REALIZE the online co-op exists. It's not even listed on the steam features blurb. Plus it's a million times better than Episode 1. Skip right to episode 2. And don't believe the people who say this game is ""the worst Sonic game ever."" It's FUN. And the music and level design are both on-point. The homing mechanism is a little bit broken, though. And there are several frustrating moments towards the end. But it's not a bad game, dammit. It's probably not worth a full $15, though. Or maybe it is, if you can find someone to play with.			",137,103,0,12,10,2,12

												I definitely like sonic 4 episode 2 better than episode 1 mainly because it has more characters, plot, and a better flow overall to the game. The only 2 things I don't are the game has to show a pop-up everytime you complete a zone and that it's not long enough. The sonic and tails roll ability is unrealistic and makes the game too easy in my opinion, even though it's a cool idea, I just think it needs to be implemented in a different way like in an item box. All in all it has beautiful graphics, physics, and boss fights. The reason I think it has good physics is because it doesn't seem too fast or too slow in my opinion.			",11,3,1,2,2,0,0

It's a vast improvement over episode 1, the only complaint I have is that it was too short and I want more!If you're a sonic fan, you'll absolutely love this since Metal Sonic makes his much desired come back. Even if you're not into sonic games this is still great for platformer fans. I'm glad that steam users gave this game positive reviews because it certainly deserves. The game is totally worth the price and I hope some day Sega decides to make more episodes.			",456,137,5,54,47,7,92

												Well sorry that I've enjoyed this game. I liked Episode I and this one have better grapshims, better controls and better soudtracks. However, it seems that the problem come from a unbalanced difficulty, a load of vicious moments and a very hard final boss. It is way harder than Episode I.→ 74/100			",17,1,2,1,2,1,0

												Personally don't think the game deserves such a low metascore, I thought it was a drastic improvement from Episode 1. Movement and controls feel more fluid and the level design shows they can still come up with something original. Found the boss battles to be fairly challenging and more entertaining than the first episode too. A solid Sonic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Huge improvement over the last game. Improved Graphics, Sonic feels fast this time, and music didnt feel so repetitive like before. The game introduced some tag team abilites that were interesting and worked well. Got to the first boss and i thought they were gonna rehash the totem boss with the arrows but it quickly switched switched to a more creative boss. They were probably poking fun at how the bosses were in the last one.  Metacritic's score is questionable.  Games pretty good overall.4/5			",244,49,6,30,8,2,13

												A great improvement from Episode I. It has better graphics and Tails! The game feels like a mix from the Genesis Sonic 2 and 3. You can do combos with tails that include flying (even without a second player!) and other cool stuff that you actually use a lot during the game, giving it a new way to play Sonic. The only thing that I would complain about is the ending, that is pretty ""so-so"". For the 2D series, I think this one might surpass Sonic Generations in gameplay. The game is awesome and a must-play for 2D Sonic fans.			",228,39,5,39,18,2,39

												It was ok. You'll like it if you're a Sonic fan, but it's not a good sidescrolling platformer. Episode 1 was far better. Buy this game on sale if you must.The backgrounds and graphics were absolutely stunning. I liked the fact you had tag team abilities with Tails. When you do the spinny thing with tails it looks like they're doing a 69 which is pretty funny. Makes you realize that Sonic is a homosexual because he hates Amy and love Tails.The platforming itself was quite lackluster. Most of the levels were just so easy it was rather boring. I really hate the handholding where the game tells you where every bottomless pit is and when you need to use tag team abilities. Can't I die once and intuitively know I need to use the ability next time? The music is also mediocre until it becomes grating because it's so repetitive.I have little to no reason to replay levels as there's a save system. The game was also rather short, it took me 3 hours to get through all 4 stages and Metal Sonic stages.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This has to be one of my favorite Sonic games ever. Twice as good as the first part, which when I bought it when it came out on 360 I didn't see that coming. I love this game more than the 2D half of Sonic Generations, and that's totally the better half. Now I'm going to have to remaster this game, like I did with the first part, so I can have the same bragging rights again. Where is part 3 Sega? They came out with the two Sonic 4 games about a year apart from eachother, maybe less. WHERE IS PART 3! SEGA, TELL ME, TAKE MY MONEY AND GIVE ME MORE SONIC 4! Can I double recommend this game?

Posted: October 27, 2015
												While not as shockingly bad as Episode 1, Sonic 4 Ep. 2 really doesn't improve upon the formula all that much. It's a tired retread that doesn't come close to any of the Genesis games. There are positive qualities: The storyline is non-existent, a Hedgehog isn't revived by a kiss, the music is bland but okay, and um...yeah that's about it. More than anything else, I appreciate Sonic 4 simply because it makes the previous games look so much better by comparison. Once again, the first major failing of Episode 2 is the level-design. Everything feels cramped. It's a combination of the camera being zoomed-in too much, a lack of anything note-worthy nearby, and a general absence of ""flow"". All of the stages have this boxy feel to them. It's like they were slapped together by some sort of map-maker and the results are really unnatural. Good levels are supposed to be sketched out before-hand, like a storyboard. It allows for the designer to develop a specific theme. In this game, it's more along the lines of: we'll have some jumps, then a ramp, and here's a loop, oh and another loop sounds good, then we'll follow up with some rings, and then... The levels are stretched out enough to fill some allotted amount of time (2-4 minutes), and that's it.Every zone in the 2D Sonic games has a different tile-set. Imagine if for Sonic 1, every zone looked like Green Hill. Spring Yard would look like Green Hill. Labyrinth? Green Hill. Starlight? Take a wild guess. Even though every zone looked like one another, they would still be very different, because they have concepts and themes unique to each of them. Every zone in Sonic 4 Ep. 2 is visually distinct, and yet they all feel so similar to each other it doesn't matter. There is the standard array of springs, ramps, traps, and enemy robots. Nothing really changes beyond ""Hey you gotta go fast here"".When Episode 2 tries new ideas, the results are middling at best. Tails is along for this trek, and the BFFs can perform team-up actions. At practically any moment you can get an assist from Tails to reach higher areas, create a super rolling attack, or swim. The system is implemented awkwardly, as most of the flying sections are forced. Also, due to the poor level-design, it never feels like you've discovered a shortcut or a secret when flying around. This I attribute to the claustrophobic aspects of the level-design. Since you can never see too far in front of you, nothing looks out of reach. Part of the appeal of finding secrets like 1ups and red rings is that you can see them, but you have to consider how they can be collected. In this game, if there's something you can't get to, it's probably because you took a different route. I guess this is to encourage replay value, but it's at the cost of exploration, which isn't a good trade-off.Another issue with Tails and - by extension the level-design - is the mechanics. When flying, you have to be careful when approaching cliffs from below. If you press against the wall, what will happen is that Tails will step onto the cliff, and Sonic will fall to his death. This doesn't crop up very often, except for the sections where you're forced to rely on Tails to fly. As with Sonic 4 Ep. 1, the hardest part of any act is towards the end. To put it another way, these parts are the only time where death is a real possibility. They can involve a lot of traps, stupid pet tricks, or other gimmicks. The unbalanced difficulty makes the rest of the act feel like padding. Sonic The Hedgehog games tend to be easy, but there is still some sort of balance, with the later zones being more challenging than the early zones. With this game, all of the difficulty is in these end-of-act sections. The boss-fights are garbage. Metal Sonic makes his less-than-triumphant return for this adventure. I've always liked its design, and the Sonic CD ""boss-fight"" was really cool. In this game, he's ran into the ground. Every other boss-fight involves a duel with Metal Sonic, and the encounters all have this samey design to them. You're constantly running, trying to get a hit on the hedgebot, but an invisible force pushes you backwards while he performs various attacks. You'll fight Robotnik (or was it Eggman?) a few times as well. These fights just run way too long. Some of them start with an interesting look or a cool visual, but then they drag on and on for several minutes. I especially dislike the third boss. It's far too easy, but then in order to get the last hit, you have to awkwardly lure him to the right spot, just to land a super rolling attack.As a ""bonus"", if you own both this game and Episode 1, you get to play a shortened version of Episode 1 starring Metal Sonic. Apparently it takes place shortly after Sonic CD, but I don't care about that. It adds an unnecessary convoluted twist to a storyline that didn't need it. All that really needs to be said is that Robotnik is back, and so is Metal Sonic. It's a freaking robot! Eggman probably just rebuilt the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥, or made a new one. Your best bet is ignoring Sonic Team's attempt at tricking unsuspecting gamers into playing through Episode 1 again. Yes it's a shorter and re-arranged version of the game, but the level-design is still absolutely wretched.Jon Rooke, the European Marketing Director at SEGA, recently had this to say: “Sega has publicly apologised to the fans as the quality of console games in the Sonic franchise hasn’t been acceptable over recent years. It’s been tough translating that iconic side scrolling 2D experience from the 90s into 3D but Sonic is still huge for us so the new games will be more inspired by how it played in its heyday."" It's a nice gesture. However, I can't shake the feeling that we'll end up with Sonic 5. I'm certain that it'll star Knuckles, every zone will be a half-hearted throwback to Sonic 3, and it's going to be a thoroughly miserable experience.			",914,265,35,107,34,4,37

												After being disappointed with Sonic 4 Episode I, a return to Sonic's 2D roots that featured some ugly art design and a brutal phsyics engine, I wasn't expecting much from Episode II. Surprisingly though, I ended up having quite a bit of fun with the sequel. The physics engine is upgraded considerably and, while still not perfect, now feels much closer to the Genesis-era games. The hideous cel-shaded character design from the first episode was also ditched in favor of a cleaner look. Level design and boss battles are also improved from Episode I. The newly-introduced ""Tag Actions"" feel fresh and make for some nice platforming sequences as well. On the downside, the soundtrack is hit-or-miss (mostly miss) and a little more zone variety would've been nice.While still not on the level of the the 2D Sonic games from the Genesis days, Sonic 4 Episode II manages to hold its own and provide an enjoyable experience that retains that classic Sonic feel while tossing in a few fresh twists here and there. Worth playing if you're a fan of the series.			",576,187,17,44,37,4,58

												Sonic 4 pretty much feels like a reimagining of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 with some zones looking very familiar with some things added, others would call it rehashing but I see it as reinventing for better or worse. Episode II as a whole is a much bigger improvement to the first episode but as a result feels very different at the same time with the graphics update and new physics enging making it feel more like its own game rather than a continuation, however you still go through 4 zones with 4 acts so structure is mostly the same as the first episode.The partner mechanic is a new feature that lets you take control of both Tails and Sonic simutaneously Metal Sonic returning from Sonic CD continuity wise is your new rivalMusic I think is better, Metal Sonic's theme is amazing and I could listen to Death Egg Mk II anytimeI recommend this game to people who only liked the first episode. It's still not a good follow up to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 nor is the level design of the zones the game's based around is good (never really was a fan of the original Sonic the hedgehog game in 1991) but it's mostly okay, could be much better. I hope to one day see an Episode 3 from Sonic Team just to see what becomes of Little Planet trapped inside the Death Egg.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""It's better than the first game."" ... That's it, that's all it really amounts to. As a game itself, Sonic 4 Episode 2 is still awkward. You get Tails this time around and don't have to get a second controller or anything of the sort to utilize him, which is honestly brilliant (as is the multiplayer feature with him as well!). He can now join you in a high speed rolling attack, or fly underwater which seems to give him infinite flight.... Aaaaand then there's the rest.It's honestly a genuine step up from Episode 1. The graphics don't look as if Sonic is pasted badly on shopped scenery, neither does Tails. Music is... well, there's more of it. You won't hear the same boss theme over and over and over. In my opinion, however, it definitely isn't ""better"". The biggest problem with the game is its frustratingly cheap level design. For example, when bouncing up on a spring, there can be an enemy atop the platform you're trying to reach, but you have literally a millisecond to react or you take the hit. Or, for Christ's sake, trying to fiddle with Tails' flight in a pitfall-heavy section only to get on a platform and Tails randomly lets go of you, thus causing you to fall backward off the edge to your uncalled-for death. Sky Fortress is definitely on my list of most hated stages in the franchise.The plot doesn't really matter but it meant a ton to me. When I read that Metal Sonic returns and Little Planet from Sonic CD is back, on top of Tails being here, I got irritated. ""Oh boy, Sonic 2 + Sonic CD!"" However, it was actually really okay and different. That's the one major plus I'll give Sonic 4 if nothing else. It's not a nostalgia cashcow like the first, it is instead its own game with its own final boss. They threw in the Metal Sonic race remake, but it was still different because you had Tails with you and it was done differently from Sonic CD.Aside from cheapness... gameplay is far tighter, bosses are way more interesting, special stages are actually fun (UNTIL THE SEVENTH), level design is still meh but better than Episode 1, and Tails saved this game.It's really not that bad if you just want to drop money on a Sonic game, especially if you enjoy Classic Sonic gameplay (with a homing attack to help). A vast, vast improvement from the first, and leaves the story at a good place to encourage an Episode 3.			",48,17,6,5,2,0,5

												This game is probably the worst game the gamecube ever had to put up with. this is shovelware at best and just a disk at worst. a story is al ready terrible enough but him about sonic ""finishing"" someone is just terrible. sorry even in a game this bad i dont give the story away. The gameplay is... terrible due to bad camera bad controls and no sense whatsoever THE POLES AND SWORDS HAVE AMMO,no sense made here.The Good-It's fun to shrink enemies and stomp on them.THE BAD:-Horrible main character-Bad story-Awful dialouge-Bad gunplay-Pointless cursing-Long, boring platforming and driving sections-The shooting lacks impact-Ugly visuals-Fails to be shocking, sexy, or funny. Overall, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II is barely playable, not funny, rampantly offensive, and one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A great improvement over Episode I but still retains some of its mistakes. The main difference in this game is the addition of Tails and ""tag actions"" which, in my opinion, was both good and bad for the gameplay. It added some new fun mechanics but also made the game much easier (almost every time you fall or mess up, you can use the ""flying tag action"" to save yourself).Pros:+Better level design and fun platforming (GREAT compared to Episode I)+Bosses and enemies are mostly new and feel more Sonic like+Improved physics+Nice new mechanics+Addition of multiplayer and Red Rings to keep you playingCons:-Game is too easy-Still uses some recycled material -Special stages may become irritating-Why can't I choose to play as Tails in single player!!!??? >:0Should you buy this game? Yeah, even if you're not a Sonic fan you will probably enjoy it :)Still... $15 is a little too expenisve so buy it on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sonic 4 - Episode II actually does a lot to improve on its predecesor, though it's still somewhat flawed. This time, the physics are a bit better, as Sonic does have inertia, but they still don't feel like the originals, especially when Sonic is curled up into a ball. However, this time around it feels more intentional. When you're curled into a ball, you go slower but are less vulnerable to enemies while freely running lets you move faster at the cost of being easier to hit. It doesn't feel like the original Sonic games but it does stand up fairly well on its own. Tails is also here, giving you an arsenal of team-attacks you can do, which does add some depth to the game, albeit breaking the pace up at times. The stages are more creative this time around as well, as they are totally rendered in 3D and combine stage ideas from previous games. The music still has the weird instrumentation from the first one, however, and towards the end of the game they start getting more lazy with reusing tracks. That said, it feels like a much more competent Sonic game than the first episode and I'd like to see a conclusion, but that's probably not happening.			",41,16,2,3,4,0,1

												The Sequel to the one of the worst sonic games out there. this is actually a solid game, and way better than the first sonic four episode.The graphics are more sharp and it has a more sonic vibe to it.The music is alot better this time around. ( same with the sound effects)The gameplay is pretty fun, the platforming is fast, the momentum (while still a little wonky) is much more responsive, but The homing attack is still here and can be overpowering, also there are these little tag-team things that can get annoying at times. the levels are well made and are fun to play.The bosses are a mixed bag but all-in-all they are really fun (some of them are based off of older games bosses).The Metal sonic segments are awesome, so much fun to play.The story doesn't really go anywhere, not like the older games.Verdict: it's suprisingly not awful. 6/10			",169,20,2,13,5,0,5

-Quick Review-Sonic the Hedgehog 4 - Episode II is a 2d platformer developed by SEGA and released May 15, 2012. As with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, these games are basically a revisualization/reboot of the classic SEGA Genesis Sonic Games.


Actual gameplay (not bonus levels) - Uploaded for Review 
A Screenshot of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4 Episode II
By: Atratzu




-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Dr Robotnik /Eggman is back at it again, Sonic needs to go kick his robo-butt again (sorry, I've watched a bit too much of the ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" over the last year), This time you're joined with tails, and Robotnik has Metal Sonic.Yeah no, there's nothing else to say here, you've danced this dance. There's no voiced characters, just gestures and good old fashion 2D platforming. Some people will like it, others will hate it.Gameplay: The new thing brought to the table in this game is the addition of using Tails. He's basically going to be your Yoshi in this game, and just like in Sonic 3 he can be beat up with no real consequences.You can rebind the keys to what you want, but the default keys I used for the whole game were WASD for directional movement, and JKUI for the buttons... so J is jump, U is to use a tails power, and either K or I were to activate Super Sonic after collecting all 7 chaos emeralds.I really liked to be able to use the tails team power to get out of Super Sonic mode, so that's nice... Originally you couldn't stop super sonic mode unless you died or ran out of rings.But I digress, Tails has two uses: If you're standing on the ground sonic and Tails will make a big spin-dash-wheel which can destroy objects in the way. And if Sonic is in the air, Tails will fly with him, btw hit J to go up, if you hit U again Sonic will let go of Tails.


literally 2-3 hours of retrying the same level again and again... @.@

By: Atratzu




Conclusion: Again, This game has pretty much what I'd expect and want out of a Sonic Game. I got really discouraged and bosses and bonus stages, but I successfully beat the whole game, got all the chaos emeralds, and yeah... to most people that's the sign of a fully beat sonic game.(*mumbles* I guess I could work on getting the final few steam achievements, but I really don't want to redo all the bosses, and play through the whole game without stopping, I'm getting tired and lazy with achievements in my old age. Maybe I'll come back another day)


And done... If you look at my screenshots, it looks like I spent most of the game in the bonus stages... and that's almost true.

												This game is much better than Episode I; the graphics and controls are better, the environments and bosses are more unique, and the music more memorable. Not saying it's a perfect game, though; I'd say that the inclusion of Metal Sonic was unnecessary, and I wouldn't go so far as to say it's worthy of being called a direct sequel to Sonic 3 & Knuckles. However, it's an enjoyable Sonic game, and for that, it's worth the recommendation.			",154,64,3,28,14,1,24

												Sonic is a 2d platform game.If I look to the old Era of sonic games.Sonic 4 episode 2 is not bad and it has some good points.You have many option to play and if you buy both games you get some extra stuff.Still I prefure the old Sonic from the Sega Megadrive / Genesis era.Game is very extended and there are many things to do .... even become super sonic and that is cool.I still find the new generation sonic very slow when starting to run and missing the feeling having real speed.Modern sonic has some cool moves like the dash move and this gives you a new dimension of playing this game.PLaying with tails is cool and also give some new moves and ways to play.Sonic is a good plaftorm game only try also the classic versions.I give it a 7/10 score.

												Now that I've properly given this a go, this game actually isn't too bad.A much better effort compared to Episode 1 but a far cry from the 16-bit titles. It's closer to the DS Sonic Rush franchise with a slight more emphasis on platforming than boosting through the levels.A combination move gimmick allows you to access Tail's airlift and powered up spindash - extremely important in boss battles. The airlift gives a little more leeway when you find yourself careening towards a bottomless pit.Overall, maybe a 6.5/10. Enjoyed it, but only probably as a Sonic fan.			",1575,649,59,261,187,14,277

												Sonic the Hedgehog, that little blue ball of fur. He whizzes around in a blur. Faster than a speeding bullet. The thrill! The exhilaration! Those wonderful feelings that come to mind whenever I think of Sonic and his buddies. When thinking of a character like Sonic, it's hard to separate nostalgia from true feelings. Hopefully I'll be able to do that!Sonic 4: E2 is a fun platformer. Colourful landscapes, and cute enemies create a vibrant atmosphere. The graphics are acceptable for a 2D game in this generation. The game struggles to run on low end machines, even those that pass the system requirements. The game just isn't playable with system lag, or low FPS.The gameplay is okay, but I do have a few issues. To me Sonic was a different kind of platformer. It was all about whizzing through the levels as fast as possible. I got great joy from timing my jumps just right, getting enough coins for the special levels and bouncing off the enemies on the way. Unfortunately S4E2 doesn't feel right. Sonic at full speed feels sluggish, and that's a word you never want associated with our heroic hedgehog. I never felt out of control, Sonic never flew off the screen. Some people might call that a good thing, but I think a fair few fans would agree with my perspective.I was able to play some levels co-op. The levels are the same, one player controls Sonic, the other Tails. The problem with co-op is as soon as one character gets a little bit away from the other, the player behind has to use the catch up button. This just made the game feel like a chaotic mess. However, this chaotic mess was extremely fun. It enabled some awesome near-death escapes.The game is trying hard to be like the 2D Sonic games of old. It introduces some new abilities, like forming a super-ball of death with Tails (which is the best way to go through 80% of levels), or dashing through the air by double jumping. Ultimately this is where it fails. It's an okay platformer, and it has a pricepoint that reflects the length of the game but it doesn't stand up to classic Sonic games.Whilst the game does not stand up against previous Sonic games, it is quite a fun platformer. The levels are a nice length and fun to run through once. There isn't much replayability there though.Bottom Line: Fun co-op game. A little lacklustre when compared to classic Sonic.

												Sonic 4 Episode 2 is a game I'm completely inconsistent with. I played it for half an hour and thought it wasn't worth playing through, played it again from beginning to end and hated it, and then played it through again and honestly thought it was on par with the Genesis games.In comparison to Episode 1 it's definitely better. The physics are improved and the graphics no longer look like New Super Mario Bros. but worse. A lot of people complained that classic Sonic was absent from the first game, and took it way overboard, but I kinda do agree that modern looks really unnatural here. Thankfully there's a mod for that anyway if it bothers you that much.The game controls a lot better than Ep1 and it's at least satisfying in this game, but still not quite as solid as in the classic games or even Generations. Sonic feels like he lacks weight on the ground and momentum building isn't quite right, sometimes requiring homing attack spamming just to reach your max speed on the ground.The level themes are all blatantly reused concepts with the exception of White Park which while I can compare it to some levels it doesn't outright copy anything. I hate the fact that a game selling itself as Sonic 4 is almost nothing but recycled levels and enemies, but the levels themselves have so many new concepts that it's still pretty fresh as a whole, and the likenesses of Episode 2's levels to classic levels isn't as offensive as in Ep1... with the exception of Sky Fortress which is nearly identical.The game's visuals are absolutely gorgeous. I'd say Sonic 4 Ep2 is the most scenic game in the series. It's incredibly polished visually. I can't say the same about the soundtrack, though. While I initially really hated it, I realized on subsequent playthroughs with Super Sonic available I never used him for just one reason; I didn't want to stop the level music. While I do actually really love the compositions themselves, the instrumentation is horrid. They clearly went for a Genesis style tinny-ness to the synths but it just sounds awful on some tracks, specifically Sky Fortress Act II and the Death Egg's theme, two songs which I would actually really like if they used better synths.Oh yeah it's also really short. This game has five zones in total and 25 levels in all if you count the boss levels and special stages. I think with a casual runthrough of both this and Sonic 2, Sonic 2 would still be longer, but I consider Sonic 2 to be fairly short for a Sonic game I dunno. Completing the game without all of the Chaos Emeralds yields a message to go collect them, but there's really no reason to, because it does nothing to the ending. Little Planet is still stuck inside the Death Egg while Sonic and Tails feel good about themselves in their escape pods. This could be thought of as a lead-in to Episode 3, but as of now Sega has no plans for one. One of the developers has said that they might make one if Ep2 sold well. Did it? I dunno but I certainly don't want the Sonic 4 series to end like this.The game was actually short enough that I turned to achievement hunting to elongate it. Which was odd as this was after I'd already had my fill of this game and dismissed it as another bad Sonic entry. I actually WANTED to come back to collect achievements and actually found a lot of fun with the game, both in gathering the achievements and just playing the game itself. However I will say that the achievements are absolutely pointless. Certain gameplay elements like the Red Rings and presence and abundance of rings before boss encounters were clearly just implemented for the game's achievements on release, but getting said achievements has no bearing on the actual game whatsoever. Collecting all the Red Rings or getting the last hit on every boss as Super Sonic, none of this affects the game at all. It doesn't even have a list of the achievements in game so really it's questionable why they're even there other than to make this short game slightly longer.All in all though I did find a lot of fun with this. The game's length as well as reused settings are the biggest problems, but they're pretty well made up for with a beautiful presentation, pretty enjoyable music and most of all a lot of good level gimmicks and physical designs. Is it as good as the classics? Eh, probably not, if only because it's not completely orginal, but I had just about as much fun with it anyway.			",86,22,3,8,4,3,5

												It doesn't support the controller I have, so I have to use the keyboard. Keyboard controls are very iffy, make sure you write down what keys you set for everything because you will need to know them. The online co-op can get very laggy in certain parts, even if you play with someone who lives relatively close, avoid playing co-op with someone who lives in BFE lol. The game is very short, playthrough wise, but it's a classic flashback for those who own or use to own a Sega Genesis. I do not think it is worth the money at original price, so grab it when it's on sale, and by sale I mean like $2.50 or you will feel kind of ripped off.			",258,66,4,11,40,2,19

BUT MAY CONTAIN POINTS FROM EPISODE:METAL BUT NOT MAJOR *In a sense*Man, This game took me by storm after playing Episode 1.I thought Sonic The Hedgehog Episode 2 was going to be boring like Episode 1, But I was wrong in typical game fasion.I will go directly into everything and adding in a new part.SPOLIERS/STORY: This start off with Sonic and Tails flying the Tornado and ended up landing where they notice Eggman is back at it *For the 15th time today* again! After clearing the first zone and moving on to the boss of the second zone, You realized 1st Tails is a idiot for leaving rockets all over the place and on another planet... 2nd Metal Sonic is back?! How did he survive you wondering, After leaving him destroyed on Little Planet *Refer to Sonic CD for more details.* Quick Backstory: Remember Eggman base from Episode 1 Turns out he been using it to charge up Metal Sonic, And he been distracting you by fighting you with machines. That's explain why the machines look so familer.Gameplay: This game have more features beside the Normal Combo Pack, You also get Tails. BUT TRUST ME Tails is useful in this game, I know shocker right? This game main focus was on Co-Op features I believe then the simple Lonely Hedgehog. You can get a friend or a stranger to play with you online or offline! There is 2 moves you can perform, Super Spindash *Not the actual name* which is faster then normal spindash and can destroy certain things. Then there is Tails Glide Ability, We both know what this do like in every game with tails... But at least this time Tails can carry sonic *Kinda*This game feel much easier then the other game, Which make it easier to digest.Level Design: This game took notes on what they did wrong in Episode 1 and added new levels that not stright up rip-offs! One thing I never explained in my last review was I highy disliked the level design, It felt so boring and sometimes very unforgiving... I'm glad they added new stages to play through.Graphics/visual: This game running on a new engine *Pretty sure the same as Sonic Generation now* And boy oh boy does it look better. From lighting and water, And I feel less annoyed.Special Stage Design: I know you never going to believe this, But I 100 percented these stages. Through hard work and crying in a corner I got through each stage, These stages are pretty much upgraded versions of the Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Special Stages. And they did it in a good way.Bonus: Super Sonic feel so nice to play as but the problem I had was with tails, I tried to do the COOP Action moves I reverted back to normal Sonic and that annoyed me. But that was more of a balancing issue...Also did you know, If you had Episode 1 you will get a bonus chapter known as EPISODE:METAL where you play as Metal Sonic. I'm in the middle of beating it.FINAL RATING: COMPLETE IT! 8.9/10This feel so much better then the last game, From visual to gameplay. Even the level designeverything is almost perfect.But this still not 10/10 material, This came pretty close but not enough.I can't recommend this game enough for the pricing! ",198,29,4,13,19,3,20

												Massive improvement over Episode I. The art direction and some of the game mechanics would not feel out of place in a Sonic Generations level. The physics have been revamped and feel closer to how they should feel. Metacritic score is too low, and probably skewed by the extremely low number of reviews (and from no-name sites) overall. The main failing is an over-reliance on the tag team mechanic with Miles, which can bog the pacing down at times.			",277,92,13,45,33,1,65

												(This a new recommendation. My old one sucked) Sonic 4 Episode 2 is a reasonable Sonic experience. It certainly holds no comparison to the classics, such as S3&K, but it tries to be a classic game brought into the HD world. It isn't terrible, but it isn't amazing either. I still recommend trying it out, as I found it to be an enjoyable experience.			",91,11,4,1,8,0,1

												This game was pretty great for a modern Sonic game! I gotta say,the music is kinda catchy and the levels are pretty neat. Compared to Episode 1,this game looks more better. I played the first act of this game and didn't play it afterwards because I was trying to get more things in SA2 (PC). After my best friend came over,though,we started the game,and I noticed the level I beat wasn't completed,but that didn't stop us. We played for a long while! Probably from 11:00 to 2:00 AM. We stopped at the first act for Sky Fortress because we were screwing up at the tornado spinning parts and the small Sonic part. The next day,we beat it. We both really enjoyed it. Pros: -Better graphics than Episode 1.-Short game,but still full of action.-The Death Egg is back again,but better!-The fact that Co-op exist.-Tails is more useful in this game than in Sonic 2 (1992.)-The combo attacks are like good items,but you can use them endlessly.-Buying this with Episode 1 gives you Episode Metal.-Improvement of the special stages. It's not great,though.-And much more!Cons:-Not being able to use Super Sonic in a combo attack. (It might hurt Tails. so,I dunno about this con)-Death Egg has only 2 stages,which is kinda sad since the other ones have 4.-Tails flys less with Sonic than he did in Sonic 2.-In Sky Fortress,if you go behind the screen,you die,which doesn't make sense. (a few games have this to.)-Last Con: The fact that you just get an achievement for doing a few tough things isn't kinda rewarding. It would be better if you had Small Badges somewhere.Overall,this game is pretty fun and I would recommend this to anyone that's a fan of Sonic,but I still don't get why it gets so much hate! It's not really bad at all!Final Results: Rate: 9.2/10Would want a third installment.			",13,5,1,1,4,0,0

												This really feels like the successor to Sonic 3. Its gameplay is fairly consistent with the retro Sonic games, and the levels are vivid and interesting. If you're a Sonic fan, try to look past the subpar physics, and appreciate the classic Sonic feel this game has.			",78,9,1,3,1,0,7

												♥♥♥♥♥THIS GAME IS PRETTY ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD, ok, so at first I was all like ""Sonic Four Episode One wasn't that good, should I play this???"" And then I played it, this game with Episode Metal is just right for me, the Special Stages are forgiving, unlike Episode One, although the Seventh Special Stage wasn't that easy, bt I finally got it, here are a basic list of pros and cons;PROS:*Fast paced, very much the reason I got into the series*The ""Team Spindash"" and ""Tails Lift"" helped me not get a single game over*Easy to get rings, even if you loose them.*Nice music, nice stage design, nice badniks, nice dificulty*Stage select is not debug only*Tails dosen't loose rings on the special stage*Episode Metal*Stardust Speedway remix is niceCONS:*Super Sonic theme is very repetitive and caused me to turn off the music when I got all 7 Chaos Emeralds*The ""Team Spindash"" and ""Tails Lift"" also are a bit OP*You get hit when you don't want to. A LOT*Not many RELEASED mods as of a quick Google search*Special. Stage. Seven.Overall I'd rate this a 9.9/10, great game.			",96,10,3,9,4,0,3

												Ehh, it's alright. It's a bit better than Episode 1 and I didn't find myself being annoyed as often with this one, definitely. But it's not without its problems.The two main issues here are that the game wastes a lot of time and as well a bit of a broken mechanic in Tails. The first issue is the one that bothers me more though. With every single boss, you have to sit through a cutscene before the fight actually starts. Which is tedious as heck. There's also cutscenes during stages, and a few stages even entirely designed around wasting time (Sky Fortress Act 1 and 3, anyone?)Tails also reeeally likes landing on ledges and dropping Sonic off them. Which leads to a fair number of cheap deaths, especially in bottomless pit-heavy stages. The stage design still also has ""haha surprise you died"" issues from time to time. Oil Desert Act 3 and Sky Fortress Act 1 spring to mind especially but there's a good bit of it throughout. Really Sky Fortress Act 1 does literally everything wrong and destroys any good will towards Sky Chase zone as well.The graphics are better, the music is a bit better, the physics are a bit better. It's all just slightly better and on the low end of a positive review for me.			",279,227,3,13,13,4,26

												It's an alright game, compared to episode 1 it does alot of things better. Such as the visuals, making the bosses more difficult,  adding tails and multiplayer, and i think more levels in total. though some levels were really cool overall i think episode 1 had more fun levels overall. And you can play as metal sonic which is kinda  cool but he is just a skin for sonic and his levels are just recycled from episode 1. The end of the game is also very anitclimatic if you don't have all the emeralds and those emeralds are very hard to obtain without a player 2. it's slightly above meh. an ok timewaster if u wanna play something but only have like 20-30 minutes free or want a game to just sit down and power thru before dinner. 6/10			",332,35,17,26,10,1,30

												Okay, how do I put this. This game is ok. I can recommend it to sonic fans but that's as far as it goes. The difficulty spike is rather high. This game is too short for a sonic game though. Even the shortest classic sonic game has more stages than this one. Pick it up during a sale, don't pay full price. The extra Metal Sonic episodes are basically playing the stages from Sonic 4 Episode 1 in reverse. It's much easier than Episode 2 stages but they're rather unfufilling in general. I love Tails but his role is minimal in this game other than using him for tag-team actions such as flying, or rolling into a super spinball.			",150,25,3,23,2,1,7

												Like all games, StH4 has its problems, but I don't think that ruins it for the game. While it's very true that you're going to have far easier a time with a controller than a keyboard/mouse, overall, the game is very well put together. Piece by piece, here's what I think.The music, like for all Sonic games, is very well done and feels very fitting. Every single stage sounds appropriate, from White Park Zone sounding very much like a snowy wonderland to Oil Desert Zone sounding like an intimidating desert factory. The music itself is composed fantastically, with nothing in it that would grate on the ears, and even the new power-up music doesn't sound too bad.The controls and physics take some getting used to, especially if you haven't played a game with Sonic's acceleration need; thankfully, it's been improved somewhat from Episode 1, making it less bothersome. They can also be frustrating at times, but once you get over the slight learning curve, it never feels rage-inducing or overly frustrating. Annoying at times, yes, but at least here, it won't ever feel like the game is actively hating you and all you stand for. Sky Fortress' changed controls can take a bit to adapt to, especially if you're playing co-op, but other than that, failures mostly feel like skill or mistakes rather than bad controls.The Zone desgins are wonderful as well. Each Zone gives a feel of some of the older games' Zones, but at the same time, they also have unique little twists or tricks that makes them feel like their own unique places as well. From White Park's snowy theme park feeling to Oil Desert's very industrialized setting, even if there aren't as many of them as in other games, they leave a mark.The game is, despite some claims, not that much shorter than the other four games it emulates (Sonic 1, 2, 3, S&K). While there are only 4 normal Zones, every Zone has 3 Acts, plus a stand-alone ""act"" that's the boss of that Zone (not counting the final Zone). As an added bonus, you can replay any Special Zone you've beaten for fun, or to practice for harder ones.Speaking of the Special Zone, the special stages from Sonic 2 make a return! And to add to the fun of the ""friendly competition"" of the ring gathering, the animation played when going between checkpoints is actually different depending on which character has the most rings. The stages, as usual, can be easy or hard depending on how good you are at picking up rings while dodging, but they definitely have the same feel as the old-school ones.The co-op for the game can be either a blessing or a curse, depending on if you have someone to play with or not. The game feels very much like it was built specifically FOR two players to work together on it, which means if you do have two people, you can do a lot you wouldn't get to do or pull off some neat tricks. At the same time, if you're playing alone, it can sometimes be a little frustrating or difficult precisely because of the build intending two people.All in all, it's definitely not a perfect game by any means... but it's a game that those who enjoy that style of gameplay should, in my opinion, pick up if they can, regardless of whether they're a Sonic fan or not. Those who are fans of the old-style Sonic, however, will definitely find even more enjoyment in it with all the throwbacks. However, I would DEFINITELY reccomend a controller if at all possible.SEGA managed to make something that felt both old-school and unique with Sonic 4 Episode 2... and how many games can claim that?

Please note:This review is based on my own experiences with this product; Yours could be different. This game is part of a franchise, so it will probably be compared to other games of such.This genre is unlikely to have the following, so these might be only spoken about: StoryRate responsibly.Gameplay - 8.5/10The Main Menu is now bigger, offers a Leaderboard, Multiplayer option (Local and surprisingly, Online) and the settings customization, both outside the game and inside the game feels much better. You get an Special Metal Sonic episode for completing Episode 1 (YES! I guess all the suffering got me something!), which you play Metal Sonic after the happenings of Sonic CD up to the first time you meet him at this episode, at the Sonic gameplay. The default key bindings for Keyboards have been totally changed, as the game also requires the player to use more buttons due to combo actions. The game doesn't really start off from where Episode 1 ended and neither introduces us to an story, but now features Tails as the rocket at the ending supposed. I had a hard time trying to play with the Keyboard, so i changed to the Steam Controller and i had no issues anymore. You can't select other zones that not Sylvania Castle while you don’t get through ACT 3. I got surprised when i thought for a second that the boss that appears at the starts of Sylvania Castle Zone ACT 3 would be just a recreation of the Sonic 2 totem one, but then, it happens! Speaking of that, all the boss battles on Episode 2 are brand new and it is great to once again have bigger threats through acts and not only on boss acts, even when those are just weaker versions from the final boss of the zone. At least, it is still something newly created.The level design feels way better than the ones at Episode 1. The use of Tails help is a great gameplay mechanic that changes from Flying (which can also be used to get better mobility inside the water) and Combo spinning, moves that gets the boss fights to be exciting and a test that you know how to make great use of those skills. The gameplay of Special Stages is great, just the same from Sonic 2, my favorite being followed by the one featured on Sonic 1. Normal acts aren't hard, but require the player to understand and master each's mechanic. The return of sky aboard (Tornado/Tail's Airplane) act is amazing and challenging, just as the Boss Act of Sky Fortress. The correct use of combo skills at the last boss gets it to be way less challenging than it should, but you're still likely to die and if you do, it is all the way back, and it is a considerably long boss. I didn't try out the multiplayer mode, but other reviews confirm both local and online works properly. The Metal episode is challenging and features camping enemies (Do you remember the crabs and crickets on Sonic 2 that wouldn't let you go up and used to get your rings to 0, and then kill you? Yea, those.) The levels on the Metal Episode are pretty much about the same from Episode 1, but with some alternate routes and minor level design changes to get you to the points that draw the Metal Sonic story the episode is supposed to. It is not a huge thing, but at least it is a gameplay bonus and a reward from playing Episode 1 (Because we REALLY deserved one after that.). I still miss being able to play the game as other character, though.Story - 8/10Sonic 4: Episode 2 doesn’t start with an introduction to an story, but draws one and quite explains what was up at Episode 1 as the game goes. Eggman, after beaten in his previous installment on Little Planet (the main setting of Sonic CD), started planning his entire intentions from the very beginning of Episode 1, when the satellite would start to approach once more and be an opportunity for the villain. As Sonic and Tails face and battle Eggman and Metal Sonic through the game, some details such as what the villain was searching for in the Lost Labyrinth and what Mad Gear was built for start to unfold, leading to the final boss at Little Planet.Episode's Metal plot, besides short and not really important, happens and starts at the same spot Episode 2 does, properly explains how Metal Sonic acquired even more power and why he first appears on the Snow Park zone riding Tails' Rocket.Graphics/Art - 9.5/10Finally, not only the UI/HUD won't look blurry as they did at Episode 1, by the fact Episode 2 properly offers resolutions higher than 720p, but the models and textures are going to be displayed properly. Everything looks so great that it is almost impossible to believe the game was built by the same team that worked on Episode 1. The 3D models look way better, the animations are well worked, the lightning fits and the background truly attracts the player attention; Everything is breathtaking. Such amazing look and the fact it was released after 2 years, almost for the exact same platforms Episode 1 was is a proof that Episode 1 could've done way better. For a moment, I thought the heavy work on graphics could lead to a poor gameplay, but it didn't. The Snow Park zone doesn't only looks amazing, as also plays cool. Each zone is charming at its own way and features proper enemies. There is a mod available for those who aren't comfortable with the modern Sonic & Tails model that replaces it with the classic Sonic & Tails model from Sonic Generations and works just fines with minor animations issues and no game crashes. Even the signs at the end of each act are properly changed.Talking about the Metal Episode, besides the fact the levels are pretty much about the same from Episode 1, it is worth being able to now see the past landscapes at proper resolution. Soundtrack - 8.5/10It is also possible to detect improvements on the soundtrack. Besides Episode's 1 soundtrack was fair, the one in Episode 2 fits even more to each zone and act, easily catching the player's attention (Or at least my attention). The Sky Fortress zone, for example, features songs that both fits with its act and the other acts of the zone, what clearly creates the sense it fits with the zone itself. General - 8.5/10My expectations were high on this one, and I’m happy they were. Sonic 4: Episode 2 delivers a much better experience to the player than Episode 1 did. The Super combo attack and the combo moves adds a special charm to the use of both characters, followed by a special taste to the gameplay. The game received a low metascore that, at least on my opinion, it didn't really deserve. Besides it was never said Episode 1 received a low budget, the Sega Brand Manager Ken Balough mentioned Episode 2 would have a larger budget than Episode I, due to the latter being received very well commercially (I'm really glad he only said commercially). Sonic 4: Episode 2 is, at least, everything that Episode 1 didn't delivered us. It is almost impossible to think that Episode 2 was produced by the same team of Episode 1, and it gets me to want to forget the latter exists.TL;DRSONIC THE HEDGEHOG 4 Episode II feels ridiculously better than Episode I. In addition to the amazing graphic, the game offers a lot of new customizations and configurations at the same time new gameplay features are introduced to the player, challenged to use each new feature at the right situation on its favor.

Super Sonic can move at the light speed and transport but when Tails and Sonic rolls together they are like ultra fast Cannonbolt. I mean.. C'mon Sega...			",67,7,3,6,2,0,5

												The physics are still really wonky but the graphics look good and the gameplay is still fun. The levels aren't as fun as Episode 1 but owning both gets you a cool Metal Sonic level set that's probably the best part of Sonic 4.Buy it if you're a sonic fan, if you're not then there are way better sonic games.

												When I was younger I was a sonic fan and I own all Genesis/Megadrive, Mastersystem and Dreamcast Sonic games even today. My favorite game was Sonic 3 & Knuckles but sadly Sonic 4 is a HUGE disappointment.The physics and controls are not the same as the previous games, they try to behave the same but they kinda... feel fake.The combo moves are pretty much required to complete a stage, they aren't that bad but it's one of those tiny annoying things that force you to slow down since you're REQUIRED to use them to progress like it or not.Level design on this one is between good-and-terrible, there's a part in Oil Desert Zone that is very unforgiving. This episode is clearly harder than Episode 1... sometimes way too hard like the last boss of the game.Boss fights thankfully are not a reboot of any boss from early games so there's a bit of originality and creativity here but fighting them can actually become tedious of how long it takes to beat them.Length of the game it's too short, yeah I know it's just 1 of 2 episodes, but that strategy was just to cash in on the same game twice.Overall, this game wasn't clearly designed by the original team behind the previous games (I should appreciate more info about this).In resume:PROS:* Well... Sonic? And Tails!* Nice 3D visuals* 2D Gameplay* No cutscenes* No new characters to fill yet more the Sonic universe.* Team work combos, including a similar one that was in Sonic 3* Original, strong and difficult bossesCONS:* Fake physics & controls regarding the previous titles.* Nothing significantly new in gameplay apart of the combos* Too short, only 5+Special Zones, Sonic 2 has 11+Special* Team work combos being REQUIRED to finish a stage* Last boss is waaaay too dificult for a sonic gameIf you want a modern sonic game that is good go get Sonic Generations instead.PS: I don't dislike the game, I find it OKAY-ISH, but i can't really recommend it as a sequel to the old ones.

												28-Jun-2016 : Finished main storyEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :If Sonic 4 Episode I feels like a remake of Sonic 1, then this one feels like a remake of Sonic 2. Not that it's a bad thing, the level design and soundtrack is a worthy successor of the original Sonic Trilogy. There's 1 level which really frustrated me though, it requires the player to attack enemy in mid-air using lock-on target. The problem is the lock-on target system on this particular part of the level somehow just have a hard time to lock-on and failure to attack means Sonic fell to his death. Really annoying. On a plus side, owner of  Episode 1 and 2 get a bonus episode that tells the untold stories of Metal Sonic. If you like retro-gaming and/or side-scrolling game, get this game.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			",120,7,2,11,0,0,2

												After being disappointed with Sonic 4: Episode I, I wasn't expecting much out of Episode II, but you know what? It's not a bad game at all. The physics still aren't as good as the classic games, but Episode 2 feels better to control. Sonic has faster momentum, taking less time for him to build up speed. Episode II improves upon the original in every single way. The visuals look much better, the level design is MUCH BETTER than Episode 1. Less cheap enemy placement and no gimmicky puzzle elements. The tag-team elements between Sonic and Tails are used very well, especially with the final boss. The music is good, too, again, much better than Episode 1's. Overall, I'm glad SEGA looked at the issues with Episode 1 and got rid of them in Episode 2. I'd recommend just skipping Episode I and just go right into Episode II.			",64,12,0,8,1,0,2

												Whilst not having played the whole game yet I'd like to post a postive review if you don't mind!If the first act of sonic 4 was a dissapointment this incarnation of sonic shouldn't dissapoint as much. Plays much more like a classic mega drive sonic than act 1 ever could.Graphics are fairly lush, characters are nicely animated be they sonic, tails or any of the robots you encounter. Two criticisms would be that the the screen is a little zoomed in, it's not always so easy to see what's coming up and that I fear the game may be a little short.Still, if you like old sonics and want something a little more up to date then get it!

												You know what this game is? Everything that Episode 1 SHOULD have been to be a decent game. The graphics are a lot better. The backdrops are beautiful. Art design in general is nice. Controls are tighter it feels like. The music is arguably better overall, Tails is once again part of the deal and you get a few special abilities with the two of them together. The levels are no longer just rehashed content. While episode 1 did have SOME unique features in the levels, the worlds were blatantly similar to the Megadrive ones. This time around it's a lot better. Also the boss fights are finally UNIQUE. I haven't beaten it yet, but I will update, if the final boss is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fight again. Also you get another special ""world"" to play as Metal Sonic if you have played Episode 1. Something for that messed up game at least. This is the better one and I wished that they would have made Episode 1 like this. Together they would have been a worthy Sonic game. As it stands, this episode on its own is a bit short, just like the last one. Still worth a grab in a sale.			",210,55,12,41,26,3,66

												Sonic 4 was Sega's second attempt outside of the GBA series to try and return Sonic to his classic roots. After the disappointment that was episode 1, i skipped the 2nd entry until a recent steam sale. And I wouldn't even reccomend this series at the discounted price.Again Sega has failed to emulate the exact physics of the classic series by making sonic more vulnerable and slower, although they've tried to remedy this with the good addition of the homing attack as a way to quickly gather speed and to more accurately attack enemies that comfort gave the developers a false sense of security which must be the excuse for this bland and annoying level design.Devoid of actual challenge and replaced with cheap deaths and forced memorization of the stages as a way to artifically lengthen this cash-in. music is meh, team mechanics were a nice try, visuals are ok. save your money for Sonic Mania			",4,1,0,1,0,0,1

												It looks like Sonic has eaten one too-many chilidogs back in the day, because now that he's nearly 25, he's slower than ever. I grew up playing the original Sega Genesis Sonic games, and let me tell you - I always got a rush from zipping from point A to B in any given level. The speed is what I love about Sonic games.This is like Sonic game, except our blue hero moves like he's on another planet where the air and water are thicker than mud and milkshakes mixed together. I can't even play through Sylvania Castle (the first level) without being frustrated by the controls, which is a shame, because the art is gorgeous, and I want to like this game as if it were the perfect callback to the 16-bit days or glory.This isn't such a game. Stick with the genesis classics or Sonic Adventure. ",348,222,11,39,9,2,15

												Though this game starts promising it goes down hill after the first three stages. The first boss fight is where it starts to go south and it keeps going south from there. Graphics do their job well enough, music is awful and the sound quality is abysmal, I could pull out my Genesis and plug Sonic 1 in and get better quality sound. Reminds me of music in a mobile game.The gameplay starts well then goes off a cliff, horrible boss fight mechanics where half the time the boss decides when they are foreground and when they are background because, hey why not right? (Not in the classic cinematic way, just in the middle of the fight in the same place they are sometimes foreground) The stages get progressively worse to the point the only reason I finished the game is that I like Sonic the Hedgehog and the game is remarkably short. Utilization of tails is also incredibly clunky and poor. I would try the local co-op but I don't want to inflict this game upon anyone else. Stay away, buy Sonic Generations if you want a decent Sonic game. If you have Generations, still stay away, this game just shows how far the series has fallen and it is no wonder Episode III was cancelled.Such a disappointment			",246,60,27,26,29,12,56

												Hey look, it's Sonic 2 HD! No, wait, aw man....it's that no good Sonic 4 Episode 2.....If you've played Sonic 4 Episode 1, you'll probably guess that this game is probably as bad as the first one, and you would be 75% correct. Sonic 4 Episode 2 is yet another dissapointing release in the never ending Dark Ages of Sonic, which is an on-going line of bad Sonic games starting from 2006, and this one has joined the bandwagon.Instead of being based off Sonic 1, this one is based off Sonic 2 and rightly so, only because it has Tails in it.The gameplay is not too shabby and it is actually better than the first one, but it still has some kinks. The physics are still kind of bad but not as bad as Episode 1. There's also no copying of any of the previous zones from old Sonic games, but some zones are similar to other zones seen in the Sonic series, but I can't really list them all.The story is really hard to notice due to all of the characters refusing to talk during the entire game, in all seriousness a storyline isn't really here in this game.This game relies way too heavily on the special Sonic + Tails moves, most of the game requires you to use those moves. Like in Oil Desert Zone act 2 or 3, the end of the act requires you to use the flying-Tails-carrying-Sonic thing for the rest of the act, and I've died a few times in that part.The Co-op mode is ok, and suprisingly it is accurate to Sonic 2's co-op mode: You both have to stay on the same gosh darn screen.It's still not a worthy sequel to the Sega Genesis Sonic we all know and love, but it is slightly better than episode 1. This game is really only for bored gamers waiting for something interesting to happen and for crazy Sonic fans who collect every Sonic game known in exsistance both good and bad.4.7/10But hey, at least it's better than Sonic Unleashed!Before I go, there is one more problem with game. If you get all of the Chaos Emeralds and beat the game, you don't get some cool ""true ending"" cutscene, or even a picture of Super Sonic, dissapointing I know. ",26,7,3,0,2,2,13

												Episode 2 is a marked improvement over Episode 1, but still doesn't quite match the legacy it's trying to emulate. The difficulty is uneven, the boss fights are some of the most tedious in the Sonic franchise, and the music is repetitive to the point of being annoying. Co-op is the coolest part, but it doesn't save the game from being aggressively mediocre at best.Level design lacks the clear purposeful simplicity of old Sonic games. It plays well enough, I suppose, but lacks the imaginative spark of creativity the series was once known for, instead coming off as hackneyed ""What if we took one old level and mashed it up with this other one?"" Originality is not this game's strongest suit.Difficulty is extremely unbalanced. You can breeze through most of the game on autopilot, but every now and then you'll hit a speed bump that will have you stuck for a frustratingly long amount of time. It makes the game feel uneven and sloppy.Most of those speed bumps will probably be the game's boss encounters, which feature excessive, flashy animation sequences that will keep you waiting. Every time you fight one of the game's bosses, you'll have to sit through a cutscene that shows them ""getting ready"" to fight. Some of these cutscenes can last a full minute, and you have to re-watch them every time you die. Death comes often in these boss fights, which can last upwards of five minutes (a really long time for a boss!) and offer no checkpoints. Dying on the last hit only to have to sit through a minute-long cutscene for the third time is the pits.Even music, typically a high point for most Sonic games (even the really bad ones!) falls extremely flat. It's generic retro video game music, but does not evoke the old Sonic games in the slightest. It's too tinny, too repetitive, too annoying. Oil Desert Act 2 in particular will grate on your nerves, with a meowing synth instrument that doesn't sound like anything on earth. Classic Sonic games were trying to evoke real instruments on limited hardware, but this just sounds like hissing, scratchy square wave nonsense. Chiptunes for the sake of having chiptunes.If there was one part of this game that felt genuinely inspired, it would be the game's two-player online co-op mode. This ends up being a legitimate improvement over co-op modes in past Sonic games, given each player gets their own separate view instead of having to share the screen. The game's flying stage, similar to Sonic 2's Sky Chase Zone, ends up being particularly harrowing in this mode. Here, Player 2 flies the plane, and is burdened with the task of getting Player 1 in to position -- a truly cooperative experience.The game is almost worth it for the co-op alone. Almost... but not quite.			",444,83,23,36,20,4,52

Make it just like Sonic 3 was!"", and maybe it impacted a few minds on the design team, but not enough. Don't buy. Wait for Sonic Mania. That is the thing that you want.			",502,68,17,39,21,9,54

												The best way I can review this game in summary is that Sega - after everything they've done - should be embarrased about this game. It's that bad. This isn't a game that makes you question the relative skills of the design team in terms of programming, visual or sound design - they're all unquestionably terrible - but rather the core fundamental of game making. The game just simply doesn't understand fun.			",695,205,18,95,57,6,122

												Overall, it's an ok platformer (not great, but enjoyable enough to recommend it), it's very short but it's worth its prince on saleIt contains 9 levels plus 3 bosses through 3 thematic worlds. Most of the content it's very easy (with the exception of the last level and the last boss), but you can replay the levels finding better scores and I think get good scores on the levels can be more challenging.Don't expect something as polished as Sonic Generations or Freedom Planet.

												Sonic 4 is a pale imitation of the genesis sidescrollers with none of the fun level design, memorable music, or intuitive physics that made those games classics. I wish I could say it controlled well, because it is an improvement over episode I, but the finicky lock-on makes so much of it a frustrating chore. Boss fights drag on forever. The soundtrack is best experienced by drowning it out with a podcast. The graphics are blandness made digital. Please play literally any other Sonic game. Play the excellent Sonic Generations if you want a modern Sonic with well-done 2D stages. Play Sonic '06 and laugh about how terrible it is with a friend. Play Sonic Adventure and take funny screenshots of the bad lip syncing. Stay away from Sonic 4.			",121,9,3,8,3,1,25

												Sonic The Hedgehog 4 Episode 2 is a great example how platformers should be done now. The story takes place immediately after EP1 and now Sonic and Tails must stop Dr.Eggman from destroying the world as always. Game plays much better than previous one. The graphics are better, gameplay is re-designed and plays more smoothly. Cool boss battles, great looking background. Very colorful atmosphere. Music as always very beautiful to listen. New addition to this is 2 player coop mode. It can be awesome to play with a friend but because you have little screen to keep up it kinda gets frustrating and hard to see what other player is doing. As always you can collect rings, get into “Special stages” to collect 7 Chaos Emeralds to transform into Super Sonic. A little extra addition is Metal Sonic chapter which explains what happened to him in the end of Sonic CD and how he made his return to EP2 explains it good. If you are a fan get it and play it, if not still give it a shot.			",365,12,2,16,14,1,17

Goes back to the roots of the genesis titles, and adds a few modern twists. I like Tails' involvement with the special moves. PC port is decent, and is best played with a controller.This one is worth the money. Avoid the first like the plague.			",414,80,10,29,30,6,44

												It says something about a game when you can defeat its final boss WITHOUT REALISING IT WAS THE FINAL BOSS, then being surprised by the credits.Worse still is beating the game again with all the collectibles, expecting a ""better ending"" in the series' traditional style, only to discover this is the rare exception to the rule and there really is just the one rubbish ending.Technically better than Episode 1, though; stepping on a dry turd is 'technically' better than stepping on a wet one. Do not bother trying to play this unless you have some sort of desire to collect and play through the entire Sonic series. Definitely DO NOT buy it at full price if you can help it.

												Read some nice reviews about this, so I played it for about a half an hour, but as a Sonic player on the Sega Genesis, this game really fails to be a true Sonic game. There are severe velocity issues which leaves you feeling like you're just playing some indie platformer. The first boss was taking a lot longer to defeat than I thought made any sense and although I didn't die to it I kept getting damaged and had to grab the rings again and I got tired of it and quit.Don't really get the appeal of the game would rather play an honest, original, high or even medium quality work game than a cheap copy, pathetic excuse for a game.

												A little better than Episode I, but not by much. The inclusion of Tails means his flying ability and ring-collecting can negate some of the cheap deaths and awful level and boss design.The graphics, or at least the zones seem even better. There's a snow level with the aurora in the sky and plenty going on in the background, and the Death Egg has a bit of a badass purple makeover.But the cheap deaths and bad gameplay still remain, and looks can't save everything. I just whizzed through this without worrying about rings (you're going to lose them several times anyway!) just to get through the game.			",52,39,0,11,6,0,6

												This is largely the same game as Ep 1 and Ep 1 was complele♥♥♥♥♥♥ Before I started Ep 2 I was excited because the reviews are overall ""very positive"" compared to ep 1 that has ""mixed' reviews. Great, I thought, they must have cleaned up the pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥that Tails left on the living room carpet at the end of ep 1. However after playing a significant amount of the this game (not as much as Steam says because I left the game on for some time while doing other things) I can now tell you undoubtedly that they did indeed clean up the♥♥♥♥♥♥off the carpet from ep 1. However, now not only does the carpet still stink to high-heaven, theres a large brown stain in the center, apparent for all to see. Here's my theory. Ep1 has 805 reviews while Ep2 has  ~500. So were talking about almost half as many reviews. My guess is that the people dumb enough or blind enough to think Sonic 4 ep 1 was good are the only people giving this game a thumbs up. While the other half of the people who totally trashed ep 1 for how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was didn't even bother to try ep 2 because they knew it would be♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well, those other half of the people were right. Ep 2 is complete garbage. If I hated ep 1 so much why am I playing ep2 you may ask? Well i bought the sonic collection off humble bundle and I'm determined to see my way through it.

												From best to worstMetal Sonic: maximum goodThe art assets: A magnificent transition of classic sonic stage elements reimagined in 3D, every stage is a nostalgic combination of themes I fondly remember as a child. The zones: Three acts per zone, though with substantually more variety in both the mechanics employed by the stage and the art assets and set pieces uses to create the surroundings. It's a more lovingly crafted subtle progression than previous games were able to render. The special stages: Out of seven the first five are amazing. Prepare to smash your face against the monitor as you retry the last two relentlessly. FORTNUATELY you can restart the special stages if you know you're going to fail without the arduous task of beating a level with 50 rings, dodged a real bullet there Sega. The bosses: Suprisingly inspired (for the most part), they employ using cooperative attacks with tails. Tails: No longer sabotaging your special stages. There's a rather large startup delay for the Sonic/Tails combination attacks and going SSJ I mean Super Sonic was a bit jarring. While flying with him he is prone to dropping sonic if you shear the two of them on a cliff's edge while trying to scale it. He will literally pull a Yoshi on Sonic by dropping him into an endless void pit unless you soar overtop the edge. -----POWER RANKING------The music: It must be opposite day in camp stupid around here. After having beaten it more than twice the only song I can remember is metal sonic's theme.  ",357,69,3,28,16,2,26

												As some others have said, Episode II is a big improvement over episode I, and I haven't played completely through both games, though I do find them enjoyable. The price is way too high, so just get the Hits collection to pick them up so you have something else to play when you're really, REALLY bored. In good conscience, I can't recommend either Sonic 4 episodes - am I the only one that can notice how SLOW these games are? Is it just me? The trailers looked like the games moved much faster, but then when I play them, much, much slower. It used to be that you could finish a level in about 1-2 minutes or so, it feels as if they artificially slowed down the game so that you'll take longer to complete it and they can say it's longer. If I'm wrong, I'd be happy to be corrected. As a long time Sega fan bordering on ""fanboy"" status (but not quite as manic and irritating) I have to wonder what Sonic Team was thinking. The Good Points: I think the graphics are gorgeous. New high-stylized Sonic does look a little odd in a 2-D platformer, but the levels look nice and the artwork is on point. The combine gimmicks are fun to an extent which makes for some cute ""aw"" moments. In other words, the game is great to look at. It doesn't lose points there. As has been said many times before I got anywhere near it, the physics are VERY improved over the first Sonic 4 game. Boss battles are cool looking and great. The Bad Points: Gimmicks are gimmicks are gimmicks, they DO get tired after a little while. This isn't my biggest gripe with the game, however, which is that the game just feels way slower than any previous Sonic title. If they slowed this down in an attempt to get new people interested in the games, they alienated their original fanbase that enjoyed the games for their fast-paced fluidness. These games aren't fluid, they're clunky and slow. Improved physics over the first installment or not, they're simply too slow-paced to get a good rhythm and pace going throughout the games. The music is really, really bad. Mute the music and put on some of your own tunes, just don't play anything too fast because the game's pacing is a mix between the average tempos of Pink Floyd and Enya. How are you gonna slow down Sonic? Some parts will make you feel like you're playing the 2012 version of Atari 2600 E.T.On one final note, I have to say that someone at Sega REALLY likes sparkles. They will absolutely put a sparkle type effect on anything they can just to use that one sound effect that they made a few years ago over, and over, and over, and over again. There's nothing entirely wrong with this sound effect, it just gets kind of boring after awhile.Decent effort, but I don't feel this does anything to improve the controversial and arguable standards of the franchise considering the previous installments (and I DO think that Sonic Generations was a lot of fun and is a lot more fun than these, because they didn't slow Sonic down.) 5/10 - Sonic disaster, not sonic speed and playability. Again, it's not all bad, get it in the Hits collection, but don't spend the money on the game by itself.			",2909,1137,96,354,354,29,474

												A game has to be fairly unbearable for me to not want to finish it.  Well, congratulations Sonic 4, you've landed in that small list of games I just straight up hate.The parts that broke me?  Lots of them, but most specifically the Oil world part 2: the  Oil world has a mechanci where you run across sinking sand and have to jump in order to not sink into it and die, right?  Fine, that's fair.  At a certain point in the stage I was then forced to run along this sand, but in a low corridor where while on top of the sand Sonic's head would be touching the roof of the corridor.  This immediately slowed my progress to a grinding halt.  It gets better, though, because as you get further down the corridor, the roof is raised BUT Spikes are placed at the bottom of the roof!  The spike tips reach exactly where the ceiling of the corridor was before, so if you jump too high you just die.  This isn't ok but I could have at least gotten through the area if it wasn't very, very long or if there had been any rings whatsoever in it, but no, I got hit once, all of my rings disappeared in the sand, and then I had to go through the rest of this insanely long corridor without any protection.  ♥♥♥♥ that.The boss of the Winter world -- really cool looking level by the way -- was also full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Alright, cool, I'm racing Metal Sonic and I have to catch up with him and hit him, awesome!  This is awesome!  Wait, two minutes into the fight -- seemed like a long time for a sonic game -- he just hits the platform that I'm running on, breaking it.  I immediately ran into the hole and fell to my death, restarting the fight.  Alright, whatever, that was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because I didn't have the time to react, and it's dumb that I have to restart the boss fight but at least I know that's coming now and it won't happen again.  Oh wait no, he just does that attack so fast and it's right on top of where you're running that you're just ♥♥♥♥ed if you don't anticipate it.Elsewhere in poor design land is anything to do with Tails.  Alright, so you occassionally have to press a button to join up with Tails for a special ability.  Cool.  Except for, you know, these abilities being so limited in utility that the only times you use them are when the game halts your progress unless you use the abilities.  Of course, you use them so infrequently that if you hit these parts, you won't know what to do, so the game has to put up a sign telling you which ability you need to use to progress.  Hey game, if you think I can't figure something out because I'm not using it frequently enough then I'm pretty sure you designed these abilities poorly.Tl;dr: there are some cool parts to the game but they usually get ♥♥♥♥ed up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design, horrible enemy placement and just straight up terrible choices.No, ♥♥♥♥ this game.  It's not a good game and it's not a good sonic game.  Just don't waste your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is just as bad as episode 1. I don't feel the physics or mechanics were improved at all, just changed. I'm giving up already. This game is so bad it should be free indefinitely (I still wouldn't play it another minute). Maybe I'm still just reeling after how awful episode 1 is, but after 2 levels of things not working correctly (again), I absolutely had enough.			",35,7,0,16,0,0,0

												I got this game as a part of the Sonic Collection... and I think this may have been a misplacement. Between the extremely slow gameplay, terrible platforming, and floaty controls, the only thing that this could have in common with any other sonic games would be the characters. If the character you controlled wasn't sonic, I wouldn't have even thought that this was a sonic game.The levels are just the same little section repeated over and over again with few differations between them going on for 5 minutes of borning right movement holding. Bosses and levels are so frustratingly slow. Also looks like a turd. -3/10♥♥♥♥♥♥game. don't buy if you are a sonic fan and/or enjoy fast.			",431,91,25,48,34,4,37

												I never really got why people hate modern Sonic games so much until I played this game in co-op. It's literally the worst co-op experiance I've ever had, and I don't use that phrase lightly. I'm not a game designer myself but this game just made me question what's going through the minds of the people who made this game. They literally could have just reskined Sonic 3 and called it a whole new game and they would have been fine! Everyone would have been, like ""Best Sonic game in ten years, 10/10.""

												The worst 2D Sonic game ever made. I actually think this game is worse than Sonic 4 Episode 1. The physics are off and the tails addition introduces nothing but ways to exploit the harder parts of the game. This is not a good follow up to Sonic Generations and I recommend that you steer clear of this game unless you have to play every Sonic game.			",234,61,4,17,11,1,24

												Like Episode 1, it still rehashes a lot of stuff from the classic sonic games, but it's different enough to the point where that's not as big of a problem, and it's a tiny bit easier, but I still wouldn't recommend it. It's a step up, but considering how bad episode 1 was, this isn't saying much at all. Episode Metal has some of the same exact problems as episode 1 does, so if you really want to play Sonic 4, avoid episode 1, it's not even remotely required to play it.			",50,9,2,8,2,2,1

												Pretty fun!  It's been years since I played Episode 1 and they promised the physics would be better, but I didn't notice much of a difference.  Still, this game has better everything else.  Great visuals, very awesome music (reminiscent of the Genesis's sound), neat bosses and fun levels.  Episode 2 adds Tails and he is a lifesaver, even outside of co-op.The only negative things I have to say are that it's kind of short (2-2.5 hours without getting any secret stuff) and the boss fights could use some polishing.  Too often would I all but finish a boss off to have it go into some ""finishing move"" scenario that I had no idea of how to accomplish and would get killed only to have to start all the way over.  This is very annoying when the boss fights have intros of any sorts and you have to run through a small stage, collect rings and then watch the boss ""get ready.""Still, I recommend it if the price is right.

												This game was really fun and enjoyable. Creative levels and really good bosses. In fact the bosses were the best part of the game, and were actually a challenge which is a nice change of pace for the Sonic series. However, it is very short, only 18 stages, including bosses, so not worth it for the price but if you see it on sale, definitely get it. It is worth your time			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Compared to episode 1, the physics are better, even if they are behind those of the classics. However, the rest plays almost exactly like episode 1, which isn't exactly a good or bad thing. The only additions here are Tails, Metal Sonic and the special stages with the Sonic 2 style. The rest are just some new stages. There's also co-op multiplayer and 4 bonus stages if you own Episode 1, but that's it. There's little inovation here. Besides the physics, the flaws of Episode 1 are still present. Again, this is not a bad game, but there are much better Sonic games.			",267,164,6,31,13,4,38

The ability to call Tails at any time to fly is very helpful and has saved me plenty of times.  I really only have two problems with the game, first nobody ever seems to be online for multiplayer and second the red rings are just for show and don't unlock anything like they did in Generations or Colors.

												A huge improvement over the first ""episode"". If I have any criticism of Sonic 4 at all, it's that it's too eager to simply bask in the series' past glories. ""Hey, remember this from the old games?"" ""How about this?"" ""And this?"". Even the special stages use the same sequence of colours to tap into your nostalgia gland. Mind you, Sonic Generations did this successfully, but that whole game was one big homage. This feels like a game with no identity of its own.Still, at least they got the physics more or less right this time.			",83,27,4,2,0,0,0

												This game is suprisingly good!It's fairly easy to defeat all the levels, and the majority of levels are designed really well. The graphics are great, and the lighting... wow the lighting... Although good, a lot of things are stupidly designed, and they really need to be changed:-The dung-beetles in oil desert need to be fixed, or just placed better.-Special stages 5-7 need to be softened up a bit.-The boss of oil desert needs to have it's second phase fixed.-The tornado needs to be heavily improved.-Where is Amy in all this?!-I want stardust speedway. Right now. No questions.-The Super peel-out needs to return.Despite all this, my main complaint is that the game is TOO SHORT. The only way to make it seem longer is to play with friends, but no-one's ever online! And don't even say that episode I means that it has over 8 zones, because episode I sucked and the physics sucked and the graphics sucked. At least let us play on a hub world or something, or give us access to little planet (either futures) after beating the game.And what did actually happen to little planet in the end? Did it blow up?

												Much like Episode I, it pains me to give this game a ""not recommended"" too, because when you see it normally, this is a pretty fun little game. The gameplay is good, the graphics are amazing, it got some pretty good music for the most part.But where it falls short is the fact that other older sonic games just do the whole 2d sidescroller a lot better. And that is why I cannot recommend this game over the rest. I recommend Sonic the Hedgehod 2, 3 or Sonic Generations before this. ",110,4,1,14,2,0,10

The only complaints i have are: Oil desert act 2 level design, Sometimes the levels and bosses can spike in difficulty to the point where its kinda unfair and the speical stages can be hard to read.

												Finally got around to beating this game and I've got to say, I'm impressed. Sonic 4 - Ep. I wasn't too great. I liked it, but I could only recommend it to someone who's been a Sonic fan for a while during a sale, and even then I'd have my doubts of whether it was a good idea to recommend it or not. While I wouldn't say this game justifies a 15 dollar price tag, it's definitely worth a peek if you catch it on sale. The use of Tails as a mandatory character is one that is met with a lot of controversy but I found it to do more harm than good - *especially* during some of the boss fights. There was one level in Oil Desert Zone where you had to fly a long distance using him and it sucked so bad that I felt it worth noting specifically in this review, but fortunately that's the only time during a normal level I found myself wanting to toss my mouse across the room due to the stupidity of it - special stages are a different story, however, but I'll delve into that later. All in all, though, he did create a few problems when he was mandatory but I ultimately found he did more good than harm.The stages are generally very well done, barring a couple of exceptions, and while some of the bosses can have patterns that are a bit too vague I found them to be acceptable for the most part, yet none of them were too memorable barring Sky Fortress Zone's boss and the final boss.I'd put this game higher than Sonic 1 and S4 Ep. I, but it's definitely weaker than S3&K, SCD, and S2. It's got a lot of good moments, however, and I can definitely recommend picking it up while it's on sale.			",129,50,1,35,28,4,33

												Despite not completely following the formula that was established in Sonic 1, 2 & 3(and Knuckles) It's still a very functional game that perhaps is more catered to a slightly more modern audience, since the classic games play in a more 1990s sort of fashion. You can feel the difference with a lighter Sonic and feels a bit more fluid than in previous 2D games. So for long time Sonic fans you may still be thrown off by the unfaithful physics that don't reflect the old-school days of 2D Sonic, but they are a step up from what Episode I had to offer because of some added tweaks to the game engine and, and some subtle changes to Sonic in this game too, such as how he no longer uncurls out of a Spin when jumping of a slope. So the game handles quite well in my opinion, despite not really playing like the Genesis/Mega-Drive days.Tails controls well too, and the implementation of team based gameplay is executed well too, so I have no real issues there.Now content is important, as Sonic 3 & Knuckles was a big game(s), and Sonic 4 Episode II on its own isn't veyr massive, and the locations of zones like in Episode I are virtually all tributes to zones from the Genesis days, but there's much more to do in Sonic 3. And since Episode II is a seperate game that you have to pay for individually (and with Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles it's easy to buy the two games together) Sonic 4 Episode II doesn't offer too much a sequel since it doesn't really expand but rather just pay a homage to Classic Sonic, so if you we're hoping to see more than what Sonic 3 & Knuckles offered, then even with both episodes combined, you won't really get that here. However it's still a fun game that any fan of Sonic should give a go, and can even appeal to people who aren't necessarily fans of Sonic. It's not amazing, but a good game nontheless.

												I loved Sonic 4 Episode 1, but i did see multiple flaws in it that let me see why people didn't like it too much. This game makes a lot of improvements. The music is still great, the physics and mechanics have been tweaked to be much better, and with Tails in tow, you have a lot of options to get through each stage. The stages are fun, the bosses are great, especially the fights with Metal Sonic, and overall it's a great 2D Sonic game. It's still a little more like Sonic Rush than the Genesis games, but it's a little more in the middle of the two. The big problem I have is the Special Stages. I've beaten them all, and while Super Sonic leads to major catharsis factor, the stages are the most frustrating part of the game. They start off fine, like Sonic 2's stages with proper control, but you will need a guide and a lot of patience for the later ones. Here's a tip: if you approach the goal and don't have enough rings, pause before you step over the goal, and hit restart to try the stage again as much as you want. I'll give this one a 9.0 out of 10. One of the better Sonic games.			",34,1,0,5,1,1,1

												There are some things that Sega did to make Episode II better compared with the first episode.  However there were some drawbacks as well.  The new game engine they used is better than the one in the first episode.  However, in my opinion the level design is not as good as Episode I.  Fortunately the boss battles are more fresh and different compared to the previous installment.  The Episode Metal that is unlocked if you have downloaded both Episodes I & II is mediorce at best.  It just reuses 4 levels from Episode I except you play as Metal Sonic.  As with Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode I, I feel this game is about the same quality as that one, which is good.  However, I feel Sega could have polished up these episodes a bit more before release.  I still believe Sega was trying to rake-in as much money as possible by releasing Sonic the Hedgehog 4 into two games.  It worked well for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles with the lock-on ability, but they didn't attempt to do anything close to that with Sonic the Hedgehog 4.Good game, but too short.  As I suggested with my review of Episode I, I would probably wait until this one goes on sale before buying.			",29,4,1,1,0,1,2

												I'm a 30 year old gamer who grew up on on Sonic..It has *always* been one of my favorite game series..I bought this on a Steam sale, and oh... my.. God...THE CONTROLS ARE SOME OF THE WORST OF ANY VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED!!!!!Trying to play this on a keyboard is trying to perform surgery with a car.I can not recommend this game as a result.  The PC was obviously a forethought; the game is pretty much unplayable with a keyboard.I had to use Joy2Key to get my PS3 controller to work with the game, most games just recognize it as a 360 controller and I don't have to do any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to get it to work; this took me quite some time figuring out exactly how to get the controller working with the game.The game is pretty much unplayable without a controller; that's my biggest gripe.The overall aesthetics of the game are beautiful; they captured the 16-bit ""feel"" with modern graphics.The audio is decent as well; it really has the same ""emotion"" as the original Sonic games.The boss fights are clever and thought out (so far at least).I would say this game competes heavily with the originals, if you're a fan of them you're going to love this (just as long as you can get a controller working with it).I will be putting more time into this game, that's for sure.

												The level design is poor. They force team mechanics onto you, and limit your options. Throughout the entire game, they expect you to use team powers (use Tails to fly, or use Tails for a super spin dash) to get through certain sections. Using these abilities takes you out of Super Sonic, and it just hinders the flow overall.Boss fights weren't fun for me. Certain boss fights are designed around the team mechanics as well. They split the boss bights into their own separate stages. You can't rack up rings to completely destroy the bosses, and instead... they only give you ~50 rings to fight them. I didn't kill any boss with the 50 rings they gave, and had to finish the fight as normal sonic. My favourite aspect of the classic titles was to destroy the game as super/hyper sonic, despite the little challenge that posed. It was a power fantasy, and this game has virtually none of that.I'd suggest just getting Sonic 3 & Knuckles. It has more content than this one (Knuckles, Hyper Sonic, Checkpoint mini-games, Electric shields, Fire shields), the levels are designed to allow for more experimentation, and the bosses generally allow for more approaches.

												At the time of this review, I haven't completely finished the game yet, but it's immediately apparent that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode II is a much better game than Episode I. The physics are vastly improved, rolling down hills helps you gain a little bit of speed, and the inclusion of co-op with Tails was very well implemented. The game's levels still aren't TOO original, but they're not carbon copies of classic Sonic stages like Episode I. Not the BEST Sonic game, and its still not deserving of the name Sonic 4, but a good game regardless that should be given time if you're a fan of the Blue Blur. Now, where's Knuckles? (R.I.P Episode III)7.5/10UPDATE: Just finished the game. Telling you right now: get Super Sonic ASAP. You can tear the final boss to pieces with him. But the game knows, because they made the special stages bone-crushingly impossible!

												Much better than Episode I.  Episode I was a poorly-controlling mess and the stages were mostly just a pastiche of the classic Sonic games' stages, leaving you wondering why you were playing a worse version of something you'd already played a billion times.  This one presents original stages and the movement feels better (not perfect, though).  The cooperative moves with Tails are kind of neat although they are a little overused (for one thing you can only really get going super-fast if you go the ball-rolling move).  This isn't a timeless classic like the Genesis titles but it's frequently on sale and it's available on a bazillion platforms (I previously played it on the Wii but got this as part of a Sonic megapack deal).  It's a worth, I don't know, $10 or so.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The sequel to the mixed recieved Sonic 4 Episode I is simply amazing. The story is that Little Planet from Sonic CD has returned and with it, the return of Eggman's greatest creation: Metal Sonic. It's up to you as the dynamic gaming duo of Sonic and Tails to stop him. The graphics look amazing as it's a full on 3D graphics engine played from a 2D perspective (Also known as 2.5D) and the music and sound design is simply amazing in it's Sega Genesis limitations. The gameplay is the same old Sonic the Hedgehog 2D high speed platforming, but this game introduces 3 new abilities for Tails: The fligh, the swim, and the rolling combo, all activated by pushing the action button at the right time. The levels are designed well and the bosses are pretty fun to fight. The weak points is that it's still a short game with 4 zones (3 acts each) and the final zone with one boss for each zone. The verdict is that this game is a must buy for fans of 2D Sonic, worth $15. If you're not big on the series, buy when it's on sale			",114,7,1,7,2,1,5

												A very good 2D Sonic game with a modern feel. The levels are nothing less than what you would expect from a Sonic game, good music to run along to, multiple routes that give it good replay value, and of course, different level mechanics that you will find interesting and fun. The graphics of the levels are also beautiful, and you will have time to admire the works of the Sonic Team. If you are a Sonic fan then you should definitely get this game, but it can be considered a good game for new Sonic fans, as Sonic's faithful friend Miles ""Tails"" Prower makes a return, and can be a helpful ally to you. Tails can be played as by someone as well as computer controlled, so this adds a nice multiplayer touch to the game. So if you are a Sonic fan like me or new to the series this game is certainly worth considering.			",123,18,19,10,15,3,22

												Don’t be put off by the game’s lack of commercial success. First it should be said the both parts of Sonic 4, Episode 1 (4.1) and Episode 2 (4.2) seem to have an identity crisis. They are officially sequels but in reality they are something of an updated remake, 4.1 and 4.2 borrow and reference Sonic 1, 2, 3&K and CD heavily; 4.1s bosses are all remakes of the originals, a fault 4.2 even references with the first boss originally appearing to mimic the Aquatic Ruins’ Boss before transforming into something new. However even it borrows the later levels and boss fights. The level design 4.2 is also much better than 4.1’s. As 4.2 has original zones; Sylvanian Castle, Winter Park Zone and the Oil Desert (whose features resemble 3&K’s Sandopolis much more than Sonic 2’s Oil Ocean which it would appear to be a copy of at first glance). After this 4.2 does fall into copying the final zone which is just an amalgamation of Wing Fortress, Sky Chase and the Flying Battery zones, taking features from each but making them worse (in the Sky Chase knock off for example Tail’s Plane can disappear leaving the player plummeting to earth).There are problems with both games; they both insist on the use of Sonic’s homing attack to access ledges which I find it unnecessary for a side-scroller. Again Physics does not seem to apply in Sonic the Hedgehog’s universe, he can walk up walls when travelling at fairly low speeds (although not as badly as he could in 06), while the homing attack creates momentum from nothing.Even the traditional saving grace of the Sonic game, the soundtrack, is poor which is disappointing. In addition, the game also has a very short life span, 4.1 failed to keep me attached for more than 5 hours, and while 4.2 actually saw me to completion, it only has at most 5-12 hours of gameplay depending on how quickly you can master it and I doubt either has much in the way of replay value unlike the games they are based upon.This said however, for once Sonic actually controls well (which he never does in 3D Games). 4.2 itself still contains a number of very good features. The inclusion of team mechanics was a great idea as it makes Tails a valued partner to Sonic, his abilities have made him an essential part as he can get Sonic through traps and defeat opponents. 4.2 also did well with the special stages, which like 4.1s are copies of the original games (this time the tunnel runs of Sonic 2,) unlike 4.1 however, 4.2 improves the originals. Tails is no longer a dead weight, he doesn't drop rings when hit and a new power up (a chaotix ring type feature) can give new interesting challenges, it is just a pity they weren’t used more often.Therefore although neither are great like the games they were trying to emulate, they are ok and I generally do not see why they have been so badly received as they’re worthy successors to the original Sonic. 4.1 may be distinctly average but 4.2 is a big improvement upon it. The current price tags are not value for money but if you pick them up in the Steam sale (as I did) 4.2 is certainly worth a fiver. 4.1 should only be purchased if you want the bonus Metal Sonic Mode which works when you own both parts.Sonic 4 Episode 1 4/10Sonic 4 Episode 2 7/10 ",33,6,0,13,6,0,14

												A decent continuation of Sonic 4 but it is a bit better in my opinion.  It has better thought out worlds and mechanics.  It however suffers the same problem the first one did.  It has fair difficulty until the last boss, where the difficulty is cranked up to maximum where it is unnessecary for that.  I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes sonic though.

												Sonic The Hedgehog 4 - Episode 2 is the second episode of Sonic 4 project, which is 2D Platformer with multiplayer, came out in 2012, two years after the first one. It ended up being the last episode in the project, with no news on Episode 3 ever since. Outside of ""it's pretty much cancelled"". No big differences between mobile and other versions this time around.Owners of Episode 1 on Steam will also get Episode Metal bonus.No complaints on technical side this time around, it supports all the needed resolutions.Being an episode, you may think it's very short. Well, it's decend old platformer lenght. You are given 4 zones with 3 acts each, plus boss act. Add to that final level and special stages. Each act is adds long enough overall for it to be considered to be about as long as, say, Sonic 1. So don't knock this title off for being ""not full game"".This time around Sonic doesn't travel by himself. The ever cute Tails the fox joins him and becomes part of the team. And he isn't just wasting space either, as the game introduces ability to call Tails to help you. He can lift you up in air, let you travel underwater or you can do a combined spin-dash. Said spin-dash breaks through special walls, destroyes everything and simply goes really fast. Yes, I said a cliche thing. You can't turn around in this mode and it will stop by itself after colliding with a wall three times. In all honesty, I don't like this move. It either will be abusive, making some sections go too easy, or will give you cheap deaths of falling into pits you couldn't possibly see before too late. Try not too use it too much.Oh, and takling of pits. Game for once actually puts signs over bottomless pits, so you know if it will kill you or just a way to lower path. The fact that you can call Tails to save you by lifting into air with push of a single button helps you to get out of this sticky situation where you are already falling into one. Quite clever thing, if you ask me.Now, it's not the first time you have Tails as sidekick. When he was first introduced in Sonic 2, he was giving game much of good. Second player could exploit that Tails always respawns to make bosses too easy, while AI would ruin special stages for you. He would later learn to fly in Sonic 3, also being able to lift Sonic along, but you had to grab Second Player's controller to do that and thus was only used to find rare bonuses. Sonic 2 bad sides of Tails were still there.Then in Sonic Advance 3, with it's sidekick system, you could take Tails along with you and could easily use his ability as single-player to help you. But because you could take any different sidekick with very different abilities, game was still using them for optional things, like finding bonus items or just helping usual process.In Sonic 4 Episode 2 though he is always your sidekick. Thus the game actively uses it and even throws challenges that requrie Tails help. For example, at the end of one of the acts in the Oil Desert you have to use Tails to hover slowly, while avoiding enemies and being pushed around by wind. By the way, flight isn't timed, instead you can ""lift yourself up sllightly"" only limited times.You can't abuse Tails for bosses either, as when it comes to multiplayer, from what I know, the lives are limited for Tails. Or maybe they are shared.In all honesty, I didn't try multiplayer out. But I think it should be real nice. Sonic can call Tails to his location, so Tails player will not feel left out that camera only follows Sonic. And yes, it has all the needed options and system to play over Internet. Maybe even too much, it's just 2-player coop of short platform game after all.I didn't find anybody active online there. So you should just use it to play with friend, not going to find strangers. Then again, playing with friend is the way it should be done anyway.Game also fixes some of the main complaints and just improves. Levels still have pacing, platforming and few paths. Actually, each level has one red ring hidden in it that you can collect. In other Sonic games it usually unlocks something. Here it doesn't do anything aside from giving achievement and just being something to explore levels for. They say that it had some use for upcoming Episode 3, but as it's not being developed, well, yea. Each act also tries to get something unique going for it, but there is still ntohing like darkness and carts.Physics are good. They are still not on par with older Genesis titles, so it's not a game about rolling down the slopes. But they about as good as other modern 2D Sonic games, so there should be no complaints. Still got platforming going for it after all.And I also should mention that this time around game doesn't feel like it tries to restrict itself. It finally feels like continuation to classic trilogy. Perhaps this one should have been the real Episode One, really. Bosses are epic, Metal Sonic makes awesome return too. This game actually does the best justice to this villian. Final boss is huge, unique and isn't easy-easy. You will even get to take down flying fortress again. And yes, there is stage where you fly on top of Tornado plane and it's more complicated than original in Sonic 2. Other zones are also unique and don't feel as much of deja vu like in Episode 1.Shame though that some boss acts are too generous with throwing rings at you non-stop. Ah well, at least battles themselves felt enjoyable.Graphics are great. It's all modern 3D now, using polygons for backgroudn details as well, not using that simplistic shading effect of Episode 1 either. While not requiring much of computer, it strikes some beautiful sceneries.Same can be said of music. In Episode 1 it felt like bad experiement at some times. In Episode Two majority of it is great. It seemed to find it's own identify and provides some unique feel that you will not find in original trilogy, providing tensity too. Oil Desert Act 2 comes to mind, which has a bit of that old-school lo-fi feel, while also giving you a feeling of being in hot oily desert. Burning. Normal boss music is still too repetitive.You can still collect 7 emeralds in special stages, which are similiar to Special Stages in Sonic 2, where you run through a tube and collect rings. No twists this time, just additional small features. That, and it's still better than Sonic 2 ones because you can actually see things before they hit you. Some of them are hard, so you will either learn to abuse ""retry"" button in menu or will have to do it in multiplayer.Episode Metal allows you to go through the Episode 1 levels as Metal Sonic. No sidekick. Metal even has same shading to him there as characters in the first Episode. You will just go through one act of each of the four zones. And layout of that act is changed heavily. Could say that it's unique ones. But using elements from what you already seen before. At least they aren't too easy.So, Sonic 4 Episode 2 is a pretty good platformer and 2D Sonic game. Better than Episode 1 for sure and actually feels more like proper Sonic 4. You should have fun with it. The only shame is that ending may feel cliffhangery for some.			",759,212,16,82,60,1,132

												How does this game have a possible review?Yes, Episode 2 is better than the first, but this game is still broken. The physics seem to have been fixed a bit, but it's still bad. I am honestly confused as to how Sonic Generations( which was a good game ) came before this, and yet they missed the mark so much. Simpily standing on a ramped surface, and pressing down, should cause you to roll, slowly, but you should move, and yet to stand perfectly still. The spin dash is almost useless, you neve get anywhere near high enough speeds to acomplish anything. Most vertical walls just need a light walk to traverse.Better than Episode 1, still bad.I just hope they can make a proper Sonic game before we lose the franchise for good :(			",154,9,1,15,8,0,5

												100x better than Episode 1, they've improved on so much. The graphics and animations (especially on Sonic) no longer look like something on an iPhone, well implemented co-op both online and off, memorable stages/enemies and the special stages are no longer stressful flash games. Now comparing to the original Sonic 2 this game wins again largely because Tails is no longer painful to play as player 2 because the camera follows both players as well as he take damage, unlike Sonic he doesn't have the homing attack so he isn't just a straight upgrade this time round. Really liked the bonus I got for owning episode 1 in this game, it is the ability to play some stages from episode 1 as Metal Sonic, not technically DLC nor is it something an owner of just episode 2 should feel entitled to which is something I'd like to see more of.

												So, lets nuke the staff from Sonic 4: EP1, get a new team in here, and stop with the pesdo 2D visurals and just do real 3D models this time. What we got was a far better product, but still one that's lacking a lot of polish. Still odd spring placements, speed traps a plenty, and the musics still rather hit or total miss (But FAR more hit this time around. Metal Sonic alone is just choice). But we got far better boss fights, far better control and platforming, and overall a rather enjoyable experance. It's nothing steller, but unlike EP1 you'll not be looking back with buyer's regret. Also: No, it's not worth buying EP1 just to play as Metal Sonic. It's only 4 stages of him in EP1 areas with EP1 physics. You are better off watching his elements on youtube then buying a game you'll not play.			",250,23,7,31,13,3,36

												While, from what I have heard, that the game is better than the first one, it is STILL by no means a good game. While the first two acts you could probably breeze through, the next two, Oil Desert and Sky Fortress, just surge in difficulty where the first two had it in small bursts. The worst part, however, is the bosses. Again, the first two bosses are not all that difficult if you have some knowledge of the mechanics of the game. The third boss in Oil Desert, however, is mostly boring climbing and occasionally waiting for Eggman to reveal his weak spot. However, the point where I stopped playing, and I am pretty sure that I cannot give this game anything other than a 'not recommended' review after having game over'd from it twice, is Sky Fortress's boss.To put it shortly, Sky Fortress has you fighting Metal Sonic in the blue carrier from before. However, his strategy is far different from Sky Fortress Act 1. For the first portion of the fight, he will move to either the top or the bottom of the screen and fire screen-filling lasers at you.  You have to hit Metal Sonic in the cockpit, which, provided you don't completely outrun the carrier yourself, is somewhat easy. The next phase is also fairly self-explanatory: Metal Sonic will move to the right side of the screen and fire bird bots and lasers along the screen, simply avoid him and hit Metal Sonic. The last part, however, is down-right impossible at first glance. The screen fills up with missiles (apparently supposed to be in the background), and much larger missiles fly towards you, albeit rotating as they come to you. What it doesn't tell you, however, is that the one move designed to destroy stuff in the way, the team-up command, doesn't break through the missiles, but it is instead to hit Metal Sonic who is way out in front. If you can't keep up with the screen, you are thrown back to the beginning of the battle. Mind, this battle is fairly long, and, again, they don't tell you ANYTHING during the fight, except on what half of the screen the missiles take up. If you're lucky you can get multiple hits on MS in the earlier portions to speed up everything, but what's the point if you die in one hit at the end of the battle unless you have the reflexes of some kind of god or something?There's a reason the classic games' bosses were simple, but not so simple that a monkey could simply wail on a genesis controller and win. Well... there's a reason THREE of the four classic games didn't do that. Sonic 2's bosses were kind of REALLY easy at times. So, for a game supposed to be a modern game built as a sequel to the classic quadrilogy, this fails pretty cohesively as a sequel, even if Sonic 4 Episode 1 apparently failed that much harder.

												To be honest, this game isn't bad. I had fun. Not as fun as Sonic 2, but close. If you have spare money, better buy it now, its only 3.75 dollars. The physics aren't bad, they are fixed, but still not as good, but even if, I don't really notice the physics, as I concentrate on the actual game. Sonic 4 episode 1 physics were noticable and annoyed me kind've, but I dont notice those problems in this game. The levels are good, all of them are similiar colour scheme as Sonic 2 levels, and that kind of feel. Also, special stages are back and better than the last! Yes, the special stages were FUN! The half pipe special stages were actually pretty fun! I sometimes found myself replaying them over and over. So, to wrap it up, it isn't as bad as some people say. I still am a bit annoyed that the game is short, but if you get Episode 1 and 2, its like 1 big game :D. Go buy it if you have spare money.			",40,2,0,2,2,0,0

												Episode 2 continues the strengths of Episode 1 - good level and boss design - and fixes the odd stop behavior while jumping. Furthermore, someone had the good idea to clearly label all bottomless pit segments. Artistically, Episode 2 does less refurbishing of old concepts than Episode 1. The special stages, which are a slight extension of the Sonic 2 special stages, are significantly less challenging than episode 1 special stages.I can name two faults that stuck out to me - one in level design, the other in boss design. One of the snow zone acts ends in a tails swimming test that, if failed, kills you by trapping you underwater until you drown. While in principle this isn't much different than a bottomless pit segment, it feels worse to have to wait for that timer. The sand zone boss has a clunky ending. Both minor faults.Sonic 4 is a good Sonic game.			",88,15,1,27,9,0,23

												Pretty fun!  It's been years since I played Episode 1 and they promised the physics would be better, but I didn't notice much of a difference.  Still, this game has better everything else.  Great visuals, very awesome music (reminiscent of the Genesis's sound), neat bosses and fun levels.  Episode 2 adds Tails and he is a lifesaver, even outside of co-op.The only negative things I have to say are that it's kind of short (2-2.5 hours without getting any secret stuff) and the boss fights could use some polishing.  Too often would I all but finish a boss off to have it go into some ""finishing move"" scenario that I had no idea of how to accomplish and would get killed only to have to start all the way over.  This is very annoying when the boss fights have intros of any sorts and you have to run through a small stage, collect rings and then watch the boss ""get ready.""Still, I recommend it if the price is right.

Literally, Sonic can now roll down hills. Momentum has been mostly fixed, as well as a lot of the physics, which I know a lot of people would probably complain at me if I didn't state that. It's not a perfect simulation of the old physics, but it works.The music is still trying to emulate the older games, but this time it sounds less like a trip to a wood chipper. The Stardust Speedway remix was a nice touch, too.The main gripe I have with this is that whenever lag occurs, the game overcompensates for it and actually /speeds up/ when there's lag. I've been playing the entire game at double or triple speeds, compared to videos online. GOTTA GO FAST at its finest.			",620,149,41,104,95,6,142

												I love sonic games and after sonic generations, I was a fool to think this would of been as good or better, truth is it has terrible level design with♥♥♥♥♥♥ways to kill you, instead of slowing the pace down. You must use tails throught most of the acts and its not fun, just frustrating.The special stages are challanging and fun but will take you sereral attempts to succeed. It is trial and error to get through some of the acts. one moment your just holding right and it guides you through then you'll get a giant snowball in the face that kills you, just to teach you that you have to jump moments before on your next life.

												Where Sonic 4: Ep I failed and annoyed, Episode II made up for in aces.In all honesty, Sonic 4: Ep II's major problem is being plagued with the name ""Sonic 4"". If it were named otherwise as a spin-off or a simple expansion of Sonic CD's storyline, I feel as if it'd be more accepted within the game community. It's got good (but still not quite Genesis-era) controls, beautiful graphics, and average level design, which is a Dimps problem.If you like Sonic with 3D models on a 2D plain, with good boss fights and cool power-ups, play this. If you want a better Sonic experience, play a Genesis game.			",40,11,4,4,6,2,1

												While not perfect, it is a huge improvement over Episode I. It definately feels like the old Genesis games if you don't take the homing attack into the consideration (the game rarely if ever depends on it anyways). I'm dissapointed only in episode metal that you recieve if you own both regular episodes. You can't play as metal sonic through every stage like I have thought previously, you can only play about 4 levels.			",60,9,2,1,0,0,3

												Considerably better than Episode I, but still not necessarily good. The controls are tighter, and there's a good mix of fast sections that basically play themselves and somewhat challenging sections where you need to pay attention. They also aren't as liberal with the extra lives as in the first game.Still, there are sections that feel frustrating and unfair. The tag team abilities are onerous, and they force the boss design to be wonky.Overall, this game felt like a chore, and that's really not what I'm looking for out of my games.

												Episode 2 continues the strengths of Episode 1 - good level and boss design - and fixes the odd stop behavior while jumping. Furthermore, someone had the good idea to clearly label all bottomless pit segments. Artistically, Episode 2 does less refurbishing of old concepts than Episode 1. The special stages, which are a slight extension of the Sonic 2 special stages, are significantly less challenging than episode 1 special stages.I can name two faults that stuck out to me - one in level design, the other in boss design. One of the snow zone acts ends in a tails swimming test that, if failed, kills you by trapping you underwater until you drown. While in principle this isn't much different than a bottomless pit segment, it feels worse to have to wait for that timer. The sand zone boss has a clunky ending. Both minor faults.Sonic 4 is a good Sonic game.			",88,15,1,27,9,0,23

												A decent continuation of Sonic 4 but it is a bit better in my opinion.  It has better thought out worlds and mechanics.  It however suffers the same problem the first one did.  It has fair difficulty until the last boss, where the difficulty is cranked up to maximum where it is unnessecary for that.  I'd still recommend it to anyone who likes sonic though.

												Man, was I looking forward to this...but. The game is ""alright"". Gameplay feels too slow/sluggish somehow. (They still didn't fix his running animation, SO SLOW LOOKING! WHY?) I though Sonic was all about speed. Also the music can be annoying at times, since each track only lasts a few seconds I found out later on. I do like that the game went 3D though instead of pre-rendered sprites. Plus the boss/enemy designs are neat.			",333,39,10,16,19,1,21

												Unlike Sonic 4 Episode I, Sonic 4 Episode II doesn't just reuse a bunch of old things from the classic Sonic games, puts them all in one game and call it a sequel. Instead, it actually adds new things and tries to fix any problems with the first episode.Most of the levels, besides Oil Desert Zone and Sky Fortress Zone which look like Oil Ocean Zone from Sonic 2 and Wing Fortress Zone from Sonic 2, look very original and are extremely creative and fun to look at.The graphics in this game are a huge improvement in this game, the game itself is now is 2.5D and now everything looks a lot nicer and beautiful. Sonic's textures in the game also aren't extremely light blue like the last game and he along with everything else in the game, looks great.Even though this game is nice, I wouldn't call it “Sonic 4” because it still doesn't feel like a direct sequel to Sonic 3, despite the game still being really good. I feel like the game should have had some more characters and stages to lengthen the game and also make the game feel alot larger than Sonic 3 was, but Sonic 4 is an episodic game so I guess both Sonic 4 episodes 1 and 2 would basically be one whole game and if you put combine all the zones in the game you get 10 zones which is close to the amount Sonic 3 & Knuckles has.Because of all of this, I recommend you buy this game at some point and if you want to play the whole “Sonic 4 Saga” then wait for Episode I to be on sale and buy it at a lower price.

												To be honest, this game isn't bad. I had fun. Not as fun as Sonic 2, but close. If you have spare money, better buy it now, its only 3.75 dollars. The physics aren't bad, they are fixed, but still not as good, but even if, I don't really notice the physics, as I concentrate on the actual game. Sonic 4 episode 1 physics were noticable and annoyed me kind've, but I dont notice those problems in this game. The levels are good, all of them are similiar colour scheme as Sonic 2 levels, and that kind of feel. Also, special stages are back and better than the last! Yes, the special stages were FUN! The half pipe special stages were actually pretty fun! I sometimes found myself replaying them over and over. So, to wrap it up, it isn't as bad as some people say. I still am a bit annoyed that the game is short, but if you get Episode 1 and 2, its like 1 big game :D. Go buy it if you have spare money.			",40,2,0,2,2,0,0

However, the rest plays almost exactly like episode 1, which isn't exactly a good or bad thing. The only additions here are Tails, Metal Sonic and the special stages with the Sonic 2 style. The rest are just some new stages. There's also co-op multiplayer and 4 bonus stages if you own Episode 1, but that's it. There's little inovation here. Besides the physics, the flaws of Episode 1 are still present. Again, this is not a bad game, but there are much better Sonic games.			",267,164,6,31,13,4,38

												This game is a bit of a mixed bag.  Sega fixed the problems from episode 1 with the way Sonic moves and tried some new ideas, but a number of them failed miserably.The good things first:  The graphics are definitely improved and they got rid of the ugly fake 16 bit look from Sonic.  Sonic moves better and doesn't feel so sluggish.  Sega tried a lot of new ideas and came up with some pretty unique levels which are a pretty nice change from previous games.Now the bad:  A lot of that new unique stuff is terrible, flow breaking, and annoying.  Some new enemies seem to be designed to always hit you if you're going fast like Sonic should.  Some parts of the new level designs are rather annoying, especially the way they ham-fisted the Tails combo abilities in.  In order to reach the fast path in a lot of levels you seem to be required to use Tails' flying ability to reach places you can't even see.  There's also a combo rolling attack which is required to break down some barriers.  The game prompts you every time you're required to use them to continue in the level, and they mainly serve as an annoyance.  And the other problem with the levels...they actually added a scrolling level in the game.  That's right, in a game where the whole point is to be as fast as possible, they added a slow scroller (and Sonic becomes extremely sluggish on this level as well).Now the biggest problem with the game: the bosses.  Without exception, the bosses are all extremely annoying and tedious fights.  Bosses are a lot more complicated than previous games, take many more hits to kill, and of course require Tails combo abilities at certain not-so-obvious spots.  They also tend to have very long start and transition sequences that you have to wait through every time if you fail.  One of the bosses even uses the scrolling level set up to make it as annoying as humanly possible to fight him.I got to the final boss, and fighting him is so annoying that I can't even be bothered to finish the game.  Do yourself a favor and just get Episode 1 and Generations.  This one isn't worth it.			",862,200,24,72,69,9,114

												After a long break from the release of the first episode of Sonic 4 comes episode II. Eggman has stepped up his game and developed more than just ""upgraded"" versions of his previous end level incarnations. In addition to more Sonic fun, Tails joins in and offers some tandem moves which allow Sonic to explore his enviorment much like in Sonic 3 but with even more freedom. Special Zones lose the original design and go for the familiar half-pipe version. Metal Sonic returns to attempt once more in defeating his fleshy double, as well as featuring in his own 4 part episode (if you own Episode I). This sequel does not quite live up to the original Sonic we all know and love, but if you want to have more classic Sonic in your life or want to complete the story, you will easily get over the frustration that this game offers.

												If you're reading this, I'm sure you've read my review of Ep. 1 Rest assured, this game is *MUCH* better than the colossal, embarrassing failure of the first game. And that is an incredibly low bar and you should not spend money on it.Sonic no longer looks like garbage run through some strange filter the rest of the game isn't in, but the art design remains dull and retready. The first stage is literally Aquatic Ruin Zone with a pallete swap in 3D, the second is ""snow in Carnival Night Zone"" when there already was a Carnival Night/Casino Night Zone mashup in Ep1, and the third is ""what would it look like if Oil Ocean Zone crashed into Sandopolis Zone?""The bosses are new and fresh and no longer rehashes of older 2D games. However all the normal enemies still are. Hell, they couldn't even find DIFFERENT old enemies to shove into the game and have appeared in Ep1 already.Tails follows you around for a bit of nostalgia and a few interesting mechanics where you can grab each other's ankles (yes, it's as bad as it sounds) for a bigger spin dash with more mass and momentum. However, none of the ones I witnessed actually added to gameplay in any way. What's the point of rewarding tricky jumps with a more efficent path if nobody will ever see the lower path because you can hit ""X"" to have tails fly you around whereever you are, saving you from bad jumps and poor choices?The game is not the literal trainwreck the first one was. But in some ways, that's worse. There was some enjoyment to be had watching me rage and rant about the first. This one isn't deserving of hatred or spite, just disappointment. I mean, one of the nicest things I can say about the game is that Sega *didn't* make the protagonist, their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ corporate figurehead/mascot, not look like complete garbage.Good job, Sega.
