												Play this game through to the end, and you will find yourself slowly driven mad as you realise the game's level design is actually a sinister ploy to make you lose your grip, over and over, in your attempt to reach the exit. It might start out with a hand on your shoulder and some encouraging words to help you along, but before you know it you find yourself thrown off the metaphorical cliff as you reset the same stage for the twentieth time in order to bypass the same obstacle, while the game gives you a patronizing pat on the back and asks if you don't want to just give up already.Pretty game, the visuals are a work of art, but the level designers were a band of sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s beyond compare.

												Up to four player platforming mayhem.  Storyline is dismal and easily forgotten, however, the the music, the art, and the gameplay are all topnotch.  The movement is phenomenal and gives you so much freedom to exploit the maps to the fullest.  The art is straight out of Saturday Morning Cartoons.  It is a delight to watch.  But this game truly shines when you play this multiplayer mode.  You can slap each other, punch each other and do so much more to each other and sometimes it plays a perfect part in the game, other times it just adds that much more fun to the game.An absolute contender for best platforming game ever.  Don't miss this one.			",1327,517,57,145,105,15,209

												So I realized Rayman Origins is on sale again and you would be a huge fool for skipping this game. This is the very definition of a perfect co-op game, I’ve played this with nearly every age-group imaginable and have yet to met an individual who did not appreciate the game. This game really does put other Indie 2D platformers to shame and shows that Ubisoft can actually make a good Rayman game that isn’t ‘2’ ported to ‘x’ system.The game really is something else, everything from the super smooth gameplay (I’m talking super meat boy / Mario fluid controls here) to the super detailed animation of the levels just leaves you in pure ecstatic joy, the same type of joy when you first experienced split screen on N64 x100.In summary: DO YOU LIKE FUN? -->THEN BUY THIS GAME.

												Rayman Origins is a platform game. A reboot of the classic Rayman game (the 2D one, not the 3D games), Rayman Origins is an excellent addition to the franchise. Rayman and his friends are all relaxing on the Snoring Tree. But their snoring disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead. She sends out an army of Darktoons across the Glade of Dreams, who capture the Electoons which inhabit it. You, as Rayman and his friends, must go out across the world and free the Electoons to restore the Glade. Although the story is great, the game's aesthetics and soundtrack is where it really shines. The beautifully crafted world, accompanied by the brilliant musical score, is what really sucked me in. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is superb. Gameplay is excellent too. The animations are fab, and the game overall feels very fluid. I am not a huge fan of platformers, the gameplay usually fails to entertain me, but I absolutely adored Origins. You start off with just the ability to run. But as you progress you unlock more abilities, such as wall-running. There are also certain levels in which you ride a mosquito. You can either shoot enemies or suck them up to fire them. The game comes with 4-player local co-op. This is great, but it would be even better if it included Online play too. This is the only downside to the game. One of the best PC games to be released in 2012. I recommend this to both those who adore platformers, and those who do not.			",480,88,10,76,69,2,83

												Rayman: Origins is a 2D side-scrolling, platforming adventure with full four-player local co-op.Rayman accidentally started a war with the Livid Dead, the monsters lurking beneath the otherwise peaceful Glade of Dreams.The protagonist must work his way through a series of themed stages, collecting floating objects called ""Lums"", and rescuing critters known as ""Electoons"" from hidden cages. Reaching certain Lum targets can earn extra ""Electoons"", which unlock new levels and characters.Besides of jumping Rayman learns new skills such as hovering, swimming and shrinking, bringing a compelling variety to the action, and testing your dexterity to the limits.On your way you have to cross floating platforms, dissolving platforms, platforms that twist and turn, that bounce you into the air or slowly fall and fade.Rayman: Origins has impressive graphics, the backgrounds are beautifully drawn and has multiple layers of action.The levels vary from familiar takes on platforming staples – cloud levels and underwater levels – to such oddities as a world based on didgeridoos.Alongside the standard platforming levels, there are boss encounters, and scrolling shoot-'em-up challenges in which you leap on to a mosquito and fly through formations of angry birds and spiky puffer fish.Rayman Origins features drop-in/drop-out cooperative play for up to four players at a time and as long as one of you stays alive to free injured players from bubbles in which they become trapped when hit, progress through a level remains possible.Everywhere there is humour and whimsy, every screen a feast of bizarre scenery and weird inhabitants.Rayman: Origins is one of the best platforming experiences you are going to have on Steam. The game is crafted with so much love, so much humor, and does so many things right, that it is impossible not to have a blast. It is definitly worth the money.Sounds 8/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

												Been a fan of the Rayman franchise since childhood, I've even bought the Rabbids games but very thankful its back to its roots. Big fan of 2D platformers and this is one of the best. If you like a difficult platformer this is for you. Level designers were truly sadistic and want you to lose your mind. Might be the single greatest test for someones dexterity and twitch reflexes. Beautiful design as usual from Michel Ancel. Visually pleasing would me an understatement. Wish it would have had a better more fleshed out story. Even one as bare bones as the original would have been nice.			",19,4,0,2,2,0,0

												Rayman Origins is just as the name suggests, a return to the origins of the franchise, which started as a 2D platformer, and also brings back a few of the earliest designs and concepts used in the first Rayman game.I fell in love with Rayman after playing Rayman 2: The Great Escape, and after that, Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc.I never actually played the original Rayman more than the first level, i did not enjoy it, i am not a 2D platformer person.But since this year marks Rayman's 20th birthday, i decided to play this game, and wanted to actually finish it, which i did.The game is very enjoyable, even for someone who doesn't really plays 2D platforming games, i can even call it very fun.It has lots of levels, with different themes, and different playstyle to many of the levels, like running levels, where you must be as fast as possible to reach an enemy/cage/etc, there are shooting levels, where you fly on a mosquito that shoots, plain old classic platforming levels, as well as boss fights, which you must avoid the boss' attacks, and then hit him in a weak spot.The engine could use some polishing, but it works just fine, except some parts where you might get stuck on a ledge or stuck inside an enemy, but these are pretty rare and not noticable.The level design is very well done, and requires skill and thought, where you cant just sprint and jump through the obstacles and enemys, and it contains lots of funny and very creative themes to them.As you progress through the game, you gain abilities like flying, shrinking and diving, and you always end up using one or the other after unlocking them, so kudos to Ubisoft for not forgetting that they implement some features and forgetting to actually make you use them.the game took me about 10 hours; its not very long but its definately worth its 10 dollar price tag.I recommend the game to any platforming fan, and ofcourse, Rayman fan, but dont expect anything like the 3D games.In conclusion, i really like the game, its fun, its intuitive in the current market, and its Rayman, meaning it contains lots of humor and an interesting storyline (although kinda confusing at times).Its not the Rayman i wanted, but its still very fun.P.S. it also contains a local co-op options, but since i'm lonely, i couldn't really try it, so i didn't write about it, but i bet it would be lots of fun.

												One of the best platformers I have ever played. The Donkey Kong Country series was the one I always considered the best, until I tried this one. The main thing I like about this game, is that you move at a much faster pace, compared to something like the DKC games. There are optional challenge levels that will test just how good you are at controlling your character at its max speed. If you can complete those, you earn the right to play the Land of the Livid Dead level, which is the most challenging stage in the game. All the secret/bonus rooms in a stage, have their own unique platforming segments that you must get past, in order to get the reward from it. I enjoy that a lot more than how the DKC bonus/secret areas usually are (just collecting the bananas). The boss fights are also a lot more difficult and better designed. The art and animations make the boss fights look so good and those water stages also.The difficulty is also great. Nothing is cheap and unfair. Everything stays the same for a stage and you will never feel like it was the stage's fault for dieing, but your own. The game also has fast respawns for when you die and automatic checkpoints per stage. You will never have to start back at the beginning of the stage (unless you die there) and you will get to keep everything you have collected so far.The game will last you 10+ hours, if you plan on trying to unlock all the levels. If you like this game, then check out Rayman Legends, which I think is even better.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's hard not be charmed by Rayman Origins. It has a sort of party atmosphere, with its bright colors, upbeat music, and surreal shenanigans that keep it charming almost all the way. Almost. The graphics are probably some of the sharpest 2d environments seen in a platformer, with a bizarre cartoony look that's not like much else.At its heart, Rayman is a collecting platformer, where you try and collect thingies (lums) to free thingies (electoons), though there's a secondary thingie (skull teeth) you can collect in special challenge levels to unlock another thingie (an extra hard series of stages). As such, if you want to hit every note, you'll be repeating stages to make a better time or to collect more thingies, and your opinion on that may very. Overall, though, you don't have to sweat that too much, and those that can put their collection impulses on hold can charge through the game for the most part.With a variety of moves and skills to unlock, most of the levels become a breezy delight, hovering, running up walls, bouncing off of enemies, etc. In my opinion, it comes very close to dethroning the kings of platforming, save for two issues: the levels can be long, and towards the latter half the game can lean towards being surprisingly tough. Seperately neither of these would be an issue, but together they can deal out some real frustration towards the end of the game. The long levels mean it can lean on being repetitive within a larger world, but each world is varied and often come up with some really great gimmicks, floating through updrafts or sliding down waterfalls. (Note to the developers, though: ice levels where you slide everywhere are not fun.) Annoyingly, the game has a tendency to ask you if you want to switch levels if you die too many times, which it will do over and over - some of the final levels had that pop up occur six or seven times, and when you're just trying to progress, it's rather irritating. An option to turn that reminder off would have been pretty welcome. Contrary to that, though the challenge levels can be similarly tough, their short length and breakneck pace thankfully turn them into one of the highlights of the game. At its best, the game has you charging through areas in a fashion you'd expect of a AAA theme park game, while at no point holding your hand.Ultimately, though, whether you just get a taste or collect every bit, Origins is worth your time. If you can affort Legends, it's a better game that mitigates many of Origins' flaws, but since Origins is often available for just a few bucks during the seasonal sales, it's absolutely worth it. For those with a distaste for UPlay, you can also relax in the fact Origins doesn't use it at all. It's a rare ""pure"" sort of game from a big developer, with no DLC shenanigans or anti-piracy measures. (This may also be due to the fact it got a government grant for its development...)Give it a shot, you should at least get a smile out of it.			",506,141,11,70,29,5,65

												Rayman Origins doesn't deviate very far from the traditional 2D platformer formula, the main way in which it evolves the genre is by setting a new standard of refinement and polish high above the state of the art in every respect. It distinguishes itself by the extraordinary quality of the gameplay, flow and pacing, level design, difficulty balance, controls, variety, visuals, soundtrack, ... It excels at all of that. If you could only play a single platformer in your life, this would be my recommendation.			",141,23,4,3,10,0,26

												As the title suggests, Rayman Origins is a prequel to all the Rayman games of the last several years. The game itself is challenging, satisfying, and has a good amount of replay value which is an oddity considering that this game is published by Ubisoft. There is a decent amount of unlockable characters (most of which are Teensies), and completionists will be satisfied with the challenges available for them to conquer. If you’re a platforming fanatic I’d suggest adding this game to your library.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I only sort of recommend this game... The graphics, music and level designs range from good to amazing, that alone makes it well worth playing, but... (There's always a but.) The controls and boss designs leave much to be desired. Bosses move in completely fixed patterns that are pretty unforgiving and extremely boring once you know the patterns. In other words, bosses are trial and error until you've learned the patterns. That gets tedious real fast --- especially so on the final boss, where the bad controls and poor boss design clash in such a way that it's actually possible to go too fast and die because of that, which seems counter-intuitive when you're chasing the bad guy. The same thing goes for a few other levels, where you can build up enough momentum that the game can't keep up, which is extremely sad to have happen in a platformer. And then there are the controls that don't really feel tight enough for many situations that you are put in. Constantly I caught myself thinking ""this wouldn't be a problem if it was Super Meat Boy or Mega Man"". It's not that the controls are downright bad, they're just not good enough.If you can overlook the flaws, it's a very good and extremely entertaining game.			",451,118,17,37,40,7,64

												Everything about Rayman Origins works.   Fastest review I've ever written.  I'm out people! Ok fine you're still here.  Rayman origins is a return to a very old character that never caught on like he should.   Personally I never played the original Rayman games, finding the character just too odd looking when next to Mario and Sonic. But fast forward about 15 years from then, and Rayman origins came around at a time when only indies made simple platforming games.   So is Ubisoft insane, or genius? Well I already said everything about this game works, so you figure it out.  But It really does.  You get the most amazing upbeat music in this game.  It creates a beautiful shiny world, and the world change at just the right pace.    The gameplay is tight, there's no life limit, and the player has a solid challenge with out being too harsh. I mean this game basically has revived my love of the 2d Platformer, a love that so many games have tried to ruin or tarnish since, but Rayman Origins (And the sequel legends) are as close to a perfect game.  There's challenge, but often times it's beyond just beating the level, rather to get some other goal.  It has a wonderful aesthetic.  I mean we're talking vibrant colors and music that are glorious compared to so many games that claim to have great graphics but just go for a dull look.  And then there's characters. As I mentioned before Rayman never caught on.  Actually, I don't know if I ever played as Rayman in a Rayman game, there's so many beautiful colorful creatures who run around, and allow the player to use them.  There's no gameplay benefit to any of the characters, so the player is free to pick the player that they wish. Speaking of different characters, the game also comes with a brilliant four player couch co-op multiplayer.  It's built on the drop in drop out so players can work together.  Now the player can accidently hit each other, knocking them in another direction which can cause death, but at the same time, to get revived, the player can fly around another and any attack or being jumped on will bring the player back. This system works perfectly.  If there's a coin or something for the player to try to grasp, the multiplayer allows the team to have multiple attempts.  There's no penalty for death, and the multiplayer really does work amazingly. I could spend hours raving about it.  There's only really two negatives I have for this game.  The first is achievements.  Or rather lack of them.  In fact the game doesn't implement steamworks at all.  No cloud save support, no achievements for beating the game, nothing.  This is a constant problem I have with Ubisoft's games.  Steam is a wonderful platform, but they have never fully supported it except for a scant few games. The other issue I'd bring up is the Damsel in distress problem.  Now first off I'm not going to claim this is game ruining, and this isn't a deal breaker.  In fact the game can even be said to be perfect, but when I play this game with the daughter, the fairies that the player have to chase and rescue are.. well over sexualized.  scantily clad, and they tend to be large breasted, long legs and ""Sexified""Here's the thing, So much of this game is kid friendly, I kind of wish the Faries could be more acceptable.  And while this doesn't ruin it, I look at the warrior princesses of Rayman Legends.   Those are brilliantly designed, and I'm glad that someone noticed this problem.  But it does deserve a negative mention, because it's one of the only things that is perfect for this game. Overall though, with that minor negative out of the way, I'm going to call this game perfect, which means as perfect as one can expect. at 20 bucks this game is great, at less, this game is an AMAZING value.  Rayman Origins produces a kid friendly, challenging platformer, that reminds the player more of a great NES while being as brilliantly colorful as almost any other game.   If you haven't given Rayman Origin's a shot, you should.  It's a fun engaging game, and really I can't ask for more.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												Designed pretty well, and quite fun to play. Only problem is that its a little bit repetitive in terms of having to go back to levels to get coins to unlock the next areas, I don't think thats a great gameplay idea, it's just a way to artifically extend how long it takes to complete without adding actual content. Still its a fun little game to play, and worth the money I think when considering how polished it looks.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My review will be divided in two parts: in an opinion as a gamer and in an opinion as a fan of Rayman. As a gamer, it is definitely a game worthy of the prizes that received back in 2011 by several identities including BAFTA, as ""Best Platformer"" and ""Best Art Direction"". It features more than twenty hours of longevity thanks to its 60+ levels, full of detail thanks to the wonderful job of the artists at Montpellier. It is a breeze of fresh air in the market of platforming games as an alternative to Mario, Sonic, etc. This game also supports cooperative gameplay. Chances are low that you will regret purchasing this, just check by yourself by playing the free demo!As a Rayman fan, I honestly think the game had really a lot of potential to be better than what it turned out in the end. The game suffered significant changes during the development, ending up in something that wasn't quite ""promised"" back in the E3 of 2010. Keep in mind: ""Origins"" for the 2D side-scrolling gameplay (like Rayman 1), not ""Origins"" for the backstory of the most important characters. Don't expect the existence (and especially a coherent) of a story, since this pretty much lacks it. The levels are too linear and easy to overcome  especially if you have a sharp dexterity from Rayman 1. While the artwork is impressive, I think the artists were chosen bad for the background treatment, with just one or two exceptions. For me it is the least good Rayman title out of the four currenty existent, and after finishing it you won't wish to replay it very soon. In short, it is a good game but not as fantastic as the other main titles released before.			",23,7,0,6,3,1,8

												For those looking for a good platforming challenge, look no further. I only played one Rayman game before, on the GBA and found it too dificult to finish. That wasn't the story here. This game's pacing feels right and you'll get through most of the levels as it gives you enough time to get used to the new moves you acquire. Rayman controls a bit slippery, but is still up to the task for every level.  This game is also very nice to look at, very colorful and animated. Compared to some recent Mario games, Rayman Origins has loads of charm and personality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Given that i'm usually the idiot that writes the reviews with 10,000 ratings with something dumb and nonsensical, I figured i would actualy write a constructive review for once for a game that I actually like. Rayman: Origins is an interesting game in that it is a platformer with a non human protagonist not made by Nintendo in an era where the modus operandi is generally stamping out 3rd person shooters with crewcut white boy protagonists with perplexingly green 5 o' clock shadows. The asthetic of the game is striking to say the least and it is impossible to mistake for another game. Brown and grey are simply not colors that exist in this worlds pallet and it makes everything feel bright and alive. For the proper enjoyment I would abandon the ""gotta go fast"" mentality that plagues many fans of the genre, and take a slightly slower pace to enjoy the lovely atmosphere and music. Also avoid the power ups that double your electoon count unless you really like listening to the same 12 note song every 20 seconds of game play. To put it simply: It is a nice game with a nice pace that doesn't outstay its welcome with an undersated soundtrack and visual design.			",308,39,2,36,7,0,19

It's like A 2d platformer Except HAND DRAWN which was amazing, The controlls are decent enough And the music is enjoyable Especially The Gourmet levelOverall i think i give this game An8.7/10 great It deserves more love though			",47,6,1,3,1,1,0

												Rayman Origins is the first installment,  followed by Rayman Legends. Back in 2012 I owned this game on my Wii and enjoyed the multiplayer hard with some buddies, resulting in fun and destroyed Friendships (well not really of course).This game covers overall 5 diffirent worlds, some in a jammy desert while others are in a temple full of buddism. Yeah, the placement for these are pretty unique, however some levels feel quite repetitive, which you will eventually notice when doing the time trials. Time trials give you a time set, which you need to beat with touching the red flag further in the level. They are quite fair and even some inexperienced players should be able to get at least the normal time done.Movement feels good even though compared to Rayman Legends, kicks in the air stop you down completly, by standing on a broken platform you have to jump first and then slam down and so on. It was the first game however, and a pretty good job was done for that. Even by using some tricks you get to be faster than actually possible set.Eventually by proceeding through the levels and saving these little pink fluffly balls, you get to unlock a treasure chase. High movement is required while chasing an eyed-chest, funky music too. It contains a red gem that acts like a teeth for that grandpa over at the Snoring tree. Collect 10 and you enter the land of the Undead, which have been triggered by loud noises at the start. Rayman does many things right, what it fails at compeltly is the trial and error. Mostly in bosses, but just it's all about remembering the whole fight. 8/10			",41,8,5,3,3,0,3

												9/10I am a die-hard fan of platformers and this one does not disappoint. Despite its childish appearance, the game is easy to play but incredibly difficult to master. The challenge level is really as difficult as you want it to be – you can choose to collect the coins in each level or simply forgo them for the much easier route. You will never fully run out of lives and you will certainly be able to complete the game no matter what skill level. If you like platformers – specifically Super Mario World type platformers – you will love this game. The art style is fantastic.  ",452,100,26,71,65,4,112

Rayman Origins(I also made a video review if you prefer that format)This continuation of the classic platforming Franchise Rayman goes back to it’s origins, as in back to the 2D roots of the first 1995 rayman game.A lot of Origins’ ingredients were already in that first game: The characters, the electoons, even the mosquito Shmup elements!Michel Ancel was responsible for the first 2 (very good and successful) games in the series, and was again on board with Ubisoft when the work on Origins 12 years later in 2011 began.Story and presentationUnfortunately, this game has no story (although one might argue that statement) and does not introduce any of the characters so you either have prior knowledge, consult the manual ( that’s no joke!) or the internet.You are thrown into a cooky world that  looks and sounds great, so much, that it feels like a lovely feverdream on a mix of LSD and amphetamines.The marriage of Audio and Video is wonderfully executed: Music and sounddesign react to what is happening on screen and are always fitting, fun, pleasent, or - if the situation demands it - exciting, and sometimes even a bit eerie. The visuals are stunning and magical and - to me - as impressive as anything realistic or larger than life in modern games.The eclectic Artstyle creates a “big bowl of crazy” and that is what I personally love most about the game!GameplayControls and Leveldesign are on point, tight and fun and  the difficulty is sitting in a nice spot inbetween challenging and almost frustrating.Yes, the game is pretty hard at times. I sometimes found myself repeating one little section of a level a dozen times until I started to get aggravated and cursed at the screen... but It happended rarely and because of a lack of concentration mostly! Every level can be completed by just making it through, or by collecting a certain number of collectibles to get the maximum number of medals for that level. One can also try to beat a certain time to get a speed run medal which is asking for precision platforming.Then there are the crazy treasure chest runs which are levels in which you chase a treasure chest and have to be as fast as possible.These levels require a lot of practice and trial and error progression which could bother many, I liked them and found myself more frustrated with some of the standard levels and bosses... but that might be a question of individual taste.I beat the game in around 11 hours and it will give you at least 15 to 20 hours of gameplay if you target 100% completion.I personally felt the game was a little too long, halfway through when you think you have completed the game, 4 new worlds pop up with a boss in each of them, these bosses are mainly fun but can get a little frustrating sometimes because of trial and error pattern learning on the players part.The leveldesign got better the further you progress in the game, I felt, but still it seemed a little stretched for my taste and schedule but most people would probably disagree.ConclusionIf you like challenging platformers and the Rayman art style you will definitely enjoy this game a lot!It’s not on par of course with SMW. It’s not on par with Super Meat Boy although that is a bad comparison for many reasons.But it’s certainly the best platformer I played since Super Meat Boy and I will definitely play through the follow up Rayman Legends when I get the chance.Last but not least, the game supports up to 4 player local co-op which is really fun!I would recommend this game (I even gifted my little niece a copy for her 3DS last christmas, so there you go)!

I liked the fact that it was difficult enough to keep my interest yet not so difficult that i quite out of frustration. I liked the art, the colors, and the controls. Truthfully i cant really think of something that i disliked about the game			",61,6,0,3,0,0,12

												Such a fun game! Absolute beautiful art design that really captures the spirit of play in a ""dream world"". Never played any of the older Rayman games, so this isn't a nostaglia based review, it's just the best damn platformer I've played in years, and probably the best on PC!			",146,27,2,6,9,0,18

												The gameplay really reminds me of a Sonic game, with some Kirby co-op elements. The atmosphere makes me feel like I'm a kid again, which I love.It's fun a game. But I admit that I would've bought Rayman Legend had I known that that game also includes the levels from this game.Although, I haven't tried Rayman Legend, so I don't know how it compares to this.

												Simply a stunning game. Visually, it is like have your head pumped full of LSD without the horrible and painfully side-effects that medical procedure would ential. Musically; see above. Gameplay is tight and smooth and awesome and adjective. Many adjective. But most importanly, it's fun. Straight up fun-a-rama. A romp riot (Whatever that means) that's easy to pick up, and find very hard to put down (Kinda like Herpes.)			",236,53,5,19,29,4,34

												Rayman Origins is an excellent side-scrolling 2D platformer. The animation and artwork is incredible, and you'll constantly be amazed at how well everything looks when in motion. The soundtrack is a bit crazy - the game uses a made-up babbling language for both its characters and the music, very reminiscent of LocoRoco's and still extremely catchy (though not nearly as mind-wormingly irritating long after playing). The platforming mechincs are extremely simple, and expand as you continue into the game. Environmental hazards, however, vary how you'll approach each stage, especially when you start attempting speed runs. Speaking of speed runs, one unfortunate omission is a lack of Steam achievements.  Though the game rewards certain tasks throughout the game, there are a lot of unique challenges missing from within the game that show up in the game's console counterpart. Regardless, the challenges are fun and the game as a whole does not hold back on difficulty. 5 out of 5 foxes.			",252,85,5,23,8,4,11

												This game is a definite blast to play with friends (local coop, up to 4 players on one computer).Roughly speaking, you can think of this game as a modern Super Mario Bros. Sometimes you have to race to the end, most of the time you have to kill bad guys and jump through figurative hoops to make it to the end of the level. Many maps are quite random and weird, but superbly fun nonetheless.A rough estimate of a first time playthrough might be along the lines of 6-10 hours, depending on how stubborn you are about completing the treasure race levels (among other factors).I'd probably rate it an 8/10 (-1 for a slight lack of replayability, and -1 for being potentially short/easier-than-desired [yes, I finished that dead-land world as well; that series of levels was a blast]).

Local multiplayer/co-op: We play 3 (one on keyboard, two on controlers).Can be played cooperative, semi (who will colect more playstile) or full compepetive (no reviving of others, 'removing' obstacles under players), but does not force neither play (there is no setting for playstyle).A must play.

												This game by far, is the best experice you can have for a platformer. I love how the whole game is based around music. Everything you do adds to the overall song for the level. Everything sings and makes noises. It's easy to die because you die in one hit (unless you get a heart which gives you two hit points), so playing coop is recomended.

												Rayman Origins is another in a series of platformers centered around a somewhat-limbless hero with a small variety of skills gained throughout the game. There are a decent amount of levels that gradually ramp up in difficulty and can be approached in a linear fashion until the mid point of the game where you can jump between multiple new areas. Some of the later levels were quite frustrating and the last few had me almost pulling my hair out. Also the bosses can be very trial-and-error meaning you will just die a lot until you figure out safe spots to run rayman over to until the weak point is revealed. Still, if you're a fan of the genre you'll probably like this one although I hear Legends has 40 of the levels from origins so it may be better to get that one instead.			",217,101,1,22,12,4,23

												Another great 2D platformer. You can't call yourself a gamer if you have never played a Rayman game before. There's nothing more to say really. It's a platformer, with unlockable abilities and bossfights. But the bossfights... oh boy, remember Super Meat Boy ? Even Rayman Origins has several frustrating levels... and boss fights. It's the one thing that really annoyed me and took away a lot of fun at the same time. The boss fights require a certain pattern if you want to kill them. It will DEFINITELY take you a couple of tries for every boss fight there is. It's annoying and requires no skill whatsoever; just a good memory.Thankfully the HD graphics make up for it... in a way.[Rating: 85/100]			",1661,635,69,222,194,16,225

												This game is simple yet very very entertaining. The style is amazing and it provides great challenges for both collectors and speed runners. New challenges appear as you get more powers and it is a very funny game, good to play with your friends also! I certainly recommend that game for any platform game lover.			",278,73,3,7,8,2,19

												The best platformer since the days of Nintendo and Mario 3.  No other recent platformers comes close to this, it's an absolute joy to play.  Do not judge this game by it's demo.  The demo is great by the full game is FAR better.  Buy this for the sake of video games and have a blast.  Controller recommended.			",626,183,21,54,43,9,54

												As a person with a great love for platformers, i must say this is already turning out to be one of the best i've come across, and probably THE best i've played on PC. The mechanics are pretty much perfect, wich is so vital for a good platformer and the game is as hard as the goals you set for yourself for each level. Did i say how beautiful the artwork in this game is? It's fingerlicking good! I'm far from finished at the time of this writing, so feel free to ask me for an update regarding my opinion if you're considering buying this.			",186,12,19,6,7,0,10

												Please, forgive my bad English.This vote has been one of my hardest decision here on Steam.I was wondering while playing if this game should deserve a thumb up, but there were too many elements that keep me distant from the quick decision.I've played the entire game with a gamepad and solo.I started collecting all the possible rewards, but then I got bored and started to go straightforward.I've also played a lot of platformer games, so I know a bit about them.Graphics is superb, with fascinating animations, 3D effects, shaders etc.Music is super awesome: they change constantly genre and get an amazing atmosphere although the strict change of setting in place.Also, performance and the stability (even if I had 9/10 bugs during the playtime) of the game is a great point in favor.The thumb up is due exclusively to this ""bright side"" of the game.Now, this is an awesome title. There is a big budget behind it, people that liked it (as it seems, a lot of people), and an unending list of people that worked on it.It is evident how great has been the work behind this title, but still I didn't get why developers decided to develop some strangely annoying mechanics.So, here are my impressions about the ""dark side"" of the game:1) The game environment is unfair:often, especially during the running part and when the scene dynamically changes its structure, there are a lot of unpredictable dangers that, considering the low field of view and the speed of the dangerous object, you haven't the time to avoid them.This is the true motivation on why this game is a ""frustration game"": you must die several times to know the level and then trespass it (and that's why I started avoiding all the collectibles).There are, also a lot often, enemies that don't act like they do normally but follow a pre-decided path, and often that path is unpredictable and hard to avoid when running or jumping.2) That heart is mostly unuseful:Do you remember when platformer's characters had lives?Just to make an example, in Spyro and Crash there was the possibility to have 3 chances before dying.The choice of giving to players just one chance before dying is not incorrect. It is nonsensical if the hitbox of the character reactivates after half a second, so you have no time to understand how to save the situation.3) Hitboxes of the character, enemies and dangerous environment is not clever at all.There are tentacles that hit you far under the bottom of the drawing and far under the upper; thunders that have a giant invisible hitbox; enemies that I still don't know how far to hit them.Drawings are very pleasant to see but deceive you from their true collision box.4) The controls and the physics are not good for a platformer game: Maybe, here it'd be appropriate a ""last but not least"".Now, I know that lots of people agree that controls are very good and movement are precise and the overall physics is cool.I think here, maybe, is just a matter of opinion, but at least I want to give a reason to my opinion.Movement is super smooth, even when not on ice, even when you are in the middle air, and this makes it very imprecise when jumping on platforms.Running movement is ambiguous: you can start fast and get your movement even more slippery especially in the middle air when you have no more chances to strike a floating platform.Jumping is decided by the time you press the button, but it has only two values, a high jump and a not-so-short jump, that does not give you the possibility to jump quickly between platforms while running.When becoming tiny, all the physic changes and gives you a very hard time: lateral attacks are always charged, jumps are even more not precise and you are like constantly on ice.Gliding with you hairs almost instantly cut down your speed to a constant value, that you can adjust but still with slippery controls. Also, you can't instantly reactivate the gliding, making the flying parts very painful.Running on curved walls seemed a cool feature, but there are too many parts in wich you must jump to another wall and continue running. I never understood that system as more of half of the times the character started falling down or going backward (on upside-down running).Without any doubt, this has been one of the most slippery platformers I've ever played since years and those 4 points are why the game should have deserved a bad vote.Anyway, the work with graphics, music, humor and cuteness saves this game.And now, let's install Rayman LegendsUpdate:I'm playing Rayman Legends and it's absolutely 100 times better than Origins!All the negative aspects of this title are wiped away, collectibles are fun to take and movements are very precise.

												Played through almost all the levels and can hands down say that if you like platformers, you will enjoy this. It can be suprisingly challenging sometimes, especially if you try to go for a speedrun. I'm not a huge fan of the levels where you have to ride the mosquito though. But since it's not a huge part of the game I get by.The art and music is very good and humorous at times, enough to keep you interested.Great game! Would recommend.			",39,2,0,2,1,0,0

												I like this game. Sadly, the game is meant for kids below the ages of 12. This is not a negative per se but I find that I am unable to appreciate the prepubescent cuteness. I loved the idea of the extra levels, each level is revisited again to find the King of the land. However, I would call this a non-priority game. Why? There is no excitement that constantly makes me want to keep on playing. I use this more as a filler game when I'm free.PROS1. Hidden LevelsLots of them to find. They aren't hard to find but it's worth looking for.2. Mini GamesThe mosquito level was very interesting. Being able to fly a mosquito with a vacuum proboscis was fun.3. Pig LatinI didn't see it at first, but then I saw that the language used was Pig Latin or Ig-Pay Atin-Lay.4. RevisitingIt's nice to see that they place another set of levels on top of the original set, so you basically get 2 separate copies of the same zone. 1 easy mode and 1 hard mode.CONS1. Hard to keep my attention for longI don't know how to put it, I wanted to play the game a bit at a time.2. Hard to Keep InterestedUnlike other games, I seem to only want to complete this game at a really slow pace. Like 1 stage per day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rayman has been around since the mid 1990s but the rapid success of the spin-off Raving Rabbids had left the main character behind and stuck in the background. But then one day, original creator Michel Ancel decided to bring the character to give the team a break from developing Beyond Good and Evil 2.The return of the character as well as its return to its platforming roots has been very much celebrated. This is probably as good as platformers are ever going to get. The game has a fun, cartoony look and atmosphere to it, it doesn't take itself seriously at all and it completely blows away anything Sonic and Mario have done over the last 10 years.The difficulty is spot on, no lives system here you just keep going, with checkpoints that are places so the game remains challenging without being frustrating, you'll never be wasting more then a minute of your time getting back to the point where you messed up.The level environments and music are so well created its surreal. You can revisit any level you want to play from the game menu and the flow of the levels are so smooth. The game is long too, expect it to take a good 10 hours to get through, if you pace yourself.Highly recommended if you love great platforming, wacky fun humour and a great art style to fit it all together with. No DRM either!			",407,120,6,53,17,2,32

												25/25 Gameplay9/10 Fairness10/10 Sound15/15 Graphics15/15 Controls13/15 Longness 4/10 MultiplayerRayman Origins, the first remake of the Rayman games, is one of the best platformers I have ever seen. Why? Read this test to learn more!First of all I want to talk about the atmosphere. You play in different worlds and their ""Dark"" World types. The worlds are completly different (Forrest, African, I won't spoiler more...) and have their own music and graphics. You see  Dust flying up in the African styled maps and after a time this even becomes a part of the Gameplay!The Graphics are just awesome. Hand-made worlds create a feeling of really being in the Rayman World. Together with the fitting sounds and music, this creates a very good atmosphere.Also: When I played the first levels of Rayman, it made me really happy. I played and was happy. I even had to stop myself from playing too much, because I did not want Rayman's adventure to go over too fast!Now to the Fairness and sticked with that: The Controls. The Controls are intuitive and easy-to-learn. After some times, you get new abilities, which though do not make the game confusing. You understand them and they stay in your brain.The game is pretty easy if you just want to play it through. You just have to get through the levels with the (sometimes not so many) checkpoints. But if you want a challenge, ok: Collect over 300, or even 350 points in the level, complete it with the best time possible or even find all of the hidden emoticons!Anyways, sometimes the not so good spreaded checkpoints are a little annoying or the unlimate pro times in the time challengers mode. You have to complete the level in a certain time (may sometimes even be 3 minutes!) AND not die AND be as fast as somehow possible. This is sometimes annoying, but I mean: it is optional, so...I already talked about the Gameplay a bit: Different worlds, different challenges, new abilities, time trial,...The most fun though is exploring the level. If you just up in the ""wrong"" way that you should and then do a bit of this and that...Hey! There is a mini game for an emoticon! And if you try to just go under the collapsing bridge...50 points in a coin! Nice done, Ubisoft!Also, you unlock new characters and racing levels with the emoticons. The characters are just for the optics, but the races are really fun! With the pursuit soundtrack you run behind a running Chest around a collapsing level, split up, come to him again, etc etc. It is just like a much better time trial mode! Anyways, the Longness is not so long if you just play the game through without secrets, time trials and so on. You can be through in 7 hours. If you do the time trials and the other stuff, Rayman can take like 25 hours. This is up to you. For this huge difference there is a minus in the points rating though...The Multiplayer is the only thing I would critise in the game: You may play local Co Op, but there are no Local Co Op levels, and in a time in which everything is connected to the Internet, an Internet Multiplayer is actually a must-have...TL;DR: If you want to play a platformer which makes you happy while exploring wonderful levels with atmospheric music, you should buy this game! Just if you need a Multiplayer at all costs though, you should think about getting the game.			",105,18,13,15,9,1,21

												Picked up this game on PC at the beginning of 2015, because I owned it earlier on the Wii. All I can say is that it's great. The artstyle, the gameplay and the difficulty level makes it exciting to play it each time. The only negative issue is the bug where you freeze on the map selection which makes your save file broken. Fortunately this happened after I finished the story, but I didn't get to finish the game 100 % which was a bit sad. It's a great game even if you haven't played any of the earlier games in the series and a nostalgic piece if you're familiar with the series. Overall: 9/10Buy it gdamn it			",79,12,2,3,3,0,7

												Rayman Origins looks and plays really well. It's a great platformer. But...I'm in two minds about this one. And that's mostly due to the last set of levels I had to go through in the game. Maybe this is picky, but, that last set of levels really tarnished the experience for me. Example - You're running along a scrolling screen type setup with falling debris. Hopping from piece to piece when, you get slowed down for a moment. You get back on track, but, now the debris is further along and you can't reach it anymore. Even though, the edge of the screen hasn't caught up, you cannot recover and die. This is terrible level design as far as I'm concerned.That above example happened so many times and it was rage inducing! In fact, sometimes you could be travelling along that same setup, making no mistakes and suddenly the platforms would slow down or go faster than normal for no good reason. Then it's fall to your death time again. AGGGHHHH!However, as much as I've just written a bad overview above, I'm still going to recommend the game. The above only accounts for maybe 5% of the total experience. That and, I was forcing myself through till I beat it.So, overall, it's a wonderful mix of platforming, shooting and just straight up goofy, cartoony goodness. This and Rayman Legends are really wonderful games for old school platforming. So, check it out if you're into that kind of thing!			",698,140,29,48,30,6,67

												If you're into platformers you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's amazing and definitely one of the best ever. I have finally unlocked everything after much work and the payoff was totally worth it :) This is definitely a 5 star game! Nintendo please take note. You have other developers outdoing you when it comes to Mario games. The game has a specific pacing and flow to it that other platformers lack. You can literally speed run without any issue through these levels after some practice. It doesn't obscure your progress or slow down your pace like those terrible side scrolling Sonic games. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Just like the stages in this game the soundtrack was made with love.The most perfect 2D Platformer since Super Mario World! Buy it!

The graphics are amazing (or as my firend would put it, amaz1ng.), beautiful, and hand drawn! The soundtrack is awesome, and will have you happily bouncing around the whole time! The atmosphere of this game is colorful and creativer, and the platforming is VERY hard, but it's some of the best I've ever seen.

												Can't even move my character. I've tried every button on the keyboard and a controller as well. Couldn't leave the starting location because of that, much less get far enough to have the game-breaking map bug. I've heard incredible things about the game itself, however it's just not worth getting on a pc. It's also available for PS3 X-360, Wii, and Vita if you really want to try it. I've heard the 3DS port is very much an inferior way to experience the game. Overall, I'm extremely dissapointed with Ubisoft for releasing a port so obviously broken and not even bothering to address the bugs via patch. If you want a Rayman game for pc, I do highly recommend the sequel Rayman Legends. It works fine aside from some minor kinks. Fun, creative, and it includes many of the levels from its predecessor anyway.			",35,2,0,3,1,0,0

 Presentation	 Gorgeous , creative and original , fantastic music , Christophe Héral did a great job composing a charming and catchy soundtrack. Gameplay	 Full of action , a TON of things to collect , almost every collectible has it's own little puzzle or obstacle to overcome , great difficulty curve. Lenght	 Each level is pretty big , with a lot of things to complete like time trials and getting a certain amount of lums. Collecting and completing is rewarding and the original level design makes it even more of a treat. 12 - 15 hours to finish , 30 Hours to complete .Perfect platforming , great music , amazig level design . Rayman origins wil always be one of the best 2D platformers to ever come out on steam .			",207,33,2,26,13,2,17

												It's a Rayman game (I loved the first one on PS1), it's often good, sometimes great... so why I am so bored when I play it ?Two expressions come to my mind to try to get to describe the feelings i have regarding this game: ""Soulless"" and ""Paint-by-numbers"".Many of the levels feel empty. You go from platform to platform, you meet some enemies, but most of them are immobile, or even sleeping. They don't feel like enemies at all, they are not here to hunt you, they don't care about you at all. They completely lack personality. Good platformers have enemies that have an interesting behavior that give them personality. Even Goombas in Mario are memorable with their mean looking eyes. In Rayman, in many cases, that's not the case. It's so bad that sometimes it's hard to tell if something is here to help you or kill you (i made a few mistakes that way).Story-wise it's the same. It's full of holes. After a hilarious 5 min cartoon intro, the game tells you ""ok you have to fetch electoons again. Go for it"". It's almost like there is no relation to what you just saw with what you have to do. Most of the characters you will meet have no name, and will usually don't utter more than one sentence. Sometimes it feels like there are 2 distinct stories and none of them was completed.That's really disappointing, because technically the game is top notch, with colorful environments and very nice animations. And sometimes, the Rayman's magic is back. In a few levels, (particularly the water world levels), enemies actually have personality, the environments are full of life, and the music nicely complement the action.Nowadays AAA studios have mostly abandoned platformers to the indie scene. So i was happy to get a new Rayman from a big Ubisoft studio. I suspect many of you feel the same.However, I can't forget nor forgive the fact that, after 2 or 3 levels, i usually quit the game because i was bored. Worse, i also used the ""skip level"" functionality several times when i didn't feel like completing that level right away. That's not things i would get in a good game. I did finish the game, including the awesome bonus level (by far, the best level, and really enjoyable), but i really had to force myself to play many of the levels (particularly the wind world).Sadly, there are too many boring levels where I'm just going through the motions. ""Been there, done that"", was a recurring feeling. Most levels felt like the 1000th iteration on the same stuff from countless platformers. There are too few memorable/good levels for me to recommend this game.Maybe some of the problems come from the added multiplayer. I only played the game solo, and i guess with friends, it would get more chaotic, but also more fun. Maybe that would alleviate some of the issues i had with the game. It would explain why the levels sometimes feel empty and the enemies are too passive: with 4 players it must already be very hard to get to the end with everyone. But I'm unable to test that theory.PS : For achievements hunters, be warned that the game doesn't include Steam achievements, even though the console versions have them.PS2 : Regarding difficulty. Some reviewers state that this game is the toughest game they've ever seen. That's not my opinion. 2D Platformers have often been challenging games. Considering that fact, i think that Origins is not easy, but it's not hard either. If you just want to see the end, as well as unlock the bonus level, Rayman Origins is way easier than many platformers from the 90s, like the SNES platformers, or Rayman 1 on PS1. It's also way easier than some modern titles like Super Meat Boy. If you're familiar with platformers, you should be able to finish it without issue.Time trials are probably trickier, but i wasn't interested in trying them so i can't give you my opinion on them.

												The levels in which you chase a treasure chest until the end and the Land of The Livid Dead are super fun. Challenging, but never frustrating. I felt comfortable with the jumping physics and never once did I blame the game for messing up a jump. Definitely more enjoyable and better platforming than any 3DS platformer I've played. It's shameful that Nintendo has been getting outclassed by Rayman, and it's shameful that it took me so long to realize it. Ubisoft hasn't made one-tenth as many platformers that Nintendo has and they're already showing them how it's done.Only problem is that the Ubisoft credits are wayyy too long. I sat through Duke Nukem Forever and Skullgirls backer credits and neither of them have ♥♥♥♥ on Ubisoft when it comes to wasting my time.Five out of five Lennys( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) ( ͡͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °)			",369,77,6,41,18,2,46

Don't be fooled by its coverI was gonna give this game a thumbs down when I was about 1/3 in the game for the lack of a neutral review. Basically, what I thought was this:- Music and graphics are really, really amazing! Top-notch stuff, really.- But everything else is meh or bad. Gameplay is so boring, really repetitive, and the game is insanely easy. Infinite lives? C'mon... There are only 2 challenges in the game (getting gold medals for colleting enough fireflies, or whatever they're called, and the trophy for time trial), but even those aren't too hard.- I haven't tried co-op mode, but I think it would be even easier.So basically it's a bland game that relies solely on a trademark and on aesthetics.But, wait, it gets worse!After playing for about 8 hours, mastering 3 worlds, the game crashed (not for the first time) and that crash affected my savefile! So, basically, I lost all my progress.And you know what? This has been a known bug FOR OVER 2 YEARS, and not the only game-breaking bug I've found in the forums.From Steam Support's page for the game, I get a link for an official website that doesn't exist anymore, and a link to a support center that offers no support for this game. (and I'm currently requesting a refund for this game, because I've paid for a complete game).I think that this game should be removed from Steam, or at least feature a big label, saying ""THIS GAME IS A BROKEN AND ABANDONED BY UBISOFT! BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!""What annoys me the most is that this is a game from a big franchise in a big company. There should be no excuse for such huge mistakes.And what really, really puzzles me is how can it have 956 positive reviews as of now, totalling 95% of the reviews. This game is mediocre at best without the game-breaking bugs, and doesn't even get close to living up to its franchise name, so DON'T BE FOOLED BY ITS COVER and avoid it entirely.(Also, as I protest, I refuse to even give Legends a try.)EDIT: To top it off, after a long series of annoying Ubisoft support (in which they repeatedly tell me to run an antivirus), they tell me they can't make the proper tests because THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE GAME!!!

When gaming starts to feel like work... ... it's not a good sign for an in -my opinion- overhyped game.Clearly the game has fancy and lovely graphics that will probably run on every machine. Then there are tight and responsive controls which should make a enjoyable platformer, but Rayman Origins lacks something that makes you want to see the next stage.After three hours it seems that you've already seen everything and you will go through the same kind of levels in different scenarios again.First platforming, then mosquito flying and in the end you will get a new skill. And when you have enough collectables you will go back to earlier worlds to race a treasure chest.When I finally cleared all worlds and thought I was going to face the boss the game opened more passages to extended stages of the prior worlds.And again I went through the same procedure again. Jumping, Flying and rescuing nymphs for the final assault. Overall it was very repetitive (gameplay, animation, screen and the end of every stage) and I literally was so bored that I almost didn't finish the game. Then there were some bugs that didn't make the game scroll to the new area when I went through portals or doors. The only solution was to restart the whole level again. Because the game becomes very challenging in the end ('Super Meat Boy'-esque),  this can be very frustrating and makes it definitely not a game for kids, although it's artdesignand it's humor, which didn't really get me, makes you think so.I really wanted to play Rayman Legends afterwards but my experience really made me reconsider. Unfortunally It's not a Mario or a DKCR (obviously the game's original) for PC ...6/10PS: The last levels were cool though ...			",145,31,2,6,3,1,12

												Starts of great. Really beautiful, really inventful, and really dynamic gameplay. Then the last third turns into the hardest game I've ever played. Really baffling move on the designers part. Half of my hours on record are doing one part several hundred times. Then I had to sit through an offensively long credits list, just as a slap to the face. A real pity. Loved 2/3's of this game.			",290,53,9,22,12,2,41

												I absolutely loved Rayman Legends. Absolutely loved it. I've been hungering for more content and I found out that Rayman Origins existed.So I excitedly shelled out the twenty dollars, didn't even wait for a sale. To my dismay upon installing, reinstalling, looking on forums, DESPERATELY searching for an answer as to why my character can't 'hit'. I've had to uninstall.I've remapped my controls across two different controllers and my keyboard. Every time I've mapped the 'hit' action to a button, the button has been recognized. Once you get into a game? Nope, couldn't hit. Can't even beat the first level without this.Before buying this game, just know that a lot of people have had issues with its ability to run on PC.

												You know I'd really like to like this game, but the random CTDs kill it for me.  Seems like 30 minutes pass and the game alt-tabs and any attempt to get back in just shuts down the game.  Halfway through the last level and it crashed.  You know what?  I tried, I tried to ignore it, I made backups of my save in case the map bug hit, but I'm not going to attempt that last level again knowing there's a good chance the game will just silently crash on me again.  ♥♥♥♥ it.

												I am giving a negative review solely based upon the fact that once again, a game company ported a game to PC clearly without making an attempt to polish it and assure that there were no glitches. My xbox controller would not work for multiplayer despite multiple attempts to reset the controls, remap them, use a different usb drive, etc. I just wanted to play with my girlfriend, but only the keyboard works and plugging in a second one with differently mapped controls in order to play is, in my opinion, a huge middle finger to PC players. ""We couldn't be bothered to make sure your controllers would work reasonably well so that you wouldn't have to do something strange to make the game work."" ♥♥♥♥ you too, Ubisoft.

												Perhaps my gaming interests have changed, or perhaps this game isn't that good. I was expecting this to be comparable to a Mario game, as the reviews have been very positive. I did not experience this. The gameplay is frusterating. It's boring, and annoying. I find myself bothered by this game after only a few minutes of play. It could be a combination of a few things: the music is not great (simple beats, but nothing moving, or interesting to hear), the character animations are good, but get old quickly. The protagonist (if you can call him that) does not have any real charm. He's a shell devoid of buttery flavor. The game is long. The game gets hard, which added to my frusteration. I usually don't mind challenge (Super Meat Boy), but this wasn't fun due to it's derivitive saminess. There's really nothing creative on display. Overall this isn't a good game, it's not bad (it technically works), but I'd look elsewhere for a platformer. 5/10 - I do not recommend.			",93,21,0,10,0,0,1

												At it's core, a 2D platformer. A few mechanics beyond running, jumping and attacking are unlocked as you progress - swimming , wall running, flying - however they're mostly only used in the world that you unlocked them in. The combat is very simple, most enemies die in one hit, apart from the bosses which have some originality, but like much of the harder portions of the game, the bosses just need lots of repetition to get muscle memory and knowledge of attack patterns. Each level has a few ""electoons"", which are mostly quite easy to acquire. The fun part in getting these is in the little challenge each section presents, but due to limited game mechanics, I can't remember any distinct ones.The hard parts, such as bosses and the levels where you chase a treasure chest for a secret *thing*, are like quick time events without the visual cues - and if you're just a moment off even though you made a good recovery, the design of the game forces you to play again, getting a microsecond closer to the speed they want you to get to.The visuals are quite nice, but you only notice them in the calm before the storm because otherwise you're too busy running around or trying to not die, which is a shame. The music was unique, but the loops caused by dying repeatedly mean that any nice melodies are quickly forgotten. The sidescrolling shooter parts are fun and a good challenge, and there aren't too many, which means you can accept that they didn't give the separate costumes (oops, I mean characters) distinctive playstiles. As far as I noticed, even in the walking part of the game, the different characters did nothing either, apart from help you identify you and your friends apart.Without co-op I probably wouldn't enjoyed this game enough to bother going very far. Co-op mechanics were decent and allowed for coordination and teamwork, however guacamelee did it better - in fact, I think Guacamelee did everything better, apart from on incomparable things such as artstyle.tl;dr unless you're a big Rayman fan, play Guacamelee instead.

												Unfortunately it's not possible to write neutral reviews.It's absolutely possible to play through the basic levels within 4 hours.After this you'd have to replay all the levels to get enough points to play the bonus level.I don't want to know how much time you would need to reach this level... And it's just not fun to play the same levels again and again...Overall it's a cool game but it won't entertain you more than a few hours and I think for 10 bucks, that's not enough.

												I love this game.I never got past the control setups though so I'm not sure if I missed anything. That part was REALLY hard. I even went online to find solutions and I tried all of them. I'm not going to spoil it for everyone, but it involves **SPOILER** making sure your controller is plugged in before starting **SPOILER**And I'm STILL stuck trying to configure my gamepay. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this is a tough game. I really like the design so far though, the EA into and the music is really jazzy, and I feel like if I get any further in the game I'm really going to have a blast, even more so than where I am right now.I guess if there's anything I'd fix with the game, it's that you can't seem to get it to recognize your XBox360 controller. I mean DANG, I'm not the only one with the problem, patch this already so we can keep playing, Ubisoft! ;)All in all, I wouldn't recommend this game though. It's really short and so far all I've been able to do is enter the options and that's about it.I'm sure the rest of the game is great though, but it might be too hard for noobs like me. I mean, if I can't get any further than that, just two minutes into the game, I guess I'm going to have a really hard time in the later parts.Anyway that's it for my review. Oh, and here's some extra points:Graphics 4/5 - Crisp and really great, iconic design. Good intro animation.Sound 4/5 - it gets repetitive after a while, and there only seems to be one song so far, but it's catchy!Plot 3/5 - The game's really got me stoked to find out what those little things flying into the EA symbol in the beginning are.Controls 1/5 - While technically I haven't been able to play with my controller yet, the mouse can open menus really well!Challenge 5/5 - Only play this if you are a PRO! I mean it!Overall  3.5/5 - Hopefully there's going to be a LP that'll show me how to get past the control puzzle soon.			",198,75,1,34,20,2,26

												The art, animation, and sound are fantastic. It is a pleasure just to see it in action.But coming to this game from other platformers, the controls feel very sluggish. It's hard to get a sense of momentum going in the levels, especially since the score par for each level is really high, so missing a single enemy or a couple pickups can mean the difference.I kind of forced myself to play it through to the end, but halfway through you find out that you have to replay every level again to keep progressing and that just killed my enthusiasm. I haven't played since.			",123,21,2,8,13,0,21

												I was looking for a fun platformer, so I thought this could be a good one. Well, it has been a very frustrating experience.Graphics are fun, rhythm is fast and controls are responsive, but something is not right.* overly difficult to control precisely, so the fast rhythm is stopped by numerous stupid deaths, so you have to replay again and again things that are not interesting to do...* menus and game organisation are confusing, I'm not even sure I completed a level* couldn't get more than 15 minutes of playing without getting bored* music is stupid* Do not even try with a keyboard, you must have a controller.Maybe if you are a harcore platformer adept you can get something out of this game, but i couldn't get into it.

												I rarely write reviews unless the game is either amazing or just utter obnoxius♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is not amazing. I like platformers and this is probably the worst I've played. I have to finish games so I couldn't stop playing but for the love of god it couldn't end fast enough.Let me just get the stuff I liked out of the way. The animation and the artstyle, Done. Now onto the stuff I disliked. Gameplay. First problem I had was the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design punishes you for using sprint unless the level design wants you to use it. It would♥♥♥♥♥♥me off to no end to die just because I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sprint or not. It would be fine if it was clear when you are and aren't supposed to, but since your jump distance is never consistant it's nearly impossible to tell. It just becomes a trial and error for every timed jump in the entire game. Oh, i guess I wasn't supposed to sprint before jumping there. Then you get sent back to the very beginning of that level. This brings me to my second problem, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ checkpoints. Oh man.  There were many, many times where a checkpoint should have been available, but there wouldn't be any, so there you go back to the start of really annoying sections running the damned things over and over until you do finally manage to  get through them.Also, after every single level you have to sit through some obnoxious, repetitive scene that just tally's up your score for the level. I know 30 seconds may not sound like much, but you'll want to skip it after the first few times you see it. But you won't, because you can't. Have fun with that.Overall, I did not enjoy the game one bit. Now I'm not even sure I want to play the next one, Rayman Legends, for fear of getting stuck having to beat it too.If you want a great platformer just go buy Ori and the Blind Forest (Definitive Edition would probably work best) and play that instead. One of the my favorite games of all time.			",406,77,11,46,23,0,39

Because they lowered the price of Rayman Legends by $10 & since it's Ubisoft & they're greedy little crap stains on the industry they probably decided they absolutely need that $10 extra dollars so why not just up the pricetag of the older game?

Rayman's slow speed means getting through a short level feels like forever, and this is doubled down with insta-skills whenever you touch an enemy or fall off the screen.

This is one of my top 5 favorite games of all time and brings back memories of solid platformers on the SNES with the added polish of today's AAA titles. I would have paid thirty dollars for this games soundtrack alone. If you are ever in a bad mood, this is the cure. It is the single happiest most fun filled game I've played in 15 years. Gameplaywise, it's flawless. Airtight controls, perfect dfficulty curve, challenging, and overall extremely rewarding. There isn't enough room allowed here for me to praise everything Ubisoft did right with this game so all I can say is this game deserves far more attention than it has gotten. It fell under the radar a bit when it was released but I haven't talked with a single person who has played this and didn't love it.			",289,43,13,25,39,6,49

												Hilarious fun for 1-4 players. This game isn't plagued by some of the annoying aspects of platformers like Mario. There is no timer except during an optional (but highly recommended) second level run during which you try to achieve a time goal. The lack of a timer allows you to explore as much as you like without feeling pressured. Also, one of the most annoying things about Mario games is absent from Rayman -- collision detection between players. In Mario, you feel forced to stay clear of your co-op partner as much as possible because bumping into him or accidentally jumping on his head (or visa versa) usually sends you flying uncontrollably to your death. In Rayman, there is no collision between players except when the players choose to boost each other or intentionally slap each other. There are no ""continues"" in Rayman.

												You don't have to be a plumber to star in a great platforming game! Rayman is living proof of this; Rayman Origins has to be the most inventive, most hilarious, and most ""feel-good"" game I've played in a long time, in any genre. This isn't a game you can just breeze through, either, since it's extremely challenging and will seriously put your platforming skills to the test, especially in its later half. And if you want to reach the very most definitely last world, you'll have to get all ten Skull Teeth from some of the most challenging and fast-paced sequences, which give Super Meat Boy a run for its money (which is a great thing).It has a large, phenominal soundtrack; a wacky sense of humor that doesn't feel forced at all; it controls like a dream; and its low system requirements mean that just about any computer can play it flawlessly while (also proving that demanding specs don't make good games). And on top of it, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous and shows just how lush and colorful hand-drawn graphics can be. Sure, it's not as cheap as other platformers on Steam, but trust me, except for the anti-climax at the end, it's worth every penny!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's impossible to feel any amount of negative emotion playing this. Downright beautiful to look at and simple to play. (But there's enough content and challenges for older/experienced players). The game is incredibly hard to use with KB+M though, so be sure to have a 360 controller around first.

												Finally rayman is back. With no stupid rabbids this time.This is a must-have to any platforming games fan out there and other people that are not-so into platforming should give it a shoot too. This game also has some of the tightest controls ever.I love the artistic value. The enviorments are so rich and there's so much going on. And it runs at solid 60 FPs. It's so much fun taking friends with you on the ride, i personally played through the entire with my friends using Xbox 360 controllers and it was so much fun.Of course there are some minor flaws like cheap enemy placement on shooter levels it happens rarely and shooting levels aren't even 2/10 of the game so aside from that everying is almost perfect.Last but not least it still have that nostolgic old rayman feel to it with the music, art and everything.9.5/10			",106,8,4,5,11,1,10

												It may not always be a muscular hero with a gun. Sometimes a guy like Rayman is enough.I was never a big fan of this game series. I have played neither the 2D nor the 3D platformer installments. By the time I realize what I must have missed all these years. If the predecessors are as ingenious as Raymann Origins, then I have much to catch up.The game is a brightly colored, insane action-platformer. Whether alone or with up to 4 players, you roll through the highly innovative game sections. Your main task is to collect wobbly stuff, fly through side scrolling sections and defeat sick bosses.The presentation is plain fun. Even after several hours of play, the eye doesn't get tired. And the soundtrack: LOL.One must simply love it! In any case, worth the money! Point deduction, because it's  from Ubisoft. ;-)7 out of 10 *			",2111,839,77,233,285,24,347

Instead, it was fantastic with my XBOX 360 controller for Windows.Graphics and sound are epic, really epic.Please don't focus on my bad english :)			",81,5,1,10,2,0,3

												I usually wait to the end of games to recommend them, but OMG I just love this game so much. From the frantic wall running, the insane cartoon graphics, down to the world design and the fact that it doesn't take itself that seriously. If you loved loose and crazy platformers post-Sonic and as far from the Mario formula as possible then Origins is exactly the game you want. Michael Ancel makes GREAT GAMES (read: Beyond Good and Evil) and jesus man he just nailed it with Rayman Origins. This is the most fun I've had in a game in a long time. Download the demo and see if my subjective and highly skewed recommendation beefs up to your own preconceptions. Wow, this game is great and exhilirating. Haven't felt this much speed since Sonic. 10/10 perfect and amazing.			",192,67,3,11,13,0,16

												Hilarious fun for 1-4 players. This game isn't plagued by some of the annoying aspects of platformers like Mario. There is no timer except during an optional (but highly recommended) second level run during which you try to achieve a time goal. The lack of a timer allows you to explore as much as you like without feeling pressured. Also, one of the most annoying things about Mario games is absent from Rayman -- collision detection between players. In Mario, you feel forced to stay clear of your co-op partner as much as possible because bumping into him or accidentally jumping on his head (or visa versa) usually sends you flying uncontrollably to your death. In Rayman, there is no collision between players except when the players choose to boost each other or intentionally slap each other. There are no ""continues"" in Rayman. You're not going to have to start the game over because you run out of them. If it takes you 10,000 lives to finish a level, then so be it.I had to restart several levels simply because I was laughing to hard to play. The game is downright hilarious, and the platforming is challenging without being irritating. 10/10			",260,66,3,41,26,3,44

												Knowing how bad Ubisoft PC ports usually are, I did not expect to like this game. Boy was I in for a surprise.The game is so much fun. Gameplay is your standard 2D platformer fare. You run and jump towards the end of the level, collecting yellow ""lums"" for a high score, and defeating enemies by jumping on their heads, or slapping them silly. Nothing out of the ordanary.What makes this game stand out is just how joyful and fun it is. The graphics have a beautiful hand-painted look that call back to the old hand drawn Disney films. Levels are all unique and colorful, with environments having distinct feels. The music is catchy, with a mix of orchestral symphonies, and western country banjo playing. Levels are difficult and may take a few tries, but are nothing compared to the unrelenting difficulty PC platformers like Meat Boy usually ask. But most of all, the game is just fun to play.TL;DR: This game is New Super Mario Brothers, but on the PC.			",373,103,14,29,27,5,55

												Pretty sweet action/platforming game.  You may think its going to be a crappy console port, but suprising it is very well made and does not suffer from consolization at all.  Don't let the cartoony graphics fool you, this game is not a kiddy adventure that holds your hand and lets you win.  Some of the levels are rediculously hard and several times I was at controller throwing levels of frustration.  In terms of difficulty its right up there with the best platformers.  The music is great and the animation really drives the games humor which is suttle, and never takes itself to seriously.  The biggest selling point is the game is HALF the price of the console version, and will probably go on sale in the future.  All around a good buy if you like old school 2D platformers.

While not having the dark themes the typical Rayman platformers have, Origins delivers some of the best platforming, music, level design, characters, and just all-around-fun I've played through in years. The PC port is solid as a rock and even supports gamepads. With 4 friends it's downright tragic how fun this gets. By yourself, expect to be tested as you navigate some of the most entertaining challenges you'll come across while you try to 100% this game. Good times all around.			",309,101,10,15,18,5,32

												An excellent 2D platformer.  The art and animation are stunning and the gameplay is everything you'd hope for from a new Rayman game.  Difficulty ranges from piece of cake to quite frustrating near the end of the game, though the hardest levels are optional.  It took me about 8 hours to beat the game, including the special ending which is longer than most $50-60 games these days.Quick summary:  Buy it!  You'll have lots of fun.			",862,202,24,72,69,9,114

												This is a sweet 2D platformer, handles well, has a nice difficulty curve, lots of levels, great music and nice artwork. Doesn't take itself too seriously and has 4 player local co-op, if you have enough controllers.			",372,91,17,28,36,0,34

												It's the best platformer that has come out in the last several years.It shows that it is a labor of love and dedication, the controls are superb and the graphics is in a unique pure 2D style that is very pleasing on the eyes. The music (and sound effects) in the game are a pleasure to listen to and makes the game much more fun to play. ",177,49,3,23,6,1,10

												A very fun game,though it will cause some frustration.It does have some issues. Like some slow-down from time to time, and pressing ""B"" and the character (s) do the down attack  after doing a smash attack.But that's fixed after jumping for a second.The graphics are eye candy for the eyes. (With extra sprinkles)The challenges are really amped up. Especially during the ""Tricky Treasure"" levels.I'd still reccomend this game despite all that, due to being a Rayman fan myself.

												One of the best 2d platformers I've played in years, and I wasn't even going into this with that high of expectations. Other than a few trial&error boss fights, this game does so many things right: very responsive and user-intuitive controls (which is the most important aspect of a platforming game), creative and fast-paced level designs that take advantage of those controls, and a steady, fair, and logical difficulty ramp that keeps increasing until end game. The music, art, and overall presentation also need honorable mentions - the game almost feels like interactive art in motion at times (screenshots and videos don't do it justice - gotta play it)note: played on a gamepad, don't know how the game is on a keyboard			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fun platformer for a reasonable priceI have played a couple of the previous Rayman games but only breifly and didn't find them particuarly engaging.I picked this one up during the holiday sale (2013) for fairly cheap because I thought it would be a good game to play with my 4 year old son. It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this great game. Wonderful animations, artwork and music all come together to make this one of the best 2D platformers I have had the pleasure of playing. The Co-op is also fantastic in that it allows a seasoned gamer play with a 4 year old and not get held up, in fact, the co-op is set up in such a way that having an inexperienced gamer can still assist in progressing through the game.Graphics:Graphically the game is flawless running at full HD and it runs great even on my work laptop with Intel graphics. The animations are smooth, artwork is amazing and the controls are responsive and natural.Sound:The game has a great sound track and the sounds are interesting and varied.Overall the game is great, the only issue I have is with the steam overlay, it is best to disable it in the game properties. If you bring up the overlay in game it can cause a player to join and run to the left which can be a real pain.			",323,50,45,18,23,2,41

I loved 100% this beast and there was never a dull moment. Big thanks to my little bro, Arty, for carrying me on his back during the tough segments and vice versa. 4 player offline, much fun, one of, if not, the best platformer to grace PC.

And local coop is a huge bonus.My only gripe would be that it CAN at times be difficult to judge the hitboxes of some enemies and other thingies.			",386,74,8,49,22,3,43

												One of the best sidescrolling platformers I've ever played, right on par with the greats on the SNES, if not better in some cases. If you played the very first Rayman game on the Playstation 1, you'll love this even more because it pays homage to that game in a very big way. The game is very challenging, especially in the latter half, but in a rewarding way. The level design is incredible and well-designed. When you play, it feels like you're playing a cartoon because of the really nice stylized visuals. The music is amazing as well. Definitely recommend this game!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rayman Origins is the best platformer game I've played since Super Mario Brothers. The game features an interesting mechanic that allows the player to create his own pace of the game. You could run from start to finish Sonic style, or you could take your time and collect everything, discover secret places and so on. I don't want to spoil it too much for you, so if you enjoy platformers, this game should NOT be missed.			",554,109,45,69,91,7,98

												I would've done unspeakable things to get a game like this when I was younger. It has solid platforming, and it looks and sounds lovely. Lovely is a good word to describe it, or maybe wonderful. After playing it for a few hours, it really failed to grab me in terms of gameplay. There have been so many indie platformers over the years that have done so many strange and interesting things in terms of gameplay mechanics and presentation that a gorgeous and excellently done big budget one that does absolutely nothing new in any way just feels kind of lacking, through no fault of its own. I really want to like it more, because it does so many things right and not really anything wrong, but it ends up being a great game that I just can't get into.			",499,202,15,84,46,6,86

												Apparently there is this game-breaking bug where you get back to the map and it just freezes and won't accept user input, and somehow this state gets SAVED so basically quitting and loading the save again just gets you frozen again, meaning all the hours of play I've put into this game so far have been thrown out the window. Normally I'd excuse this sort of thing, since I'm a dev myself and know that bugs are inevitable, but it appears that this critical game-breaking show-stopping bug has been known for YEARS and Ubisoft never bothered to do anything about it.TL;DR: If you buy this game, it's all but guaranteed that you won't get to finish it due to a bug.

												Rayman Origin is one of my favorite games. The art is gorgeous and the music is impressive. In general, this game is casual and suitable for players who are not good at action games. Certainly, skilled players can also find some tricky and challenging levels such as boss fight and time race.I recommand this game for some other reasons listed below:+ Multiplayer game has so much fun! This game supports up to 4 players to local co-op.+ This game is quite replayable. It is still interesting for you if you have played it through.+ No Uplay to bother your gaming experience.+ Control is simple and most players can master it after hours of game play.Some drawbacks are listed below:- No steam achievement and cloud. You have to manually backup saves.- Some minor bugs are not fixed for a long time. I remember there is a bug on one stage of Mountain World which may make you stuck on that level (You have to restart that level. Yes, this bug occurs at a relatively low probability).

												It's wonderful to see Rayman still kicking after all of these years. Each game directed by series creator Michel Ancel seems to bring something new and unique to the table. Rayman 1 has intense challenge, Rayman 2 has a dark story and atmosphere, and Rayman Origins features beautiful visuals, fluid controls and multiplayer co-operation. It's a non-stop ride from start to finish of classic platforming action. If you like platformers, you need to own this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's a fantastically fun game!There's no need to complain about the lack of a story simply because this game is emulating the good ol' days where it was just about the gameplay and fun and not necessarily about the story.Rayman Origins is a 2D platformer, and the control in this game is very smooth and responsive. The game boasts 60+ levels of awesomeness, and players get new powers from the nymphs as they go along. Yes, you have to win the power of punching and kicking. But that's a callback to the first game! And the third! The levels are differently themed. You will travel through jungles, oceans, mountains, frozen tundras, musical lands and even an infernal kitchen! The game is designed to be relatively easier to just get through, however the game does get a lot harder as you progress. Plus, the major challenge in the game comes from gathering the collectables. Electoons can be found in cages or won by collecting hundreds of Lums, which can be found scattered throughout the level, obtained from defeating enemies or finding Skull Coins. The Tricky Treasure levels provide the second-biggest challenge in the game, as they are frantic chase-the-chest levels where the stage pretty much falls apart even worse as you keep going, and you earn Skull Teeth from these. The boss fights are not as difficult as I expected them to be, but they still provide a good challenge. However, once you complete the game there are a few very interesting twists that I will not reveal. Play the game to find out. :P The hardest challenge, of course, comes from The Land of the Livid Dead, a level that is unlocked after gathering all 10 Skull Teeth.[EDIT: I have played this level, and GOSH DARN IT is it hard! I lost track of how many times I died just trying to complete one section of the stage, but it's a lot of fun, and worth it, too. :) ]But it all gets a lot zanier and crazier if you bring some buddies along! Up to four players can play this game at the same time. I've only done co-op with one friend at a time (I only had 2 PS3 controllers), but even that gets nutsy after a little while. The players have free reign to slap each other without directly hurting each other (however that won't stop you from accidentally launching your buddy off the cliff or into a trap). I have, however, done a whole bunch of friend co-op in the game's sequel, Rayman Legends, and if that mayhem was any indication, you're gonna have a great time with this one!The Windows/OS X port was done pretty well. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't appear to be optimized TOO well, as occasionally it will skip a frame or two. It's nothing terrible, but to me, it's noticeable.Now, people may want to draw parallels to Legends. Is it better? Well... To be honest, I found Legends to be a little too easy. Origins packs more of a challenge from what I could see, and, honestly, I kinda prefer the cartoony art over the more realistic rendering of Legends. And it had an anti-climatic ending that wasn't funny like this on--In fact, screw it. This game is miles better than Rayman Legends. To be fair, Legends has more content, but something just feels...off about that game compared to this one. This game has lots of character, bright environments, upbeat and fantastic music and, well, the entire game is amazing!If you love platformers and/or Rayman, GET THIS GAME. You will NOT be disappointed! As you can see, I had no problem buying another copy of this game, so even if you have this game on a console already, get it for Steam.			",24,0,1,0,1,0,1

												Rayman Origins blew my socks off. There really isn't anything bad about this game- it's challenging without being unfair, the visuals are some of the best I've ever seen, the sound, music and atmosphere are all utterly unique and delightful, and overall it just carries this feeling of pure video-gamey fun that is becoming increasingly sparse nowadays.Maybe the co-op is a bit dodgy, but even then there's plenty of fun to be had.Even the water levels are fun. EVEN THE WATER LEVELS. That's how you know it's good.			",279,90,3,13,21,3,11

												Rayman Origins could very well be the ultimate 2D platformer. Fantastic graphics that ooze with charm, with a soundtrack to match them, Rayman's world feels rich and completely developed. The learning curve is rather fair too, and ends up being a devilish challenge that avoids rage quit with plentiful checkpoints.Such a shame that despite perfect execution on the game part, there is literally no story here. Im not expecting something deep or meaningful, it's Rayman after all. But from the developer or Beyond good and evil, how hard would it have been to throw in a similar whimsical story that propels the action along. Would have been a perfect 10/10 if it had that, but as it stands a very solid 8/10.			",717,264,22,74,58,6,80

												Beautiful art, hilarious animations, creative/bizarre characters, wonderful musical score, and some very rewarding gameplay.  Rayman: Origins is a fantastic platformer for all ages.  Combine Mario, Sonic, Donkey Kong, and Mega Man, add in some new elements and you have a truly memorable experience.  Replay value is high as you will be challenged in time trials, collection quests, as well as simply trying to beat a map with the most ""lums"" possible.  Gameplay is smooth, graphics are gorgeous, and I frequently find myself humming one of the many tracks from this incredible game.  Oh, did I mention it has co-op, that's even better!

												This is, by far, my favorite platformer of all time, and one of my all time favorite games. This game's charming visuals, soundtrack, characters, and overall package are a staggering achievement. I prefer Rayman Origins over any mario game I've ever played. Its sequal, Rayman Legends, comes in a close second. Plenty of content, a whole wealth of wonky and fantastic worlds to explore, and a seemingly endless barrage of moments that just make you grin from ear to ear, this is a wonderful game. And the later levels are very challenging, so it doesn't feel like you breeze through the game. The later Tricky Treasure levels are extremely demanding, but they're challenge levels, so it's okay, and I loved them all the same! Same goes for... well, you'll have to find out for yourself! Instant buy, would buy again.			",56,5,1,1,1,0,3

												This is one of the most charming and fun game I have has the pleasure to play in a long time.  Colorful art work and graphics compliment this great platformer well.  Very tight gameplay mechanics.  Any fan of platformers would enjoy this game.  The level design is so obscure and unique.  It has a flow and speed to it that will attract any old school gamer.  Since Mario isn't available on PC (legally) Rayman is by far one of the best platformers availble on Steam. 9/10			",113,15,0,10,7,0,2

												As an avid Rayman player who played every single PC-installment, as well as the first two Raving Rabbids-games, this game made me almost cry tears of nostalgia.This game has everything, and I repeat, EVERYTHING you want from a 2D-Rayman-game. - The artstyle is unlike anything you have seen in any of the previous installments, yet it naturally fits into Rayman's world. - The music does an amazing job of reinforcing the feel the worlds give you upon your first impression- The difficulty of the game is never too easy and rises drastically in the end, with the last world being a serious challenge for every Jump n Run-fan- The humor is fantastic and, again, fits perfectly in the game without being awkward/repelling at all.Any old Rayman fans who were sceptical should definitely buy this game (and probably Rayman Legends as well, while they're at it), because this is the most fun I've had in ages playing a 2D-JnR-game. Definitely worth every cent!			",154,55,4,27,11,0,21

It is also perfect for friends if you're into platform games. I consider Origins significantly better than Rayman Legends, good for you who are reading this review because it's cheaper. Ok maybe you won't have the internet challenges or whatever, but it is simply more immersive (this is usually my main criterion for judging a game: to I get into it. As far as this game is concerned I do: it's beautiful, great music, very good gameplay, the hours will fly and you will lift your eyes from your computer wondering why it is suddenly dark outside).

												I want to start by saying that if your are seeking in this game for something like Rayman 2 : The Great Escape, you WILL be dissapointed. The older, darker Raymans are not to be seen in this colorful and joyful game. Rayman Origins is not a bad game, it's just not at all the same style as the old ones.Pros : It is easy to play, you can choose your own character, the graphics are awesome and the music is so gorgeous it is near absurd. Cons : There is not so many challegings levels to beat, 90% of them are quite easy. You have to farm as **** to unlock the endgame content, which I really didn't like too much.I do recommend this game nontheless.			",248,72,2,17,9,2,21

												Holy crap this game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun! There's no online co-op, but it really doesn't matter. Everything is perfectly achievable in single player. Thanks to not having a lives system, what would otherwise be incredibly frustrating levels are actually a reasonable challenge.  The game is fast, it's weird, it's challenging, and most of all it's fun. A must buy!			",93,4,0,13,8,0,3

												I'm a huge fan of 2D platformers, and Rayman Origins is one of the best I've played in years. It's right up there with Super Mario World and DKC Returns. The addition of 4-player co-op just serves to make the game even more fun with more people. The level design is brilliant and challenging. Though you are given unlimited lives, the game manages to have some challenging moments, even for a platforming veteran. While challenging, the game never feels unfair. When you die, you feel as though it was your fault.The graphics, while not technically spectacular are impressive. The little details you can see help to make every moment look incredible.Plus they finally pulled off underwater stages without feeling slow.			",104,8,3,3,3,1,13

												Hilarious fun for 1-4 players. This game isn't plagued by some of the annoying aspects of platformers like Mario. There is no timer except during an optional (but highly recommended) second level run during which you try to achieve a time goal. The lack of a timer allows you to explore as much as you like without feeling pressured. Also, one of the most annoying things about Mario games is absent from Rayman -- collision detection between players. In Mario, you feel forced to stay clear of your co-op partner as much as possible because bumping into him or accidentally jumping on his head (or visa versa) usually sends you flying uncontrollably to your death. In Rayman, there is no collision between players except when the players choose to boost each other or intentionally slap each other. There are no ""continues"" in Rayman. You're not going to have to start the game over because you run out of them. If it takes you 10,000 lives to finish a level, then so be it.I had to restart several levels simply because I was laughing to hard to play. The game is downright hilarious, and the platforming is challenging without being irritating. 10/10			",260,66,3,41,26,3,44

												Rayman Origins revives a character we have maybe not actively seen in games for some time now. When I was growing up, Rayman was my absolute hero. I will never forget Rayman 3, and Rayman 2, where colourful characters came to life and took me on amazing adventures. Rayman Origins however goes back to old, old Rayman games, in which the character is barely larger than a pen and often finds himself dodging household utensiles. Rayman as a character is a colourful little guy without arms or legs, who can make a helicopter out of his hair and traditionally throws his fist at enemies. He is often assosciated with his best friend Globox, a blue frog who loves to dance raindances.Rayman Origins creates a beautifully colourful world, with fun music and great level design. The art in this game is absolutely amazing, and it all comes together in such a delightfully colourful way that it is a real joy to play through the levels. It is also notable that Rayman Origins is a very quick paced jump'n'run, and when you find yourself used to the completely adaptable controls, you can go through a level with great momentum, never really stopping for anything. This makes the levels even more fun, as once you replay them and get the hang of them, you can just glide through them, reminding me very much of the old slide levels. The game is quite replayable (as I just noticed myself by returning to the game after some time). You can free 5 Lums in every level, and whilst it is not necessary for game completion to get all these Lums, you can unlock new stuff and further levels by getting them all. It is therefore worthwhile to repeat older levels and look cloer for the cages of the Lums, or collect more points throughout every game.There is not much of a story to the game, as expected maybe of a simple jump and run game, but generally the characters are charming and the environment is so friendly and vibrant that the story is not so much necessary.My only gripe with the game is, that, as a longtime rayman fan, i find myself not recognizing the main character very much. To me, Rayman had always made a friendly, confident, cool expression, where as in Rayman Origins he very much becomes a tongue-stuck-out crazy silly kind of guy.The game goes for a very silly reprensetation of the characters, which is certainly fun in the general feel of the game.What is completely missing however is Rayman's traditional fist throwing mechanic. This came as a disappointment to me because I was so used to using this special,personal technique in most of his other games. Rayman no longer throws fists, instead he kind of just slaps his enemies, or tornadoes through them, or kicks them, or stamps them, which is all very fun, but I miss his trademark technique. Overall I can absolutely recommend this game. If you can ever get it in a sale and maybe get it for a bit cheaper, it is definitly worth it. Lovely Art, lovely Music, fun and unique level design, charming characters, definitly replayable, even if you dont have a lot of time on your hand. Quick paced and lively. Whilst it is not the continuation of the rayman franchise that I had maybe hoped for, it is certainly a great Jump'n'run more like the very old original rayman games. ",41,56,0,9,3,2,2

												For the longest time, I felt rather odd around this game. I never bothered to buy this rather affordable title for years since it came out, and despite its popularity, I just didn't feel like getting it for some reason. Then one day, a sale came around, and as I was looking around for bargins, I came across this title for a nice little price. I was torn between a few other titles I wanted, but then I decided to get out of my comfort zone and try something I never was too interested in. Turns out it was worth it, even if it ticked me off near the end.In an age full of mindless shooters, zombie surviver deathmatches, and ""retro"" games that hardly feel retro and more lazy in the art department, Rayman Origins is a game that shows us that you don't need any of that rubbish to be a good game. You can be a 2D platformer and still look good at the same time, and best of all, it has difficulty that scales with the levels, so the further you go, the harder things get. None of that so called ""hardcore"" platforming crap where they claim they designed the levels poorly intentionally. Ranting aside, this truely is a nice return to form for Rayman, even if the story is rather confusing and the gameplay, while it starts out fun and simple at first, soon gets really hard and demanding as more mechanics come into play, sometimes to the point that you die over and over again at a single point of the game until you either master it or get lucky.. But thankfully, there are plenty of save points, so it at least reduces the frustration, even near the end of the game.Now, the game isn't perfect, sure. As I said earlier, sometimes you'll come across levels that'll kick you in the balls over and over again, turning your happy little mood into a mood of pure annoyance, if not rage due to the near-percise actions needed for some parts of the game (as one person noted, it is almost like a quick time event, but without the ""Press x to not die"" system in place). However, as♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off as I would get at these levels, I still powered through, and even if you couldn't, the game will allow you to skip some levels if they prove too hard for some players, which is a kind gesture I suppose, if sometimes insulting. In short, while I don't recommend this to casual gamers, those looking for a real, honest challenge might find this a lovely title to invest in. And best of all, you can play with your friends, should you have any, which might make the game easier or harder, depending on if your friends are jerks or not.			",101,10,3,2,12,2,15

												One of the best platformers to have come out in a long time.  To just finish all the levels will take you about ten hours, and the difficulty curve is fairly natural until the last world, when it spikes dramatically.  Aside from that though, a soothing soundtrack and characters speaking in Pig Latin just makes the game fun and enjoyable.Easily worth it for $30.			",326,85,12,17,26,2,41

Control is good and feels good, the visual style and design is gorgeous, character animation is out of this world and the music is probably the best thing I've heard in a videogame. Plays at its absolute best with 4 players but is also enjoyable solo, although not as much. Try to have at least one friend to play the game with.This game is so pretty you'll vomit rainbows.

												Simple to say, Rayman Origins is immensely fun if you've even the slightest nostalgia for the days of 2d platformers. The game doesn't take itself seriously in any regard and seems to exist for the sole reason of entertaining and challenging you, as the gameplay itself is surprisingly challenging for such a lighthearted game.A final mention would be that it has one of the best OST's I've had the privalege of listening to. Rayman truly is a joy to play through and has left me grinning like a madman more times than I can count.Highly Recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played a Rayman game since the original on the PlayStation 1. Well enough nostalgia, if you're looking for  a fun platformer, then you've found it. The story is so wacky I don't even know how to begin to describe it, the levels are fun even if some of the harder levels can drive you crazy, and if that isn't enough you can invite 3 of your friends to go through the game via local co-op.  It a must buy for any platformer fan out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												OK from ALL the games I've played. this a game that should have its own hall of fame! This game restores the pride and glory of what games used to be! The amount of unlockables also suprised me! Gaming DOES NOT! get any better than this tons of fun and a game that brings back childhood memories from Rayman. For all those who played Rayman(1) on the PS1 or even the first 3D rayman WILLL LOVE THIS.This game actually made me cry. Games should become fun like these again. This is also a very simple minded game. PERFECT for liltle kids. It feels like playing a TV cartoon.Ubisoft & UBlart Montpellier you both deserve a medal for this!

												1 thing I like the most:The look of the game. Very smooth and fluid, with gorgeous animation and design to the characters and environments.1 thing I dislike the most:The shmup levels. Very cluttered, probably too much, and with no surefire way to keep your eyes on your charcter with multiple enemies and players all over the place. They are seemingly the longest type of level, and though they are by far the easiest the medals for (there's 3 for each level instead of the standard 6), I feel like there's not enough checkpoint spread throughout all that length.   1 feature I would want added:Simply being able to switch costumes with a menu during the world map screen, instead of having to enter a costume/rest area, which you can't exit immediately. You have to go to the far end of the last room to get to the exit door. Can get people who change outfits regularly ever slightly so annoyed.      1 feature I would want taken out:The ""coin collected"" type medals. Makes completing every level with all medals tedious; I gave up after realizing I wasn't having fun. Replace with a ""beat the level without dying"" challenge or something; you'll still be restarting, just a whole lot less.What I want improved:The Boss fights. A mixed bag, really. Some play fine, while others will have you die cheap deaths. There's one underwater boss (the best kind, am I right?) in particular I hate with a passion. Finger(s): 1 thumb up (and a half) out of 3 ""Pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of platformers that chase after the perfection that is Mario,but I like the challenge that this game poses. Needs some fixes in my opinion.Yours might be different though""			",49,1,6,2,0,0,0

												This is, by far, my favorite platformer of all time, and one of my all time favorite games. This game's charming visuals, soundtrack, characters, and overall package are a staggering achievement. I prefer Rayman Origins over any mario game I've ever played. Its sequal, Rayman Legends, comes in a close second. Plenty of content, a whole wealth of wonky and fantastic worlds to explore, and a seemingly endless barrage of moments that just make you grin from ear to ear, this is a wonderful game. And the later levels are very challenging, so it doesn't feel like you breeze through the game. The later Tricky Treasure levels are extremely demanding, but they're challenge levels, so it's okay, and I loved them all the same! Same goes for... well, you'll have to find out for yourself! Instant buy, would buy again.			",56,5,1,1,1,0,3

												A masterpiece from the geniuses at Ubisoft Montpellier, Rayman Origins boasts a gorgeous art style, slick controls, clever level design and a fantastic soundtrack. While the story's as barebones as it gets (you're a limbless guy and/or his friends! go kill some evil♥♥♥♥♥♥) everything else about the game more than makes up for that. Origins may not quite match the standards of platformers of years past, but it does a damn good job of modernizing the genre and giving it a quirky appeal that a lot of games lack today in general.Overall, probably one of the best games I've played, and the main reason I fell in love with the entire series.

Instead, it was fantastic with my XBOX 360 controller for Windows.Graphics and sound are epic, really epic.Please don't focus on my bad english :)			",81,5,1,10,2,0,3

												If you ever enjoyed a 2D Sonic, Mario, or any game like them you will undoubtly enjoy this game. Its game design really lends to an excellent learning curve that is easy in the beginning, but becoming challenging in the end without being overwhelming. The best part is you can enjoy the game with others in local co-op, but I suggest no more than two people. Sadly your save files are currently incompatible between the pc and mac versions. If you are on the fance on getting this I highly suggest giving it a go.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Delightful is what I'd use if I had to sum this game up in one word.It's an old school sidescroller with a lot of modern day polish. For example, the difficulty is extremely well balanced. Most levels are simple enough for a child to get through, yet only the most hardcore players will be able to collect enough Lums (the game's version of coins) to get medals in each level without a lot of deaths. But that's okay, because dying in this game is relatively painless. There are no lives to lose, and the game will place you in the beginning of the section you were in nearly instantly (possibly taking a cue from Super Meat Boy?)The art is gorgeous, the animation is smooth, and it has good controller support. The only negative I can think of is the lack of online multiplayer. But that's a tiny negative in a sea of positives.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Proof positive that 2d platformers are not dead. For this, we can all rejoice. As the name implies, Rayman Origins is a return to its roots. While not nearly as difficult as the original Rayman (which is good, I guess?), Origins forsakes the rabbits and the minigames and gives you 20 hours of good old-fashioned running and jumping. Toss in the cartoonish look and feel, and you're looking at a lighthearted nostalgia trip. Didn't have a childhood? That's okay! Rayman Origins can help you get started. Get it on sale, though. Not a lot of replay value, unless you want to play it again with a friend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A truly amazing game, both in terms of gameplay and graphics. A modern take on the classic Rayman gameplay, and still as funny as ever. You can choose from a wide variety of characters (only 4 when first starting) and play through platforming levels, from classic Rayman lum collecting-helicopter hair flying sidescrolling to other twists, such as controlling a mosquito that can suck in enemies and shoot them back out as you attempt to reach the end of the level, all to save those sexy fairy-nymph things. This is definitely one of the best platformers and also one of the best local multiplayer games Steam has to offer, and I highly recommend it. 9.5/10			",109,19,3,6,5,3,3

												Fun platformer for a reasonable priceI have played a couple of the previous Rayman games but only breifly and didn't find them particuarly engaging.I picked this one up during the holiday sale (2013) for fairly cheap because I thought it would be a good game to play with my 4 year old son. It didn't take long for me to get hooked on this great game. Wonderful animations, artwork and music all come together to make this one of the best 2D platformers I have had the pleasure of playing. The Co-op is also fantastic in that it allows a seasoned gamer play with a 4 year old and not get held up, in fact, the co-op is set up in such a way that having an inexperienced gamer can still assist in progressing through the game.Graphics:Graphically the game is flawless running at full HD and it runs great even on my work laptop with Intel graphics. The animations are smooth, artwork is amazing and the controls are responsive and natural.Sound:The game has a great sound track and the sounds are interesting and varied.Overall the game is great, the only issue I have is with the steam overlay, it is best to disable it in the game properties. If you bring up the overlay in game it can cause a player to join and run to the left which can be a real pain.			",323,50,45,18,23,2,41

The game doesn't take itself seriously in any regard and seems to exist for the sole reason of entertaining and challenging you, as the gameplay itself is surprisingly challenging for such a lighthearted game.A final mention would be that it has one of the best OST's I've had the privalege of listening to.

The level design is excellent. It has a good level of difficulty that ramps up as the game progresses and the vast number of collectibles and challenges are a completionist's dream. And did I mention how unbelievably beautiful it is? The lack of online co-op is only slightly disappointing and not nearly enough to detract from the overall package.As good a game as I've played all year. Pure 2D platforming bliss.

												This is, by far, my favorite platformer of all time, and one of my all time favorite games. This game's charming visuals, soundtrack, characters, and overall package are a staggering achievement. I prefer Rayman Origins over any mario game I've ever played. Its sequal, Rayman Legends, comes in a close second. Plenty of content, a whole wealth of wonky and fantastic worlds to explore, and a seemingly endless barrage of moments that just make you grin from ear to ear, this is a wonderful game. And the later levels are very challenging, so it doesn't feel like you breeze through the game. The later Tricky Treasure levels are extremely demanding, but they're challenge levels, so it's okay, and I loved them all the same! Same goes for... well, you'll have to find out for yourself!

												An incredibly solid platformer. Smooth, challenging, and utterly worthwhile. Rayman Origins, unlike most of the games in the series, is in touch with its roots, and recovers the same qualities that made the original Rayman such an excellent game. On the other hand, it isn't trapped in the past - this is no mere nostalgia trip, but its own distinct thing with its own unique playstyle and art style. It's not quite as expansive as the original Rayman, but still rewards exploration. and offers multiple objectives in a given level to make multiple playthroughs worthwhile.Skill-wise,it gets reasonably tricky in the later levels, approaching Super Meat Boy in terms of difficulty. The level design has an excellent sense of flow. It's also pretty imaginitive, and evokes the feel of the original game's setting without copying it. The only criticism I have is that it feels very slightly unfinished in places - missing animations, boss fights that are a bit shorter than expected, a somewhat abrupt ending. Nothing that really hurts the game, one just feels that they could have given it another month or so of polish before release and it wouldn't have been a bad idea. If you're looking for a platformer, this is an excellent choice! (They have the original on GoG.com, too - go check that out if you've never played it!)			",183,86,0,18,12,2,23

												Funny with Great designs on levels and enviroments. Lack of bugs, glitches and low framerate but the bad thing is no online multiplayer and there is lack of skins for Rayman and Globox			",71,13,4,7,2,2,3

												My absolute favorite platformer of all time. It's full of beautiful and amazing art and animation, fast action-packed fun and alot of humour. On top of all of this it allows up to four player coop!			",141,26,12,14,11,1,30

												This is easily one of the best local co-op games on Steam. It's absolutely a joy to play. The animations are art are incredible, and you can't help but smile when you play this game. It just oozes character. The game itself is easy to get through, but there's a lot of challenges in there that will test even experienced players.			",320,112,2,32,22,4,30

												I want to start by saying that if your are seeking in this game for something like Rayman 2 : The Great Escape, you WILL be dissapointed. The older, darker Raymans are not to be seen in this colorful and joyful game. Rayman Origins is not a bad game, it's just not at all the same style as the old ones.Pros : It is easy to play, you can choose your own character, the graphics are awesome and the music is so gorgeous it is near absurd. Cons : There is not so many challegings levels to beat, 90% of them are quite easy. You have to farm as **** to unlock the endgame content, which I really didn't like too much.I do recommend this game nontheless.			",248,72,2,17,9,2,21

												Very fun game with a lot of humour. Although I haven't got many hours on Steam, I grew up playing Rayman on Playstation and remember how fun it as then. Great game very funny love the art, animations, story :)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A 2D platformer that really does justice to the legacies of Mario and Sonic in a fantastically colorful well-animated and fun world. Lots of creative ideas and means of keeping platforming thoughtful yet hectic; slide, shrink, swim, smash, bounce, and run through some truely inventive (and occasionally devious) levels. Gotta catch all those lums!			",308,60,5,30,20,1,36

												OK from ALL the games I've played. this a game that should have its own hall of fame! This game restores the pride and glory of what games used to be! The amount of unlockables also suprised me! Gaming DOES NOT! get any better than this tons of fun and a game that brings back childhood memories from Rayman. For all those who played Rayman(1) on the PS1 or even the first 3D rayman WILLL LOVE THIS.This game actually made me cry. Games should become fun like these again. This is also a very simple minded game. PERFECT for liltle kids. It feels like playing a TV cartoon.Ubisoft & UBlart Montpellier you both deserve a medal for this! THX FOR RESTORING RAYMAN TO ITS FORMER SELF!<3 Ubisoft <3 Rayman <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I haven't played a Rayman game since the original on the PlayStation 1. Well enough nostalgia, if you're looking for  a fun platformer, then you've found it. The story is so wacky I don't even know how to begin to describe it, the levels are fun even if some of the harder levels can drive you crazy, and if that isn't enough you can invite 3 of your friends to go through the game via local co-op.  It a must buy for any platformer fan out there.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1 thing I like the most:The look of the game. Very smooth and fluid, with gorgeous animation and design to the characters and environments.1 thing I dislike the most:The shmup levels. Very cluttered, probably too much, and with no surefire way to keep your eyes on your charcter with multiple enemies and players all over the place. They are seemingly the longest type of level, and though they are by far the easiest the medals for (there's 3 for each level instead of the standard 6), I feel like there's not enough checkpoint spread throughout all that length.   1 feature I would want added:Simply being able to switch costumes with a menu during the world map screen, instead of having to enter a costume/rest area, which you can't exit immediately. You have to go to the far end of the last room to get to the exit door. Can get people who change outfits regularly ever slightly so annoyed.      1 feature I would want taken out:The ""coin collected"" type medals. Makes completing every level with all medals tedious; I gave up after realizing I wasn't having fun. Replace with a ""beat the level without dying"" challenge or something; you'll still be restarting, just a whole lot less.What I want improved:The Boss fights. A mixed bag, really. Some play fine, while others will have you die cheap deaths. There's one underwater boss (the best kind, am I right?) in particular I hate with a passion. Finger(s): 1 thumb up (and a half) out of 3 ""Pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of platformers that chase after the perfection that is Mario,but I like the challenge that this game poses. Needs some fixes in my opinion.Yours might be different though""			",49,1,6,2,0,0,0
