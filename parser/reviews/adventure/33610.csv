""A hand was going to come out of the water and catch the sword? Get real, George!"" - Nico CollardFrom year 2003, the third instalment of the series, Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon makes a radical change of presentation by carrying our beloved protagonists to 3D! Yup, it's the start of the millennium and 3D adventure games are big at the time. Knights Templar, Slavic assassins, medieval conspiracies and much more for us to enjoy in 3D this time. Expectedly, this change comes with a whole new set of game mechanics too. Not to worry though! The setting, the environment and the tone of the game are trademark George & Nico quality, alright!Following the events of the previous game, George goes back to his life as a patent lawyer and finds himself flying to the Congo to meet a scientist who claims that his machine can produce limitless energy. However, the plane crashes during a storm and George barely saves his hide. He takes a walk to meet the scientist, and yet again, finds himself in a conspiracy involving - wait for it - Templars! Meanwhile, Nico, still working for her paper, is called to interview a hacker who claims that he cracked Voynich manuscript and warns hectically about an ""end of the world"" scenario. Going to meet the guy, Nico finds him dead - of course - and gets attacked by the assassin who was impersonating her! As sure as the careful hands of fate would deem so, they again get together to solve the mystery, save the world and beat some Templar♥♥♥♥♥while doing so.In this adventure to come, we will meet new faces and encounter some familiar ones from previous games, going on another adventure that would rally us around the globe. That's one thing that I love about Broken Sword games. You get to visit countless different locations with different cultures and get introduced to anecdotes from their local lore. Yet, somehow, all those seemingly irrelevant details come together to paint a bigger picture. Its Indiana Jones meets Dan Brown every time. Humor is spot on also, this time relying on both folklore narrative and sexual innuendo a bit more than usual. One other thing is that we are capable of observing George and Nico's relationship growth based on their mutual history, growing inner jokes and references to previous games. Both George and Nico are just as you remember them: a lovable, smart♥♥♥♥♥Yankee with a law degree and an ambitious, pretty reporter with a sharp tongue.Let's get to the obvious change then, shall we? Our good old 2D P&C environment is no more. Now we have 3D cartoon renderings of our beloved characters and there is no ""clicking"" on the literal sense. Yup, mouse is pretty much useless in this instalment. All interactions are controlled from the keyboard, including item selection and movement - which is kinda okay. What would be a real drag is cameras. They change into pretty obscure point of views without warning, and it can become hellishly nasty if you are on a chasing scene. Oh, yes, we are also introduced with QTEs - quick time events - in this game. There will come some cinematic sequences in which you'll be asked to respond in a timely fashion by hitting the right button. Cute, huh? There aren't as many puzzles compared to previous games though, but the ones that we encounter are satisfying enough. Another newly introduced element is Sokoban games - a.k.a. box pushing puzzles. The game is riddled with them. They all are pretty easy, but mostly time consuming. You won't miss them when you finish the game.All things aside, Broken Sword 3 - the Sleeping Dragon is a neat little adventure game, even though it is slightly subpar in means of mechanics and brain scratching compared to previous titles. Its worthy of an experience for the jokes, the story and character interactions to begin with. Go ahead, play the game. You know you want to. It's George and Nico, and they are at another incredible adventure. It cannot be bad anyhow.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!			",353,799,0,204,86,0,63

												When I first played this game, I hated it. I loved the 2D animation and the point and click interface of the first two Broken Sword games. This was so different that the experience was almost ruined for me. I'm glad I saw it through, because this is a great game. We still have the George and Nico that we have loved from the previous games (same voice actors and a great script) and the story is great, stemming back to the first Broken Sword game. The 3D is decent, with some awesome set pieces, and the rest being average. The controls can take a bit to get used to, and may turn off a lot of people. A point and click adventure has turned into an only use your keyboard adventure. That was difficult for me to swallow at first. For the most part, the puzzles are pretty good.....except....for all...the BOXES!! There were way too many move-the-box puzzles. One here or there isn't a sin, but the amount in here makes them feel like filler, as if the game needed to be longer. I don't think the game would have suffered had they removed some of these tedious box puzzles. A minor complaint is that there are moments in the game in which you have just moments to react, and you have to press the right button to avoid death. It kind of kills when the button doesn't appear till after you die. Luckily, the game loads right back to the perilous situation and you now know what button to push. This doesn't happen often though, so it is a minor annoyance.  This game will probably not be considered as good as the first two, but it is definitely still worth playing. There is enough Broken Sword goodness to soften the leap from 2D to 3D adventure.			",114,169,0,22,10,3,18

												Even though Broken Sword 3 departed from the point-and-click 2D adventure, I am trying to be open-minded and not afraid of changes, when it comes to games that I literally grew up with.But in general:+ Good story, nice dialogues;+ The characters remain faithful to the first two games;+ More cut-scenes than the previous 2 games;+ You get to play with George and Nico equal time;+ The character animations feel quite much human.- They could've made the ending a bit more satisfying; - TOO MUCH ♥♥♥♥ING MILLION-KILOMETERS-OF-CRATE-PUSHING ""PUZZLES""!- No, seriously. DO NOT PUT CRATE PUSHING PUZZLES IN YOUR GAME! EVER! If I wanted to play a game that you push crates, that game should not be named ""Broken Sword"".Anyway, this game is pretty much enjoyable and I recommend it. But only after you finished the first 2 Broken Sword games.			",70,33,2,2,8,2,8

												Broken Sword 3 is host to some big problems that unfortunately overshadows a lot of the good aspects of the game. Just like the previous Broken Sword games, the story is decent though not special. The dialogue and voice acting is definitely one of the strongest aspects of the series, and BS 3 has that too. Most of the puzzles range from okay to pretty interesting.However, the controls are an unholy collection of awful and rubbish. They suck, they suck in every way possible. Combine the bad controls with the terrible camera and you got a special kind of awful. The camera uses weird angels and it switches them constantly. CONSTANTLY. It jumps back and forth, sometimes as much as five times in a few ""meters"" of road. It's enough to make you seasick... and it causes you to run the wrong way since what was one direction a second ago is suddenly the opposite direction or sideways. It also prevents you from seeing the things you wish to see.Maybe it is easier to play on a controller, but as far as I can tell there is no way to do so. The move to 3D really did not help this game in any way. The visuals look dated compared to the other two older games. The controls and camera are, as I said, horrific. To the puzzles it has apparently only added crate/block dragging and hidden climb points. The block puzzles are unfortunately uninspired and the hidden climb points are either obvious or frustrating. It has, however, added a bunch of empty space that you have to transverse, filled with an endless supply of locked doors that you can for some reason try to open, look at and listen to. It is a frustrating test of patience. It adds nothing to the puzzles when five endless corridors still only contain one object and one place to use it. It does not make the world feel larger and more alive, it just creates even more space you have to get through with your bad controls and camera.Then we have the fact that you can't skip dialogue or cutscenes. Which is going to be a problem considering BS3, like all adventure games, encourage interacting with objects numerous times... which means that it sure would be nice to be able to skip past having to hear them say they can't open the door for the thousands time until you find the door you ARE supposed to open. Not being able to skip cutscenes is even worse since they had decided to match almost every cutscene with either quick time events or chases... and if you miss you die... and if you die... YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE WHOLE FREAKING CUTSCENE AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN. It's a shame, because underneath it all is a pretty nice adventure game. The problem is that the amount of frustration you have to go through to get to the good parts is just not worth it. The only reason I played to the end is stubborness. There are good moments, but the only way I can recommend this game is if you have a high tolerance for bad controls, bad cameras, watching the same cutscenes over and over again, and just generally feel like the game is wasting your time for no good reason.

												NOT recommended, unless you're a completionist ...and want to torture yourself.This is a non-point & click Broken Sword game. The controls are really wonky, even after adjusting them to the typical WASD setup.You waste a lot of time on box puzzles, as others have mentioned. The ""stealth"" sections are extremely tedious, frustrating, and don't add to the story.There were two points in the game that really drove me crazy. At one point, while dungeon-crawling, I missed an item at the very beginning. Yep, you guessed it, no way to backtrack! I had to grab a save file to continue. Secondly, there was a puzzle that required you to check your notes. That was the ONLY time I found myself having to look at the notebook, so it was the furthest thing from my mind!The dialogue and videos are NOT skippable, so have fun if you have to repeat sections because you missed your window of opportunity to not be killed. Those windows of opportunity involve paying attention to the action buttons and pressing it when required. Most of the time, I was too involved watching what was happening in the video only to realize I had died, because I didn't see the action pop up. Sigh.And the ending... boss fight, really? Another pointless section!Not sure what they were thinking with this game compared to 1 & 2 (which I enjoyed), but I was quite pleased when it ended... That says something.			",82,158,0,13,6,0,5

												Not as good as 1 & 2 and the controls can be pretty awkward at times.  Quite a few box puzzles, which are more time consuming than difficult.  The worst parts are the 'sneaking' sections which highlight poor controls and some odd camera angles which often lead to multiple attempts to get past them.Also having moved away from the cartoon graphics of 1 & 2 this one hasn't aged quite as well.I'd still recommend the game if you have played  1 & 2 and liked them.  It's still good fun and humorous, enjoyed playing through. ",8,26,1,1,8,0,1

												Having finished Broken Sword 1 and 2 I decided to immediatly play Broken Sword 3 expecting the same quality as before....sadly this was not the case. This game takes everything great from the past 2 games and completely ignores it. The Bad:- This game came out roughly 10 years after the first game and has aged worse than the previous games. This is what happens when you focus on technical graphics over art style. Gone is the cartoonish look and animations replaced with a more realistic look that doesn't even come close to holding up in modern times. Obviously a decade old game isn't going to look good compared to modern times but when the game is harder to look at than the previous games, you know you have a problem. -The areas in this game feel so lifeless and soulless. All the charm has been lost. Every area is devoid of anything and now that you have to manually control your character it feels even emptier than before. I remember areas from the first two games that felt vibrant filled with people and unique locations. This game, every area feels the same. The feeling of being on an exotic adventure is gone. - The game suffers with poor controls and camera angles. - Designed with controller in mind- The dialogue is atrociously bad and painful to listen to with some of the worst sounding accents I've heard in a game. To make matters worse you can't skip any dialogue. It's like getting punched in the face repeatedly and there is nothing you can do about it. -The puzzles are not very good and most of them are 'crate puzzles'- moving crates around to access new areas. On some occasions you have to use 'stealth' or risk being killed. These stealth sections are also poorly done given the camera angles and controls.The Good:+ The only bright spot I can think of is if you enjoyed the characters from the first game than you will enjoy seeing the same characters and revisiting familiar locations. Conclusion:I don't blame the developers for this. Point and Click Adventure games were all but dead in the early 2000's so trying to make them relevant and porting them to consoles only seemed like the logical choice given that is where the money was at. This game sadly did not make the transition so smoothly. As a standalone game I could recommend it, problem is 2 other games came out before it and did a much better job in every area.

												Just completed the game and actually wanted to vote a ""Neutral"" rating for the game, but unfortunately, there is no such choice. Went with ""Recommended"", but only if you are a fan of the series.I previously played part 1 and 2 of the series, and this game was, IMHO, the poorest of the 3.The game had lesser puzzles! I don't count box pushing as puzzles and there were really too many of them! They also added Quick Time Events (QTEs), some action sequences (usually running away or hiding) and sneaking around. Well, my preference would have that it been more puzzle-oriented.The 3D perspective would have been fine, but the camera angles made it terrible. The camera kept switching and the controls are relative to the angle at that point, and so making it difficult to move the character. For example, I might end up running towards the enemy rather than away. And certain sequences had time constraints, which made it frustrating when I can't move the character to the correct position, and had to keep repeating till I get it right. It is also irritating that I couldn't skip cutscenes when repeating these sequences. For these reasons, I prefer the 2D view in the first 2 games. The shift to 3D was refreshing (reminded me of Uncharted a couple of times), but implementation was really poor.Well, having said all these, I love George and Nico and won't hesistate to buy the next game (was also wondering why The Angel of Death is not on Steam?), though newcomers that start with this game first will probably think otherwise.Will probably get The Serpent's Curse (glad that it went back to the series' 2D roots) on the Playstation Vita once, or if, it releases in the Asian PS Store (probably the region with the worst store updates).

Broken Sword 3: The Sleeping Dragon			* 7/10Nico is being framed for Homicide of the Hacker she was about to interview, while George arrived too late in Congo where the scientist who called him is being killed by a mysterious man and his thugs in an archeological site. Once again this Broken Sword Chapter begins on a rush and with some news as well. This is Another Point & Click that decided the old 2d system was obsolete and had to be renovated and replaced with a new 3d interface. Good thing? Bad thing? Well it's true that the old 2d interface is a classic best suited for adventures, but this is not just a matter of following a trend. New mechanics have been introduced, so even if the third dimension wasn't necessary it suits fine this adventure as the items you can interact with are easily marked and reachable, the character can move fluently, and the camera system has been studied enough to prevent as much as possible those classic shot troubles. The inventory system is quite comfortable and well integrated in the game (unlike Grim Fandango's, just to make an example) and the actions pad seems like a good integration as well: there are 4 slots which hold 4 different kind of interactions. According to the item, the compatible actions will lit and will be usable with the corresponding key.The most important news still is the action side of the game: while in previous chapter you never needed to run now you can. And there are also stealth sections where running is mostly inadvisable as you'll be heard if you do it too close, so you'll need to quietly sneak behind guards and other things like these. And last, we have the infamous boxes... XD In this chapter we have many situations and riddles that will require you to pull or push many boxes (or rocks, or other things) in different positions at the purpose of granting you a passage or maybe blocking some mechanism, or maybe even solving more complicated puzzles.So it is safe to say that this chapter sees more action along with classic riddles and box riddles. As a confirm there are (few) Quick time events, not to mention the very end of the game which is a little action based (no spoilers, beside the gameplay), but there's nothing to worry about if you're not used to action games and prefer a quiet adventure, as every situation of this kind starts from a checkpoint, hence if you fail you can quickly restart from that point until you're able to pass through.I've had some minor issues with the game, as I run it on Windows 10: the game kept on playing windowed, and I had a hard time to save my video resolution and settings as well, but these are minor issues to me as anything worse ever happened to prevent me from enjoying the game.After all I enjoyed this chapter, the story was intricate but I liked it, The 3d interface was a change but has been handled well as it was quite easy to use, and about puzzles, as usual, some of them you have to try out of schemes. Anyways this is a good chapter, to me.+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. The 3d revolution was a news that brought some small action situations as well. Honestly I did enjoyed this because it gave a small excitment to the classic quiet atmosphere of the old adventures. Still I understand that purist might consider this blasphemy but I believe the developers thought about this too and that's why all of the most dangerous situations have an immediate loading checkpoint. INTERFACE. Even though I still prefer the classic 2d interface of point & click adventures, I still enjoyed this game as the situations and ambience required an action interface together with an intuitive inventory system and item spotting method which worked quite well here. DIALOGUES. An always important part of an adventure, in my opinion, and I appreciated the dialogues, the thoughts, the comments and the dynamics between characters.---CONs--- COMPATIBILITY BUGS. I know they have to be expected because of the age of the game and the requirements but honestly I don't care. Fortunately they're very small issues that can be dealt with, but still the game would be obviously better without them. WOLF, SHEEP AND CABBAGE. Yes, there's this riddle disguised with Egyptian mythology... I was speechless when I saw it and I silently solved it blindfolded... Now seriously, they could have thought something a little more creative considering the rest of the game. On top of that this riddle is in the final part of the game... ",497,128,12,20,23,4,28

												Six years after the second game we finally get another run in with good old' George and Nicole. This time in full 3D - a change from the classic 2D style we have all become so accustomed to. You may ask, does this change work for the series? Well... yes and no... I did feel a lot more connected with the characters than the previous games. For being made in 2003 they did a very fine job with the facial animations sparking new life to Georges witticism and Nicole's sarcasm. The jealous banter between the two of them continues just like the old games, but it feels more fleshed out this time. Nicole continues to improve with each game and is much funnier and involved now. You will constantly switch between them giving both equal screen time, and in some instances they will be working together to solve puzzles.  Where this game fails unfortunately is the gameplay. You will have tedious climbing sequences which will remind you of a bad version of Uncharted, weird sneaking like it's trying to imitate Splinter Cell and endless simple crate puzzles which adds nothing but frustrations. The game tries to be so many different things, but only works great when it's a point-and-click adventure. Still... despite the flaws, simple puzzles and ugly controls which will have you run into so many walls George will end up looking like the town drunkard - It's still a good game. The story is there, we have many interesting characters, the dialogue has its moments and the voice acting is above average.  A lot of classic point-and-click adventures failed the 3D-conversion in the early 20's, but this game has stood the test of time and is yet another fine entry in the Broken Sword franchise.

												If you like mystery games that involve a lot of puzzle work then you will love this one. I am a great fan of the whole Broken Sword sequel and I am looking forward to playing the next one shortly. Overall, the game has improved from the previous version by intergrating 3D animation. However, I thought the point and click concept that was present in the first two games was more user friendly. It's a good idea to buy it when it's on sale (also look for the collection package I recommend it).Pros:-Expect to put in a lot of hours because many puzzles are simple but long to solve (they are also fun though).-Expect to see interesting character developments.-I liked the references to the previous games.-The story line is once again amazing.Cons:-Very hard to control the character movements in the game (only done by keyboard).-Some puzzles are redundant and get annoying after a while.-Too many sudden camera angle changes.

I found them to be ok, at first its a bit tricky but after 5 mins it's not a problem (keyboard). I think you can even adjust the controls to suit your needs, so i do not know why these people are ♥♥♥♥♥ing.Some of the puzzles are hard XD but aye you can always use a walkthrough like the ""Oh those puzzles were so easy"" people.Personally I feel the previous two games are better but this is still worthy of having the broken sword title.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I paid less than 2,5 € for the whole trilogy. I feel like I robbed someone. The bad:1 - Controls - What were adventure game producers thinking, tranforming a point and click into a keyboard game. It was really a dumb move. This game have much more success if it wasn't for that lack of judgment. (as could Grim Fandango by the way)2 - The ""George moving a box"" puzzles. Very time consuming. Extremely boring. 3 - Some parts of the game require keyboard dexterity. What is this, an action game?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is a game that is so good, that knowing of its simple existence is enough to put a smile on your face. The Sleep Dragon is a shining example of how the genre has progressed and what it is capable of, it’s a stunning achievement adventure gaming. Inclusive of a solid story, likeable and engaging characters, stunning visuals, and delightful dialogue, this is one adventure you simply won’t be able to tear yourself away from.Graphically, the game is well done, with bright, cartoonish visuals. Cut-scenes are well voiced and complement the story, animation quality is superb. Incredible voice acting dominates this game, often surpassing the graphics and story by far. From Nico’s French accent to George’s “yankee lawyer” daftness, it’s a pleasure to listen to this game.Many of the puzzles are somewhat straightforward in design, and while ensuring player is less likely to hit those infuriating brick walls typically found in many of the genre's titles, your input into the events once again tends to feel slightly shallow and less rewarding than before as the majority of ‘box’ puzzles are repetitive, yet otherwise clever.The games controls however, feel somewhat broken, as to can make it almost impossible to play expect for the most dedicated of fans. The Sleeping Dragon is the only instalment in the series that is not point-and-click, in fact, it’s impossible to use the mouse for anything; instead all major actions in the game are done by keyboard or even game-pad as I preferred. The games manual brags about its “hybrid” system, but it’s practically unusable. The UI on the other-hand does steer away from the familiarity of the previous titles in the series, but once you look past the crude user interface, you will find an otherwise excellent and compelling game.

												A bit of an odd duck, this one. It comes from that time when everyone wanted their games to be 3D even if 3rd person adventure games weren't exactly sure how to do it correctly and the result is a game with a decent, if not fantastic story, but clunky controls and quick-time events that are not always intuitive. Still worth it for fans of the series or adventure games in general.			",285,124,4,44,27,4,28

												This is an OK point-and-click adventure game, which took me around 10 hours to beat. Parts of the story were good, and the addition of the crate puzzles and some QTEs did not bother me much, but the ending is so bad it makes you wonder what were they thinking - it almost feels like they rushed it and just went along with whatever they could come up with at the last minute.

												There were some major changes to the franchise on this game, particularly the controls. No mouse at all, everything is done on the keyboard. At first I really disliked the controls, but you can't deny there's a simplistic ease to them. There's no hint system, but because everything is so linear, there's not really much you need to figure out so you don't need hints. Like always, the plot and the characters are wonderful, the best part of Broken Sword games are always the interesting if not always coherent story lines. There are a ton of timing/movement puzzles and man, are you gonna get sick of moving boxes. They added some more comedic characters and these were a welcome addition.			",70,148,0,12,1,2,7

												+ Better characters, dialog and story compared to first 2 games.+ Character animations aint too bad for the time.- Bad controls and bad fixed camera angles- Stupid action bits.- Tedious box pushing puzzles that are more of a chore than anything else Broken Sword 3 isn't too bad. It's quite tedious to play at times though. Fixed camera angles coupled with the way controls work will trip you up at times. Say you are moving up with the up arrow key and the camera angle switches 180 degrees. If you had never let go of the up button you will continue moving up but if you let go and press down you will move down instead. Thinking more on it this is actually good system to have in place since if it wasn't there your character would never be able to walk a straight line with all the camera angle changes but it's still not a good enough control system to make the fixed camera angles excusable. Fixed camera angles and 3D games don't go togather well.And the tedious box pushing puzzles that aren't puzzles really they are just there to pad this game. Seriously, if there was no box pushing puzzles involved I would say it would take 2/3 less time to finish the game.That said I find the characters and dialog for this game to be much better compared to the first 2. It's the little things that are good. Like the characters having facial mimics while talking, it makes them feel more alive. Makes the delivery of the dialog better. It's up to you if you want to play it. If you cannot handle the oldschool awful controls, camera angles and tedious puzzle design I suggest you pass it. If you are slightly nostalgic about all this crap though, you'll sort of enjoy this for some reason.			",352,160,6,56,39,2,46

YouTube™ Video: Broken Sword The Sleeping Dragon Review 

			Views: 145		

			Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is an adventure game released on Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003, while in Japan, the PlayStation 2 version (released only in Europe and Japan) was released...		

Rocky Transition to 3DAs a fan of the original first two broken sword games, i was bit worried how well adventure game could turn into 3D Format for a company with a little experience on 3D World. My fears manifested in first 30 minutes of the game after i realized how clunky the controls in the game where for Keyboard and i couldn't get controllers work even though support existed.Each time you restart the game you have to set key's again which is a bothersome. It doesn't help the camera is rather awful and so are movements of the characters.Luckily the story itself isn't a ♥♥♥♥♥how, but it was exhausting experience to play the game only for the story, also the puzzles were bit repetitive but i guess somewhat challenging for people who don't do them much. Overall its a game you want to pick from sale or just watch whole game from YouTube or elsewhere.			",425,179,5,53,33,3,42

												Read the review for Broken Sword 1 at: https://cassus.org/muut/#!/adventure:review-broken-sword-shadRead the review for Broken Sword 2 at: https://cassus.org/muut/#!/adventure:review-broken-sword-2-thMan oh man! Let's talk about wasted potential shall we? Right off the bat I want to say that this game has the most interesting and gripping story. But that's the only thing I can praise this game for, if only they'd kept to the formula…Now, if you've watched the Godfather trilogy you know there is a noticeable progression line in terms of quality, the Broken Sword trilogy (excluding 4 & 5, obviously) follows the exact same progression, as in, the 1st is really good, the 2nd is an overall improvement over the 1st, and the 3rd is just a disappointment.Most of it's decisions are just backwards and poorly thought out, which is a shame, because the story is great, it could've been a wonderful movie.>SPOILERS FOR PREVIOUS GAMES AND 3rd'S INTRO<Broken Sword 3 starts with Geor ge Stobbart travelling to the Congo to meet a client, he's a patent lawyer now, and has broken up with Nicole for good, but during the flight, the plane crashes terribly because of a sudden storm, luckily for Stobbart, he crashed really close to the place he was supposed to land, but when he got there, he saw his client being questioned and threatened by a mysterious man and his goons, ultimately being murdered by them… After deeper investigation, he heard the scientist's last words, which warned that there might be a deeper conspiracy involving the end of the world and the name of a man, Susarro.Meanwhile, in Paris, Nicole was supposed to meet a hacker and coder that could've unveiled a conspiracy involving a armageddon and possibly the end of the world (it appears destiny really wants Nicole and George to stay together) but when she got to the man's house, she found him murdered, and after an encounter with the assassin and some deeper investigation, Nicole found out that she could've been framed to seem like she was the killer, soon after she got arrested.The story is really mysterious and interesting, it also goes much deeper into the lore and what happened to the Neo-Templars, and the ‘magic’ of the world they wanted to control.The story is great and truly worthwhile, but for all I care, it could've been the Sopranos, but the gameplay still is what's at fault with this game, and part of the reason why I wouldn't recommend it as a game.If you hadn't noticed, the series goes from a 2D point-and-click adventure to a 3D adventure, and with that brings the reason the gameplay is terrible, you see, most of the puzzles are now reduced to box sliding and climbing. The old intelligent and imaginative puzzles from previous games are reduced to just that, sliding damned boxes and climbing on them. But that's for the better, with such a backwards interface and controls, I wouldn't want to ever open my inventory, the new ‘wheel’ system works against itself, especially when you have to cycle through hundreds of items.The puzzles are also terribly easy and simple, you can't really do much challenging stuff with just boxes and climbing, you know?But wait, there's more! The camera and the movement are horrible, tank controls are better, you're never sure if the up arrow will move you up or some other randomized location, and when the camera changes, the controls also change, making you figure out where the arrows will make you go all over again.Want more? Alright, the dialogue system will make you want to suicide, you can't skip dialogue. That's right, you have to hear what all the characters have to say without skipping, also your character's remarks will get boring really fast, since you know, you can't skip them, so if you missclick on an item you've already inspected, you'll have to hear it all over again. Most of the game will be spent on hearing dialogue.Moving on, the graphics are okay, they aren't ugly in any way, especially for 2003, but the animations and voice acting will be awkward at times, even cringy, but you can through it just fine, but now, there is something that is bugging me to no end… WHY THE BLOODY ♥♥♥♥ ARE NICOLE'S EYES AND HAIR BLUE??? She's always had dark hair and brown eyes, I mean, I love dyed hair, but I'm confused because of the sudden design decision, she's got daddy issues now or something? (She does, but that's not the point)The music is OK, but nothing really worth mentioning, it feels kind of recycled from previous games though.Overall, the game is great in the story and graphical departments, but I found the gameplay unbearable, I do recommend watching this game somewhere, but playing through it is hard, you've really got to love the series to enjoy this one entirely.

												It had been years since I last played this game but amazingly I could still remember how incredibly annoying it is to continually shove boxes around. Even so it is probably my favourite of the BS games - witty sparkling dialogue, excellent characterisations, brilliantly ludicrous script. And a genuinely thrilling ending. What is not to like?Ok the clunky controls leave a lot to be desired but you soon get used to them.The Broken Sword series remains an absolutely unmissable classic. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game only to the broken sword fans. The game is probably the worst in the series. First negative thing is graphics. If it would have stayed 2d as the previous games, it would look good even these days, i played BS1&2 recently and the graphics were really nice. But this looks like crap because of outdated 3d graphics.Secondly. Controls. I didn't manage to get my xbox controller to work properly and played with a keybord, ooooh what a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but good game worth the sacrifice.Third thing would be puzzles. They're not so interesting as in previous games. Too many box moving puzzles. And action sequences really doesn't fit in to the game imo.Story is good, it still feels like broken sword.

												It's doubtful if you are reading this or looking at this game you loved the first two games and why wouldn't you as they were simply excellent but this is almost Broken Sword but it has a few minuses in comparison to the other games.Strangely it's a much younger game than the first two and yet it's graphics look more dated and it's controls are harder to use and lack the fluid of movment , the inferior graphics I could live with but the controls made me say very rude words indeed...Get it if you want to play the 4th game and if your a fan of the Broken Sword games but don't expect it to be as good.It isn't bad it's just a good game when the others were exceptional games.

Too bad there's no HD or remastered version.There is one annoying thing about this game. It's not point 'n' click. It uses WASD keyboard input and movement is often quite goofy and difficult.That being said, I recommend the game to the everyone who enjoys adventure genre.

												This game is worth playing for a few bucks if you can get it on sale.  It's old, and while I was surprised that there was no mouse control, the controls were fairly intuitive.  It is one of those adventure games which, instead of point and click, attempts to add an element of real-time play.  This mostly works against the game as it can sometimes pose annoyances that force you to replay a scene multiple times until you execute the moves just right.  It also gets obsessed with tedious but not difficult pushing box puzzles similar to Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver.  They mostly don't add any satisfaction to the game.  There are also many stealth scenes that are hampered by camera angles that block your view of surroundings.  Beyond that there are a lot of standard adventure game elements.  I'm fond of the conspiracy themed games, however this series tends to follow a less sophisticated plot similar to an episode of Scooby Doo.  It serves its purpose and I wasn't entirely put off by it.  The character of Nico is well done and complete with sexy French accent and sexy everything else.  George is portrayed as a bit of a typical jock, but also well voice acted.  The age of the game also means a 4:3 aspect ratio, which can be streched to fit modern resolutions if you don't mind the characters looking fat.  In summary, worth playing but probably not going to be very memorable.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So. Many. Box. Puzzles.Most of the reviews complain about the controls.  Yes, they could be better.  In particular, the ""click to move to a location"" scheme from the previous titles is better.  But the controls aren't too bad for this style of game, and you quickly get used to them.Overall, not a bad addition to the Broken Sword line of games.  Decent voice acting, and the puzzles are (for the most part) well done.  Except for the box puzzles.Ever hear ""When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.""?  Well, the devs built a really nice hammer -- the ability to slide boxes around on the floor.  And they use it.  Contantly.  It seems like every third puzzle amounts to ""How do I move that box to that spot on the floor?"".  It's badly overused.			",55,19,1,1,5,0,8

												For an adventure game that uses 3-D graphics, Broken Sword 3 acquits itself rather well. Though controls are still not exactly optimal, it's still way better than, say, Grim Fandango. Graphics are decent for a 10-year-old game, but what makes the game are the voice-acting, the snappy dialogue and the well-drawn characters. Sure, there are cliches aplenty, and the ending is a tad short and slightly unsatisfying, but the game is worth playing through. That is, if you don't get tired of the umpteenth crate puzzle! That's a pretty cheap way of extending playtime. Still, this is a step-up from the 2nd Broken Sword, which was a disappointment. Definitely worth playing if you're an adventure gaming fan. 7/10.

												All broken Sword games are a treat, and this one is as memorable and enjoyable as the others. Some people whine about keyboard controls and 3D graphics, but it's just whines. As usual, everything is very well thought through, and after a short learning curve you forget about the interface and immerse yourself in the adventure, which is probably the most cinematic of all, and goes completely over the top in the end. Lots of humour, memorable characters, beautiful locations. Highly recommended to any adventure fan.			",197,132,5,19,11,2,15

												So different, no longer point and click. Well, I guess that's what the whole ""do everything in 3D"" era did to all games. Funny thing that era has passed and 2D things are starting to return. But returning to this game... It's still really amazing. Changing it to 3D and basing the controlls fully on the kayboard emphasises different types of puzzles now. There's plenty of sneaking around on walls and ledges included as well as crate pushing. It's not necessarily better or worse, it's just different. But the story is still amazing! So worth playing. ^_^			",754,315,16,92,65,9,123

												A classic adventure game. Point and click and a bit of arcade fun - what could go wrong?If you were interested in mythology being incorporated into stories, games and movies - this game will be your adventure game. From Excalibur and the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to the new-wave ideals of an immense power source that has been kept in secrecy for centuries. Templars, the Church, Russian hitmen and a reverence to the amazing Czech architecture are just some Broken Sword 3's motifs I personally found very enjoyable. On top of this: All Harry Potter fans will find a lot in common between this story and their favourite books and/or movies. You have to play it to believe it, ",20,69,0,1,1,0,1

I haven't played the old ones so I can compare them and that means that I can't say if this one ""wasn't as the old ones"" or ""it's not the same anymore"" or whatever. I played this as first and I loved it. I played it again now on PC (not completed though) and I didn't have any issues. :)			",36,8,0,2,1,0,2

												As always great game, great story. Loved the crossovers with Broken Sword 1 story! The new 3D gameplay style makes the game a bit more interesting than BS 1 and 2. Although this game has no ""Hints"" section, with the way it is designed you don't really need them. Favourite puzzle, the Anubis - Horus!!!11/10			",50,5,3,1,1,0,11

												This game has mixed reviews but I think any true Broken Sword fan will enjoy it. Once you look past the change to 3D, you'll realize it's very similar to the previous Broken Sword games. Everything that made those games great is still there, and the 3D perspective is actually pretty nice in terms of visuals and gameplay. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the controls, but they really aren't that bad. Seriously, just disregard whatever is stopping you from getting this game and try it out. As with all Broken Sword games, this is definitely worth playing.			",71,53,1,7,6,1,6

												The controls on this game stink. I actually had a hard time figuring it out at first and finally after an hour was able to play the whole game. You couldn't use your mouse at all,  It was Page up, Page down, wasd, shift, ctrl, enter, and arrow keys. . .very annoying because the first two games had a much simpler to follow control system. As for the storyline, it was more fantasy based rather than something more believable.  It was certainly an extension to the first two games and lets us know more about the templars.  I hated that you couldn't skip conversations like you could in the first game, so they made you sit through the dialogue and the cut scenes over and over again until you succeeded in whatever actiosn or missions were needed.  This game involved far too much box moving.  Almost every chapter I felt like George was pushing and pulling boxes or crates.  George wasn't as much of an idiot as he was in the first two. Nico was the same (no complaints).  Hope the 4th one has better gameplay!			",31,36,0,3,4,0,1

												I really want to like this game, but it simply doesn't want me to. It keeps crashing on the plot sequences forcing me to have to redo whole sections.Also there is no mouse control, only keyboard, a really terrible idea, I guess they wanted the keyboard to be used for the new platforming/box moving puzzles, which imo don't fit this game at all, the series is all about characters, conversations and infering what items to use where, not moving boxes to get into a window.....I really can't recommend the game just based on the crashes, let alone the problems with controls and bad puzzles. I'm very happy to see the recent installment has gone back to point and click, and shunned this obvious fault of only keyboard control. Even if you're a big fan of the original games, I don't see too much point in playing this unless you desperately want the complete collection.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is not a point&click!Instead of mouse-control, there is only keyboard or controller, and both suck.Control and camera are even worse than Monkey Island 4...Neither dialog nor cut-scenes are skippable, which is especially ""funny"" in scenes in which you can die...Did i mention that you also can't save during those dangerous scenes?Except for one of the main characters, every voice-actor uses accents that are so horrible that after about two hours, you just want to punch them to make them stop.I wasted 11 hours of my life and i damaged my keyboard out of sheer anger after dying 17 (!) times on the same scene: 2 minutes of unskippable cutscene/dialog, 1/2 second where camera and controls screw you, 30 second unskippable death-sequence, rinse and repeat...If you want good point&clicks, play one of the Wajet-Eye- or Telltale-games♥♥♥♥ this game			",153,235,2,64,8,3,49

												I will give a negative review with a caveat.This game is not as good as the other games in the series. The controls are not very smooth, and some wanna-be designer though that moving crates around was so much fun they should be added everywhere throughout the game. The puzzles are there but not as interesting as the earlier games.Here is the caveat: If you have enjoyed Broken Sword 1 & 2, get this one just to get more George & Nico. I mean you already know you're going to buy the series, why waste your time with reviews?			",130,218,0,17,36,0,13

												Broken Sword 3 comes from an era when all adventure games felt the need to go 3D with mandatory action sequences and suffers for it, sadly. There are points at which the puzzles are are a little weak, or the conversations a little stilted... But this remains a Broken Sword game. This should be nobody's first Broken Sword game, but if you have passed through the first two games, this is a reasonable next step. However, do be wary of the three million and seven crate-pushing puzzles that this game includes. They will get tedious after the very first.			",618,250,12,89,58,5,107

												I played the first 2 games and loved them, I know how good and humorous the story can be and even thought I still have to finish this one, it looks like it got both characteristics. So why am I disliking it so much?This game is PAINFUL: I don't even care about playing it anymore, I just want the story, it could be all dialogues from now on and I'd be happier.Awful keyboard controls, can't stand moving with directional arrow keys: I keep confusing them with WASD but those are for selecting actions.Dreadful camera angle changes: i'm tryina run, not getting shot, solving puzzles etc etc WHY DO YOU KEEP BOTHERING ME!?!WHY AM I CONSTANTLY MOVING BOXES? DIDN'T THEY THINK HAVING TO QUICKLY PRESS A RANDOM KEY (you never really know where the action icon is gonna appear in that 1 second window they give you to select it so you can fail and watch the cutscene other 5 times because you can't skip it and you'll eventuallly fail at running) PLENTY OF TIMES WASN'T *screams* ENOUGH?Buy it if you played the first two games and plan to get the 4th and 5th as I did.Don't buy it out of curiosity.

												Series ruined by the move from 2d to 3d. Stupid fixed camera angles ruin gameplay, making some scenes nearly impossible due to controls geting reversed, flipped and inverted several times in less than 10 seconds. Certainly very very hard to control on keyboard, might be possible on games controller, but if I wanted to use a controller, I wouldn't be using a pc!There is no way of skipping cutscenes, and when you die over 20 times at the same place due to the aformentioned problems, you really don't need to see the same cutscene over and over!First time in over 30 years of gaming I have ever had to rage quit. This has frustrated me so much that it has brought me to the point that I am even uninstalling the game, never to return to it.			",11,27,1,6,10,1,2

												I enjoyed this game's first half but it is let down by a weak, weird and trashy second half. It features all the same characters but this time instead of relying on you solving puzzles, you're relyed on to push boxes back and forth and sometimes pull a lever. The graphics are nice, and the script is still strong. It made me laugh a few times, it's not often that games succeed in that more than once so it deserves some credit. I was still, though, bitterly disappointed, but happy to report Broken Sword 3 is not entirely a lost cause, however it is also not entirely worthy of a great amount of comment or discussion.

												Another amazing game from Revolution Software. From Templars, to Evil Gods and now fairy tales and myth and yet it all works together so well. The unnecessarily long puzzles seem to have bred to cover a lot more of the game but are genuinely a challenge most of the time and despite some apparent predjudice against Australians, it is definitely worth and adventure gamers time as they have moved out of the typical point-and-click style. Can't say I enjoyed the camera control much though.			",199,53,0,29,22,3,16

												Broken Sword 3Pros:- I enjoy the Broken Sword stories and characters;- Certain of the puzzles are satisfying to complete;Cons- The controls are atrocious;- The conversion to 3D was not kind. Too much of the game is spent moving the characters around awkwardly, while the samera switches and f***s up your direction continuously;- There are far too many doors that are locked;- Too many box puzzles;- Even though I enjoyed the story, it wasn't as satisfying as (and kind of a departure from) the original broken sword. Without giving spoilers, it is too overtly supernatural;Score - 5/10Play it for the story or watch a let's play.			",123,80,1,16,11,2,23

												2/10 : This is an attroccious game. I love the retro 3d look actually.. I am not going to complain about that, and the puzzle I completed.. yes.. just one.. was fair enough... the style and art, for what they attempt.. which seems to be the evolution of George Stobbart.. who seems to be a 30 something Lawyer.... in to a mystery solving adventurer.. well that's actually pretty cool... for at some point in the first two games one wonders when old Georgie is going to trade in the slacks, loafers and sports coat, or bad tourist wear, for something more appropriate, and stop calling himself a lawyer, when clearly he's found a penchant for being a professional investigator of some kind.. well amateur, but full time... the main issue.. a serious, seriously screwed up one.. is the UI. Yes. This game has THE SINGULARLY WORST controls of ANY PC GAME EVER. The UI is attrocious. Infuriating. Ill conceived. Dare I say it... CRIMINAL.  If you're getting this game for a Console, AYE.. it MIGHT.. just MIGHT work well... though I hear the UI doesnt recognise newer Microsoft controllers.. but yes.. perhaps you people can disregard, somewhat, this review... but if you're getting this for PC...????   JUST DONT! EVER.			",2,5,0,1,0,0,0

												Nope, this game is absolute garbage! Very sad for a company that made one of the best point and click adventure games with Broken Sword 1. Some obvious reasons are the terrible camera angles and controls for the game. That could drive someone bananas just with that. The game also does not allow for the skipping of cutscenes, which must be repeated on dying over and over and over again. The crates are just stupid and the game no longer has the intriguing point and click puzzles of the first two games, all of the puzzles seem way to simple/linear. This game reminds me alot of King's Quest 8. Both are terrible games and leave a bad taste in my mouth of two amazing companies, so I try to block them out. The story could potentially have been decent, but I gave up two hours in and I'm never going back. Buy the first for sure, but maybe not the director's cut. And the second if you are a super big fan (Check out my other reviews of these games for more information). Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and the game might be great (it might just be a Sleeping Dragon for all I know!), but I figured I would be a voice of warning, play at your own risk!Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!
